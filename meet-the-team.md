# Meet your Local Dallas Mortgage Lender Team

--->    ![Team picture of local mortgage lenders in Dallas](/img/team.jpg){: .team-pic}

##### Senior Loan Officer – Wade Betz “The Chief”

Wade spent the first 14 years of his mortgage career at Guardian Mortgage as a vice president of sales and branch manager at their
Dallas, Texas location. Since then, he has transitioned to a Senior Loan Officer role with NEXA Mortgage, LLC. Having helped
thousands of families with more than $500M+ in residential financing, Wade Betz is a leading mortgage originator in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area and loves helping families build wealth and memories with real estate.

Wade has a message for his customers: There’s more to a mortgage than just the close. A job well done is a job that lasts the duration
of the home loan. Counsel, support and personal service are paramount to becoming a trusted mortgage advisor for his clients.

“Too many loan officers and lenders in our industry just focus on selling the borrower a mortgage loan without listening to the
borrower’s desires or asking the right mortgage planning questions,” he says. “It is our responsibility to create mortgage solutions
that complement our clients’ overall financial strategies and allow them to most effectively accomplish their short and long-term
financial goals.”

Born and raised in New Orleans, Wade came to Dallas in 1997 and attended Southern Methodist University (Pony Up!), where he
earned a bachelor’s degree in economics. Wade enjoys spending time with his wife and two growing boys. He is also an avid
Louisiana State University football fan. GEAUX Tigers!!!
