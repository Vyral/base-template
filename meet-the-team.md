<h1>Meet the Team</h1>


<h4>Rob Spring</h4>
**Branch Manager, Loan Originator**
<p>Rob has been in Mortgage and Real Estate for 15 years. He’s seen the ups and downs and excelled in thriving and retracting markets. He’s worked for the big bank, the Mom and Pop, ran branches and teams – but found his forever home in early 2014 with AmeriFirst. Rob is the Mortgage Guy other mortgage people call when they need the right answer.</p>


<h4>Jennifer Spring</h4>
**Licensed Loan Officer and Team Loan Coordinator**
<p>Jennifer is “The Communication Queen” – her job is to make sure the buyers, agents, builders and sales reps know exactly where we stand, what the next steps are and how long those steps will take. She keeps everyone on point and in the know, we couldn’t do what we do without her.</p>


<h4>Natalie Worley</h4>
**Operations**
<p>Natalie has been in mortgage operations since the 2000’s. She’s held numerous positions but always wears the hat of a leader. Her knowledge is second to none and her care and love for her part on the team is very apparent.</p>
