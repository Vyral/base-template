  - quote: Melissa was very professional and responded to any inquiries with a quickness. Our house only needed to be on the market for 7 days before receiving 2 competing offers that increased the selling price of our home. At the same time, she sent us listings that matched our criteria and showed us homes in a timely manner that enabled us to find, purchase, and move in to the new home on the same day we closed on our home! Everything happened so quickly, but it was a smooth and painless process thanks to Melissa's expertise.

  - quote: My husband and I were house hunting and were having trouble finding exactly what we wanted. Then, we came upon a neighborhood where Melissa had three new homes available. We immediately set up and appointment with her and discussed our needs; we felt so confident with the quality of the homes and Melissa's professional input that we were quickly ready to work with her to start the construction of our own home in our Arlington neighborhood. Melissa was a great agent for the next six months; she even helped us time the completion of the home to coordinate with the end of the lease on our apartment. At closing, she helped us feel at ease. And, after closing she even sent a housewarming gift that we truly enjoyed. Melissa's attitude and consideration to our needs and wants made buying our first home a great experience.
