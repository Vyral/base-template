      Kari Kohler happens to be not only my, well to begin with an agent that I
      met, but today she is not only our agent still for investment needs but my
      very, very, very dear sweet awesome friend that I love very much. She
      means a lot to me. I've done multiple dealings with her—multiple. I mean
      she's helped me with my investment property needs for the past 6 or 7
      years now and I actually live right next to her now! She’s very dear to
      me. She's extremely professional, extremely, extremely, extremely good in
      her real estate business that she runs like a champ. I would recommend her
      over and over again. And I have in the past, to everyone and anyone even
      if they don't have the need. I’ll say hey, are you looking for an awesome
      real estate agent because I know the best of the best of the best. I feel
      that when you go with Kari and her group you go with the best. They
      literally babysit you through the entire process. When you don't go with
      them you realize what you're missing because I've done that. Kari knows
      I’ll pick up investment properties, and if I'm dealing with someone else I
      feel so frustrated because it's like you have to do things on your own,
      and I think Kari's team literally spoils you because they babysit you
      through the process so much and take all the worry out of everything. They
      answer silly little questions for you in such a norm way as if you're
      asking the most important question in the world. But to make it short Kari
      is a dear friend of mine, and an agent still of mine, and my neighbor. My
      husband and I have high regards of respect for her, and her husband Neil
      Kohler, and her team, and I would recommend her 1000 times and over again.

      We met her so long ago; we were looking for a townhouse I believe back in 2007 or 2008. She helped us buy a house at that time, our first townhouse. She's just wonderful, I don't know if you've met Kari, but she's just such a fantastic person. She's super sweet and she's always willing to go above and beyond for us and get us all the information we needed. Once we met with her, we knew that she was very familiar with the area, and she could guide us in the right direction. At that point in our lives, it was just the two of us; we didn't have any kids. Fast forward down the road a few years, we needed a bigger place. She helped us set up the old place as a rental, and then we rented another townhouse, and she actually helped us with that, too. A few years after that, she helped us find a place. We ended up building in a newer subdivision. She was really knowledgeable and helpful when it came to school districts. Neither of us are from the area: I'm from Indiana; my husband is from Missouri. So, we knew nothing of Illinois and the area we were in. Talking with Kari, we found out that we might want to switch it up a little bit when our daughter was getting ready to get into kindergarten, because we were in a different school district at the time, and we had our eyes set on a different one. So she helped us find a house in that school district and in a really fantastic neighborhood. She met with us many, many times. I would say we looked for a good year before we finally settled on building. We just couldn't find what we were looking for in the area, but she kept up with us, and she was super patient. She showed us many places and gave us some great things to consider. She's always just been really personable and wonderful to work with. I still keep in touch with her; she's fantastic! We've actually referred a few people that she's worked with to buy and sell their home. She's just great. I don't really say a whole lot; I just say, "Here's Kari, she's fantastic. Use her and you won't be disappointed." If they're looking for someone and in the market for a new realtor, they usually take our advice and they give her a call. Nobody's been disappointed yet. I'm very confident in referring her to our friends. As you know, when you refer someone, your name is on the line too. I know that Kari is hands down one of the best in the area, so I don't worry about it. I refer her all the time.
