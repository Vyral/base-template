Each time, they have been very courteous and professional while always going above and beyond. When I was selling my last house, he came out and did a thorough survey of the surrounding properties, made some great suggestions, and did really well to make sure I got top dollar for my home."'

  - quote: "\"First off working with Patty was one of the best experiences especially as a first time home buyer. I had interviewed with another realtor and immediately i knew it wasn't going to be a good fit. Patty became an instant friend and to this day is still a friend. Honestly everything she did went above and beyond and it was the little things you wouldn't pay attention to. She was just so helpful and put me at ease. We hit a very stressful point in the home buying situation when it came to my loan. I called her in complete panic and she was able to calm me down and she actually rectified the situation without me even knowing it. So when it got to the point I give up this is not going to happen she's like oh no this is happening. She made it work and I'll forever be grateful to her for that.\""
