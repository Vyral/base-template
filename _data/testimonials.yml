      “Well we had an excellent experience. Kurt was sending me house listings
      about every week I would say. We were in Washington, our children live in
      Austin and we are moving to Austin next year. And we wanted to actually
      buy in with our kids. And one of the houses he sent me, I told him we’re
      looking for something with a mother-in-law, father-in-law type apartment,
      and he would try to always send me something along that line. And we found
      this one house, I talked to my kids and said let’s go look at it. I called
      Kurt, and we were on a very short time frame because we were coming home
      from there in like three days. He quickly set up a viewing of the house so
      we could go in and see and we quickly made a decision that we were
      interested in putting in an offer and he jumped through a lot of hoops in
      a very short time to get us going on purchasing that home. And by the time
      we left and came back to Washington it was well under progress so that we
      could do the rest of it remotely."

      “He achieved selling our house in a timely and fashionable manner. Kurt
      always goes above and beyond for us. He works very hard at getting our
      house on the market and getting the best selling price that he can
      possibly for us. He’s just very professional and very courteous.”

      “We sold a house, it was amazing, because it took only two days to get it
      done. His suggestions about what to fix and what to leave to the next
      owners was very accurate. It was amazing, the whole process. He actually
      helped me find a handyman to fix little details that the buyers wanted us
      to fix. He basically took care of everything. I just showed up and signed
      and hired a handyman. It was super-fast and easy.”

      “I was looking one night on the internet, at Zillow, and liked several of
      the houses and my wife, recently we discovered that she is not going to be
      able to do everything that she’s done before in her life. She’s had
      several brain surgeries and is now handicapped because of that. I put in
      all of the information that we were looking for, and I mean very specific
      in some areas. I entered it into the system and received a phone call back
      from Kurt either the next day or a few days later. We worked together from
      August 2016 to current. He put me in touch with someone who could sell our
      home in San Antonio and I wasn’t real happy with the conversations we had.
      So Kurt said, well you know what, have you ever considered doing an online
      sale, like an auction? I said, no I hadn’t. And he said well I can do that
      for you if you’re interested. I said absolutely. He even worked with my
      family in the process because I had family as renters, helping them to
      find another place."

      “My wife met Kurt at an open house and she decided that he should be our
      Realtor then. We were looking to move, we didn’t know exactly where. So we
      worked with Kurt, first to get our home ready to sell and then eventually
      to find our new house, which was a new build. During the sale of our home,
      our existing home, we actually had a fair amount of difficulty with that
      process and Kurt was always very clear in his communication and kind of
      advising us on what we should do next. Even though we kind of came up
      against some road blocks and actually were under two different contracts.
      So that was something Mandy and I really appreciated. Kurt is extremely
      good at listening and understanding his clients’ needs. And also very
      clear regarding the options that they’ll have for buying and selling a
      home and how their needs kind of fit with the different options.”

      “Kurt actually was referred to us by a friend that worked for one of his
      previous companies so it was a happy accident that we met him in the first
      place and have since become pretty good friends with him. We’ve refereed
      him to quite a few people. The sale of our first house was brutal for
      everybody involved. The market was down at the time. Kurt stuck with us
      through five offers that fell through including two the week of closing.
      Through that it really was a huge ordeal for all of us and it was a
      no-brainer to go to him when it was time to buy again and sell again.
      Whatever you’re going to go through this guy’s going to do everything that
      he can to help you out and be there for you. And like I said, he’s become
      more than just a Realtor, he’s become a good friend.”

      He was a really great real estate agent. We actually just stumbled upon
      him randomly when we were looking through open houses. He happened to be
      at one of the open houses we were at. He's very knowledgeable, very
      courteous, and overall to me very genuine. Among this he was also very
      prompt with his responses online and through text and in person. And I
      don't know if I said it earlier, but he's very caring as well.  He has a
      lot experience which gave us a lot more confidence in our real estate
      search and once we finally got a new home. I would definitely refer him to
      pretty much anyone looking to buy a house or maybe buy a resale home or
      maybe even sell house because I know he has experience with that. I know
      that he is honest so much that if he doesn't know you know he won't make
      up something in the meantime for an answer. He'll say he doesn't know or
      he'll find out or refer you to someone who will know. And among all of
      that he also has a lot of resources even after you buy a home. So I would
      definitely would refer Kurt pretty much for anything real estate related.
