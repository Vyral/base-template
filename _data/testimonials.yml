  - quote: When we found the home we wanted, we told our Realtor at Jeff Cook Real Estate and told her what we were looking for. She worked very hard to get us into the house quickly and really made sure things were moving along. She even made calls to the utility company and home inspectors that, to me, was above and beyond!
