testimonial:
  - quote: "I’m probably the most picky customer service person there is and what I require from people, I seldom get. That being said, I was completely wowed by the Limbird Team. My first experience was when I called on a listing and somebody got back to me within minutes. I was just blown away. They weren’t just fabulous in the beginning to gain my business either, I could probably text her right now and get a response. They stayed in constant communication with me and just provided great service. "
    name: Laura
  - quote:  "We got good results from the Limbird Team. At one point there was a leak in our bathroom ceiling and we were getting ready to head out of town so we couldn’t really handle it. We hadn’t been in the house for 7 years so we didn’t even know where the attic entrance was to get up there. Our Realtors basically handled the whole thing for us which was a complete relief!"
    name: Tara
  - quote: "The results we had were very positive, in fact the house was sold 5 hours after it hit the internet! We had people from West Texas come over for a showing. We showed them the house and they wanted to make an offer so I called Michelle, who was watching the game, and she actually left and came over on a Saturday afternoon to work on it. They were all very good and everything was excellent. It was a smooth process!"
    name: Ronnie
  - quote: "My husband and I were quite nervous about purchasing our first home as we had heard numerous horror stories from many of our friends about how much of a hassle buying a house can be. RE/MAX proved all of those stories to be false! Our realtor, Mandy Curren, was absolutely amazing! We looked at our house at 6 pm, placed an offer by 8 pm, and had it accepted by 1 pm the next day! My closing lasted 30 minutes and voila! We became home owners! I will never use anyone else. Mandy delivered 100% flawless execution!"

  - quote: "I've had the pleasure of working with Tara and her team on several real estate transactions including buying, selling, and leasing rental properties. I have lived in seven different states and worked with many real estate agents and I can say that Tara is without question the very best among them. Any time I do anything with real estate, I call Tara and the Limbird Team and I am very happy to recommend her for your real estate needs."
