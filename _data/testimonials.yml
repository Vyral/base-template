It as a quick transaction, he was professional, and he always followed up. Every step of the process, he’d send me a video saying here’s where we’re at in the process and here’s what’s going to happen. For me, that was above and beyond, I’ve never heard of an agent doing that and taking that kind of time."'

    name: Bruce

    name: Michael
    audio:
  - quote: '"They were great. Before we switched to them, the house was on the market for six and a half months. There were some offers, but they all fell through. Josh just had techniques and outlets that our previous Realtor did not have. We sold the house in seven weeks with Josh. They got back to me, and his whole team just did such a good job. I would recommend him to anybody."'

  - quote: '"My son had died unexpectedly, leaving a property in Salt Lake City. I’m in Virginia, but we found Josh after going through my son’s paperwork. Josh had sold him the home in Salt Lake back in 2006. We went to Salt Lake City, and Josh gave us a very straightforward presentation. Josh first gave us different ways for us to sell the house to my friend’s kids, and when that didn’t work out, he put the house on the market. I went back to Virginia, and Josh worked with some of my friends in Salt Lake City to sell the house. He kept me updated throughout, and the whole process was so easy, even though it was long distance!"'
    name: Una
    audio:
  - quote: '"We got great results! The house sold, and it was fast. He was very professional. Our initial meeting with him was fantastic. He prepared an analysis of different homes that have been sold in our area. I’ve never seen that from another Realtor before, and I thought that was really above and beyond!"'
    name: Jill
    audio:
  - quote: '"They have friendly customer service, and an extremely quick response time. He was very professional. The first time we worked with him, we just randomly called Keller Williams because we needed an agent. We needed to fly in 24 hours later, buy a house in 24 hours, and fly back. He was very accommodating. He really got us acclimated to Salt Lake City, so he was more than just somebody who showed us through houses!"'
    name: Kimberly
    audio:
  - quote: '"I’ve been very pleased. Initially, we went with another real estate firm. We had twelve showings in seven months with them. My wife did some research, and Josh came in. He’s on the ball. He’s sharp. He has a plan, and the passion and energy to execute that plan. He sold the house in three weeks. Any time I brought up some kind of issue, it always impressed me that he had a plan. He just goes right into problem-solving mode."'
    name: Gary
