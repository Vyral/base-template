  - quote: “We sold our house in 3 or 4 days, so it worked out pretty well. We’ve worked with him before and [he’s] very knowledgeable and keeps us up to date so we’re happy with the way things worked out. We bought a house after it was on the market for just a couple days and then we sold ours after it was on the market for 3 or 4 days.”

  - quote: “Overall we were very happy with Steve’s services. What really impressed us was his knowledge and experiences about houses and buildings in Portland. As we worked with Steve, he gave us tidbits and tips that we didn’t consider because we weren’t thinking in the mindset of parent’s at the time. He was also very patient with us, whenever we needed to go physically see the house because we called him last minute, he would fit us into his schedule and drop what he was doing to show it to us, whether it was during the weekday or the weekend. I highly recommend him for sure.”

  - quote: “I was satisfied with the results, he found the house that I was looking for and I was pleased with how the home-buying process went. When we found the house that I was interested in to put an offer on it, it was late in the evening. He stayed in order to get the offer over to the agent and I think it was close to 9:30 at night. Once I found something that I was interested in, he made sure that I got the house.”
