  - quote: I was referred to The Wolek Group by my goddaughter’s friend who had done a few transactions with them in the past. I am so grateful for the recommendation! The Wolek Group was very responsive, proactive, and it was a good experience all the way around! I really liked that they helped me stage my home too. We had 4 showings, 2 offers, and we were able to sell it for more than we were asking! I deal with real estate agents all the time because I’m a mortgage lender and out of all my experiences, I really like how The Wolek Group does business. They are very professional! They were able to sell my home quickly because of all their marketing efforts and I truly think that is very important. They use a team approach that I really like because if you can’t reach a certain person, you can always reach someone else in the group. That makes them always available to their clients! The Wolek Group was the first team I’ve worked with and I would definitely do it again!

  - quote: We had really great results with the Wolek Group and they were incredibly helpful. We were in Texas and our Realtor would go look at houses we’d ask her about and send us pictures so we could get a better idea of the home. When we did meet up with here, it was a smaller list that we already weeded out. She bent over backwards to do stuff for us and I couldn’t thank her enough!

  - quote: There was a little confusion with our buyer and where he was from with him being in California, not Tulsa but The Wolek group was very diligent about getting all the paperwork back and forth and we got the house sold.

  - quote: My house sold in less than 2 months and Jennie Wolek was absolutely fabulous! They really got on it! We got it listed and all the papers signed and that day, if not that afternoon she came over and just started getting everything set up. They got the word out, all the fliers out, it was listed with all their Realtors, and got it all over the internet. They had a photographer come out and take pictures and got it up on The Wolek Group website, and the fliers in front of our house. It was great!

  - quote: I had been looking for 6 months and I couldn’t make up my mind. They actually convinced the other Realtor to let me back in for the 4th time so I could look at the property again. They did a great job and they even contributed to my favorite charity which I have never heard of! They just do an excellent job!

  - quote: They were really a wonderful team. We had 2 offers within 4 days of putting our house on the market! Everyone on their team was very professional and really used social media in order to reach a broad spectrum of the community. Any questions we had, they got right back to us and they were just helpful in every way. It was the best selling experience we’ve ever had!

  - quote: My house went on the market about mid-June and I had a 97% offer of my asking price within a couple of days. We were expected to close mid-August but the buyers were doing their underwriting through the VA and after about 3 weeks of yanking their chain and our chain, they denied them the house. The buyers still wanted my house so The Wolek Group actually got them connected to another underwriter and were able to ensure the house closed within 14 days. It was a very positive experience and we really appreciated them stepping up and getting that done for me.

  - quote: We sold our house in 13 days! It seemed like they stayed in touch with us constantly! They were great about answering questions quickly. If we had any problems with the house, they sent a repairman over quickly to get it taken care of. It was just a good experience, all the way around!
