      Jeremy is an outstanding individual with a the work mentality as good as
      anyone around. His knowledge and expertise help my wife and I find the
      home of our dreams. I would recommend Jeremy to anyone I know. There isn’t
      a realtor out there, that I would trust more with one of the most
      important decision in one’s life than him. He is a hardworking, honest,
      and kind person.

      We worked with Jeremy in 2011 to help us find our next home. He really
      listened to what we were looking for and would also get weekly listings of
      houses that fit exactly what we were looking for. He was so helpful with
      the whole process and was always quick to answer any questions that came
      up along the way. We would strongly recommend Jeremy to anybody looking to
      buy or sell a home. He is an honest realtor whose integrity is unmatched.

      Jeremy made finding our first home a memorable experience that we will
      never forget.  Jeremy put countless hours into finding homes that we could
      afford and that we would want to look at.  Never once did he offer to show
      us a home that was too far out of our budget that would put us in a bind
      if we were to purchase the home.  His hours were extremely flexible around
      our schedule even to the point he would be willing to cancel plans to show
      us a house.  Even signing papers and negotiations with the seller came
      without any hiccups.  My wife and I would use Jeremy as our realtor again,
      and would offer his card to any family and friends in need of a realtor.

      I would strongly recommend the realty services of Jeremy Qualley for any
      seller or buyer. Today we closed on our home after setting out previewing
      our very first property 11 months ago. The home search timespan was not
      dictated by Jeremy’s inability to find properties to our liking, but
      rather the ongoing search to find the right home for us, which was our
      goal and Jeremy’s all along. The patience shown by Jeremy and his actions
      of putting our best interests first while searching to find our home was
      truly one of the best customer service efforts I have encountered. Jeremy
      was more than willing on multiple occasions to work with our busy
      schedules and preview homes on nights, weekends, and lunches. He made the
      home buying experience enjoyable and effortless on our behalf. With weekly
      mailings of homes within our wanted criteria, we were able to locate our
      new home. Although, I am excited to work with Jeremy again in the future,
      I know it won’t be in the near future as he found us the perfect home for
      years to come.

      I highly recommend Jeremy Qualley as a Realtor.  Jeremy represented us in
      the sale of our home in Fargo, North Dakota this Fall.  Having been a
      realtor in the past, I can’t think of anyone more qualified in Fargo to
      represent a client either as a listing agent or a buyers agent.  Jeremy
      has the pulse on the market, and his professional ability to market our
      home gave us much needed relief as we were selling from our home in
      Tucson, and we were not able to be there for the listing, and the final
      closing.  I put my full trust in Jeremy, and was not at all disappointed
      in his creative marketing skills which led my home to sell quickly and
      efficiently.  Jeremy and SK Realty went above and beyond the normal
      realtor responsibilities.  That made all the difference!

      Working with Jeremy Qualley was an absolute pleasure.  He was fantastic at
      understanding the aspects we were dealing with as first-time buyers.  It
      was nice have someone who helped us with every step, and was always very
      prompt with information and updates throughout the process.  It was makes
      the whole experience so much less stressful to have someone who can
      explain everything to you in a professional and yet affable way.  We
      highly recommend Jeremy, and will be doing so to everyone we know!

      Jeremy guided us through the home buying maze and answered all our
      questions as soon as possible. He was excellent dealing with the
      homeowner’s agent and looking out for our best interest. He’s professional
      but easy going and we would highly recommend Jeremy.

      Jeremy helped us look for a house for 3 months. He always worked around
      our schedules and always gave us a heads up on houses that went on the
      market that day. After a couple houses that we first walked through, he
      knew what we were looking for and where we would like to live. He also
      would look into all the questions we had about the houses that we liked.
      When we found the house that we have now, Jeremy had a list of:
      inspectors, the places where our utility’s will be from, ect. He helped
      with everything and was there for all our questions. He is a easy going,
      hard working agent! I recommend Jeremy to anyone looking for their home!

      Jeremy helped us sell our first home. His knowledge of the process and
      market made our experience a pleasant one. A good mix of marketing
      strategies were employed and Jeremy relied on his knowledge, experience,
      and professional network to help us meet our goal of selling within a
      reasonable time frame and to our satisfaction.

      Jeremy was great to work with! He was prompt and efficient in helping me
      buy my home – which I love so much. He was able to answer all my questions
      and was very easy to talk to. The experience was that much better for
      having Jeremy as my realtor! I definitely recommend Jeremy and would use
      him again in the future for any real estate needs I may have.

      Jeremy was always quick to respond to any questions we had. He had an open
      house right away and our pictures looked great on the internet. He knew we
      wanted to be out by a certain date and our house sold in time and at the
      price we were looking for. He was very personable and easy to work with.
      We would use him again if we were going to purchase in the F-M area.

      Jeremy was absolutely WONDERFUL to work with! He was very honest and
      up-front about every aspect in selling our home. He was very gracious to
      explain any part of the process that we didn’t understand and offered
      honest input and advice whenever a “snag” occurred. I would recommend him
      to anyone looking to buy or sell a home! I wish he could be our agent when
      we buy our next home! (we moved out of state, otherwise he would be!)

      I was a first time buyers, and I was guided the whole way through this
      crazy process with such care and professionalism. I may have been small
      fries compared to other clients, but he always made me feel like I was his
      main concern. He was extremely patient with all of my requests. Jeremy
      understood the importance of getting me my first house, and followed up on
      everything possible to ensure that I would be able to buy my new home. He
      made the process seem like a piece of cake. He kept me informed, educated
      me on the process, and continues to follow up with me. I was lucky enough
      to work with Jeremy, and would highly recommend him to anybody.

      Jeremy was great to work with. He knew just what we needed to do to our

      old home!

      My wife and I were moving back from Iowa and looking for a new place in
      the Fargo/Moorhead area to call our home. We knew that there were going to
      be a lot of big changes coming up in our lives and really didn’t know
      where to start with looking for a house. I found out that Jeremy was a
      relator in the area and figured he would be a great person to speak with
      since I’ve known him for many years. As first time home buyers we were
      thinking we could get some questions answered and get some good ideas. We
      were completely blown away with the first meeting we had with Jeremy. He
      really took the time to learn more about us. Not just what we could
      afford, but what we were looking for in our “Dream House”. We went over
      location, size, year, model, everything that we were looking for in a
      house. Then Jeremy took us through a “house reality check” that really
      opened our eyes to what would work best for us.  After this meeting Jeremy
      took what we had spoke about and began sending us emails with different
      houses that were listed on the market. We were able to view these homes
      without having to leave ours. When we came across something we liked we
      just let Jeremy know and we would go take a look at it. With the way the
      market was going in the Fargo/Moorhead area, houses were going faster than
      Jeremy could email us.  We were getting a little worried and not sure if
      we were going to find something just right for us. We told Jeremy about
      our concerns and that’s when he really got down to business. He put us
      upon his shoulders at this point and within no time he was showing us the
      house that we eventually bought. We had to go through a couple
      negotiations, and Jeremy handled the situation perfectly while keeping us
      calm and informed during the entire process.  We can’t thank him enough
      for the hard work that he put in, we weren’t always the easiest to work
      with, but from the beginning he told us he would find us our “Dream House”
      and that’s exactly what he did.

      Jeremy is absolutely the best realtor and business professional out there.
      So unbelievably professional and very knowledgeable. He has so many up to
      date tools that he uses so your house is literally available to everyone
      immediately. I would never work with anyone else nor recommend anyone
      else. You are making a huge mistake if you go with anyone else.

      We were very pleased with Jeremy in the whole process of buying our home.
      Everything went smoothly, he got back to us right away with any questions
      we had and made sure we were satisfied with everything. He has a great
      personality and very friendly. We definitely would use him again. We have
      gone with SK Realty for many many years and have always been pleased.
      Again they didn’t let us down!! Thumbs up!

      Jeremy is an absolute treasure. He always responded promptly to my
      communications and kept in constant contact. Jeremy never made me feel
      silly for asking dumb questions. He is trustworthy, concerned and kind.
      You won’t find a better realtor in the area.

      Jeremy is an awesome realtor! He always works towards ensuring that your
      transition is smooth and easy. Jeremy has sold 2 homes for us and each one
      has sold in 1 day above asking and offers that blew me away. To this day
      my son still talks about Jeremy and we feel he is a great family friend we
      will always recommend him to anyone we know. In looking back I had
      accepted a new job in Arizona and Jeremy got off of a plane from in
      Minneapolis and drove straight to our house in Fargo so that we could get
      our home on last minute. Every time we have worked with Jeremy he went
      above and beyond expectations to ensure that your home is sold and listed
      right away.

      Jeremy did a great job in helping us find a good home that fits what we

      and was always willing to let us think about things.

      Jeremy Qualley was a pleasure to work with from start to finish, he always
      made us feel like we were his highest priority. In the last five years I
      have bought and sold a few houses in the area, using other realtors and I
      was always left disappointed. It is not very often that you get to work
      with someone that takes pride in what they do. If you are looking for a
      realtor that will go above and beyond to make sure you are well taken care
      of and your best interest is at hand, you couldn’t ask for a better
      realtor than Jeremy Qualley!
