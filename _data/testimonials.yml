  - quote: I liked it, he treated me really good. He went above and beyond helping me fine tune the house, putting the house on the market, how much it's worth. He really spent a lot of time with me. I was really happy with the experience. He gave me a lot of tips to update the house to get the most money out of it.

  - quote: It's pretty much positive, the whole thing went pretty quick. Once we listed it we basically had an offer and we accepted within about five to six days. There really wasn't that much contact with him other than the original meeting. As far as getting everything organized, I thought he did very well. Everything was pretty positive.

  - quote: It was great, I had three properties that I wanted to sell, I gave them all to him. He got me the money that I wanted for them and he sold them really fast. Whenever something was needed, he always got it. It was great. He was quick, effective, he got me the deal that I wanted. Whenever I have another property, I will definitely give it to him.

  - quote: Well, to be honest, it was very easy, he listed a property for me because I do live in Canada and he was there. He listed it and pretty much sold it after a week to ten days. So it was really fast and it went really well. Everything was pretty straight forward, but if I had any questions or I didn't understand something, he was there to help me out. I would recommend him to anybody.

  - quote: When our first offer had to be cancelled, we immediately had another offer, a cash offer. I was really impressed with the way he was able to handle my frustration level and was always available to call and text. We closed 10 days after our first escrow was cancelled! I would definitely recommend him. His would be the first name that came out of my mouth for anyone needing a realtor.

  - quote: I was satisfied. It was an easy transaction and he was helpful with getting the house that I wanted. He gave me all the pointers as far as what improvements I could make to the house. Get the fair market value of the house. Pretty much all of the paperwork that we had to sign and stuff was online where I could just get online and be done with it.

  - quote: The whole process went very well, very smoothly. Mike was very accommodating, very cordial, and went out of his way to make sure that I understood things and made sure that I received the information necessary. He was with me every step of the way and making sure that I answered all of the proper questions and kept up-to-date on everything. He walked me through step by step and made sure everything went smoothly.

  - quote: I got results that I was very well satisfied with because I don’t live in Vegas, but my home is there and I was trying to sell it, but I live in Phoenix. He helped me out a lot and I only had to travel there one time and he handled everything for me and I was just so pleased because it took a lot off of my shoulders. He was easy to work with and understood what I needed. He thought of stuff that I have not thought of before… I trusted him because he knew what he was doing so it just gave me a peace of mind.

  - quote: Perfect! Actually, he went beyond his responsibility and he helped me out because of a repair. I asked him to watch the guys that were doing some repairing on the property and he did it and I loved it.
