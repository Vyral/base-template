      Kari Kohler happens to be not only my, well to begin with an agent that I
      met, but today she is not only our agent still for investment needs but my
      very, very, very dear sweet awesome friend that I love very much. She
      means a lot to me. I've done multiple dealings with her—multiple. I mean
      she's helped me with my investment property needs for the past 6 or 7
      years now and I actually live right next to her now! She’s very dear to
      me. She's extremely professional, extremely, extremely, extremely good in
      her real estate business that she runs like a champ. I would recommend her
      over and over again. And I have in the past, to everyone and anyone even
      if they don't have the need. I’ll say hey, are you looking for an awesome
      real estate agent because I know the best of the best of the best. I feel
      that when you go with Kari and her group you go with the best. They
      literally babysit you through the entire process. When you don't go with
      them you realize what you're missing because I've done that. Kari knows
      I’ll pick up investment properties, and if I'm dealing with someone else I
      feel so frustrated because it's like you have to do things on your own,
      and I think Kari's team literally spoils you because they babysit you
      through the process so much and take all the worry out of everything. They
      answer silly little questions for you in such a norm way as if you're
      asking the most important question in the world. But to make it short Kari
      is a dear friend of mine, and an agent still of mine, and my neighbor. My
      husband and I have high regards of respect for her, and her husband Neil
      Kohler, and her team, and I would recommend her 1000 times and over again.
