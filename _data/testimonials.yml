  - quote: I wish we had gone with Greater Toronto Group first! I had been through several realtors who tried to sell my property unsuccessfully. The Greater Toronto Group got me a successful sale within 30 days, at the price I wanted, without lowering the list price!

  - quote: We sold for 99.5% in less than a week - in a down market! We have worked with realtors before that do the job, but the Greater Toronto Group goes WAY beyond that. Even when we were satisfied with the price negotiated, our realtor kept on negotiating and got us $7,000 MORE THAN WE WANTED! We couldn't be happier!
