      Jeremy is an outstanding individual with a the work mentality as good as
      anyone around. His knowledge and expertise help my wife and I find the
      home of our dreams. I would recommend Jeremy to anyone I know. There isn’t
      a realtor out there, that I would trust more with one of the most
      important decision in one’s life than him. He is a hardworking, honest,
      and kind person.

      We worked with Jeremy in 2011 to help us find our next home. He really
      listened to what we were looking for and would also get weekly listings of
      houses that fit exactly what we were looking for. He was so helpful with
      the whole process and was always quick to answer any questions that came
      up along the way. We would strongly recommend Jeremy to anybody looking to
      buy or sell a home. He is an honest realtor whose integrity is unmatched.

      Jeremy made finding our first home a memorable experience that we will
      never forget.  Jeremy put countless hours into finding homes that we could
      afford and that we would want to look at.  Never once did he offer to show
      us a home that was too far out of our budget that would put us in a bind
      if we were to purchase the home.  His hours were extremely flexible around
      our schedule even to the point he would be willing to cancel plans to show
      us a house.  Even signing papers and negotiations with the seller came
      without any hiccups.  My wife and I would use Jeremy as our realtor again,
      and would offer his card to any family and friends in need of a realtor.

      I would strongly recommend the realty services of Jeremy Qualley for any
      seller or buyer. Today we closed on our home after setting out previewing
      our very first property 11 months ago. The home search timespan was not
      dictated by Jeremy’s inability to find properties to our liking, but
      rather the ongoing search to find the right home for us, which was our
      goal and Jeremy’s all along. The patience shown by Jeremy and his actions
      of putting our best interests first while searching to find our home was
      truly one of the best customer service efforts I have encountered. Jeremy
      was more than willing on multiple occasions to work with our busy
      schedules and preview homes on nights, weekends, and lunches. He made the
      home buying experience enjoyable and effortless on our behalf. With weekly
      mailings of homes within our wanted criteria, we were able to locate our
      new home. Although, I am excited to work with Jeremy again in the future,
      I know it won’t be in the near future as he found us the perfect home for
      years to come.

      I highly recommend Jeremy Qualley as a Realtor.  Jeremy represented us in
      the sale of our home in Fargo, North Dakota this Fall.  Having been a
      realtor in the past, I can’t think of anyone more qualified in Fargo to
      represent a client either as a listing agent or a buyers agent.  Jeremy
      has the pulse on the market, and his professional ability to market our
      home gave us much needed relief as we were selling from our home in
      Tucson, and we were not able to be there for the listing, and the final
      closing.  I put my full trust in Jeremy, and was not at all disappointed
      in his creative marketing skills which led my home to sell quickly and
      efficiently.  Jeremy and SK Realty went above and beyond the normal
      realtor responsibilities.  That made all the difference!
