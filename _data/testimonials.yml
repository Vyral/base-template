  - quote: We were on the market to sell our house and found Scott Fuller’s information online so we decided to do a live interview with him. He seemed really straightforward, honest, and after that we were sold. He was always available to us and he followed through with everything he said he would do. It was less than a week before we got an offer! We actually received a couple of offers and Scott was very good about helping us choose one that worked the best, which we really appreciated. He knew what made which offer better and it was great! Like I said, Scott was very straightforward and I think that was key to his success. He told you the way things would work and he was very honest about it. Those were absolutely his best qualities. He has a great team which makes a big difference when you work it a Realtor. It’s doesn’t work out that you always work with the Realtor the entire time so you deal with other people on their team and Scott has definitely assembled a wonderful team.

  - quote: Several years ago, I was looking to do a short sale on my house. I started looking online and found Scott Fuller’s information. I read a really positive Yelp review and decided to work with him. He provided excellent service for myself, my wife, and to all of my family and friends that I’ve referred him to. When we first started working with him, as I said before we were on the market to sell but we were also looking to buy and he helped us get an excellent deal. I’ve worked with a number of other Realtors and Scott is the only one I continue to refer to others. Scott has effective marketing and he’s very attentive and responsive. Throughout the entire process he always went the extra mile to get us what we needed. Scott is very reliable, honest, and trustworthy.

  - quote: The first time I worked with Scott Fuller, I was doing a short sale on my home. I saw an advertisement where Scott presented himself as a short sale expert so I got in contact with him and it took off from there. Scott always stayed in touch, he communicated, he followed up, and he proved to be a guy of his word. I honestly couldn’t have been more pleased with him. I’ve worked with other Realtors in the past and they were all good in their own light but no one was as good as Scott. One thing that I was really impressed with was his communication, he responded to emails and phone calls immediately or within the day. The communication was always there. Scott stayed on top of things and I never had the impression that he had a lot of other clients and didn’t have time for me. I didn’t feel like my condo was that big of a deal especially compared to other bigger homes where the commission would be better but he called me a lot and he even made time to sign papers.

  - quote: I’ve known about Scott Fuller because our kids go to the same preschool. At the time we were selling the house, I was going through a divorce and my now ex-wife and I felt that Scott would be impartial between the two of us. I’ve worked with various other Realtors and I’d still go back and work with Scott before any of the others. It was a volatile situation and my ex-wife isn’t always the easiest person to work with so managing that says the world. He’s upfront and honest. Scott is very easy to work with and whenever you leave him a message, if you even have to leave him a message, he’ll get back to you right away. I can be very bull headed and I needed someone that can cut through the bull and give a straight answer on everything and Scott definitely did that. I like people who are straightforward, upfront, and attentive and Scott has all of those qualities. I’d absolutely refer anyone to work with Scott Fuller.

  - quote: I was recommended to Scott Fuller from a previous Realtor and I am so grateful for the referral! The level of service was wonderful! I was working with a short sale and it’s not something I have a lot of experience with but Scott made the whole process very easy. He explained everything and guided me throughout the whole process. He is very good a walking you through and answering any questions you may have. Scott is on the ball and he does what he says he’s going to do. He is very efficient and incredibly responsive. Every time I called him, I got an immediate response back. During the sale, I was actually out of the country and Scott really helped me and stepped in to smooth things over with the tenant. We were trying to get the tenant out of the house so we could show it and they were being very difficult about it but Scott was very professional. He gave me advice on how to deal with it and it was just a huge help.

  - quote: We wanted to do a short sale and we heard nothing but horror stories from everyone that’s done them. Scott actually specialized in short sales and it was a surprisingly smooth process. He really knew what to do every step of the process. We had a lot of concerns as far as credit goes so Scott had someone do some research based on our circumstances that really put us at ease. We’ve adhered to their process and actually we have a very good credit standing!
