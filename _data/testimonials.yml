  - quote: My results were very good! She was selling my home and helping me buy a house. The first weekend we had 45 showings and multiple offers so that was good. She listened to what I said because she was advising me when the first buyer pulled out to not give them what they were asking for but she also knew I wanted to move and I wanted the other house. And she helped me get the house I wanted at the price I wanted (to pay).  I had a lot of sewer problems (on the house I was selling) and I was about to lose my mind. I would refer to her as my “counselor” because she would call to check in and give advice on what to do; she was extremely helpful during that time because it was such a stressful process.  She gave me resources of people to call to get things looked at. She called me back right away! She was great!

  - quote: Excellent. It was a better experience than I could have really ever imagined. We came out, she looked over our house and told us things we needed to do. We put it on the market and sold it the next day. She made everything go really smoothly and easily for us. My husband and I both travel a lot for work, and it was around the holidays we were traveling. There were a few different things during the inspection that we needed to get done, and she coordinated all of that to get done with a contractor. She had it all fixed while we were out of town and we didn't have to do anything. She took care of everything, literally, everything for us!

  - quote: Sandie sold our small city home nearly a decade ago before we moved off to the East Coast. When we moved back, there was absolutely no question which Realtor we would use. We had to fly in and had two days to check out houses. Sandie gave us complete attention those two days, was able to change our  schedule on the fly if we stopped liking an area, and we found our dream house! In both buying and selling, Sandie has amazing negotiation skills. We were very happy with the outcomes of our home sale and home buying. She also a really professional team to support her at the office. As far as we're concerned, Sandie is the only choice in St. Louis.
    name: Zach and Sarah, Home Seller

  - quote: Sandie Hea was the reason we were able to sell our house for nearly our asking price in less than 30 days in a down market. She knows what it take to get a house ready to sell and has numerous resources (stagers, handymen, etc.) which makes preparing the home for sale very easy. She is professional and a very good negotiator. She has a responsive staff who are always available to assist or answer questions. I would recommend her without hesitation.
    name: Jim and Christie, Home Seller

  - quote: Sandie knows her stuff! After my husband got a new job out of state, we had a very short timeline to sell our home in a relatively slow time of year and a down market (yikes!). We spoke with another Realtor who advised us to wait until fall and told us to expect a sale price in the $160s  (for our 4bd, fully updated home). Our neighbors across the alley had recently sold their home with Sandie and highly recommended her. We decided to give her a call for a second opinion. She arrived at the meeting very well prepared with comps to show what was on the market, what had sold, how fast and at what price. With that information we were able to decide on a price that was based on sales, not current listings. Lots of homes similar to ours were listed around $200K, but after looking at the closed deals, the sales were closer to $185K. Being short on time, we decided to list right at $185K. We put a lot of work into making sure the house looked perfect, including filling up two small storage units to get rid of excess belongings. Sandie recommended a home stager who came for a 2 hour consultation. All together we got the house looking perfect! Sandie's fabulous team also includes a professional photographer so the online listing looked sharp. We had 14 showings and two offers in two weeks and our home sold! When it came time to negotiate with the buyers, Sandie took a collaborative approach making sure that everyone's needs were met. She handled the post-offer process (inspections, etc) just as professionally and worked hard to make sure everything was settled on a tight deadline. We were already out of state for the last week and a half prior to closing, but Sandie kept in close contact with us as things progressed. I cannot say enough good things about Sandie Hea. She is very organized and has a great business system and a great support team. But most importantly she knows the market and how to sell a home! Sandie helped us find, negotiate and buy a good home for a good price, in only 2 days! We were out of town buyers so relied on her expertise and experience and have not been disappointed with the outcome. Everything on her end went perfectly throughout the entire process. Her team was connected with us every step of the way providing information and assisting us in the transition process. Continued follow-up since closing is something we brag about to our friends and neighbors!

  - quote: I recommend Sandie to anyone that is even considering selling or buying a home. The reason is she doesn't tell people what they want to hear and doesn't fill them full of promises that she can't deliver on, she is successful because she is so totally awesome at what she does, if you ever need to sell or purchase a home she will thrill you in comparison to any other agent you have dealt with. She makes significant sacrifices of her personal time to provide her clients what they need, and that is the difference, between a real estate agent and an amazing real estate agent.
    name: Jeff and Melita, Home Buyer and Seller

  - quote: Frustrated from lack of communication from our first Listing Agent, we reached out to a top agent in our area, Sandie Hea with RE/MAX Results. Sandie made many helpful suggestions that she felt were holding our house back from getting an offer the first time around, all of which we followed. My  husband and I both work full-time and have a toddler; the stress of keeping the house clean, the dog removed, and our son happy during this process was nothing short of chaotic, but Sandie went above and beyond to make the experience as painless as possible. Although the offer we finally received was a lowball, Sandie's expert negotiation skills managed to get the buyer up to a price we wanted to accept. We were so impressed with our selling experience with Sandie that we also hired her to be our Buyer's Agent for a new home in the Chesterfield/Ballwin area. Her specific knowledge of market conditions helped us to not go overboard on a house we really wanted, which she advised was too high for the area, and consequently we bought our dream house for far less than we thought we could! Our experience with Sandie was exceptional and we would not hesitate to recommend her to anyone looking to sell or buy a home.
    name: Charlie and Adrienne, Home Seller

  - quote: I have two client experiences with Sandie to write about. The first was when we had to sell our house after 10 months of ownership and Sandie was our agent. She was fabulous and everything went off flawlessly! Even when we had to replace our furnace on the DAY OF CLOSING (talk about stress!), it was covered since we had purchased a home warranty! The second, and more recent, relates to how Sandie knows the business like no other. We were selling a house in another state and trying to pick an agent. I met with 2 agents who went through our house and brought their comps. I liked both agents but there was a wide discrepancy between the prices they wanted to list the house at. OF COURSE I was more drawn to the agent who wanted to list it at the higher price...who wouldn't be? But even when I looked at the comps I didn't quite feel comfortable with it. So I called Sandie to ask her opinion, and she had long talk with me about going with an agent that KNOWS the area, that has a VAST amount of experience, and that is realistic. She was right. We sold the house without any complications and were thrilled with the Remax agent that we used there! She was very much like Sandie...knew the market SO well and had massive experience that helped us have a smooth deal! So even when Sandie WASN'T directly our agent, she used her knowledge and experience to make our transition leaving our home that we loved and moving to a new state. 
    name: Sarah and Matt, Home Buyer and Seller

  - quote: Sandie was amazing to work with! She knew exactly what to do to navigate a short sale and keep us updated and informed throughout the process. We were very happy and have recommended her to several friends and family members. We were relocating to St Louis from Canada with a very limited time to find a home. We approached Sandie several months prior to making the move. She took the time to get to know us, find out exactly what we were looking for and how much we were willing to spend before we ever set foot in the  country. We had just a few days to find a house, make an offer and get the deal done. Sandie put together a wide range of houses that met our criteria, spent two full days driving around showing us houses so we could find just the right place for us. She also assisted with finding the right financing, which is not easy when moving from another country. We were in transit the day our sale closed so Sandie did the walk-through on our behalf and made everything as stress-free as possible. Sandie is a wonderful example of what great customer service can be and should be. Highly recommended.
    name: Ron and Susan, Home Seller

  - quote: We were referred to Sandie by some contacts of ours. We did not know the city nor many people who lived in the city, so we were pretty lucky that things worked out so well. Sandie is incredibly responsive/prompt. It is very evident that she works incredibly hard at this. The home we bought in  St. Louis was actually our second home, so we were somewhat familiar with the process, but Sandie held our hands through the entire process and actually became a good friend along the way. She is very realistic and works hard to understand the needs of the homebuyers in order to best serve them. I would say that we looked at 6-10 houses with Sandie over the course of an entire year! When we first moved to St. Louis we considered buying a home but after feeling pretty overwhelmed by the transition, we decided to hold off and rent for a year. As we neared the end of our lease, we began looking for homes again and re-contacted Sandie, who was more than willing to dive back into the process with us. We love our home. We ended up purchasing a century old home that was remodeled in 2007. So, like all old homes, we have run into a few issues, but nothing out of the ordinary. St. Louis has some beautiful and historic areas, and we are so glad to be in this city. 
    name: Brett and Maggie, Home Buyer

  - quote: Sandie was refered to us by a very good friend. From the first time we met with Sandie she represented herself and her team with great confidence and professionalism. We felt very comfortable as she worked through severall situations that came up in the course of the sale of our condominium. She arranged all of the paperwork and made closing very easy. We would encourage others looking for true professionals to use the Hea Team. We had a wonderful experience recently with Sandie Hea when she listed and sold our house. Her expertise proved essential as she saw us through many challenges that we could not have foreseen ourselves. The time on the market was kept to a minimum and she walked us through many obstacles from  contract to closing, which was especially important given we were expecting baby No. 3 and trying to manage our two small children in addition to heading into a big move. We were thankful to have her as our agent and felt she cared about us and how we were doing through the process, not just the end result of a sale. We would highly recommend her without reservation.
    name: Caleb and Anna, Home Seller

  - quote: We have worked with Sandie through four transactions over the past 8 years. From selling our house to buying a new house, twice. Through each experience, Sandie has been the calm in the storm. Her expertise in real estate may us feel at ease. She was able to assist us get our house ready to sell, and buy our next house effortlessly. We always felt like we were her number one priority-day or night. When it comes to negotiating, we felt like we were in the BEST hands! Sandie and her team gives you a personal touch. Honestly, we can NOT imagine going through the overwhelming process of buying/selling a house without Sandie. 
    name: Shane and Carolyn, Repeat Customers

  - quote: When we decided to sell our home of 15+ years, Sandie gave us an honest and professional opinion as to what needed to be done. Throughout the entire process, which was stressful at times, Sandie continued to provide status updates and assistance at every turn. We felt as if Sandie only had one home to sell - OURS! 
    name: Rhodes

  - quote: I chose to interview Sandie because I remembered she was a volunteer when my home in St. Louis Hills was in the House Tour. I respect a working professional that gives back to the community. Upon meeting her, I informed her that I had nothing but negative experiences with realtors in the past. I  told her I had several acquaintances that are realtors but given my mistrust, I wanted to go with someone I didn't know so if this turned into another bad experience, it wouldn’t damage any relationships. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. Sandi is smart, organized, technologically savvy and straight-forward. She has a team of people/contacts that clearly respect her and like working with her. She guided me through the process without being pushy and really looked out for my best interest in a very realistic and professional way. She didn't try to sell me on anything but rather gave explanations of the pros and cons and let me decide. I found myself asking her what she would do which is something I have never trusted a realtor enough to do in the past. She had services that were up and above my expectations that seemed to be just a part of how she does business. I still think selling a house is miserable...but when I choose to do it again, I won't have the added frustration of choosing a realtor. Sandie is my realtor.
     name: Sherri Juergensen

  - quote: The most important part about selling your home is finding the right Agent. Well look no further; Sandie Hea is the absolute best. Selling a home in today's economy is tough, so picking the right Real Estate Agent is critical in getting it sold. You need an agent that knows the business inside and out, someone who is not afraid to tell you the truth about the market, but more importantly, the truth about the value of your home. Our home was on the market for over a year, and we had three different agents represent us during that time. Before we found Sandie, we were very frustrated and at the point of panic most of you will know what I mean. Before we got started, Sandie gave us a little homework project, in the form of a Video and a Q&A worksheet. By the time we actually got started, the ball was ready to roll. After learning the right way to sell and market our home, we had five showings the first week and were under contract two weeks later. From the beginning of the contract, Sandie and her incredible team took control. We were notified immediately when documents were changed or needed quick action. We could sense a cool calmness about Sandie, which made us feel like we were always moving in the right direction. Sandie even has a service for using her moving truck. If you want to sell your home with as little pain as possible, contact Sandie Hea, she truly will “Get the job done”. I could not give her a stronger recommendation, two thumbs “way up”. 
    name: Gary and Terra 

  - quote: Sandie is a strong Christian business woman that treats her clients by the Golden Rule of doing onto them as she would have them do onto her. She is one of the sharpest, most savvy realtors you could ever want. The attention to the details, incredible negotiating skills, and complete knowledge  of the markets are what set her apart from the typical realtor. Sandie actually helped sell two different houses for me. My personal house back in 2002 and my mother's house after she had passed away in 2010. In both cases, Sandie was able to sell the houses within a few months for a much better price than I expected. Especially, in the extremely tough market conditions of 2010 when she helped sell my mom's house. There were six other houses for sale in my mom's subdivision, but Sandie's advice to make a few improvements to the house of tearing out the carpets and refinishing the original wood floors underneath, along with a fresh coat of paint and furnishing the house with showroom quality rental furniture made all the difference to prospective buyers. The last thing I need to share and elaborate on about Sandie are her shrewd negotiating skills. On both houses, I was ready to fold under the pressure and accept lower offers. Sandie convinced me to hold strong in both cases and it paid off with my getting a much higher price. I can't emphasize enough that she knows the market and if you listen to her advice and trust her natural instincts, you will benefit tremendously.
    name: Mike and Tammy 

  - quote: All of the Sandie's reviews on Zillow are spot on. She is extremely professional, honest, and knows the area well. As first time home buyers we really appreciated her expertise and honest assessment of the homes we toured. She was able to point out flaws that we otherwise wouldn't have even noticed. Throughout the process Sandie remained very patient with us even though it took months before we finally found the right house. I would definitely recommend her to anyone looking for straightforward guidance in this rapidly changing housing market
    name: Buyer in Kirkwood 2013

  - quote: We used Sandie Hea in the spring of 2013 to sell our home in South St Louis city and we used Sandie to help us find a home for our growing family in the 63109 zip code as well. With high competition and tough overall housing market, I didn't want to mess around with someone who was not a full time real estate professional. Sandie runs an efficient operation that maximized our sale value. Sandie hired a professional photographer who took crisp photos for our online listing and ensured that our listing was posted on the numerous real estate websites. The entire showing / feedback process was automated including the offer negotiation. I recall electronically signing counter offer forms in my own pajamas late at night from my bedroom. I think easiest way to summarize it is that Sandie is a pro's pro. Experience matters and Sandie will devote countless hours assisting in every step of the process. She is well connected and can easily provide vendor recommendations who are very reliable. Very good experience!
    name: Tom and Jane 

  - quote: Face it, selling and moving is at best hard and at worst it can be a nightmare. Having a great realtor is your only defense. Who you pick matters greatly. We have been through 6 Real Estate deals in the last 10 years and we used Sandie Hea for 5 of them. We only used somebody else for the  6th because we bought out of state and Sandie is not licensed in Tennessee. After meeting to set it all up and with a more than a little trepidation we started showing the house, dreading the repeated vacating of the home at a moment's notice for buyers to come look. But as it turned out we just had to meet with Sandie the evening of the first showing day to discuss the offers that continued to stream in even as we met. The upshot is there were 5 good offers to choose from and the house sold in 1 day. We could not have been happier. The buyer came back with a short inspection fix list but it was over $1000. Sandie managed to work the deal such that a piece of furniture that would have been really really hard to move anyway, suddenly became an instrument of the negotiation and we managed to use the transfer of that furniture to significantly lower our inspection-fix costs. The real fireworks started when the survey showed the neighbors had a piece of our property as part of their front lawn. The buyer understandably wanted it, and wanted us to fight it out with the neighbors on his behalf. The neighbors entered the fray with a claim of Adverse Possession. If you've never heard of Adverse Possession, it's a legal concept basically citing the proposition that I have pretended to own this piece of property for 10 years, therefore it is mine. Incredibly, these claims often work. We all worked with the neighbors and while it was never nasty it was uncomfortable. Sandie had to calmly talk us back off the ledge more than once during this multi day episode. Everyone finally agreed to allow the property line to be reset if the Title Company paid the costs. (Thankfully we had Title Insurance.) But not so fast. The neighbors (one of whom is a lawyer who did nothing here to improve the image of lawyers) at the last minute wanted to use this survey issue to capture a cool $5000 from the Title Company, threatening to break the deal the night before we closed. Thanks to some savvy and ethical people at Investors Title Company & a last minute agreement, the deal was saved. The solution was to make all paperwork signing and the property line changes on the day of closure. This of course required a group of workers and a Bobcat End Loader in our driveway throughout closing day. And this was just the sell side of deal. As I said we had to use another realtor for our purchase in TN. Never allow yourself to get mixed up in a dual agency situation. That is where the realtor works for and supposedly serves the interest of both seller and buyer. That is preposterous; it can't be done, not by anybody. Dual agency should be illegal. Our Tennessee realtor, who we also liked, presented us with a home he just put on the market for the seller. We knew better but stupidly went along with the dual agency situation. Now we were faced with having, not an advocate but a facilitator. It nearly drove us nuts. We couldn't trust that what we said would not be immediately told to the seller. He told us things I felt he probably shouldn't have, that the seller supposedly said. Operating without trust in a real Estate deal is almost impossible. Without Sandie's help the deal would probably have blown up down there. She gave us a lot of advice about what to watch out for, how to make certain demands and what we should say and what we may want to keep to ourselves. It was still frustrating working this way; we were at one point literally about to fire the TN realtor. Thankfully Sandie agreed to speak with us and hear our concerns and basically convinced us that he was doing about as well as anybody could in this kind a dual agency deal. So we stuck with the guy. Then another buyer stepped in behind us (we had a contingency but without a kick out clause) and offered $30,000 more than our signed contract was for. Lovely. Now the seller, who liked us a lot when we bought his property 5 days into the MLS listing, now didn't like us so much. And he didn't like at all the idea of fixing anything on the inspection report. We were back out on the ledge ready to jump, figuring this thing was falling apart. Again Sandie talked us back and with an injection of logic over emotion we decided to try to make it work even with no inspection fixes. After a scary date negotiation the seller signed. We had a deal. Without high quality realtors involved these deals would have never gotten done. As it all turns out we did have a pretty competent agent in Tennessee. And in St Louis we had a truly great realtor in Sandie Hea
    name: Jeff and Pam 

  - quote: Sandie helped my wife and I sell our Rock Hill home last year. With her help we received two full price offers the second day the house was on the market. Sandie and her team did a great job of guiding us through the process; from preparing the house for listing through negotiations and closing.  She is very professional and has an excellent system. Sandie's expertise in the St Louis real estate market is obvious. We would recommend her to anyone selling a home in the area. Sandie helped us search for and buy a house that met all the criteria we were looking for. It took us about 10 months to find just the right house. She actually recommended we look at a house that was a bit more expensive than our price range because she knew it was an estate and we should be able to negotiate a lower price. Once we saw the house, we knew it was exactly what we wanted. She helped us move quickly to put in an offer and negotiate a very favorable price on the deal. She knew exactly what to ask for in our offer and bring up in negotiations to get us the house at significantly below the asking price. She did an excellent job of handling all the paperwork associated with the purchase. She also helped us with leasing out our condo. She was very knowledgeable of rental rates and how to market the condo. We ended up with an excellent tenant paying more than we expected to get in rent. It was well worth the commission to have her handle the rental for us. We would definitely use Sandie again if we need to sell or lease a property. We've also recommended her to several friends who are looking to buy. 
    name: Shirley and Brian 

  - quote: We decided to go with Sandie Hea,because she lived in our neighborhood. She was able to get 99% of our asking price,and find us another home in our time frame. Sandie is the best in our opinion! Always professional, organized and on your side.
    name: Phil and Kathy 

  - quote: We interviewed multiple agents for the job. Sandie Hea was most well prepared and knowledgeable of the bunch. She used a variety of techniques to show what the house\property was worth and what selling price could be expected. These included comps and computer models. After following most of her recommendations the house was listed and sold within weeks at almost the exact projected price. Have used her again since then.
    name: Chris and Tess 

  - quote: We live out of town and saw some interesting properties in the area we were looking. I picked Sandie randomly from reviews and her area of expertise. I knew immediately from the phone conversation that she was the agent for us. We came in town for the weekend and she accommodated us into her schedule. We looked at a couple houses and she was able to point out problem areas. We went back home and had a contract on a foreclosure within a week. There were other buyers interested, but she fought hard for us. We would definitely use her again for a future purchase in the area.
    name: Colorado people

  - quote: Sandie and her team were fantastic to work with and will be my first call when in the market again. She provided assistance right from the beginning of the listing process right through the closing and then on to the purchase of my next house. There was quite a bit of negotiation during both sale and purchase and it was great to have a strong negotiator in my corner who knew the ropes. She is straight forward and honest regarding things like selling prices and locations. My purchase location drifted quite a ways out of the St Louis area and she never hesitated to be available and help.
    name: Delos 

  - quote: We bought our first home with Sandie, and she was an immense help. We only had 2 days to shop, and she helped focus the list on the most likely candidates. The first house we wanted to make an offer on, she did a great job finding comparable sales and negotiating price using the house's weak spots.  They didn't take our offer and that house is still unsold two months later. The second house we went for, she did a terrific job, and recommended a great inspector and did some hard negotiating that allowed us to get a lot of stuff fixed on the seller's dime. We love our cute new house!
    name: Ryan King and Molly

  - quote: Sandie Hea was extremely helpful in assisting us with the sale of our home. She is truly a professional and an excellent experienced realtor. Our home sold in exactly 3 weeks and Sandie Hea along with her team provided excellent advice along the way. I would highly recommend Sandie's team to any home owner who is contemplating the sale of their home. Her many years of experience and many contacts will guarantee the best offer and professional sale. We are extremely pleased and happy to have had this team in our corner. Thank you Sandie Hea team!
    name: Fenton, 2014
