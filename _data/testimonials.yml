  - quote: My results were very good! She was selling my home and helping me buy a house. The first weekend we had 45 showings and multiple offers so that was good. She listened to what I said because she was advising me when the first buyer pulled out to not give them what they were asking for but she also knew I wanted to move and I wanted the other house. And she helped me get the house I wanted at the price I wanted (to pay).  I had a lot of sewer problems (on the house I was selling) and I was about to lose my mind. I would refer to her as my “counselor” because she would call to check in and give advice on what to do; she was extremely helpful during that time because it was such a stressful process.  She gave me resources of people to call to get things looked at. She called me back right away! She was great!

  - quote: Excellent. It was a better experience than I could have really ever imagined. We came out, she looked over our house and told us things we needed to do. We put it on the market and sold it the next day. She made everything go really smoothly and easily for us. My husband and I both travel a lot for work, and it was around the holidays we were traveling. There were a few different things during the inspection that we needed to get done, and she coordinated all of that to get done with a contractor. She had it all fixed while we were out of town and we didn't have to do anything. She took care of everything, literally, everything for us!

   - quote: Sandie sold our small city home nearly a decade ago before we moved off to the East Coast. When we moved back, there was absolutely no question which Realtor we would use. We had to fly in and had two days to check out houses. Sandie gave us complete attention those two days, was able to change our  schedule on the fly if we stopped liking an area, and we found our dream house! In both buying and selling, Sandie has amazing negotiation skills. We were very happy with the outcomes of our home sale and home buying. She also a really professional team to support her at the office. As far as we're concerned, Sandie is the only choice in St. Louis.

   - quote: Sandie Hea was the reason we were able to sell our house for nearly our asking price in less than 30 days in a down market. She knows what it take to get a house ready to sell and has numerous resources (stagers, handymen, etc.) which makes preparing the home for sale very easy. She is professional and a very good negotiator. She has a responsive staff who are always available to assist or answer questions. I would recommend her without hesitation.

   - quote: Sandie knows her stuff! After my husband got a new job out of state, we had a very short timeline to sell our home in a relatively slow time of year and a down market (yikes!). We spoke with another Realtor who advised us to wait until fall and told us to expect a sale price in the $160s  (for our 4bd, fully updated home). Our neighbors across the alley had recently sold their home with Sandie and highly recommended her. We decided to give her a call for a second opinion. She arrived at the meeting very well prepared with comps to show what was on the market, what had sold, how fast and at what price. With that information we were able to decide on a price that was based on sales, not current listings. Lots of homes similar to ours were listed around $200K, but after looking at the closed deals, the sales were closer to $185K. Being short on time, we decided to list right at $185K. We put a lot of work into making sure the house looked perfect, including filling up two small storage units to get rid of excess belongings. Sandie recommended a home stager who came for a 2 hour consultation. All together we got the house looking perfect! Sandie's fabulous team also includes a professional photographer so the online listing looked sharp. We had 14 showings and two offers in two weeks and our home sold! When it came time to negotiate with the buyers, Sandie took a collaborative approach making sure that everyone's needs were met. She handled the post-offer process (inspections, etc) just as professionally and worked hard to make sure everything was settled on a tight deadline. We were already out of state for the last week and a half prior to closing, but Sandie kept in close contact with us as things progressed. I cannot say enough good things about Sandie Hea. She is very organized and has a great business system and a great support team. But most importantly she knows the market and how to sell a home! Sandie helped us find, negotiate and buy a good home for a good price -- in only 2 days! We were out of town buyers so relied on her expertise and experience and have not been disappointed with the outcome. Everything on her end went perfectly throughout the entire process. Her team was connected with us every step of the way providing information and assisting us in the transition process. Continued follow-up since closing is something we brag about to our friends and neighbors!

   - quote: I recommend Sandie to anyone that is even considering selling or buying a home. The reason is she doesn't tell people what they want to hear and doesn't fill them full of promises that she can't deliver on, she is successful because she is so totally awesome at what she does, if you ever need to sell or purchase a home she will thrill you in comparison to any other agent you have dealt with. She makes significant sacrifices of her personal time to provide her clients what they need, and that is the difference, between a real estate agent and an amazing real estate agent.

   - quote: Frustrated from lack of communication from our first Listing Agent, we reached out to a top agent in our area, Sandie Hea with RE/MAX Results. Sandie made many helpful suggestions that she felt were holding our house back from getting an offer the first time around, all of which we followed. My  husband and I both work full-time and have a toddler -- the stress of keeping the house clean, the dog removed, and our son happy during this process was nothing short of chaotic, but Sandie went above and beyond to make the experience as painless as possible. Although the offer we finally received was a lowball, Sandie's expert negotiation skills managed to get the buyer up to a price we wanted to accept. We were so impressed with our selling experience with Sandie that we also hired her to be our Buyer's Agent for a new home in the Chesterfield/Ballwin area. Her specific knowledge of market conditions helped us to not go overboard on a house we really wanted, which she advised was too high for the area, and consequently we bought our dream house for far less than we thought we could! Our experience with Sandie was exceptional and we would not hesitate to recommend her to anyone looking to sell or buy a home.
