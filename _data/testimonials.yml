      "Above anything else, they were more than willing to answer my questions
      like at any time of day. Which, I’m sure, they were super thrilled with,
      but it was really great getting to work with them because they are both
      very knowledgeable and if there was anything they didn’t have the answer
      too or they weren’t sure about, they would always reach out and get an
      answer to me as fast as they possibly could so it felt like we were in
      very good capable hands with them and I always felt comfortable asking
      questions throughout the process."

      “I’ve known Wes for several years and it just kind of happened to where we
      went looking for a house but we were just searching on our own and found
      one that we liked so we just called Wes and said ‘Hey, do you want to be
      our Realtor?’ and he very enthusiastically accepted. So we just found a
      house we liked and then Wes hooked us up with Zach. Zach listed
      everything. Wes  worked on the  house that we ended up ultimately buying.
      Wes just went above and beyond. Anytime we needed something he’d just jump
      on it.”

      "Wes was good the entire time. He worked with our schedule and we really
      enjoyed Zach Sikes. Even after we bought, if we had a question he always
      answered it. He’s just been great. We recommend Wes to anyone for sure.
      Wes was good the entire time. Like I said, even after we bought, even
      after we were done with everything, if I had a question I’d shoot Wes a
      text and he’d answer back about whatever it might be. His customer service
      was really good. Wes was really knowledgeable. One thing we liked about
      Wes was [that] he didn’t try to persuade us into anything. He took in our
      thoughts on what our needs were, and then he gave us options and helped us
      find houses based on those needs and desires and wants. One thing my wife
      pointed out that she really like about Wes was when we looked at houses he
      was never pushy on anything. He just let us look and he pointed out things
      that we needed to know that we probably might not have known if he hadn’t
      pointed them out. We felt that he made us feel really comfortable in the
      buying process and I felt like he increased our knowledge base about
      houses in the area and structural things that you need to know about.
      Overall we just felt more comfortable and we trusted working with him and
      seeing houses. We really just enjoyed Wes. He would go down and check
      things that - like I said - we wouldn’t probably have checked or noticed,
      and that was pretty important to us. Overall, we recommend Wes to anyone.
      We really enjoyed his helping us with the house. Definitely, we recommend
      Wes for sure. He’s a good dude."
