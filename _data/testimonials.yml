      "Above anything else, they were more than willing to answer my questions
      like at any time of day. Which, I’m sure, they were super thrilled with,
      but it was really great getting to work with them because they are both
      very knowledgeable and if there was anything they didn’t have the answer
      too or they weren’t sure about, they would always reach out and get an
      answer to me as fast as they possibly could so it felt like we were in
      very good capable hands with them and I always felt comfortable asking
      questions throughout the process."

      “I’ve known Wes for several years and it just kind of happened to where we
      went looking for a house but we were just searching on our own and found
      one that we liked so we just called Wes and said ‘Hey, do you want to be
      our Realtor?’ and he very enthusiastically accepted. So we just found a
      house we liked and then Wes hooked us up with Zach. Zach listed
      everything. Wes  worked on the  house that we ended up ultimately buying.
      Wes just went above and beyond. Anytime we needed something he’d just jump
      on it.”
