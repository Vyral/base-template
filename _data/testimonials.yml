testimonial:
  - quote: "I’m probably the most picky customer service person there is and what I require from people, I seldom get. That being said, I was completely wowed by the Limbird Team. My first experience was when I called on a listing and somebody got back to me within minutes. I was just blown away. They weren’t just fabulous in the beginning to gain my business either, I could probably text her right now and get a response. They stayed in constant communication with me and just provided great service. "
    name: Laura
  - quote:  "We got good results from the Limbird Team. At one point there was a leak in our bathroom ceiling and we were getting ready to head out of town so we couldn’t really handle it. We hadn’t been in the house for 7 years so we didn’t even know where the attic entrance was to get up there. Our Realtors basically handled the whole thing for us which was a complete relief!"
    name: Tara
  - quote: ""The Limbird Team is so good at what they do! We did everything they asked, and it worked. We had multiple offers at the same time and sold the house in only a few days at above the asking price. They are friendly, helpful, positive, and professional. We would never, EVER think of using anyone else."
    name: Sandra B.
  - quote: "We live out of state and the Limbird Team took on everything we couldn't: brightened up the home, lined up any repairs requested and let the contractors in, spotted what needed to be fixed, etc. We were so happy with them! If we had a home to sell in Arkansas again, we wouldn't feel safe putting that sale in the hands of any other realtor."
    name: Marlo
  - quote: "I've had the pleasure of working with Tara and her team on several real estate transactions including buying, selling, and leasing rental properties. I have lived in seven different states and worked with many real estate agents and I can say that Tara is without question the very best among them. Any time I do anything with real estate, I call Tara and the Limbird Team and I am very happy to recommend her for your real estate needs."
