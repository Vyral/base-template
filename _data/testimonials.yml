  - quote: "I have seen better support from being in this office and better training than I’ve even had in my entire life. I was doing REO for the last 6 years and getting back into this market is basically like being a new agent again. That’s why I joined because I wanted to start from scratch and I’ve seen amazing support for Jerimiah and the Keller Williams system. He’s always made time to answer my questions and coach me. He really focuses on who he’s talking to and that really makes the difference!"
