  - quote: Great Partners in My Real Estate Success!
      Coming into this process I was very intimidated, as most first home buyers would be, but instantly I felt reassurance that I had all the support (as well as control) that I needed. Without reaching out personally, I recieved a call from Chelsea at Homesmiths months ago, and immediately was sold on who I needed to partner with for this search. Chelsea & the team were great partners in this process and were very flexible with my schedules. My biggest fear was that I would fear pressure to settle, but they reassured me that I needed to make the right decision based on whether or not I could picture this place as my home, was it within the budget I had set from the beginning. The process was seamless. The CMG Financial team was amazing at clarifying and answering questions to ensure I understood what I was signing and where my money was going. Overall, I am grateful for this experience and owe everything to the HomeSmiths and CMG team in purchasing my new home.

      The HomeSmiths and our agent Mike are awesome! They are personable, knowledgable and extremly helpful. After talking to us initially they were able to show us many houses we liked. Within a few weeks we found and purchased exactly what we were looking for. Thank you!

  - quote: Jeff went above & beyond. He worked with me with an outside buyer I had been working with before I signed with the team, which he did not have to do. We put the house on the market for 2 days and received 5 offers, each outbidding the other. 10 out of 10!
