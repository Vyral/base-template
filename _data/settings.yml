    Over the last twelve months, we have closed over 220 transactions – compare
    this to the average real estate agent that sold less than four homes in the
    same period of time. More importantly, we are bringing our sellers an
    average of 96% or more of the asking price. This is all done on a timetable
    of 35 days that the home being on the market.  I’ve been in the real estate
    business for over 36 years and have closed over 5,000 deals. There hasn’t
    been a problem we’ve come across that we can’t solve in today’s market –
    especially in the challenging market we have today. We will also determine
    the best price that you can receive in this market. One of the biggest
    problems in this industry is the lack of communication between the seller
    and their agent. We have a dedicated team that will be available to you
    seven days a week. You can rest assured knowing that all of your questions
    will be answered and you will be updated through every step of the
    transaction. You also can expect Weekly Activity Reports that include how
    many hits your listing has gained from the internet, TV advertising, and
    feedback we’ve received from the buyers. When you’re ready to sell your
    home, give the Roth Team a call or send us an email.'
