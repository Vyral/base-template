  about_markdown: |
   Many people meet doctors only after they've lost their health. Dr. Q has a purpose to educate as many families as possible towards optimal health and wellness through chiropractic and wellness lifestyle education, coaching and role-modeling. Ideally this would begin even before health is lost.
   Dr. Q's message is that you must eat, move and think right and be spiritually connected to express 100% of your God-given potential.  Health talks presented by Dr. Q describe living a wellness lifestyle -- eating right, moving right, and thinking right.  He has created and taught customized workouts to help improve the overall fitness level of his patients, with ages ranging from 12 to 90.
   <br><br>
   Through this experience Dr. Ho became a team leader not just for his staff, but also for his community.  He led his team and patients to better health through wellness lectures, group exercise classes, and most importantly through role modeling because he believe and practice what he preach.  He looks forward to bringing unique and advanced chiropractic care to the people of San Antonio.
   Dr. Ho's life purpose is to help people achieve a better quality of life.  He shares Pinnacle Wellness' vision to be the best health coach to as many families as possible and to bring this type of healthcare to the forefront of our healthcare system here in San Antonio.
