  about_markdown: |
    Dave Knight, our CEO &amp; Listing Specialist, started his career in real estate back in 2007 and quickly became a top-producing Agent at Keller Williams. Since then, he’s cultivated a cohesive and successful team that relies on hard work, intellect, and a strong customer service focus to deliver the best experience for our clients.

    While yes, we buy and sell hundreds of homes, our biggest priority is the people we help. Our aim to “always come from contribution,” meaning we strive to provide value to our clients every step of the way and make sure they are being listened to and respected. Our unique team approach means there is literally a team of people dedicated to answering your questions, keeping you well informed, and getting you the best deal possible.
