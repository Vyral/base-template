      about_markdown: >-
       Akili is an Executive Tax Recruiter with a background in Career Coaching, Learning & Development, and Management. Over time she has discovered many ways we (unintentionally) put barriers in our paths to success, and she enjoys helping candidates experience breakthroughs in those areas. Thirteen years ago she became certified in coaching, and has since helped hundreds of individuals tap into their gifts and talents.

       Akili has developed Career Development programs for corporations, in which leaders felt ineffective and employees didn’t feel connected. By introducing simple techniques to enhance communication, assess strengths, and reallocate human resources, she has witnessed an increase in employee engagement and a decline in compliance infractions.

       Her motto is, “Everything good lies on the other side of fear”, and even at the executive levels she has to remind her candidates to lean into their fears instead of moving away from them. Clients must also be reminded to take chances, and deviate from the hiring practices of the past. This all comes with the development of relationships and trust, and she prides herself on being a Rockstar in both areas!
