    Lee is a 37-year native of Baltimore and has a great passion for Real
    Estate. Having worked in the sales industry for more than 25 years, and with
    80% of his business from referrals, he is known for following through and
    getting the job done. To prove it, he guarantees that if he doesn't get your
    home sold, he'll buy it. His goal is to ease the stress of your buying and
    selling experience by accompanying you through every step of the process.


    Lee has successfully served over 500 families in the last six years, and
    believes that any time is the right time to buy or sell if you have a
    skilled professional to serve you. He values education and devotes his time
    to keeping up with industry trends by regularly attending industry
    conferences, and has obtained a number of professional designations. Whether
    it's marketing, writing contracts, managing short sales, or negotiating
    complicated contracts, Lee is your guy.


    January 2018 will mark 12 years in the real estate business for Lee. In
    those 12 years Lee and his team have successfully helped over 2,400 people
