      about_markdown: >
        Eric launched his real estate career in 2002 when he moved from Montreal
        to Vancouver, BC. He started on a successful real estate team in the
        role of a buyer agent. In 2009, he transitioned from the team and went
        independent. In his first year as an independent agent, he sold 114
        homes and was top 1% of the industry year after year.


        In 2012, Eric joined forces with his wife, Juliana, where he lead the
        team as the Rainmaker and Lead Listing agent to bring the group to over
        160 sales in 2015 of over $80M in volume. Eric constantly supports his
        wife, Juliana, and co-OP's the market centre business.
