  about_markdown: |
    I'm passionate about Gulf Coast Florida living. The weather, the beaches—it's a lifestyle that's only possible in a climate that encourages year-round outdoor living. I knew many years ago I wanted to live in Florida and finally made the move from New Jersey in 2004. I get it, it's a big move—a big deal. This blog will help you sort out the "where to" and "how to" questions that I know you are asking. Make The Move To Florida will help you get to know the Gulf Coast from Tampa Bay to Charlotte Harbor—the Suncoast communities. I'll keep you up to date on the local real estate market, plus I’ll go over "how to" financial strategies. It's my passion to share this beautiful place with you.<br><br>
    When you are ready to "Make The Move to Florida," my real estate team at Wendy Sells Florida will make it happen. They are the coastal real estate pros. Wendy knows how to get the deals done for out-of-town buyers. Her clients enjoy personalized concierge service and exceptional results.
