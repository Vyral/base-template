    The Realty One Group Legacy mission is to “Inspire & Empower people to
    create a better life through real estate!” and they are doing this with
    John’s support and guidance. In December of 2016, John and his operations
    team launched this company with a vision to become the largest residential
    real estate brokerage in the Delaware Valley by living this mission. Realty
    One Group Legacy is a thriving group of agents building their businesses and
    teams with John’s support and mentoring. John works to consistently increase
    his knowledge so that he is able to help other agents reach their goals and
    serve their clients to the best of their ability. John’s personal mission is
    to help as many people as he can to reach their personal goals by improving
    their businesses. This benefits agents, buyers, sellers, and investors
    alike. With his dedication to learning and sharing, John stays connected
    with the industry through his affiliation with the Realtor Association,
    Realty One Group, and Real Estate B-School Boardroom (a mastermind group of
    elite agents from around the country with similar values and missions.) If
    you are an agent looking for a place to create a successful business through
    sustainable systems and with incredible support, contact John Meulstee at
    Realty One Group Legacy today. “By freely giving and sharing everything I
    have learned in this business and by bringing on top quality people and
    agents, Realty One Group Legacy will have the most powerful sales force in
    every market we enter.” - John Meulstee
