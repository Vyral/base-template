    Philipp Fries



    In 2008 I moved to Tampa from Dusseldorf, Germany to pursue my MBA at the
    University of Tampa. I have always been passionate about experiencing the
    customs and people in other parts of the world, so I jumped at the
    opportunity to relocate. Here I fell in love with Floridian culture and my
    wife Michele. Since then, we have had a beautiful baby and begun a wonderful
    life, and now a business, together.



    Before I began my career in real estate, my professional background centered
    heavily on customer-relationship management, as well as sales and marketing
    for companies such as 3M, AAA-Auto Club South, and Air Berlin. My love for
    interpersonal interactions and the opportunity to work with people of all
    different backgrounds is what has propelled me through my various careers,
    and ultimately led me to real estate.



    <br>Michele Dupree



    Born and raised right here in Tampa, I have a deep seeded love for the
    community, from running on Bayshore, to trying to local restaurants, to
    Lightning games with our whole family. Now, as a new mother, I understand
    just how important finding the right home for a family here can be. I have
    over ten years of experience in the mortgage industry and have specialized in
    business analytics, management, and negotiations, making me well equipped to
    handle all of your real estate needs. Like Philipp, I have a passion for
    working with others, not to mention shopping, both of which come in handy
    when helping our clients search for the perfect home at the perfect
    price.&nbsp;

    everyday work ethic at every turn; our number one goal is to help our clients
    find their happiness. We guarantee that we will do everything in our power to
