  about_markdown: >
    My name is Trudy Coler and I am a full-time, full-service realtor serving the
    Portland, Or marketplace including the surrounding communities of Beaverton,
    Hillsboro, Tigard, Tualatin, West Linn and Lake Oswego. I left over 25 years
    in the corporate world to pursue my dream of taking care of my wonderful
    sellers and buyers as they relocate, downsize, make their first purchase,
    sell and buy their dream house and all of the other things that happen with
    families and home as life happens. My goal is to provide valuable information
    on properties and the process of buying or selling a home and my work is not
    done at closing time. I want you to think of me as a resource for all your
    home and life needs â€“ plumber, electrician, handyman, painter, babysitter,
    dogsitter, housesitter and more!
