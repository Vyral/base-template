    Energy, experience, integrity and the calm efficiency to complete
    transactions smoothly. Those are the hallmarks of a professional. A
    professional you want on your side. Always FOCUSED on our clients, bringing
    hands on experience beyond the normal negotiation of real estate sales. That
    breadth of knowledge spans both residential and commercial properties. We
    have been a principal in a variety of projects, including entitlement of
    vacant land, development of luxury residential neighborhoods, multi-family,
    rehab of existing structures, as well as the acquisition and re-positioning
    of distressed properties. As an active real estate investor, we are frequent
    key note speakers on real estate. We constantly monitor rapidly changing
    market statistics. Local knowledge combined with proven strategies for
    marketing properties is our companies hallmark.
