  about_markdown: |
    Willie Miranda began his real estate career in the Capital Region in 1998 with Coldwell Banker. He left there and went to work for RE/MAX Premier until 2002, at which time he decided to go out on his own and established Miranda Real Estate Group, Inc. in July of 2002.

    This decision was made by Willie’s desire and vision “To help the best agents in our region build a business while making it hassle-free to our clients.” His innovative and progressive approach to real estate has been the driving force behind the continued expansion and success of his unique "Sales Team Systems.”
    
    Willie is a Certified Trainer of the Brian Buffini "100 Days To Greatness" and "Peak Producers" program. He is also a member of an elite group of the Top Realtors in the Country and a Master Trainer and Coach for the Craig Proctor "Quantum Leap System". Miranda Real Estate Group, Inc. has won the Albany Business Reviews "Best Places To Work" Award multiple times over the past few years. Willie was also a recipient of the Business Reviews 2006, “40 Under Forty" award.
