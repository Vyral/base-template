    Nate Martinez, REALTOR®, Owner, Team Leader, Master Coach, International
    Bestselling Author, Coach, ABR, CRS, GRI, e-PRO, CDPE, CIAS, CLHMS, CRP, and
    SFR

    Nate Martinez is the owner of RE/MAX Professionals, a multi-office franchise
    located in the greater Phoenix area and the owner of a Motto Mortgage
    franchise. The highlight of running his business and team is getting to work
    in the trenches every day with the love of his life and his adult children.
    In 2021, he co-authored an international bestselling book, 8 Ways to
    Dominate Any Real Estate Market with long-time business partner, team member
    and friend, Sarah Michelle Bliss.

    Nate passionately believes in the value of education, having trained
    hundreds of real estate professionals across the globe as a speaker and a
    coach. With more than thirty-five years in the real estate industry, he has
    been recognized with the Lifetime Achievement, Titan Team, Circle of
    Legends, and the Luminary of Distinction from RE/MAX. But with all these
    achievements, Nate’s focus has always been giving back to this industry and
    now focuses much of his time on helping agents discover their potential and
    ultimately live their best life.

    He is most proud of the charitable contributions of his agents to the
    Children’s Miracle Network and the support of their local Phoenix Children’s
    Hospital. In addition, he is proud to be ranked the number one brokerage in
    Arizona when it comes to production per agent.

    Outside of work, Nate enjoys golfing and spending quality time around the
    pool with his adult children and their spouses, his confidant Tonya, their
    daughter, Mila, and three grandchildren.
