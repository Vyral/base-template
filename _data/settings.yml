  about_markdown: |
    Kelly’s personal experience as a student athlete & collegiate football coach has provided valuable insight and experience that propelled him in the real estate industry. As a student-athlete, Kelly played football at the University of Nebraska, participating on the offensive side of the ball at both Quarterback and Wide Receiver. During his tenure at the University of Nebraska, Kelly competed in two BCS Bowls, one Conference Championship game, and one National Championship game. After the conclusion of his football playing career and graduation from the University of Nebraska, Kelly served on the coaching staff at Nebraska and Ole Miss.

    In 2005, Kelly decided to take the skill set he acquired competing in collegiate athletics and apply it to the real estate industry here in Arizona. Leadership, integrity, and work ethic are the core competencies of Kelly Cook and the Kelly Cook Real Estate Group. These simple, yet profound intangibles have turned Kelly Cook Real Estate Group into one of the largest and successful Short Sale Teams in Arizona. If you are looking for a real estate agent that enjoys the challenge of negotiating with your bank, then you have arrived at the correct place. Kelly has helped hundreds of homeowners successfully short sale their homes and help set them up with a game plan moving forward to ensure they are able to purchase another home just as soon as they are eligible. Whatever your end goals are, we can help you fulfill that exit strategy and will do whatever it takes to make sure you become a satisfied client for life!
