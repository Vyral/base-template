      about_markdown: |
        Fluent in English & Cantonese Juliana is a BC native and is proud to be the first generation of her family born in Canada. She has always felt a strong connection to the local way of life-perfect harmony with the community. Juliana's parents always encouraged her to explore her opportunities and she began playing the piano at the age of five. She later went onto become a professional piano teacher and then after having her own children, started her own business, Birth & Beyond Total Child Development. Being a firm believer of infant stimulation, Juliana taught new parents to stimulate baby's brain soon after they are born by optimizing their mental, sensorial, social and affective development. Juliana is dedicated and strongly believes in lifelong learning.
