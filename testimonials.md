Just as the housing market was beginning to feel the effects of the recession, we decided to sell our home. At the recommendation of a colleague, we hired Chris. We were not disappointed. Chris helped us decide on a fair asking price which resulted in a couple good offers. Within three months the house sold. Even after the closing date, when an issue arose, Chris's experience and expertise helped quickly resolve the issue. We would hire Chris again without reservations.
