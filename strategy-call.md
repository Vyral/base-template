<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>We’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales.</p>

<p><strong>We know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</strong></p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, we’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

<p>We are The Dan Ellison Team and we sold 57 homes in 2017.</p>

<p>We want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>We’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. We're happy to offer our insight on what we would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>We also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate and sales.</p>

<p>Once we understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc.), we’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who want to sell their home who list with you.</p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why are we offering this?</p>

<p>We’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working at our team/brokerage.</p>

<p>Let us be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>We also figure we’ll do business together someday and we would like to get to know you. We enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and we love it.</p>

<p><strong>We invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with us.</strong>​ We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too. We have a questionnaire we would like you fill out so that when we meet so we're prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, we’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Dan Ellison</p>
