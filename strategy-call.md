<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales. </p>

<p>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

<p>My name is Jennie Wolek and I’ve sold over a thousand homes. </p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>I will also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate leads and sales. </p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who will list their home with you. </p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p><span class="quote">My biggest a-ha is from using Jennie's guidance in class to discover my why and form my own personal mission statement. It was sooo revealing and I have come back to it many times since class. It gives me more clarity and is like a rudder in my business decisions. The scripts and other tips and tricks were amazing, too.</span><br>
<span class="author">- Missy Webb, Norman, OK Agent</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">FAIL FORWARD! I love how Jennie is open and courageous about sharing some of her failures and how she is getting through them. It's easy to get the impression that successful people/agents no longer fail. Hearing her talk about the failures she is working through gives me the the best perspective on my failures and reinforces that failures are really just great stepping stones on the way to success, and that every failure I get through just makes me a better person and agent.</span><br>
<span class="author">- Chandra Hall, Tulsa, OK, Agent</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">My a-ha was that Jennie was in a similar position as me just a few years ago and she got real and intentional with her database and monumental growth occurred. It is always great to hear and learn from other agents on the same journey with ideas that can be realistically implemented.</span><br>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>I’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working with our organization. </p>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me. We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you to fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Jennie Wolek</p>
