<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>We’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales.</p>

<p><strong>We know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</strong></p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, we’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

{% include strategy-photos.html %}

<p>Our names our Shawn O'Neill and Dan Stephenson and we’ve sold over a thousand homes to date.</p>

<p>We want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>We’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. We're happy to offer my insight on what we would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>We also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate and sales.</p>

<p>Once we understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), we’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who want to sell their home who list with you.</p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s some stories about a few agents working with me…</p>

<p><span class="quote">One of our new agents wanted to replace her income. She joined two other companies before us and worked her sphere and did events. She barely made enough money to pay her mortgage. She was working a full-time job for part-time income. After joining us, she made $80,000 within her first year.</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">Another one of our agents worked for the different team and then went out on his own. He eventually joined our team and made over $40,000 in his first six months.</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">Finally, another agent was working 20 hours a week part-time and he made $45,000. We were able to connect with him on a deeper level about what he wants to do. This year, he is on track to do 40 or 50 transactions and make over $150,000.</span></p>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why are we offering this?</p>

<p>We’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working on our team.</p>

<p>Let us be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>We also figure we’ll do business together someday and we would like to get to know you. We enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and we love it.</p>

<p><strong>We invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with us.</strong> We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>We have a questionnaire we would like you fill out so that when we meet so we're prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, we’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shawn O'Neill and Dan Stephenson</p>
