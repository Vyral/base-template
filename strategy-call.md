<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>Are you looking for training that teaches you exactly what you need to do to sell homes specifically right here in {{site.data.settings.client.market}}?</p>

<p>I invite you to subscribe to our free real estate agent training newsletter.</p>

<p>Every two weeks, we publish helpful tips for you; which includes:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Real agent success stories</li>
<li>Question and answer videos</li>
<li>Highlights of our team training</li>
<li>Our favorite technology tips</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Our goal is to give you a taste of the training we provide if you have any interest in working with us in the future.</p>

<p><strong>We have no intention of recruiting you</strong> - that’s a conversation with us when you are ready, if at all.</p>

<p>Last year 24,901 homes sold along the Wasatch Front</p>

<p>That’s plenty of business to go around for all of us.</p>

{% include strategy-photos.html %}

<p>We’ve been fortunate to sell nearly 300 homes last year and our average agent earns $87,000 a year with us their first full year and over $130,000 in their second full year.</p>

<p>The same training they get will help you do it as well.</p>

<p>So, if you’re interested in knowing what we’re up to here, and you’d like to stay current on the latest strategies to:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Generate qualified seller leads</li>
<li>Attract buyers who actually want to buy</li>
<li>Convert more leads to appointments</li>
<li>Win more listing presentations at full commission</li>
<li>Systematize your administrative processes</li>
<li>Earn more referrals and reviews for repeat business</li>
</ol></p>

<p>…I invite you to subscribe to our free newsletter below.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p><span class="quote">You won’t find better management or a more caring group of people,  when you join the team they genuinely want you to succeed and their systems and training are 100% focused on getting you there</span><br>
<span class="author">Justin Acheson</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">What I love most about being on the Stern Team is having access to a vast resource of people who have been in the business for such a long time. I love the training, education and information daily, it’s priceless. </span><br>
<span class="author">Jacquie Reagh</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">Why did I join the Stern Team?  Well, who wouldn’t want to be on the #1 resale team in the State? </span><br>

<p>You are also welcome to subscribe to our Agent Training Podcast on iTunes and we also publish our free training content on our agent training Facebook page if you prefer to stay touch that way, too.</p>

<p>Most importantly, everything you receive is designed to start a conversation. So, if you have any questions about selling real estate you can email me at <a href="mailto:Talent@RealEstateCareersInUtah.com">Talent@RealEstateCareersInUtah.com</a>. </p>

<p>I’ll first answer your question by email, and if I think it would be of benefit to more people, I’ll answer it in a video.</p>

<p>We look forward to staying in touch. Let’s raise the standard and training of all real estate agents along the Wasatch Front.</p>
