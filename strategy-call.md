<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales.</p>

<p><strong>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</strong></p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

<p>My name is Joshua Stern and we've sold over 3000 homes in my career.</p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>I also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate and sales.</p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who want to sell their home who list with you.</p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p><span class="quote">I chose to join a busy team for the volume of experience I would gain in a high transaction environment... I figured that with a lot of opportunity for "trial," I would get through a lot of "error" quickly & become better at my trade faster. I wasn't expecting the Team's systematic approach to real estate, though... which meant fantastic detailed training and mentorship right out of the gate. I got up to speed & was able to push past my goals much more quickly than I expected. </span><br>

<p><span class="quote">Onboarding with the stern team was like whirlwind of information and processes that seamed very overwhelming. I knew I wanted to perform on higher level but this blew my mind. But the offset was there was a plan for each and everyday, week and month. The 90 day plan helped me see past the enormous information and process overload, the support coaching and encouragement was nothing I had ever experienced. It made the time fly by and left me with a sense of accomplishment every day I left the office. Now it was time to hit the pavement and start selling homes, again I felt overwhelmed. After completing my first solo listing presentation and GETTING HIRED I then realized shadowing several listing presentations with Lee, Josh and Michael I was much more prepared than I could have imagined. The tools systems and coaching had paid off big time, in the first five months I have listed and sold over 30 homes taking my business and personal life to new heights and milestones. Im very excited to continue my training and plan out my goals for 2019 which will be even more achievable than before.</span><br>

<p><span class="quote">The Joshua Stern team provides you with the tools and opportunities to crush it. There is a plan in place to get you up to speed and producing at a high level.  The plan is thoughtful and systematic, while at the same time flexible enough to focus on areas where you may need more help. In addition we meet as Buyers Agents weekly to train and continuously improve on our skills.  Each morning we run through scripts and scenarios so we our better prepared to capitalize on our prospecting time.  There are great partnerships with vendors who also provide training on Insurance and Lending allowing us to provide a higher level of service to our clients. The Stern team is sincerely interested in providing tools and training so that you can be successful.</span><br>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>I’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working at our brokerage.</p>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p><strong>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me.</strong> We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
