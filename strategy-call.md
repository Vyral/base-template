<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales.</p>

<p><strong>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</strong></p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

{% include strategy-photos.html %}

<p>My name is Dave Friedman and our team sold over 250 homes in 2017.</p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>I also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate and sales.</p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who want to sell their home who list with you.</p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

	<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>


	<img src="/img/olivia.jpg" alt="Olivia Froncillo" class="photo-left"/>
	<p><span class="quote">"After working in many professional settings, I have never felt more appreciated or valued than working with Dave. In a fast-paced environment like real estate, Dave has found a way to make his employees feel supported and challenged while maintaining an incredibly fun workspace."</span><br>
	<span class="author">- Olivia Froncillo</span></p>

	<img src="/img/ellie.jpg" class="photo-left">
	<p><span class="quote">"Working with Dave has  encouraged, inspired, and pushed me to become the best version of myself in every sense! From my work habits and determining my Big Why, to creating a work-life balance, and self improvement in every facet of my life, Dave does it all! My daily outlook and goals have changed tenfold as I have grown more than I ever imagined possible.  Be prepared to triple your goals and push yourself, while making your Big Why your priority!"

	<p><span class="quote">"I had a great career in the corporate world, but I knew I wasn't passionate about my work.  For over ten years, I dreamed of a career in real estate but taking the leap from a secure, salaried position to pursue my dream was such a scary thought.  I believed in myself, but I knew that I needed additional support and strong leadership to ensure my success.  Dave has given me the tools, education, positivity, and accountability I need."</span><br>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>I’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working at our team/brokerage.</p>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p><strong>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me.</strong> We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
