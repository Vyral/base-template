<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales.</p>

<p>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

{% include strategy-photos.html %}

<p>My name is Tom Nickley and we’ve over 600 homes in the last 3 years.</p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>I also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate and sales.</p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who want to sell their home who list with you.</p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p><span class="quote">I am held to an unbelievably high standard when it comes to mindset and accountability on this team.  It has been an absolute game changer for my business</span><br>
<span class="author">- Shaun Ross</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">I would not be where I am in my career had it not been for the outstanding coaching, mentoring, systems & accountability of The Nickley Group</span><br>
<span class="author">- Jeff Wernsing</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">The coaching and training is the best I've ever been exposed to.  I learned more in my first 6 months on the team than I would have in 5 years had I gone elsewhere.</span><br>
<span class="author">- Daniel Geddings</span></p>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>I’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working at our team/brokerage.</p>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me. We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Tom Nickley</p>
