<!-- <h1>DFT Training Program</h1>

<div class="training">
<p>DFT provides an in-house, hands-on training program for all agents that join our team. </p>

<p>Our training program is called the First 100 and it typically takes a candidate around 100 days to complete the training program. You will be given a set of 30 day goals, 60 day goals, and 90 day goals - you are required to meet all goals in order to test out of the training program. </p>

<p>A candidate may get through the training program sooner than 100 days depending on their license status and how focused they are on achieving their goals. </p>

<p>If you do not hold an active South Carolina Real Estate License when you join the team, you will need to complete training and the pre-licensing courses through the State at the same time. There’s an option to complete the 90-hour pre-licensing requirements during the evenings. In this case you will train with us during the day and take it upon yourself to complete the pre-licensing courses in order to obtain your license. </p>

<p>The training program is Monday through Friday, starting at 7:15am with a role-playing phone call with the team. </p>

<p>There is a sales meeting at 7:30am in our office in Mt. Pleasant. </p>

<p>From 8-10am, Monday through Friday, you are required to be in the office and prospecting with the entire team. We have an additional prospecting session on Thursday evenings from 4-6pm. </p>

<p>While in training, you are required to be on the dialer for prospecting for a total of 28 hours per week (this is around 5.6 hours per day!). Once out of training, you are required to prospect for 12 hours per week. </p>

<p>You will be working very closely with our Sales Manager and you’ll have weekly 1-on-1 meetings. You will also be learning from our team of seasoned Buyers Agents who will provide mentorship, knowledge, and experience with you to learn from. </p>

<p>We will show you how to sell real estate! During this training period, you will be doing a lot of scripts practice and role-playing, understanding concepts around the language of real estate, finding motivation in potential clients, converting phone leads into appointments, writing contracts, the proper way to show homes, how to close clients, and we’ll teach you the tips and tricks we’ve used to become the number 1 team in Charleston! </p>

<p>You are paid $2,500 per month during this training period. Once out of the training period, you will be 100% commission. </p>

<p>Our start dates are the 1st and the 15th of the month; if this day falls on a weekend or a company Holiday, it will move to the following day. </p>
