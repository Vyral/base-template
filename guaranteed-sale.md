<p>Would you like an offer on your home?</p>

<p><strong>You can skip the headaches and hassles of selling traditionally.</strong></p>

<p>There's a record amount of capital looking for a place to rest. Companies are ready to make a very competitive offer on your home.</p>

<p>They buy it, turn it around, and sell 30-90 days to the public for a tiny profit.</p>

<p><strong>You get convenience and speed in return.</strong></p>

<p>This means:
<ul class="indent">
  <li>Close Quickly, get equity from your home in as little as 7 days</li>
  <li>You pick your closing date</li>
  <li>No showings or open houses</li>
  <li>No negotiating with buyers</li>
  <li>Skip the cost, time and (in some cases) embarrassment of getting your home market ready</li>
  <li>Freedom to move on your timeline</li>
  <li>No strangers and Realtors walking through your home</li>
  <li>No risk of two mortgage payments</li>
</ul></p>

<p>I know companies who will buy your home directly at a fair price. I will negotiate all offers for you so you get the best price and terms.</p>

<p><strong>Your offer is competitive.</strong> These are not "sharks" who buy your home for 50% of it's value.</p>

<p>Enter your information. I'll be in touch to price your home, get photos taken, and submit it to the companies who will buy it from you.</p>
