They did a fabulous job of making a video of our house to post it so that potential buyers would be able to view our home both inside and outside."

I was able to meet with him on short notice to ask questions and go over the transaction details. But as I look back at the sale what really stood out for me was Dane's willingness to do whatever it took to help me make this run smoothly. In fact he is at the house helping me move things into storage driving his truck down to the location and actually helping me load things up. I don't think it gets any better than that."

Anytime we needed Scott, we worked with Scott for years showing us home. He was always right there. We love Scott, Dane, and the Hollingers. They were there every time we needed them. They would drive clear around the lake anytime we needed them. They were there, seems like they went out of their way. I highly recommend them, and I have been recommending them. We just love them."
