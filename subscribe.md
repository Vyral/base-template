Dear Real Estate Agent,

Are you frustrated with where you’re at in your real estate business?

I’d like to offer you a free subscription to my real estate agent training e-newsletter. You’ll receive:

<ul>
<li>Q&A videos answering the most commonly asked business questions</li>
<li>Interviews with agents in my office on what they are doing to sell homes</li>
<li>Replays of trainings and meetings we hold, that are recorded, so you can attend 24/7</li>
<li>Invites to special events with guest speakers that include exclusive discount codes</li>
<li>Copies of procedure manuals, checklists, and more we use to streamline operations</li>
<li>Market updates we publish that you can copy and paste to use in your marketing</li>
</ul>

This newsletter is specifically for real estate agents who want to grow, learn, and want to dominate their market with a local brand and expert presence. If you want to improve yourself, make more money and you feel you can do more and just need the tools, this is for you. This is not for part-time agents who are happy with their income.

This is 100% educational advice. I’d like you to get to know what we’re up to here so we can grow the size of the real estate pie in Charleston. In the greater Charleston area, there were 17,720 closed sales in 2016. The Dave Friedman Team sold 212 homes in 2016, so there is plenty of business to go around. So far in 2017, we've closed 223.

SPECIAL NEW SUBSCRIBER BONUS

When you subscribe, you’ll also receive a free copy of my Office Tour DVD so you can see how our office is set up, who does what, and what’s it like to work in a productive real estate office.

Feel free to unsubscribe anytime. We will never, ever, ever spam you.

The next step, after subscribing to our newsletter, is to attend one of our many Business Planning Workshops we hold from time to time, with the opportunity to schedule a free business planning meeting where we’ll personalize the plan for you.

I invite you to subscribe below. Simply enter your email address and you’ll get a confirmation email with a copy of my Office Tour DVD.

Email me at <a href="mailto:Dave@DaveFriedmanTeam.com">Dave@DaveFriedmanTeam.com</a> with any questions I can answer for you in my videos. If I pick your question and answer it in the newsletter, I’ll send you a $5 Amazon gift card!

Let’s help you grow your business.

Dave Friedman
