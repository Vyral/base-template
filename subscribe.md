<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>Are you looking for training that teaches you exactly what you need to do to sell homes specifically right here in Providence?</p>

<p>I invite you to subscribe to our free real estate agent training newsletter.</p>

<p>Every two weeks, we publish helpful tips for you; which includes:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Real agent success stories</li>
<li>Question and answer videos</li>
<li>Highlights of our team training</li>
<li>Our favorite technology tips</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Our goal is to give you a taste of the training we provide if you have any interest in working with us in the future.</p>

<p><strong>We have no intention of recruiting you</strong> - that’s a conversation with us when you are ready, if at all.</p>

<p>Last year 11,282 homes sold in the greater Providence market.</p>

<p>That’s plenty of business to go around for all of us.</p>

<p>We’ve been fortunate to sell over 200 homes last year and our average agent earns 120k a year with us.</p>

<p>The same training they get will help you do it as well.</p>

<p>So, if you’re interested in knowing what we’re up to here, and you’d like to stay current on the latest strategies to:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Generate qualified seller leads</li>
<li>Attract buyers who actually want to buy</li>
<li>Convert more leads to appointments</li>
<li>Win more listing presentations at full commission</li>
<li>Systematize your administrative processes</li>
<li>Earn more referrals and reviews for repeat business</li>
</ol></p>

<p>…I invite you to subscribe to our free newsletter below.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s what a few agents say about our free training:</strong></p>

<p class="indent">“Before going to Guy's training I had an "okay" idea of what my business should look like and how I should be running it. Let me tell you, I was completely off. Guy helped me understand what really matters in real estate and explained exactly what I need to do improve my business.” <br> <span class="testimonial-author">- Chris</span></p>

<p class="indent">“I've been to a few of Guy's training events and I have to say his system just works. He is full of strategies that have helped explode my business.” <br> <span class="testimonial-author">- Steve</span></p>

<p class="indent">“I was about to quit right before I ended up in a seat in front of Guy. My real estate business was just dragging along and I was never able to find any consistency. I came full of questions and he was able to answer every single one of them. After I left the training, I immediately put Guy's plan to work and I haven't had a bad month since!” <br> <span class="testimonial-author">- Tony</span></p>
