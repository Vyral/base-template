Dear Real Estate Agent:

1. Real agent success stories&nbsp;

2. Question and answer videos

3. Highlights of our team training

4. Our favorite technology tips

Our goal is to give you a taste of the training we provide if you have any interest in working with us in the future.

**We have no intention of recruiting you** - that’s a conversation with us when you are ready, if at all.

That being said, if you’re interested in knowing what we’re up to here, and you’d like to stay current on the latest strategies to:

1. Generate qualified seller leads&nbsp;

2. Attract buyers who actually want to buy&nbsp;

3. Convert more leads to appointments&nbsp;

4. Win more listing presentations at full commission&nbsp;

5. Systematize your administrative processes&nbsp;

6. Earn more referrals and reviews for repeat business&nbsp;

…I invite you to subscribe to our free newsletter below.

Most importantly, everything you receive is designed to start a conversation. So, if you have any questions about selling real estate you can email me at&nbsp;[Jennie@TheWolekGroup.com](mailto:Jennie@TheWolekGroup.com){: target="_blank"}

I’ll first answer your question by email, and if I think it would be of benefit to more people, I’ll answer it in a video.&nbsp;

We look forward to staying in touch. Let’s raise the standard and training of all real estate agents, especially in the area.&nbsp;
