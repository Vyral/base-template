<p><strong>We have no intention of recruiting you</strong> - that’s a conversation with us when you are ready, if at all.</p>

<p>Last year 14,000 homes sold in the greater Des Moines market.</p>

<p>That’s plenty of business to go around for all of us.</p>

<p>We’ve been fortunate to sell 320+ homes last year and our average agent earns $65,000 a year with us.  Our top team agents earn $125,000+, with NO EXPENSES.</p>

<p>The same training they get will help you do it as well.</p>
