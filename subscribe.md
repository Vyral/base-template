<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>Are you looking for training that teaches you exactly what you need to do to sell homes specifically right here in {{site.data.settings.client.market}}?</p>

<p>I invite you to subscribe to our free real estate agent training newsletter.</p>

<p>Every two weeks, we publish helpful tips for you. These include:
<ol class="indent">

</ol></p>

<p>Our goal is to give you a taste of the training we provide if you have any interest in working with us in the future.</p>

<p><strong>We have no intention of recruiting you</strong> - that’s a conversation with us when you are ready, if at all.</p>

<p>Last year 45,752 homes sold in the greater Wasatch Front market.</p>

<p>That’s plenty of business to go around for all of us.</p>

<p>We’ve been fortunate to sell 300 homes last year and our average agent earns over $100,000 a year with us.</p>

<p>The same training they get will help you do it as well.</p>

<p>So, if you’re interested in knowing what we’re up to here, and you’d like to stay current on the latest strategies to:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Generate qualified seller leads</li>

<p><strong>Here’s what a few agents say about our free training:</strong></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"I chose to join a busy team for the volume of experience I would gain in a high transaction environment... I figured that with a lot of opportunity for "trial," I would get through a lot of "error" quickly & become better at my trade faster. I wasn't expecting the Team's systematic approach to real estate, though... which meant fantastic detailed training and mentorship right out of the gate. I got up to speed & was able to push past my goals much more quickly than I expected."<span class="testimonial-author">  - Maritta</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"Onboarding with the stern team was like whirlwind of information and processes that seemed very overwhelming. I knew I wanted to perform on a higher level but this blew my mind. But the offset was there was a plan for each and every day, week and month. The 90-day plan helped me see past the enormous information and process overload, the support coaching and encouragement was nothing I had ever experienced. It made the time fly by and left me with a sense of accomplishment every day I left the office. Now it was time to hit the pavement and start selling homes, again I felt overwhelmed. After completing my first solo listing presentation and GETTING HIRED I then realized shadowing several listing presentations with Lee, Josh and Michael I was much more prepared than I could have imagined. The tools systems and coaching had paid off big time, in the first five months I have listed and sold over 30 homes taking my business and personal life to new heights and milestones. I'm very excited to continue my training and plan out my goals for 2019 which will be even more achievable than before."<span class="testimonial-author">  - Jeremy</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"The Joshua Stern team provides you with the tools and opportunities to crush it. There is a plan in place to get you up to speed and producing at a high level. The plan is thoughtful and systematic, while at the same time flexible enough to focus on areas where you may need more help. In addition, we meet as Buyers Agents weekly to train and continuously improve on our skills. Each morning we run through scripts and scenarios so we our better prepared to capitalize on our prospecting time. There are great partnerships with vendors who also provide training on Insurance and Lending allowing us to provide a higher level of service to our clients. The Stern team is sincerely interested in providing tools and training so that you can be successful."<span class="testimonial-author">  - Ken</span></p>
