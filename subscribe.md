<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>Are you looking for training that teaches you exactly what you need to do to sell homes specifically right here in Houston?</p>

<p>I invite you to subscribe to our free real estate agent training newsletter.</p>

<p>Every two weeks, we publish helpful tips for you. These include:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Real agent success stories</li>
<li>Question and answer videos</li>
<li>Highlights of our team training</li>
<li>Our favorite technology tips</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Our goal is to give you a taste of the training we provide if you have any interest in working with us in the future.</p>

<p>We have no intention of recruiting you - that’s a conversation with us when you are ready, if at all.</p>

<p>According to the latest report produced by the Houston Association of Realtors (HAR), sales of all property types in 2017 totaled 94,726 units, a 3.5-percent increase over 2016’s volume, which was 91,530. Total dollar volume for single-family homes sold in 2017 rose 6.5 percent to $23 billion.</p>

<p>That’s plenty of business to go around for all of us.</p>

<p>So, if you’re interested in knowing what we’re up to here, and you’d like to stay current on the latest strategies to:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Generate qualified seller leads</li>

<p><strong>Here’s what a few agents say about our free training:</strong></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">“As a team leader, I love that my team members get trained by the brokerage, and the training is world-class!” <br><span class="testimonial-author">- Adam Olsen</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">“I’m generating dozens of free buyer and seller leads every week using the Social Media training I received at Abby Realty. I love it!” <br><span class="testimonial-author">- Michelle Eubanks</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">“I joined Abby Realty as a brand new agent four weeks ago. I’ve already put six properties under contract and am about to land a $3.5 million dollar listing. At every step in the process, from marketing my services, to filling out contracts, to inputing listings into the MLS, I’ve gotten all the training and broker support I could possibly need.” <br><span class="testimonial-author">- Jannie Jonker</span></p>
