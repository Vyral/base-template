Here in Tucson in particular, February through June are our strongest months. If you’re a seller, how can you maximize your sale price while minimizing your costs?&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Let’s start with maximizing your sale price. <b>Your home must give a strong first impression,</b> and that first impression starts outside on the street where people pull up in their cars. The front yard landscaping, the front entry, and your home’s exterior painting all contribute significantly to your home’s curb appeal.&nbsp;</div><div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">The earlier a house sells, the higher the price it generally sells for. </div></div><div style="text-align: left;">Once you get inside the house, the carpeting, flooring, and windows all need to be clean. Layer on a fresh coat of paint if possible. Making these areas look spotless might seem like a nuisance, but doing it will help your house sell quicker. The earlier a house sells in its listing period, the higher the price it generally sells for.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">What about minimizing your costs? Not many sellers do this, but <b>we recommend getting your home inspected.</b> Have a home inspector go through your home with a fine-toothed comb so you can repair any items with a vendor of your choice. You lose a lot of cost control if you let the buyer do their own inspection after you’re under contract and select which vendors to use.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"></div><div style="text-align: left;">Whether you’re a buyer or a seller looking to make a move in our market, please give us a call so we can help you out.
