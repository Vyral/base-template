<p>Wow...this is crazy to say but I feel so fortunate, blessed and forever grateful that I’ve had the opportunity to have Shawn in my life. (It’s only crazy to say because when I started coaching I was very skeptical at what could really happen). What started out as Real Estate Coaching has turned into something far greater than I could’ve ever imagined. Shawn is seriously one of the best guys I have ever had the opportunity to learn from. If you are in or thinking about getting into Real Estate and have the opportunity to work with, for, or be coached by this man do it!!!</p>

<p>The amount of value I have received from 30 minute phone calls with Shawn is invaluable and has forever changed the trajectory of my life. If it wasn’t for the fact that I am all the way up in Wisconsin I would be working with Shawn down in Jacksonville and I wouldn’t hesitate to close my Business down and work with him if that was the case. My personal experiences with Shawn were great as it related to Real Estate and making sure I’m doing the right things in the right order but it was more his heart and the conversations we had about thinking bigger and reaching for more in all areas of my life. He just provided and gave more than I can ever repay him for and I will forever be grateful for the time he spent with me and still does to this day! More than anything I’m grateful to call him my Friend!</p>

<p>Shawn is going to make a positive impact on your life, just be open to seeing things a different way and expanding you vision for what is possible for you. There is no better person, in my mind, to be associated with than Shawn. With that said if you’re looking for more in all areas of your life, more than just another real estate deal, more than just getting by, more than just being ok with the status quo, take the time to meet with this Man. Even if you don’t work with him he will give you more value than you could ever imagine.</p>


<p>Shawn my brother!!! I have gone through so many different programs for coaching and talking with hundreds of people, and out of them all you’re truly the only one I call a friend, I appreciate you and am here for you. I know you’re going to make a positive impact on the lives of anyone who comes into your circle/sphere. Keep up the good work and God bless.</p>
