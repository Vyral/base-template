  Today we’re taking a break from the normal real estate talk to share another
  wonderful endorsement our team received. This time, it’s from Tommy and Joe
  Johnson of the popular “Johnson & Johnson” morning radio show on K-Bull 93.3
  FM. Tommy and Joe have been on the air for two decades, so they know a thing
  or two about hard work and dedication. We share their commitment to being the
  best at what they do, and we’re truly honored to be able to share their
  endorsement with you today. To hear what they had to say, watch this short
  video.

We’re proud to be able to share another great endorsement for The Josh Stern, this time from Tommy and Joe Johnson of the “Johnson & Johnson” morning radio show.

**Here’s a snippet of what they had to say:**

“Josh sells a home, on average, almost two months faster than the average agent, and there’s no risk to working with Joshua. He offers a no-hassle cancellation policy so if you’re not happy with the service you receive, you’re free to get out of the contract. But don’t worry—you’re not going to do that, because they really are going to sell your home.”

It’s true—we offer a cancellation policy that guarantees if you’re not happy with the level of service you receive from us, you can pull your listing at anytime. We’re confident we will sell your home, though. As we’ve said before, we know Salt Lake city and Wasatch Front real estate, and we know how to get results in these markets.

If you have any questions for us or you’re looking to buy, sell, or invest in Salt Lake City real estate, give us a call or send us an email. We’d be happy to help you.
