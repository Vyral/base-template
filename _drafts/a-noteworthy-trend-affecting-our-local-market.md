<center>Buyers from across the country are migrating over to our area, and it’s impacting buyers and sellers in different ways.</center>

“What’s the latest news regarding our Metro Phoenix market?” That question has come up a lot lately, so today we’ll take a look at the numbers.

More than anything else, **population growth in our area is astronomically high**. According to AZCentral.com, Maricopa County’s population grew by 81,000 residents between July 2017 and July 2018. I should note that the metro area includes some parts of Pinal County and Maricopa County, so when you look at the area as a whole, the population boom is even larger.

**What does that mean for real estate?**

Well, as scores of buyers from higher-priced markets in California, Illinois, and New Jersey migrate to Arizona and bid on our inventory, home prices steadily increase. **While this is welcome news for sellers, buyers are left with fewer options as their affordability goes down**.

Our market is changing and is wildly competitive, so whether you’re a buyer or seller, it’s all the more important to have a real estate professional by your side, guiding you through the process.
