<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Late last year<b> the Fed met and raised interest rates for the first time in years.</b> It was a small increase, but what many people don't understand is that even small interest rate increases have a huge impact on affordability.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>We're predicting interest rates to rise slowly over the course of 2016</b>&nbsp;as the market continues to stabilize. Inventory is down and home values will continue to rise. Additionally, on-the-fence buyers are going to enter the market in order to make a purchase before rates increase significantly.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>It all comes down to supply and demand when it comes to the pricing of homes. </b>We already have a low inventory, and we're expecting an influx of buyers trying to avoid high interest rates. This is a perfect storm for sellers in our area; <b>your home's value will likely be at a premium in 2016!&nbsp;</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If you have any thoughts of selling your home this year, now is the time to start looking into the process.
