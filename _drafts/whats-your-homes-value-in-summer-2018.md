Summer is here, which means the high season for real estate. If you've been thinking of selling your home, you might be in for a golden moment.<br><br>**However, it might not last long.** Let me explain why, with a few details about the current real estate market.<br><br>Right now, homes are selling in record time. This May, it took just 34 days on average for a home to go under contract, which broke last year's record of 36 days.<br><br>Home prices also continue to rise. In fact, they've been rising for six straight years. For the past two years, this growth has been accelerating. **As a consequence, 27.6% of the homes sold in May sold above their list price.**<br><br>All of this is due to a woefully short supply of homes on the market. In fact, the total supply of homes is 5.4% lower this year than it was at the same time last year.<br><br>However, **the real estate market might be on the cusp of change.** Mortgage rates have been rising, and now stand near their highest levels in seven years. As a result, pending home sales were down as of April. More alarmingly, we saw a drop in customers touring homes for the first time in 27 months.<br><br>What's going on? The home price surge might be nearing its end. **Overall, home affordability is dropping:** Over the past 6 years, there has been a 48% increase in average home prices, while wages increased only 14%. Wage growth has not kept pace with home affordability and we saw the results of that in April.<br><br>While some sellers are still managing to sell at higher prices than listed, nearly a quarter of sellers actually had to lower their prices this April. What does this mean for you?<br><br>**If you do decide to sell right now, you would have an easy time of it, and you could get top dollar for your home.** If you decide to wait, things might go south quickly. That’s because the market may be reaching the limits of price growth and may be stalled by higher mortgage rates.
