Summer is here, which means the high season for real estate. If you've been thinking of selling your home, **you might be in for a golden moment.**

However, **it might not last long.** Let me explain why, with a few details of the current real estate market.&nbsp;

Right now, **homes are selling in record time.** This May, it took just 34 days on average for a home to go under contract, which broke last year's record of 36 days.

**Home prices also continue to rise.** In fact, they've been rising for six straight years. For the past two years, this growth has been accelerating. As a consequence, 27.6% of the homes sold in May sold above their list price.

All of this is due to a woefully **short supply of homes on the market.** In fact, the total supply of homes is 5.4% lower this year than it was at the same time last year.&nbsp;

However, **the real estate market might be on the cusp of change.** Mortgage rates have been rising, and now stand near their highest levels in seven years. As a result, pending home sales were down as of April. A recent Redfin survey also found a drop in customers touring homes for the first time in 27 months.

What's going on? The **home price surge might be nearing its end.** Overall, home affordability is dropping: Over the past 6 years, there has been a 48% increase in average home prices, while wages increased only 14%.&nbsp;

While some sellers are still managing to sell at higher prices than listed, nearly a quarter of sellers actually had to lower their prices this April.&nbsp;

**If you do decide to sell right now, you would have an easy time of it,** and you could get top dollar for your home. That's because demand and prices are both still high.&nbsp;

If you decide to wait, things might go south quickly. That’s because **the market may be reaching the limits of price growth** and may be stalled by higher mortgage rates.&nbsp;

If you want to take advantage of current conditions by buying or selling a home any time in the near future, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
