Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the process of showing homes has had to change.

During this stay-at-home period, real estate is considered an essential business, which means we can still operate by listing, showing, buying, and selling real estate. However, we do have to follow certain guidelines to keep our agents and clients safe.

For one, home showings must be done by appointment only, and no more than five people will be allowed into a home at a time—only the decision-makers in a family will be allowed in. We’re also **asking sellers to leave the home**, since the fewer people there, the better.

Of course, **we’re also practicing social distancing** by doing our best to remain six feet away from each other when we go into the house, on top of wearing gloves and masks. The buyers will be instructed not to touch any surfaces, and any surfaces that are touched will be cleaned with sanitizing wipes. Furthermore, we’ve been **putting up signs on our listings specifically stating that if the buyer is sick or has symptoms, we don’t want them to enter the premises.**

Another option for sellers is to do virtual showings and listing videos to augment your listing photos. Buyers can then make an offer on your home subject to inspection.

In the end, even though stay-at-home orders have shaken up our process, **you always have options moving forward.**
