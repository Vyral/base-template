<center>This time on “Business Spotlight” we took a trip down to another local favorite: Molli’s Cafe.</center>

On today’s Business Spotlight, we’ll be highlighting another great business on Main Street: Molli’s Cafe.

This awesome local restaurant is one of our absolute favorites, which is why we’re so excited to give you a behind-the-scenes look at it today.

**Molli’s Cafe serves breakfast and lunch here in Westminster Monday through Friday from 7 AM to 3 PM, and on Saturdays from 8 AM to 2 PM.**<br><br>There’s so much about Molli’s Cafe that makes it unique. They’re one of the few places around here to be open on Mondays, and they’re also set apart by their customizable salad bar, which boasts a whopping 24 topping options.

If salad isn’t up-your-alley, they’ve got a number of other great menu items to try. Whether you’re craving a turkey club, a “Great Dane,” or any other cafe favorite, **Molli’s has got something for you**.

But more than just the delicious food offered here, there’s another reason why Molli’s is such a special place to us. Like many of the businesses on Main Street, Molli’s Cafe genuinely cares about giving back to our community.

With all of this in mind, we hope you’ll come out and give Molli’s Cafe a try yourself. **You can learn more about their hours, menu, and location by [visiting their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/American-Restaurant/Mollis-Cafe-1626081601055734/)**.
