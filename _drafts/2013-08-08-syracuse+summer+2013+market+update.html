Welcome to my video real estate blog! <br /><br /><i><b>What’s happening in our current real estate market?</b></i><br /><br />In the beginning of this year, we saw the market taking off. Buyers were finding a lot of homes that they liked and they were buying them.&nbsp; There wasn’t a large amount of inventory for them to choose from, though.<br /><br />Right now, in July, we are seeing the market slow down some.&nbsp; Year-to-date, we are up 2% over last year in the amount of closed transactions. That’s pretty much a flat market. <br /><br />On the national level, we are hearing the market is up 8-12%, that’s not the Syracuse area. We never lead a trend; we always follow.<br /><br />Statistics show that our pending sales are down 10% from last year. Now, I don’t want to be a negative person; that could just be a down month for our market. <br /><br />What we are looking at now, though, is a better July than we had last year. That’s good for us, but we are really seeing a slowing down of buyers.<br /><br />August can be the third slowest month of the year; January and February are the two slowest. Why is this? Kids go back to school; families go on vacation, and a lot of other activities are going on. So, July is a great time to make your real estate move.<br /><br />Thank you for watching! If you have any questions, please give me a call! I’d love to help you out with any of your real estate needs!
