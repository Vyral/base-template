Hurricanes. Blizzards. Wild Fires. Heat Waves. Earthquake. Mud slides.&nbsp; Zombie Apocalypse.

Are you prepared to leave your home on a moment’s notice if one of the events above should happen to you?&nbsp;

Here are a few tips and a list of some of the things you should have ready to go.

Water and food – At least 2 bottles of water per person (in your family). Pack snack bars.

Waterproof map – Don’t expect to have internet or phone service if you get lost.

Cash in small bills – $1 and $5 bills. Credit cards will be useless if the electricity/internet is out.

Copies of important documents – Driver’s license. Passport. Bank account numbers. Homeowner’s insurance policy (copies are sufficient).

Sturdy backpack or rolling suitcase

Batteries and flashlight

Portable cell phone charger

Gloves and goggles

Whistle

Change of clothing

Extra eye glasses or contacts

Toilet paper

Duct tape (fixes about everything)

Pet supplies

These are suggestions from emergency personnel, but only you will know what’s best for you, your family and your area.
