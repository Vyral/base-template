I’ve been with Jeff Cook for over a year now. I left corporate America after struggling to find some sort of work/life balance that also met my financial goals. &nbsp;Today, I’m at Hutchinson Square, where there is beautiful shopping and delicious restaurants—and thanks to Jeff Cook Real Estate, I’ve also sold tons of houses in the area.

I love getting to know my clients and helping to find them a home they love that’s within their budget. **As an agent on Jeff’s team, I’m encouraged to do whatever it takes to give our clients an amazing experience.** I always want to ensure that my clients have a complete understanding of the home they’re considering, so I like to bring my drone on showings. If my clients have a question about the roof, I simply send up the drone to give them a bird’s-eye view and to help them make an informed decision.
