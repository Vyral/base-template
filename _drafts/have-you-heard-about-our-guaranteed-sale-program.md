When I go on listing presentations, I often make recommendations to homeowners about how much their home could sell for. I make this recommendation based on what the home would sell for on its best day and at its full potential.

Many times, people want to know what I would do if this was my home. If my clients are willing to take my advice all the way through the process and we’re on the same page with price, **I will guarantee that we will sell their home for a specific price by a specific date and if I can’t deliver on that, we’ll sell it for free.**

If you’d like to learn more about this program and the advantages it offers you as a Baltimore homeowner, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
