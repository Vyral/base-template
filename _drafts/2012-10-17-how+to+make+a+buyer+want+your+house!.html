We’ve put together  some great tips for home-sellers so you can get the same results you’d  get by hiring a professional staging company.</span><br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Fix Up the Place</span></b><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br />One of the biggest mistakes homeowners make before putting their house  up for sale is to neglect areas in the house that need attention.  <b>Folks,  don’t leave that faulty step unrepaired, only for a potential buyer to  step on, slide off of or worse, get injured on – FIX IT!</b>  You might  think potential buyers won’t notice but they are walking around on your  premises like hawks, noticing each little detail.  The good news is that  they are noticing the first-rate stuff too, so as long as you have the  home’s amenities in order and other major areas in tip-top condition,  you should be in good shape.  Here’s how:<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Get Rid of the Clutter</span></b><br /><br />If you want to successfully sell your house, you need to get those  potential buyers to imagine they already live there.  Too much clutter,  hobby-oriented items or personal possessions that most people may not be  able to identify with, can easily get in the way of that vision.  <b><i>Organize things in stylish storage bins or better yet, have a garage sale before the open house and get rid of unwanted stuff. </i></b> You have to move soon anyway, why not kill two birds with one stone?  A  clean and organized home will seem like a clean slate to buyers, who  can then see themselves moving in without much hassle and settle in  effortlessly.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Stay Neutral</span></b><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br />Skip the tie-dye sofa cushions, shaggy 70s rug and don’t light incense  on the day of your open house.  While you’re at it, don’t fill the space  with gender-specific things either.  <b>Buyers should walk into a neutral ground – literally.</b>  Light to medium colors, preferably in beige tones, are the simplest  way to pull buyers’ attention away from other personal aspects of your  home that they may not be able to identify with.  Beige goes with almost  anything so if someone considering purchasing your home can imagine  their things in the space, then you’ve just crossed one of the most  major hurdles in home-selling – making a buyer identify with the home.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Make It a Modern, Inviting Environment</span></b><br /><br />If you don’t already have them, invest in a few modern decorative  accessories to improve the look of your space while lending an air of  style and taste and making it more enticing.<b>  It doesn’t have to take  much but depending on how you set it up, you can enhance a given space  with a few simple additions and deletions.</b>  Take your over-crowded  study and rearrange the bookshelf to display only a few strategic but  essential books, like a leather-bound set of encyclopedia or some  literature classics.  In the same way, leave a few children’s toys in a  child’s room but be sure to display them tastefully.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Put a Few Finishing Touches in Place</span></b><br /><br />The  idea is that you want your house to be sold – and you probably want it  sold fast.  If you are careful to respect the people who are visiting  your space to decide whether it’s the right one for them, then you are  doing something that a lot of homeowners neglect to consider.  <b><i>Taking  down a piece of controversial artwork that may make a potential  purchaser uncomfortable could be the one bargaining chip that could make  or break the sale.</i></b>  Arranging for all those who currently live  in the home to be away during the open house and while showing the house  being dressed in a way to present a good impression are also great ways  to tip the scales in the right direction.<br /><br />It’s very simple.  You need to make the potential buyer feel right at home from the get-go.  <b>If  from the moment they walk in and smell cinnamon cookies baking makes  them wish this was already home – then you’re already two steps ahead  and can call the open house a success!</b>  Of course, a signature on  the dotted line is where the real success lies and as long as the buyer  feels at home, chances are that if everything else lines up – the sale  is a winner!
