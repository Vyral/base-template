Today I’m with my good friend Ali Garbero, who is a listing specialist on our team. She’s been a good friend for a long time, knows the business very well, and is one of the top agents in our market.&nbsp;

Awhile back, we did a [video](http://canovogroup.tv/the-risks-of-selling-your-home-without-a-professional-agent.html) talking about Homie and some of services they provide, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of working with them. There have been a few recent developments involving Homie.

As you know, they have been promoting working with their service over using a real estate agent to buy or sell property and, in an ironic twist, they just became a real estate brokerage. As far as I understand, they were under investigation by the Division of Real Estate—who was trying to determine if they were practicing real estate without a license—and now they’re a real estate brokerage.&nbsp;

So today, I’ve brought Ali on to talk about the benefits of working with a professional real estate agent or team rather than working with any one of these discount brokerages.&nbsp;

“People need people, and when you’re selling a home, it’s more than just the very black and white transaction,” Ali says. Selling a home involves a lot of emotion—you’re negotiating one of your largest if not the largest asset that you have, and it affects your bottom line financially.&nbsp;

Having someone to walk you through the process step-by-step, especially if you’ve never sold your home or it’s your second time going through it, will make the entire transaction easier.&nbsp;

Working with a professional real estate agent means you also have access to a network of professional vendors. “Getting a home sell-ready is also going to be a process,” Ali says, is a valuable asset.

Ultimately, it’s an emotional process selling your home. Having a trusted advisor to help you make decisions is a welcome thing. Additionally, she says, “We’re so confident we’re going to sell your home for top dollar and the least amount of time, that we really charge no upfront costs to start working with us.

**The discount brokerages will charge you upfront, and then they really have no skin in the game.** If you home sells for top dollar or for rock bottom price doesn’t matter— they’ve already been paid. When you work with a professional agent, you can rest assured that they only get paid when the home sells.

Here at the Canovo Group, we don’t charge any upfront fees. We have a very flexible commission structure and a cancellation guarantee. **If you’re not happy with our services, you can cancel our agreement with you at any time, for any reason, and without any repercussions.**&nbsp;

Our flexible commission structure works like this: we have a 7% commission structure on the high end, which is usually for homeowners who have a huge remodel or other project that needs to be done on their home, but don’t want to deal with contractors personally. So we’ll take that on with the commission and manage the entire transaction for them.

Another part of our commission structure is the more traditional 6% commission, where we represent the seller exclusively and another agent represents the buyer. In this transaction, we would share 3% of our commission with the buyer’s agent.

Lastly, if we have a client who is interested in just having us manage the transaction itself—they’ve already found a buyer and just need help getting through all the paperwork—then we will service that client for 1% of the sales price of the property.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me or Ali about this topic, or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, please give us a call. We would love to help you!
