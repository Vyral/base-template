Today, we want to share what we learned so you can make more informed renovation decisions. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>What should people be aware of when choosing cabinets?</b></div><div>Homeowners should pick a factory-made product with a hard finish. With these products, you can clean the cabinets without having to worry about the finish coming off. One of the main aspects of factory-made cabinets is they are manufactured in a controlled environment.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>How many varieties of cabinets do you have?</b></div><div>We have six different lines of cabinetry. We have over 600 finishes and 120 different door styles for those who are looking for custom cabinets. There are modern designs as well traditional, so there is something to fit everyone's taste.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Updating countertops is a very common home renovation project. What are some of the popular products now that granite is falling out of favor?</b></div><div>One of the main products we use a lot nowadays is quartz. It's a manufactured product that's more solid than granite. A second product that's gaining in popularity is Neolith, a porcelain product that comes in very large sheets like granite, and can be cut so that it has an edge to it. Neolith is really tough, it won't stain or scratch, and it has a large selection of colors and styles.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>What kind of tiles are the most popular now? What do people here in Truckee like?</b></div><div>Many people are starting to move toward porcelain tiles, which have perfectly squared edges and are usually quite large. There are also tiles to choose from that will give your home a more rustic look, which is really popular in Truckee right now!</div><div><br /></div><div>If you have any questions or would like some tips when renovating your Truckee home, give us a call or shoot us an email. We would love to help make the process as smooth and fulfilling as possible!&nbsp;</div>
