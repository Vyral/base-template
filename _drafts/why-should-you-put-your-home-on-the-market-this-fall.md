Contrary to what you may have heard, selling your home in the fall is a great idea. There are three main reasons why:&nbsp;

**1\. You never know where the market will head in the future.** Real estate and the stock market tend to be tied together, and the stock market usually experiences a lot of volatility in the fourth quarter. This can create quite the lag in demand, so you may want to capture the favorable conditions we’re currently experiencing while they last. Buyers might not be as eager to invest their hard-earned cash in the months to come.

**2\. Competition is lower at this time of year.** With all the traveling, celebration, and inclement weather people face during the later months of the year, not as many sellers take the initiative to list their home on top of everything else they’re doing throughout the season. Sellers savvy enough to seize the opportunity the fall and winter market presents, however, will find that doing so really helps to set their home apart.&nbsp;

**3\. Buyers are more prone to be out and about during the cooler fall weather.** Gone are the days of boiling temperatures and super-high humidity. Now, cooler weather has people much more willing to get outside—which means they’ll also be more willing to drop by any open houses you might be hosting, for example. All in all, people won’t be nearly as bothered about going out for showings or other such events during these fall months.&nbsp;
