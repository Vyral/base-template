Your deck might need some maintenance after the crazy snowfall we’ve seen this year. Here are some tips for getting it done.

Today I want to talk about decks. Whether it’s a seller getting ready to sell or a homeowner who realizes their deck needs a bit of work, I’ve got some tips that can help you out.&nbsp;

**A neighbor of mine has a deck that’s only three years old, but the amount of snowfall that we’ve had this year actually caused the deck to break off the side of the house.** We’ve seen decks fall off commercial properties as well. The decks around here definitely got load-tested this winter with snow. It’s probably worth checking to see if you have any damage because of it.

My deck is 23 years old, so I’m definitely going to be having it checked out. **No matter how old your deck is, I advise you to do the same.** Better safe than sorry, especially when it comes to your deck.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me or want to know anything else, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. We'll be back soon with another market update for you. Until then, we look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
