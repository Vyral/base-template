Most landlords are not allowing pets, and because the rental market is so busy the landlords can be very choosy. &nbsp;What’s more, once you do move in there are extra charges to have pets and renters are largely limited through liability as well.<br /><br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Extended Savings Through Delayed Initial Payment</span></b><br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ziC3iLXalss/Tp8iKZBQY9I/AAAAAAAAFOI/Pc43wwIoLn8/s1600/bigstock_Calculate_the_mortgage_rate_an_6579523.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ziC3iLXalss/Tp8iKZBQY9I/AAAAAAAAFOI/Pc43wwIoLn8/s200/bigstock_Calculate_the_mortgage_rate_an_6579523.jpg" width="133" /></a>When you rent a home, chances are that rent will be due immediately. &nbsp;In fact, most renters cannot even move in until and unless they have paid their dues. &nbsp;Conversely, depending on when the closing date is, homebuyers are able to get away with as much as 45 days without making the first mortgage payment, which is usually just the payment, real estate taxes plus private mortgage insurance if less than 20% was put down on the house. &nbsp;Renters would have to pay as much as $3,500 (including security deposit and additional months’ rent as required) depending on their monthly payment amount.<br />~<br />With rates and home prices as low as they are, if you can afford it and if you qualify – this is a very good time to choose buying over renting. &nbsp;To find out whether you can qualify for a home purchase, visit your Realtor today.<br /><div><br /></div>
