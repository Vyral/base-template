When it comes to purchasing a home there are three mistakes you should always avoid making during the process if you want to succeed:

**1\. Go on vacation**. If you’re going on a vacation to Greece during the process of buying a home it will be very hard to complete the purchase. We can’t do everything on your behalf, and being far away makes coordination difficult. Wait to go on vacation until after you’ve closed on your home if you want to avoid undue stress.

**2\. Don’t pay off any debts**. This may sound crazy, but it’s not. If you pay off a debt entirely, that will impact your credit—for better or worse, we don’t know. Consult your loan officer before you pay off anything.

**3\. Don’t finance any large purchases**. Be it a new car or furniture for your new home, don’t take out any additional lines of credit.
