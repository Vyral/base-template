If you’re like me, you absolutely love the holidays. After all, what’s not to love about food, family, and fun? **Unfortunately, the season also comes with its share of stressful moments, which is something nobody can really say they love.** I try to make my holidays as pressure-free as possible, which is why I’d like to share with you some tips on making this season’s stress disappear (or at least be more manageable):

**1. Skip traditional gifts and save money.** You can share gifts with those you love without breaking the bank account. Think about different gift-giving options you could take advantage of, such as pooling together for group gifts or playing Secret Santa.

**2. Take no-stress holiday photos.** Most of us use our phones as our cameras, which still have the ability to take incredibly effective pictures. When taking a picture of your Christmas tree, make sure to turn off the flash for a better picture. If your child is uncooperative during a photo-op with Santa, show your little one a picture of you two together doing something fun; it’s sure to get them in a jollier mood.

**3. Try not to regift.** One man’s junk is another man’s treasure, but regifting can cause awkward situations for all parties involved.

**4. Start saving early.** November through January is a rough time for many people. On top of the cost of gift giving, property tax bills and end-of-year expenses all hit during this period. If you save a little money each month leading up to the holidays, you’ll have an easier time funding your holiday expenditure (and your credit card will thank you).

**5. Have fun and focus on experiences.** Some of your best memories cost little to nothing to create, so think about activities you can do with friends and family that will bring you joy for years to come.

I hope you have a wonderful holiday season that’s free of stress and full of fun! If you have any real estate-related questions or there’s anything I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
