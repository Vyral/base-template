  Do you have an exclusive professional relationship with your real estate
  agent? If not, you are missing out. Bouncing from one agent to the next will
  never gain you the level of service you would find working exclusively with a
  single, top quality agent. Speaking from personal experience, there are things
  our team will only do for buyers with whom we are exclusive. To learn more,
  watch this short video.

At some point, your agent is going to ask you to commit to the professional relationship you have with them. Keep in mind that when they ask this, they are also promising to make a commitment to you. **So why is this in your, and the agentâ€™s, best interest?**
{: .present-before-paste}

It is long been said that you get what you pay for, and this is true in real estate. If you are partnering with a laundry list of agents on the sale of your home, how hard is any one professional really going to work for you?&nbsp;

When our team members sign an agent agreement, we take our service to the next level. We will get out there and find properties for our clients that are not even on the market yet. **This is not something we would do for someone we are not working with exclusively.&nbsp;**

This is exactly what makes exclusivity so important in the realm of real estate, especially as it relates to buyers.&nbsp;
