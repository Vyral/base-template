There are many myths about the real estate market. Today I am discussing the biggest myth surrounding down payments.

The biggest myth I hear is **“I need a 20% down payment.”** After the last recession, underwriting guidelines tightened across the country, and the perception became that you needed at least a 20% down payment to qualify for financing. While this was true at the time for jumbo financing, it has since changed. There are a wide array of loan programs with different down payment options.

In Texas, jumbo loans are set by the government, and this year**, the amount for a jumbo loan is anything over $453,100**. A loan larger than this will usually still require a 20% down payment. However, there are plenty of lenders who will loan at 100% loan-to-value for the right borrower. Just remember that the lower the down payment, the higher the interest rate.

**Loans lower than $453,100 will be considered a conventional loan, and their down payments can range from as low as 3% to however high you want to make it**. These loans will have different requirements for mortgage insurance that you should be aware of.

Your next option is the FHA loan, which has a 3.5% down payment minimum, assuming you have a credit score over 580. If you have a credit score of less than 580, it will be hard to qualify for financing, but at that point, 10% is required.

The final two loan programs you can use are **USDA and VA loans. USDA loans are used for rural properties and VA loans are for veterans.** Neither requires any down payment.

As you can see, there is definitely a wide range of down payment possibilities. If you have any further questions about the myth of the 20% down payment or how to best use your funds, please don’t hesitate to ask. I’d be glad to help you.
