We’ve been getting quite a few questions lately about the multiple listing service (MLS), what it is, and what it does. There are a few things confusing people about the system, so I wanted to clear the air today.

First, a word on what the MLS is not. It is not www.themlsonline.com. That’s just a real estate company with a conveniently titled name. Our actual MLS can be found **[here](http://www.saintcloudrealestate.com/)**.

Our MLS has changed a lot over the last 15 years. Back then, each community had their own separate MLS. **St. Paul, Brainerd, Duluth, and St. Cloud each had their own system to market properties to agents in the area.**

Since then, real estate has become very regional. Instead of 15 different MLS systems, we now have just one. The Twin Cities MLS covers Minneapolis, St. Paul, St. Cloud, Mankato, Alexandria, and a good ⅔ of the state of Minnesota. When you market your property on the MLS today, it reaches many more agents before being distributed out to websites like Zillow and Realtor.com.

**Most agents will simply list your home on the MLS and leave it, hoping for other agents to pick up the slack.** That’s not how we do things. We work hard marketing your property each day it’s listed and we don’t get paid until you do.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about the MLS, real estate, or anything else, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon!<br>&nbsp;
