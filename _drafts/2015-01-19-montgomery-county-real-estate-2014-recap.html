If you want to stay in the loop, you need someone you can trust to deliver up-to-date and accurate market information.<br />If you're looking to see what's up with the market, you've come to the right place.<br />I think <strong>we're going to have a better 2015 than most people are projecting.</strong> According to the Chief Economist at Freddie Mac, Frank Nothaft: "We expect single-family home sales and housing starts to be at the highest level since 2007." This is huge news, as it means our market will continue to thrive with activity.<br />Let's take a look at prices - where are they going? Well, a new FHFA report shows that <strong>home prices are going up significantly across the country.</strong> The Middle Atlantic Region, where we're located, is seeing price increases at a lower rate than any other region. This is actually a good thing, because it means <strong>our market has stabilized more quickly than the rest of the country.</strong><br />We're currently in a very good place as far as prices are concerned. Additionally, we are seeing strong signs that our sales volume is in a solid place as well. <strong>Our market is coming back to a much more normalized status, which is great news for everyone in our community.</strong><br />If you would like more detailed information on where our market is heading, or if you have any questions about real estate in general, give me a call or shoot me an email. I would love to help you make the most of this strong market! <br />Thanks, and see you next time!
