Back in 2010, the <b>Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) </b>started enforcing their longstanding and strict regulations on condominium approvals, which includes a rule that <b>mandates re-certification every two years.</b> Prior to 2010, these guidelines weren't really followed; now, however, all condo projects are held to the same level of restrictions and <b>entire projects must be certified as a whole.</b> This means that all condo communities must go through the same rigorous process of re-certification every two years, which basically means they have to fill out the same paperwork they did at the time of the initial approval process.<br /><br />The result: condominium communities have allowed their FHA approval status to expire without going through any re-certifying process. The downside to this is people who would like to use an FHA loan will not be allowed to buy in a condo development or community. This reduces the pool of potential buyers, causing condo prices to drop because there are fewer buyers in the market. <br /><br />So, what is the solution now that 95% of condominiums are not FHA approved? It really comes down to urging the non-FHA condo projects to bite the bullet and become approved. This will move properties for sale by opening them up to a whole new pool of buyers - effectively increasing demand and upping prices. Home Owners Association boards of directors, with the help of their community managers, can do a lot of the work themselves and become FHA approved - or, they can hire an independent FHA approval facilitator to do the job for them. A significant increase in FHA approvals in the next few years would be a game changer in the condominium market, and we can only hope to see that happen.<br /><br />If you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, give us a call or send us an email.
