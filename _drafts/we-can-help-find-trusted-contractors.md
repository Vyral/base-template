If you want to hire a contractor, how can you find one you can trust? Let us help you with that.

If you're looking to hire a contractor, how can you find one that you trust?&nbsp;

I like to tell my clients that in order to really trust a contractor, you need to know that they've been in business for an extended period of time. You also want to be sure that they are licensed, insured, and bonded.&nbsp;

**I have a list of trusted contractors and vendors that I've amassed during my experience in real estate.**&nbsp;If you need a contractor of any kind, I can definitely help you. Our network includes electricians, plumbers, roofers, general contractors, handymen, and many more.&nbsp;

Just give us a call or send an email and we'd be happy to send you our network of preferred contractors and vendors.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or you know a great contractor that should be added to our list, call me! I look forward to hearing from you.
