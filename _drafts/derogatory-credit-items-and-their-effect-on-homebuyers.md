If you’ve had credit issues such as a foreclosure, short sale, or bankruptcy, you can buy a home again in the future. However, you might not be able to for seven years.

Most people understand that a negative life event, such as a short sale or foreclosure, affects your credit. **It will also have some repercussions for mortgage qualifying purposes.**

Different loan programs have different time frame requirements for the different events. It can take anywhere from one to seven years for you to be able to buy a home again, depending on the situation.

**These days, I’m seeing a lot of Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 Bankruptcies.** There’s a pretty wide gap for what the different programs allow.

If you or someone you know is contemplating one of these actions. It’s important that we have a conversation up front so that we can lay out a roadmap for what happened and what we can do to get your back into homeownership.

If you or someone you know is looking to buy a home, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
