  real answer is documentation requests. Specifically, you should expect to
  provide documentation on three separate occasions: once during your
  pre-approval, once when you’re under contract and locking in your rate, and
  once (though not always) when you get closer to the final approval.

As a homebuyer, what can you really expect during the mortgage process?

The real answer is **documentation requests**. Specifically, you should expect to provide documentation on three separate occasions: once during your pre-approval, once when you’re under contract and locking in your rate, and once (though not always) when you get closer to the final approval.

The mortgage process can last multiple months, **so you should also expect to be in frequent communication with your lender**—by phone, text, email, and, in some cases, video. Remember, you’re borrowing a lot of money, so you and your lender need to be on the same page during this time.

To further summarize what you should expect from the mortgage process, I’ll share with you our mantra at The Betz Team: “Close accurately, on time, and with lots of communication.”

For example, as far as accuracy goes, we’re very thorough on the front end in completing your pre-approval so that you have the best chance possible of getting your offer accepted. We also promise to close on time because, otherwise, you’ll be stuck with a moving van full of furniture and nowhere to go with it.

**Because there’s a lot of communication happening during this process, you need to make yourself available and check your email regularly**, because there will be a lot of timely, actionable items that you’ll need to complete.

This emphasis on being readily available and being in constant communication with your lender is so that you cross the finish line and become a happy homeowner within your contract deadline. If you’d like to talk more in depth about what to expect during the mortgage process, just give me a call and I’d be happy to speak with you.

As always, if you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me as well. I look forward to helping you.
