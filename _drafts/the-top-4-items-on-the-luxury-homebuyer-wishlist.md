Luxury home shoppers can have high expectations when it comes to buying a property. The higher the price point, the more they expect. Most luxury homes have similar traits, but there are four features that are trending in 2019:

Greater privacy. Luxury home shoppers don’t want to be able to see their neighbor when they walk outside. They want gates, walls, and hedges in order to keep things private.

Smaller pools. Deep pools aren’t trending anymore; luxury homebuyers are instead looking for smaller plunge pools that take up less space so that there’s still plenty of land available. 

Two of everything. One set of appliances isn’t enough. Luxury homebuyers want two stoves, dishwashers, etc., and they want them to be high-end designs.

Guest suites. This doesn’t have to be a detached suite—luxury buyers are open to having rooms with an en suite bathroom. They use these rooms for live-in nannies, maids, and friends and family. They also want additional rooms they can use as a study, home office, theater, home gym, etc.
