The fall is a great time to sell your home, and there are a few reasons why.

What makes fall a great time to sell your home?

First, we saw a strong spring and summer in terms of the volume of sales, but sales typically drop toward the end of the year. It doesn’t mean people don’t want to buy or sell; it just means there are fewer buyers out there for a variety of reasons (colder weather, the start of the school year, etc.).

Because of this, **the remaining buyers are more serious**. This means less tire-kicking and more people who are ready to make a deal. In fact, most fall buyers want to get into a home before the first snowfall.

Most times, we also see less competition in the higher price ranges from other sellers during the fall, so **now’s an especially great time to sell if you’re looking to move up**.
