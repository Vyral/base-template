Friends, clients, and colleagues –

Here’s an update for you on the price of your St. George area home.&nbsp;

Look at these recent headlines…

**&gt;&gt;&gt;“Median price of Southern Utah single family homes up $110,000 since March 2013”, *The Spectrum*<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;“St. George, Utah is nation’s fastest growing metro area”,** ***USA Today***

We’re seeing more millennials buying homes, consumer confidence is up, and interest rates are still hovering around 5%, but climbing.&nbsp;<br><br>And get this - in some St. George neighborhoods we’re having all-out bidding wars with multiple offers on a single home for sale. Look at some recent Larkin Group sales:<br><br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Single Family home on Bulloch St. in Washington City, 9 offers, home sold at $10k over asking price.<br><br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;$500k+ executive home in Green Springs, 2 Buyers bidding against each other, sold for 100% of asking price.<br><br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Single family home in Ivins, 5 offers, sold at $12k over asking price.<br><br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;St. George townhome, 2-Buyer bidding war sold at $15k over asking price.<br><br>Clearly it’s a seller’s market. **Supply is not keeping up with demand, not even close.**&nbsp;<br><br>Consider that in the four above scenarios alone, (and there are HUNDREDS of those scenarios), **14 home buyers were left looking for a home after the bidding war.** Willing, ready and able to purchase a home today.&nbsp;

This is very comforting to my clients who need to sell their homes at higher prices - especially those recovering from the recession.

In particular, Investor Landlords are making a killing selling their rentals right now and can sit on sidelines until they feel values have adjusted down enough for their comfort.

If you have any questions about our St. George market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, please reach out to me. I would love to help you.
