A recent study by Udemy found that 38% of millennials are bored at work. And when millennials feel unchallenged at work, they may seek employment elsewhere—somewhere they feel they can excel and grow.

With all that being said, today I would like to share some recommendations for keeping your millennial employees engaged.

**First of all, it is a good idea to be flexible in regards to allowing millennials the option to work remotely.** While 65% of millennials prefer coming into the office to work, according to a study by Hunt Scanlon, they also appreciate having the ability to work from home if need be.

Over 80% of employees surveyed in this same study said that they were happier and more productive when given the option to work remotely. If working from home increases productivity, consider allowing employees to do so periodically—whether it is once a week, once a month, or under special circumstances. Giving your millennial employees small privileges like this will benefit the company just as much as it benefits them.

**Another way to boost engagement among millennial employees is to examine your company’s work hour policies.** I understand not every company can have a four-day work week, but allowing employees to be flexible in the way they work their hours can be highly effective.

**For my third and final tip, I would recommend offering career development opportunities.** A study by Forbes recently found that 80% of employees have greater job satisfaction when they have access to career development. Things like conferences, webinars, networking events, and trade shows will help employees learn and develop. And when you invest in your employees’ growth and development, you are investing in the success of your company.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
