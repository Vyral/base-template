You have decided to purchase a property. What do you do now? Where do you start? I am here today to give you four tips to become a successful purchaser in today’s real estate market.

1. **Talk to a mortgage professional and get yourself pre-approved.** The pre-approval process is like a mini application. A few documents will be required and a credit report will be run. With the pre-approval you will have a price point that is approved for you. This gives sellers peace of mind when you put in an offer because you will have the money available during the process.

2. **Talk with us at 2% Realty.** We would be happy to help you with the purchasing of your new property. Tell us exactly what you are looking for and we will take note of all your wants and your needs. We will be with you 100% of the way.

3. **Join our buyer VIP program.** We offer this program if you work with us. It provides you with a website populated with properties that match your exact criteria. Instead of waiting for realtor.ca to post the property, and sometimes have the property already sold, you’ll get the information when we get it. You are too busy to look at property that has already been sold. With our program, you can log into the website and see all the new listings since you last logged into keeping you ahead of the market competition. You will also have the ability to see price reductions before the public. Alerts for when the property is sold in your market price is an added benefit of our program.

<br>4. **Arrange a tour with us.** Once you are set up in the program, you can call us anytime to arrange a tour. We can point out valuable information you might not be aware of. For example, if it is a condo, is it a rain screen building? Is it leaky? We will protect you from getting involved with these issues.

When you have found the right fit and are ready to buy, **we will draft a legally binding contract on your behalf.** We will find out all about the sellers needs and wants, including date expectations, to make the offer more appealing. If you are flexible, the seller may even help save you money.

We will work with the seller’s Realtor for the disclosure statement and title search so we don’t have to include it in the offer. This will make it a cleaner offer which will make the seller much happier.

With these steps you can be a successful buyer in this market. If you have any further questions, please let me know. I look forward to your calls and emails. Remember, quality service doesn’t always have to come with a big price tag.
