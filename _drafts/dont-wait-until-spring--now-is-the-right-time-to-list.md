  Many believe that if they wait until spring to list their home, they may earn
  a better deal. People ask me all the time, “Should I wait until spring to list
  my home?” My answer to this is, actually, no. The current market presents
  tremendous opportunity for sellers. To learn more, watch this short video.

Not a day goes by without me hearing the question, “**Should I wait until spring to put my home on the market?**”

With this question on so many people’s minds, I want to address it today.

The fact of the matter is that we have a shortage of inventory right now. This means that our current market presents a tremendous opportunity for sellers to maximize what they can net for their homes.

**Another benefit of listing now instead of waiting until spring is that you don’t have to worry about landscaping.** The only thing you need to worry about is your home’s interior.

Also, there is a lot more competition in the spring. With more homes going on the market during those warmer months, buyers can afford to be more selective.

**Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to enjoy your spring with the difficulties of your home sale behind you?** While other sellers are just beginning to hit the market, you can enjoy the season with your family knowing your transaction has already been settled.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
