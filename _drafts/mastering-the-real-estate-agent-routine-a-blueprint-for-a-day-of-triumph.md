What does a successful day as a real estate agent look like? Agents wear many hats, but there are three things we need to do to have a successful day in real estate:&nbsp;

**1\. Lead generation and follow-up.** Agents need to spend their time finding buyers and sellers who know, like, and trust them to help with their real estate needs.&nbsp;

**2\. Hold consultations.** Talk with those buyers and sellers, identifying their wants and needs and helping them to build a winning strategy to serve their real estate needs.&nbsp;

**3\. Negotiations.** Agents need to negotiate every day to lead to closings if they want to succeed as real estate professionals.&nbsp;
