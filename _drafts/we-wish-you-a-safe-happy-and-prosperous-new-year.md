We at Imagine Realty wish you a happy, safe, and prosperous new year.

To our family, friends, and everyone we’ve worked with over the past year: We at Imagine Realty wish you a happy, safe, and prosperous new year. I can’t believe it’s going to be 2020 soon, and we’re fortunate to have had such a great 2019. This, of course, is the time of year people start thinking about their New Year’s resolutions, and mine is to be better prepared for the future—specifically for my retirement and my daughter’s education. If you have a New Year’s resolution I can help with—perhaps it involves buying, selling, or investing in real estate—please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you, and I look forward to seeing you in 2020.
