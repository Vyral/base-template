<center>Most millennials face some financial difficulties buying their first home. If you’re the parent of one, here’s how (and why) you should help them do so.</center>

You’re the parent of a millennial who’s looking to become a first-time homebuyer. The problem is that your millennial doesn’t quite have the financial wherewithal to independently purchase a home.

Here’s a tip for how you can help:

**Open a gift fund for them**. This will help your child get their financial footing when purchasing their first home. The truth is, the majority of first-time buyers are unable to pay any or all of their down payment and must seek help from a parent or some other source. This is a fact of home buying that often goes unmentioned.

Think about it in these terms: Helping your millennial take the first steps to buy a home now will help them for the rest of their lives. Unlike, say, the purchase of a car, you’re investing in an asset for them that will gradually appreciate.

Putting a little money toward a down payment or a gift fund for your child may make all the difference in helping them secure a fairly low interest rate on a home; having them stay sidelined could mean a potentially missed opportunity.

**Locking in a 5% or 6% interest rate now will allow your child to generate wealth that they can build a family around in the future**.
