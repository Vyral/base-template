<center>Have you heard the ads on the television and radio from companies offering to buy your property without listing it?</center>

Have you ever heard television and radio commercials from companies offering to buy your property without ever listing?

If this kind of deal is something you’re interested in, I want to apologize. I do personally offer this arrangement, but am not vocal about it because **it is not always the best solution**. However, it could fit some people’s needs.

If you need money now, need out of the property immediately, are in a foreclosure or tax lien, or are simply not interested in going through the hassle of a traditional sale, let me know. **I can offer you the same solution as those commercials on the radio and TV**.

If you are considering this option, I ask you consider working with me over selling to those other companies. They are purchase properties for less than market value. If you want top dollar for your home, I would love to help you with aggressive, proper marketing so that you can get it sold quickly.

**The market is still moving very fast**. Buyer demand is very high and inventory remains low, so we can still help you get the money you want quickly.

If you are interested in talking about selling with me, please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I would be happy to speak with you.
