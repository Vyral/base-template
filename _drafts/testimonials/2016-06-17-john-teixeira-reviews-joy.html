My daughter and son-in-law had used him once before when they sold their house in Arlington. Actually, my daughter was down here and then my son-in-law came and John helped them to sell their house, he’s awesome. </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He helped us to locate people to help us with the work that we needed to get done after the inspector came. We would have been at a total loss if he hadn’t have been able to guide us to people that could help us do the things that we needed to get done.”</i> </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>-Joy Almond, Home Buyer</b>
