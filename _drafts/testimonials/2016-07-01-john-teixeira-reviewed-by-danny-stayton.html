This is a guy that you want in your corner. This is a guy that will go the extra mile. He’s going to tell you straight what you need to be told but, he’s going to do it in a very professional way that you will understand. He knows his business, he knows his stuff. He doesn’t try to add a lot of fluff.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know of any other agents that will come out and be there for you when you’re not there. Let’s say, that your dogs are pinned up most of the day because you need to have a showing. John would drive across town when you’re at work and he will let them out for you. He’s going to help you out, he’s going to make sure your place is taken care of. To me, that’s the kind of guy that you want working for you. That’s the kind of person that you want to work with, that you trust. He will take care of you, take care of your family, and also take care of the business that you need to get done.”  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Video URL:</b> youtu.be/5hYnvxXT8Cc</i>  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Danny Stayton, Home Seller</b>
