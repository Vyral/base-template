Every time we have a business deal he goes beyond. And he’s an excellent agent. He always does what he says he will do, he goes beyond. I was going to be out of town with the property that I had bought from him that I was having repaired. He was willing to oversee the project with no extra cost to me.”</i> </br></br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Joe Norton, Home Buyer</b>
