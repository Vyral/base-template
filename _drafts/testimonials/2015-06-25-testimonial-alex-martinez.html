My wife and I were first time buyers, and he didn't make us feel like we were just more clients. He made the process so easy for us. He walked us through the entire process. We were anxious about the whole process, but he was very patient and answered all of our questions. We felt like he actually cared about our wants, our needs, and our desires. He really went out of his way to find that perfect house for us. We didn't feel like we were just another pay day. He took care of us and made sure we got what we wanted. It was great!”</span></span>
