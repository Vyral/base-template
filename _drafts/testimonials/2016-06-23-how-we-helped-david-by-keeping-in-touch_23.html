He even kept in touch when there was a problem with the buyer’s bank. They had an issue with their bank that they had to take care of that ended up putting a delay on our closing. We’re leasing the house that his buyer had bought from us until our next house is finished. John worked with them and got us a pretty good rate on leasing until we’re done with our new house.”</i> </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>-David Blasingame, Home Seller</b>
