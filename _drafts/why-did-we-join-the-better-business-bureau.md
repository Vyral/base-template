<center>We’ve joined the Better Business Bureau. If you’re curious as to what this change represents, let me explain.</center>

Today, I’m excited to let you know that we have joined the Better Business Bureau.&nbsp;

Part of the reason for this change is that whenever the market gets hot, as it is right now, we have a huge influx of people in the industry. These people don’t stick around long. **Our team, on the other hand, has a commitment to the industry, and we want people to know that.** &nbsp;

We feel strongly about honesty and integrity, both of which are things the Better Business Bureau stands for. &nbsp;

To join, we had to go through a specific accreditation process. This process reviewed our business history back to 1975. **According to the representative from the Better Business Bureau, we were found to have an absolutely stellar history.** In fact, this representative said our business history was some of the best he’s ever seen.

We’ve run our business by the “Warren Buffett rule” for many years. It takes 40 years to build a good reputation and only about five minutes to undo it. That said, **we’ve worked hard to earn the great reputation we have today and we won’t do anything to jeopardize it.**

If you have a question you can check out our site on the Better Business Bureau, but you should also know that we’re always here to take your questions directly.

So, if you’d like any more information or want to ask us anything else, feel free to give my team and me a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
