Though solitary lenders are a common way of getting a mortgage, lending teams are gaining in popularity and for good reason. Let’s look at the benefits you receive from working with a team.

The team concept provides us the bandwidth to handle your file with greater care and give you better service. We have front-end contacts to handle pre-approval processes and back-end help from contract to close. No matter what stage you’re in, there’s always someone there to help you. We promise to accurately close on time with plenty of communication—things that solitary lenders simply cannot do.
