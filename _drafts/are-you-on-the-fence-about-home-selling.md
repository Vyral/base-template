Today I want to discuss how the market is doing as a whole. I’ve been hearing a lot of talk that the market is slowing down or houses aren’t selling.

**Actually, the opposite is true.**This is one of the best starts we’ve had to a real estate season in years. My team alone has listed 27 brand-new properties since January 3, with 17 pending sales in that same timeframe.

In New Haven County as a whole, 698 new homes came on the market in the last 30 days. There were also 586 sales in the last 30 days. **If that’s any indication of how the spring market will be, it’s going to be a beast.**

If you’re on the fence about selling, you shouldn't be. Houses are moving as long as they are positioned properly and priced correctly. It’s not just about the price though, you have to have good marketing as well.

**If you’re paying a lot for rent and you’re sick of it, you should be talking to a lender to see what you can afford.** If you can afford that monthly rent, you can certainly afford that mortgage payment that comes with equity and tax deductions.

If you're interested in buying or selling a home anytime soon, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
