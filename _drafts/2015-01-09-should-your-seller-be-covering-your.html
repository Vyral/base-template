Today we have Al Ripple from Johnson Bank here with us to talk about buying and selling homes. One thing we have been seeing a lot lately is buyers asking sellers to pay some of their closing costs. <b>What can a seller pay on a buyer's behalf when they are financing a home?</b><br /><br /><b>Well, there are really two categories where the seller can pay on behalf of the buyer.</b> The first is the usual and typical expenses of the transaction, including appraisal, title insurance, and recording fees. The other category is the prepaid expenses that establish escrow counts if the buyer is going to be in escrow for taxes and insurance. <br /><br />Now, there are a few limitations to what sellers can pay on the buyer's behalf. One is a function of the loan amount relative to the purchase price, and the other limitation is the actual expenses. <b>In other words, a seller can't give a buyer more credit than what their cost actually was. </b><br /><br />Another topic we have been getting a lot of questions about is “prepaids”, or prepaid expenses. <b>Prepaids are expenses you pay in advance, such as deposits and interest expenses on loans in the month of which you are actually closing.</b><br />&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you are a buyer and have questions about closing costs, feel free to give Al a call at <a href="http://%28414%29%20852-7022/">(414) 852-7022</a>.
