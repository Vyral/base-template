excerpt: >-
  Today I have the latest market statistics from the month of March to share
  with you. The number of regular listings available has slightly dropped since
  the end of February. The number of sales, however, has risen. In the freehold
  and condo markets, the numbers tell a slightly different story. To find out
  more, watch my latest video.
