Recently, I’ve noticed that a lot of people are curious as to whether working with a team is truly better than hiring an individual agent.

These days, the truth is that most people undergoing a real estate transaction tend to utilize a team.

This is a great option since a team costs the same as an individual agent, but provides you with more services for your money.

Hiring multiple professionals for the same price as you would pay for one simply makes more sense.&nbsp;**Working with a team means you will have access to a higher level of communication, better marketing, and a wider base of expertise.**

I recently pulled a report from the Multiple Listing Service to help illustrate this point. According to these statistics, the average days on market for a listing sold with a single agent was typically greater than 50. Also, listings sold with a single agent tend to sell for 5% less than list price.

When you look at my team’s statistics for this year so far, it’s a very different story.&nbsp;**With us, a home’s average days on market is 5, and all of our listings sell for 100% of asking price.**

Think of it this way: if you needed surgery, would you rather trust a single surgeon working out of his car, or go to the hospital under the care of a professional team? Getting more service for the same price is always the obvious choice.

Buying or selling a home is a huge life event—that’s why it’s critical to work with the right people.
