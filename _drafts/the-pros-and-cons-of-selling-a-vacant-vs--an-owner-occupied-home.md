Today I want to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of selling a vacant property versus selling an owner-occupied property. I will start by discussing the pros and cons of selling a vacant property.
{: .present-before-paste}

The **first advantage of showing a vacant property is that it is easier to show.** When the buyer wants to get in, we have ultimate access to show them around. We can take as much time as needed to answer all of their questions.

**Vacant homes also do not need to be kept in great shape.** The buyer knows when we open the door that it will look like nobody lives there, so it shows perfectly every time. Even better, we will not have to interrupt you since you do not live there.

Finally, **some buyers have an easier time visualizing a vacant property.** They can go into the home and say what they want to use the room for and how the property will look for them.

The cons of showing a vacant property, meanwhile, are that it may be a little distracting to hear everything. **Photos of a vacant home may attract criminals.** People know that nobodyâ€™s watching over the property, so they may take advantage of the opportunity.

**A big downside to selling a vacant home is that it can signal urgency.** If the buyer goes through the home, they may think that seller has two mortgages, two sets of property taxes, etc. and that they may be open to taking a lower offer.

One advantage to selling an occupied home is that they tend to **show better than vacant homes.** If you take things a step further and hire a stager, you will be able to show the home in its best possible light. This will leave a great first impression on buyers.&nbsp;

Finally, **those selling an occupied home will be able to more easily address any plumbing issues, roof leaks, or any other emergencies that come up.** If this happens in a vacant home, small issues could go undetected and become severe.&nbsp;

However, one disadvantage of selling an owner-occupied home is the need to **keep it clean all the time.&nbsp;**

Selling an owner-occupied home can also be generally inconvenient. When we do a showing, you will have to get out of the house because buyers want to look at the house without worrying about you taking offense to things they might say.&nbsp;
{: .present-before-paste}

Ultimately, the decision between selling while living in the home or listing a vacant property is up to you. There is no right answer, but your Realtor will be able to help you devise a marketing strategy in either scenario.
