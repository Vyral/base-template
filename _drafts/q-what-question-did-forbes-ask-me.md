Last week, Forbes Magazine (a periodical focused on American business) called and asked me a few questions. I gave them my best answers, and today I’m going to share the most essential one with you.&nbsp;

**Last year, I had the honor of being asked to join the Forbes Magazine Real Estate Advisory Council.** As part of those duties, they reached out to me last week asking questions about the real estate market. The question they were most curious about was “What advice would you give an agent whose business has stalled and needs a powerful restart?”

Here’s what I told them: That agent should get on the phone and call 100 people they already know. This could be past clients and customers, their teachers, neighbors, people they know for an exercise class or church, anyone whose name they would know if they bumped into them on the street.&nbsp; In that conversation, they should simply ask: How are you doing? How’s your family? Is there anything I can do for you?&nbsp;

Before they get off the phone, they should **ask directly: Do you or your family have any real estate needs coming up within the next year that I can help with?** Or do you know anyone who has a current real estate need that I could help?&nbsp;

I can assure you that if you have that conversation 100 times, no matter what’s happening with interest rates, the oil and gas market, or the health crisis, you will be swimming in new business. That’s what I told Forbes Magazine, and that’s my advice to you. If you want to jump-start your business, get on the phone\!&nbsp;

If I can ever do anything for you or you have further questions, let me know. Reach out via phone or email. I’m here to help.&nbsp;
