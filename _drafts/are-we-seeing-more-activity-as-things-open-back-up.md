We were pleasantly surprised at the response last week in the real estate market as more and more businesses opened back up. We listed four houses last weekend and had a total of 85 showings. We didn’t expect such a response so soon, and more people are getting anxious to take advantage of pent-up demand and low interest rates. **We only expect it to get busier from here** as we continue to follow the state’s guidelines for our listings.
