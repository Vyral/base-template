  As a buyer, agent exclusivity is very important. When an agent isn’t committed
  to you, they aren’t working to their full potential. Signing a buyer’s agency
  agreement provides both you and your agent with a sense of security in the
  transaction. And once your agent is committed to you, they’re much more likely
  to go above and beyond to meet your real estate goals. To learn more, watch
  this short video.

At some point, an agent is going to ask you to commit to them. Of course, this also means they’ll be committing to you. **This exclusivity comes about when you and your agent sign a buyer’s agency agreement.**

Agents who don’t work exclusively for you are less motivated. However, an agent who has committed to your transaction through a buyer’s agency agreement will go above and beyond for your needs.

When my team and I work exclusively, we even find properties that aren’t listed on the market yet.

Who you work with matters.** If your agent is already doing their best to serve you before you gain exclusivity, you’re going to want to commit to them.** Exclusivity is so important for buyers in today’s market.
