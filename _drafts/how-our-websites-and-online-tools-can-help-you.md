We at the Wicker Homes Group have been working very hard to create some really cool tools for our toolkit that buyers, sellers, and anyone out there thinking about making a real estate transaction can use.

Two tools that have been particularly very helpful are our search website [www.wickerhomesgroup.com](https://www.wickerhomesgroup.com/)[,](__notset__) which allows you to search available homes in real time, and our video blog [www.livelovenova.com](http://livelovenova.com). Our video blog will give you a video library of different real estate topics we’ve covered in the past for your education and enjoyment.<br><br>We also have two different websites for buyers and sellers, specifically. The website for buyers is www.buywithwhg.com, and the website for sellers is www.sellwithwhg.com. Both of these websites are individually tailored for each side’s needs.

We’ve been getting a lot of feedback lately from clients who really love these websites. We’ve also been getting positive feedback from folks who aren’t our clients and even people we haven’t met yet who’ve used these tools to introduce themselves to the world of real estate.

If you love our online tools, you’ll love meeting and working with our team. Whether it’s our listing manager, Julie Westendorff; our transaction coordinator, Allyson Adamson; our marketing specialist, Mike Hauptman; or myself—we’re dedicated to serving you. Our tools are just the beginning!
