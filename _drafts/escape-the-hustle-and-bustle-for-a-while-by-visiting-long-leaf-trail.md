Just east of Gulf Place sits the beautiful Long Leaf Trail—an eight-mile walking path where my family and I love to come to get “off the grid” for a while. If you’re looking for somewhere to spend some time out in nature, this is a great place in the area to do so. It just goes to show what kind of amazing places are hiding in plain sight.
