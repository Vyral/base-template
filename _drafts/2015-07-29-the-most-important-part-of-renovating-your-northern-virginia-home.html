Renovating your home can be an exciting process, but it's important that you don't get ahead of yourself. <b>You can't just go willy-nilly into a major project and expect it to go perfectly.</b> Planning properly for these types of projects can assure a smooth project, and one that may even cost less!<br /><br />HGTVâ€™s Amy Matthews recommends making a very detailed timeline of your project, including potential things that could go awry and making backup plans in order to prevent these things from happening. <b>Putting your plan onto paper is a good way to start this process.</b></span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jWF9ORHeZlc/VbkiPhjkaaI/AAAAAAAAcVk/vNnLVxVHrUU/s1600/7.29.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="110" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jWF9ORHeZlc/VbkiPhjkaaI/AAAAAAAAcVk/vNnLVxVHrUU/s320/7.29.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Another major step is choosing a good team of contractors that you can communicate with. If they don't know what you want done, they can't do it. <br /><br />Just remember, <b>there is no such thing as too much planning!</b> If you plan on renovating your Northern Virginia home, please contact us. We know great contractors and could also give you advice on what projects will bring you the highest return on your investment. <br /><br />We look forward to hearing from you!</span><br /><script async="" charset="UTF-8" src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js"></script>
