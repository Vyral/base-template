I have Allan Ripple from Johnson Bank here with us today and I wanted to talk about the increasing interest rates and how they affect buyers. <br /><br />A lot of people have asked me where interest rates are headed and I thought Allan would be the best person to help us understand.<br /><br /><b>Allan Ripple</b><br /><br />Well, to predict where interest rates are going, itâ€™s important to understand what is driving the interest rates. The Federal Reserve has been supporting the lending market by purchasing mortgage-backed securities. This has kept interest rates artificially low. This is known as Quantitative Easing.<br /><br />Over the past couple of meetings, the Federal Reserve has hinted that they will be backing off. Since then, we have seen an increase in interest rates. <br /><br />As interest rates increase, there is a scaling effect on buying power. If interest rates are at 4.5 percent, for every $100 in principal and interest payment, it gives you $19,600.&nbsp; If you have a principal and interest payment of $500, it gives you about $100,000.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xacP_GuqhXE/Uk13iBSl9KI/AAAAAAAALV8/iDRebhngaD0/s1600/Untitled-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xacP_GuqhXE/Uk13iBSl9KI/AAAAAAAALV8/iDRebhngaD0/s1600/Untitled-1.jpg" /></a></div><br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>If rates increase a point, though, you are looking at a $10,000 reduction in buying power. So if you are thinking about buying home later on, it will be important to keep in mind how your buying power will be affected.<br /><br />If you have any questions, please give Mike or me a call!
