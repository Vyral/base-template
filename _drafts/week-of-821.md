This house is in the premiere school district Ladue.&nbsp; It is also just 1.5 miles to 2 of the top hospitals in the St Louis Metro area.&nbsp; Westwood is the municipality which is VERY small but next door is Frontenac and there's Frontenac plaza nearby.&nbsp; being on a lake is not heard of in St Louis.&nbsp; There are also no HOA fees for this tiny subdivision of just 3 other homes.&nbsp;
