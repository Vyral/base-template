Today, I want to talk about what buyers look for in a home, as well as a few upgrade ideas for your current home.&nbsp;

When it comes to preparing your home for the market, the most basic thing you need to understand is that buyers expect a house to be clean. When someone walks through the door, your home must feel clean, fresh, and cozy.&nbsp;

So, what about upgrades to your property? If you are thinking about selling at some point later on, there are a few ways you can prepare now.&nbsp;

One upgrade that will definitely attract buyers is the installation of a smart thermostat. Smart thermostats allow you to remotely control heating and cooling in your home, and aren’t that much more expensive than a normal thermostat. Also, home surveillance systems can be a big plus.&nbsp;

Kitchen upgrades are another good option. Small features that don’t cost a lot can make a big impact on buyers. &nbsp;You shouldn’t feel obligated to spend a ton of money upgrading your home, but some subtle changes can definitely make a difference. For example, touchless faucets are fairly inexpensive and will help your home stand out to buyers.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
