One question I’ve been getting a lot lately is, “When I list my home, should I do a major renovation project or am I better off doing some minor remodeling?”

{% include pullquote.html %}
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The answer I give to 99% of the people I meet with is to **do a minor type of remodeling or upgrade, as this will bring you a better return on your investment.**Don’t get me wrong—a brand-new kitchen or bathroom will help your home sell hand over fist, but by the time you get done with that type of project, there’s usually a lot of unanticipated costs that can also cost you time and prevent you from getting top dollar for your home sale.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>**Research indicates you should start your upgrades outside.** Buyers are drawn to things like curb appeal and attractive landscaping. Avoid getting too customized with your renovations, though. Not everybody likes a certain color or style, so you’re better off maintaining neutrality.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Lastly, do some decluttering. It’s an often-overlooked task, but it’s an easy one to accomplish. I understand if you have things you appreciate lying around the house, but clutter can become distracting to a potential buyer.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>If you have any questions about which minor upgrades you can make to increase your home’s value and sale-ability, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be glad to help.&nbsp;
