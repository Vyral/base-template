  Why would you buy or sell real estate right now? I am not saying you
  should—that depends on your current situation—I am just answering a question.
  The answer is that we are in one of the greatest real estate markets we have
  seen in quite some time. Whether you are a buyer or a seller, there is a good

Why would you buy or sell real estate right now?&nbsp;
{: .present-before-paste}

**We are in one of the greatest real estate markets we have seen in quite some time.** Prices are high right now in Washington County. Since 2013, home values are up by an average of $110,000.

There is an analogy I like to use with my clients that pertains to our current market situation.&nbsp;

Imagine you are about to take a trip and go on a long drive to an area you do not know very well. After you are on the road awhile, you pull up to a gas station because, as you remind yourself, you do not know where the next one is. All you know about is right now, and right now there is a gas station in front of you.&nbsp;

Right now, we know that interest rates are hovering around 5%. We also know that real estate cycles typically last seven to 10 years, and we are seven years into an “up” cycle. A little over a decade ago, we experienced the biggest financial crash since the Great Depression, but if you put your home on the market today, you can sell it quickly and for top dollar. Today the stock market looks good and buyers are competing in bidding wars.&nbsp;

**As a buyer, you can take action knowing that you could get a loan and buy a home. As a seller, you can take action knowing that you could find a ready, willing, and able buyer who will buy a home for 2005/2006 prices.&nbsp;**

To clarify, I am not saying you *should* buy or sell a home; that is up to you, your family, and your current situation.

But, there is a beautiful gas station right in front of us and we do not know if there will be another one for the next 200 or 300 miles.&nbsp;
