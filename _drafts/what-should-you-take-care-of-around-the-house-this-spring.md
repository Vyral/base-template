  Spring is here and it’s time to do some cleaning. Whether you’re getting ready
  to sell or just get your home looking good for summer, there are a few simple
  things you should take care of. This includes mulching flower beds, weeding,
  and washing your windows. I did some research on window washing for our house,
  and I found that it was much easier (and much less expensive) to clean them
  myself rather than hiring a window cleaner. To learn more of my spring
  cleaning tips, watch this short video.

Spring is here in Memphis and it’s time to get ready for some spring cleaning. **If you're getting ready to sell your house, or just get it back in good shape for the summer, spring cleaning should include:**

* Weeding
* Mulching flower beds
* Aerating your lawn
* Washing windows inside and out

I get tired just thinking about it. Around our house, the window washing is a must. After doing some research on window cleaners, here’s what I’ve found. Our home has 42 windows and doors and the cost ranges anywhere from $500 to $540. **Unfortunately, these professionals start with a “come on” price just to get you excited.**

My suggestion is to go to Lowe’s or Home Depot and buy Windex Outdoor Spray and Rinse for about $9 per quart. **It usually takes me about two bottles to get all of the outer windows clean.** The inside is another story because Diane won’t let me bring the hose in. I guess that’s another project for another day.
