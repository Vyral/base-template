<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xcEYXfKSccA?rel=0" width="560"></iframe><br /><br /><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br />How do you pick the right lender?<br /><br />When you’re looking for a lender, <b>you want to ask your real estate agent two things: who do they know and who do they trust?</b> Real estate agents don’t make any more or less based on which lender you use. The only difference is whether or not it’s going to make their lives any easier. When you use a lender that your agent knows and trusts, they usually get a property to close faster and with less hassle. If it makes their life easier, odds are it’s going to make your life easier too. <br /> </span></span><br /><div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">No one wants to deal with an out-of-towner. </span></span></div></div><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br />No one wants to deal with an out-of-town lender. They have neither a viable reputation nor a stake in this town. If they mess up a loan, it doesn’t affect them long-term at all. Local lenders, on the other hand, live where we live, eat where we eat, and socialize where we socialize. Our community is their community. They can’t afford to mess up loans. They can’t afford for your house to close 30 days late because they didn’t do their job. <br /><br />Personally, I would recommend Joe Balsley of Atlantic Bay Mortgage. He’s the lender in my office, and he’s the best one I’ve ever used in my 14 years as a real estate professional. You can reach him at (540) 278-1430. <br /><br />If you have any real estate questions or have a topic in mind that you’d like me to cover, please don’t hesitate to call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!</span></span>
