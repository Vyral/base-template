<center>If there’s an abandoned house in your neighborhood that is pulling property prices down, we can help provide options for how to improve the situation.</center>

Imagine you’re driving through a neighborhood and you see a house that’s obviously not being taken care of—the grass is dead, cobwebs have taken over, and it appears to be abandoned. It’s interesting to know the backstory behind the house’s condition.

Truthfully, these sort of homes may present an opportunity for you as a buyer. One of the things we pride ourselves on is doing that research for you. **We just need the address, and then we’ll go into detective-mode, doing anything from pull tax records to doing property profiles to even contacting the city**.

The reason that these homes may provide you with an opportunity is that no one wants to live next to an abandoned home; **they tend to bring property values down in the whole neighborhood**. We like to help people who own the abandoned homes find solutions—perhaps help with repairs so they can either resell it or fix it up to be a rental property.

If you see a home like this in your neighborhood, shoot us the address and we’ll go and take a look. **When we’ve assessed it, we’ll come back to you with different options for what we can do with it**. If you can get the house looking nice and help bring up the neighborhood home values, you’ll be the hero of the block.

For any inquiries you have about abandoned homes, or any other questions you might have, please feel free to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.
