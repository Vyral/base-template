There’s one critical tool you need to use every day to assure you grow your business.

There are plenty of quick fixes and shiny objects out there that you’ve probably been tempted to spend a lot of time and money on to grow your business, but as we all know, to grow a sales business, you have to be in contact with a lot of people. There a lot of ways to do this, but one phrase that stands out to me is, “we respect what we inspect.”

<br>There’s no better thing to inspect than our critical activities used to get in touch with people. And that’s why my agents and I carry a document called the **Weekly Critical Activities Success Tracker** every day. You can take a look at this document in the video above.

It tracks everything we do every day and puts it on a worksheet. For example, the middle of that page has prospecting and follow-up calls because we know we should make between 15 and 30 prospecting and follow-up calls every single day. We can also notch off referrals and new contacts added to our database.

**I encourage you to set a goal for yourself for the amount of outbound touches you want to make every day** and record them on this document. Then, set yourself up with a Google Form like we do and it will come to your inbox every Monday to help you stay accountable.

If you have any other questions about growing your business or you’d like a copy of our activities tracker, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to hear from you!
