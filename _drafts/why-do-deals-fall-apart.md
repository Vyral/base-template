Unfortunately, real estate deals don’t always make it all the way through closing. There are a number of reasons they can fall apart, and today we’d like to share five such reasons:

**1. The buyer and/or seller encountered pre-contract problems.** This includes issues like a lowball offer, an extensive list of repairs, or an appraisal problem.

**2. The buyer and/or seller encountered post-contract problems.** Whether a buyer gets cold feet, the buyer and seller can’t agree on how to handle repairs, or a problem with financing arises, there are several different things that can kill a deal once the buyer and seller are under contract.

**3. A contingent buyer failed to sell their current home.** One of the most common reasons a real estate deal falls through is that buyers who need to sell their current property before buying their next may be unable to do so.

**4. The buyer was denied financing.** In a perfect world, every buyer out there would be going about their search with a pre-approval letter in hand, but this isn’t always the case. Financial issues on the part of the buyer are a major reason deals can fall apart.

**5. There were issues with the pre-settlement walkthrough.** Even once the closing table is in sight, last-minute problems can pop up and sink an entire deal. Liens, a previously unnoticed safety issue like mold, or an unforeseen financial hardship could all pose a threat.
