Today, I’ll show you a few strategies to update your home and maximize the resale value. If you’re thinking about selling your property, there are a few things you can do to get top dollar.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>First, look at your kitchens and baths. **Kitchens are what sell homes, and baths are what keep buyers in that home.** Now, that doesn’t mean you have to start from scratch on the kitchen. Instead, find a great new granite or quartz countertop that will help you achieve that luxury feel. You can also do simple things like updating your lighting and your faucets.

What else do you need to do? Many people need to simplify and **reduce clutter.**Having a light, open home will definitely help you get top dollar.
<br>
<br>Plus, you always want your flooring to be in great condition, so** consider updating or replacing that used carpet.&nbsp;**
<br>
<br>I have a few other tips for you, so give me a call or send me an email if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you!
