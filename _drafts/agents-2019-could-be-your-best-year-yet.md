<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Did you meet your selling goals in 2018? If not, we need to talk.</em></p>

If your career didn’t take the direction you expected in 2018, then we need to talk.

**The first thing you should realize is that it wouldn’t matter if 2018 had the hottest real estate market in history—there would still be agents struggling.** To be successful, agents need to have the right tools and opportunities.

I’ve heard from many agents lately telling me they’ve been in the industry for four years but only sold 12 homes this year. It doesn’t have to be this way.

**Agents on my team sell at least 30 houses, if not 40 or more, within their first year with us.** So if you’re thinking of to a top-producing team (like ours), this is what you can expect:

Agents with the Dan Jones Home Selling Team are held to a high level of accountability, and are also expected to perform to a high standard in terms prospecting. We track our team and our agents’ performance because this lets us all be as successful as possible.

**We give our agents the system, structure, resources, and leads they need to take their career to the next level.**

So, if 2018 was a disappointment for you, don’t let 2019 be a repeat experience. Talk to me about what joining the Dan Jones Home Selling Team could do for you, instead.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
