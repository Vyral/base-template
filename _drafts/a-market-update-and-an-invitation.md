As summer turns to fall, I wanted to bring you an update on the real estate market. I also wanted to let you know about our upcoming party.

**With kids going back to school, the real estate market in Louisville and Southern Indiana has slowed down just a bit.** The number of homes that sold in July was off by less than 1% from last year, but the number of homes going under contract is down 11.9% from last year.

The number of homes on the market last month was just about the same as we saw in 2018, as was the number of new listings in July.

**If we look at our absorption rate and remember that anything less than five months is a seller’s market, our 2.87-month supply puts us in a strong seller’s market.**

However, here’s where things get a little scary. We’ve been hearing the word “recession” a lot. **When experts were polled about when the next recession will begin, the majority of them said 2020.&nbsp;**

A recession does not equal a housing crisis, contrary to popular belief. The top three triggers for this next recession will be trade policy, stock market correction, and geopolitical crisis. With low interest rates, the housing crisis will be minimal because people still want to buy and sell homes.
