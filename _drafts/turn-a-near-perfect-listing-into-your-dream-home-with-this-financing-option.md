Can your financing program help you make home improvements when you purchase property? Actually, some may. Let’s discuss this option today.

Imagine you’ve found a near-perfect home. **It fits most of your qualifications, but there are still a few changes you’d like to make. What should you do?**

In the past, lenders would allow people to finance a home and then sometimes get an equity loan. These days, there are a couple of lenders in the market who will allow you to, with a few limits, roll the cost of home improvements into your initial mortgage.&nbsp;

My team and I worked with a client recently who took advantage of this option. They closed on their home, had contractors lined up, and **were able to immediately make a few very nice upgrades, like new countertops.**

So if this is something that appeals to you or you have questions about how the program works, my team would love to provide you with additional details.&nbsp;

And, as always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
