What if you didn’t communicate with your spouse? Or how about your boss? Or how about anyone important in your life?

**Your life probably wouldn’t go as well, and the same is true in real estate.** Let me tell you a quick story about what I mean.

I had a closing recently that was rife with miscommunication. I wasn’t getting any communication from the buyer I was representing or the local immigration attorney who was handling the closing. The buyer’s lender wasn’t returning my calls and I wasn’t hearing anything from the closing/immigration attorney, either. Once I called that attorney, it became very clear to me that she wasn’t used to doing real estate closings and didn’t know much about them.

As it turned out, she was joint-venturing with a title company located in Richmond, who I then had to call. The seller was also using a different settlement company that I had to get in contact with.

In essence, I was the one doing all the communication and making sure everyone else was communication with each other. You need to do the same thing with your real estate purchase and make sure the settlement people—who are incredibly important to your transaction—are in communication with each other.

For example, if there’s a split settlement where the seller is using a different settlement company than you, you need to make sure they’re talking to each other and talking to your agent. **Everybody in every department that’s involved in your transaction should be in communication with each other** so you can know things like what your closing costs will be and whether title is coming through every step of the way.

If you have any questions about how to keep everyone in your real estate transaction in communication with each other or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in our northern Virginia market, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you.
