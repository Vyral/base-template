  Today we’re taking a break from the normal real estate talk to share another
  wonderful endorsement our team received. This time, it’s from political
  commentator and talk show host Sean Hannity. According to Sean, there’s no
  other agent he would trust in Salt Lake City over the Stern Team. To learn why
  and hear his full endorsement, watch this short video.

Through the messages I’ve put out to you over time, I hope I’ve made it clear that our team would love to assist you in achieving your real estate goals. We know that our experience and knowledge would be an amazing asset to your success, but you don’t just take our word for it.&nbsp;

Today I’m thrilled to share an endorsement from talk show host and political commentator Sean Hannity. **Here’s an excerpt of what he had to say about our team:&nbsp;**

*“Even though this nation may be uncertain about a lot of things, selling your home doesn’t have to be one of them. I’m going to make things easy for you and tell you the one agent whose marketing plan is in a whole different league than anyone else you will talk to. I’m talking about Joshua Stern of Keller Williams.”*

*“He attracts hundreds of buyers every week, and he sells a home, on average, every 25 hours. If he can’t sell your home at a price and deadline that you agree to, he’ll buy it himself. He offers you a one-day listing agreement. If after one day he doesn’t live up to his end of the contract, guess what: You can fire him and pay nothing.”&nbsp;*

*“But on average, **Joshua’s homes are selling three times faster and for two-and-a-half times more money.** If I needed to sell a home in Salt Lake City, he’s the only agent I would call.”*

Everything Sean said was true. If you aren’t happy with the results you see, you can pull your listing at no cost. But, **based on our proven results, I’m sure this won’t be the case. &nbsp;**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give my team or me a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
