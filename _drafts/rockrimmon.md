<br>Rockrimmon, Colorado is a fantastic place to live and visit. If you haven’t heard of it, here are three insider tips about why you might need to make it a stop on your next road trip:

**1\. Location**. If you love hiking, biking, rock climbing, and other outdoor activities, you’ll love Rockrimmon. Ute Valley is nearby and it’s very close to I-25, meaning you’ll have access to all the neighboring amenities, too.

**2\. Home values**. The home values in Rockrimmon are a little higher than Colorado Springs. The median sales price is right around $422,000, and the homes average about 3,100 square feet. Homes in the area tend to sell after around 38 days of being on the market.

**3\. Food and attractions**. There are so many options in the area. Some personal favorites of ours are Momma Pearl’s (a cajun kitchen), Oliver’s Deli, Josh & John’s, and Nara Tai (for those who love Thai food).
