Guess what? **We just sold another flooded home.** Not only that, it was 25% higher than the last offer they received!

How did we manage to do this?

Investors who have been making offers on one home have also been making offers on other flooded homes in the same subdivision. Since, more than likely, many or all homes in that area are having the same issues selling their swamped properties, investors can pick and choose as they look for the desperate seller who is willing to sell at their price.

Meanwhile, **we do not go to local investors.** We go to national and international investors who are not physically present. They depend on the inventory that we send them. So, when we send one property at a time and they have multiple investors wanting the property, we create a bidding war.

Whoever pays the price, gets the property. So, on average, we have been receiving 25% more than local investors.

If you want to sell your flooded home for more money, feel free to reach out to me. I would be happy to help relieve you of stress and anxiety and help you sell your property, flood notwithstanding.
