When a home is listed for sale in the Portland area market, it's likely to receive multiple offers. We recently listed a home that received 19!

So what's the best way to handle multiple offers as a home seller?

**First, we'll reach out to all the buyersâ€™ agents and ask them to be sure that they've submitted their clients' highest and best offers.** That way, we'll be sure we're not leaving anything on the table. From there, we'll rank the offers in order of your priorities. Price is very important, but it's not always just about price.

You probably want to consider other things, like timing. If you need to get out of the house quickly, you might prefer an offer with a quick close. Or, you might like an offer that lets you stay in the house after closing to give you time to go buy your next home. We also want to consider financing in each offer. Obviously, a cash offer is much more likely to close and will have fewer contingencies.

**The commitment of a buyer is one of the most important things** you want to consider with multiple offers. Their earnest money deposit is a good way to gauge this. Some offers might even come with non-refundable earnest money, which is a strong indicator that they'll be able to close. This is important because in many multiple offer scenarios, the price of a home starts to get bid up, which leads to buyers getting emotionally involved. When that happens, they might win the bid but end up with buyer's remorse a couple days later.

Another reason we like to rank offers is setting up a couple backup offers. This will not only give you a buyer to go to in case the winning bidder backs out of the deal, it also gives you much more negotiating power during repair requests. Buyers might have a home inspection, and ask you to repair certain things or reduce the price of the home to account for the costs. However, you can tell them you won't make those repairs or reduce the price because you have a backup offer in place if they don't want to go through with it.

There are many more nuances to getting the most out of multiple offers, so don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email with you have any questions or comments. I'd love to hear from you.
