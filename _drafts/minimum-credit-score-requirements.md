There is a lot of conflicting information out there about what minimum credit score is necessary to qualify for a home loan, partially because different institutions have different standards. Today, Justin Allender and I will share the truth about minimum credit score requirements and what you can expect from working with Success Mortgage Partners.

For conventional financing, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do require at least a 620 credit score to qualify for a loan.&nbsp;

Both FHA and VA loans typically require a score of at least 580, but there are ways to qualify you for a loan if yours is not that high.

USDA loans also require a 620, but **there is a no-credit option.** When we say “no credit score,” that doesn’t mean bad credit. There are people who just don’t utilize credit, and that’s perfectly acceptable for us as long as we can document some alternative credit sources that the applicant has paid for the last 12 to 24 months, such as rental verifications, utility bills, car insurance, etc.

However, there are some non-qualified mortgage programs that would allow you to qualify with a minimum score of 500, though **with a score that low, you wouldn't be able to guarantee a 3% interest rate.**

If you or anyone you know has any questions about credit score requirements as they pertain to loan programs, don’t hesitate to reach out to us at Success Mortgage Partners. We’d love to educate you about your options.
