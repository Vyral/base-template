How many homes should you look at before buying one? Find out today.

“How many homes should I look at before I buy?”

Before you even start counting how many homes you ought to be looking at, **you should first make sure that your home search is done properly**. Today, most home searches begin online. For example, visit <u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.colemererealty.com/">ColemereRealty.com</a></u>, &nbsp;where you can set up your own personalized account and start your own list of homes that you like. From there, you can reach out to your Colemere Realty specialist to have them set you up with a customized home search.

**Next, be sure to consult with your agent**. Tell them what areas you like and dislike, what features you need to have in a home, and what features you’d like to have in a home. Also consider whether you have a home to sell before you buy a new one, and whether you’ve met with a mortgage lender. These steps need to be met before you physically observe homes you’re interested in.

Once you’d accomplished all that, **now you can go out to look at homes**. Based on our statistics, we’ve seen that the average buyer tends to look at around five to 10 homes in person before making a decision to buy one. But don’t let that stop you—if you find the perfect home on your first outing, refer to your specialist and go through the process to determine if that home is right for you, and then proceed. There’s a lot of pressure in this market to make decisions quickly, so it’s great to have a professional in your corner.
