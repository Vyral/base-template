The new year is almost here and we’re excited about what we have planned in 2019. Here’s what you need to know.

I just wanted to take a moment to wish you all the best for 2019, as well as share a unique idea that might make this your best year yet.

2018 was a challenging year for many people. How was it for you? I’d love to hear. Hopefully, you’ve been able to spend plenty of time with your friends and family and find success in your career.

Are you ready to buckle down for 2019? **We’re expecting it to be another year of negative growth in the Calgary region**. We’ll likely see fewer sales than we did in 2018, and I expect prices to drop by an average of 3%.

One of the best ways to have a booming business, even in a bad market, is to have raving fans and tons of referrals. We’re so grateful for all of the referrals that our clients have sent us and we want to do something special for all of you as a token of our appreciation.

**Send me an email that tells me about your business or a local business you think is great**. We’ll compile that information and share it with the thousands of people in our network, so they’ll know about all of these great local Calgary businesses.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
