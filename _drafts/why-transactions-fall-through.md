What’s the market like in South Central Pennsylvania? Unfortunately, the national news focuses on data taken from 11 metropolitan areas in the United States. You really need to talk to a local expert to figure out what the real estate market in your area is like. Fortunately, I’m here to provide that hyperlocal insight for our area!

For the first time in six years, our housing market is improving.  The average value of real estate in our area has finally started to increase over the last 12 months. We hope that appreciation continues in 2016!

The average days on market has dropped from 96 to 89 days on market, so homes are selling faster than they were last year as well.

Finally, the number of homes sold in the past 12 months has increased by almost 900 homes. That’s an increase of over 5%.

With these market conditions and historically low interest rates, now is a great time to buy or sell a home. If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
