<center>Our new series, Tarrant County Eats, has just launched. For our first episode, we’ll be featuring a great local spot in Downtown Mansfield: Dirty Job Brewing.</center>

Welcome to our new series: Tarrant County Eats!

To kick things off, we’re taking a behind-the-scenes look at a great new brewery in Downtown Mansfield: Dirty Job Brewing.

According to founder Derek Hubenak and co-owner Justin Watson, they got their start in brewing years ago. The two of them have been friends (and big fans of beer) for quite some time now, so going into business together in pursuit of their passion just made sense.

Now, a few years and several local awards later, **what started off with just a humble home brewing kit has grown into the popular local business Derek and Justin are running today**.

As for why they chose Downtown Mansfield, Derek and Justin say it was an easy and obvious decision. The revitalization of this historic area was a major draw for them both. “The place is great, [and] the community is awesome,” says Derek. When they saw everything Downtown Mansfield had to offer, they knew right away that, in Derek’s words, “this is home.”

After hearing their backstory, it was time to go see where the magic happens and, after that, have a taste for ourselves.

**You can see a full breakdown of their brewing process in today’s episode starting at 3:23 in the video.**

The four beers we tried in today’s episodes were just a small sampling of the 44 main recipes Dirty Job Brewing cycles through on a seasonal basis. **You can see how our tasting experience went down in the video at 4:09**.

All in all, we couldn’t have a better experience at Dirty Job. If you haven’t already checked them out, then it’s time to take a trip to Downtown Mansfield and try their brews for yourself. And be sure to come thirsty.
