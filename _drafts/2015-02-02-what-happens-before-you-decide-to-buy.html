Specifically, it's about being realistic in today's market with your offer and approach. We are happy to be joined by Al Ripple of Johnson Bank to discuss the topic further.<b> Now, let's talk about the first steps that you, as a buyer, need to make before you even think about making an offer on a home.</b><br /><br /><b>The first thing you should do before even thinking about making an offer is make sure you have your financing in order, as well as a fully-underwritten pre-approval with all the necessary paperwork.</b> Once your loan is fully approved, all you need to do is find a property. <b>As far as your loan goes, you should also be aware of what your monthly payment will be.</b> Don't make an offer on a home you can't afford month-to-month. Make sure your monthly payment is comfortable, and worked into your budget. <br /><br />Now, what about closing costs? It is an option for the buyer to ask the seller to pay for closing costs, although there are restrictions. When you are making an offer on a home, understand that the average list-to-sale price is 96%, <b>so if you are asking the seller to drop their price and pay closing costs, it may not happen.</b> You'll likely have to pick one or the other. <br /><br />If you have any questions for Al about getting a mortgage or a lower interest rate, give him a call. As always, if you have any real estate questions, we would love to answer them. Give us a call or send us an email and we will be happy to help. <i><br /></i></span></div>
