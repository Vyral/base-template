My wife and me started off, back in the beginning I moved to Tyler back in ’09 and have been paying rent ever since. And you know it’s the rent vs buy thing, and got to thinking, I ought to have something to show for all this money that I am paying in rent. So back in November my wife and me said well we’ll look at some houses. We started out, we would go on the internet and look on a website and we would go and drive by. I don’t know we probably drove by 40 houses or so, looked at several more in depth. Probably, I don’t know, along in January and February, this isn’t going so well, maybe we need some help doing this. The problem we were having basically is the houses that we liked and that we were interested in either would be, by the time we would call, they would be either off the market, the offer would be pending, and the real estate site we were looking at didn’t update their information. Doing it ourselves basically just wasn’t working well.&nbsp; We walked in one Saturday afternoon, The Burks Team, we sat down in the conference room and we talked and we kinda told them the same thing. What we’d been doing on our own and that we figured it was time that we needed some help with this process. And I gotta say from the first day that we walked in, you guys really made it easy. We left the office that day saying, wow, we should have done this three months ago. Anyway, to wrap it up here, shortly after we signed up with you guys, sure enough we found a house in The Azalea District, and we found a really nice house that fit our life style, that’s really updated. You guys had two trucks that were available and if we needed some help moving we were welcome to use one of your trucks for 24 hours. Everything just went extremely smooth. “</span></span></i>
