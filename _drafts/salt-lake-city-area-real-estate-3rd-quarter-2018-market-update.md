Those things considered, buyers do have their limits and we are seeing them push back a little. The most important thing to remember is that the real estate market will shift from time to time.

As a child, her family moved often giving her the opportunity to experience living in many different neighborhoods. After getting married and earning her real estate license in 2000, Jodie and her husband bought their first home is Sandy. She was mentored by her mother, a successful Realtor, for the first few years in the business, and eventually spread her wings and began her own career. During her time with a large national brokerage, Jodie trained to become a certified real estate coach. She enjoys teaching new agents and helping experienced agents set goals and improve their business. Her enthusiasm for the real estate industry, holding people to high standards, and caring for her clients are some of the characteristics that people mention when asked to describe her. When the real estate market crashed, she was able to learn from it and grow to the next level. “I knew real estate was my passion and I couldn’t imagine doing anything else. It is in my blood. Helping people is my ‘why’. I love seeing the smile on their face the first time they walk into their new home.
