As most people are aware, first-time homebuyers make up an increasingly large segment of the home buying population as more millennials join the market. If you are a first-time millennial homebuyer, what do you need to know?

One of the things that you need to understand is **that it is never too early to talk to a certified mortgage planning specialist about what your path to homeownership** will look like.

Some situations are different than others and require more time to get your ducks in a row. But those conversations need to happen early and often so that you are in a strong financial footing when the time comes.

With first-time homebuyers in particular, **there are some special programs out there to help with getting you into your new home**. This includes down payment assistance. So, if you fear that you can't afford a home for some reason, you may be incorrect. There are studies that have been done that say show that a good chunk of renters can afford right now but are unaware.

If you think that you think that you can't afford to buy a home, I would love to have a chat with you. I can walk you through every step so that you have a good experience with no surprises. All you need to do is reach out and contact me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
