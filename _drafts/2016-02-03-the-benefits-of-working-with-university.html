There are many advantages to getting a mortgage through them.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>They're business plan focuses on becoming the leader when it comes to having the lowest available rates and the lowest fees. </b>Additionally, they offer zero down payment programs, which is fairly uncommon in today's lending environment. Based on the sheer volume of clientele that they work with, the level of expertise they have to have as loan originators helps them put together some pretty incredible financing options for the people they work with.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br />One thing the SOLDwisch Team has noticed is the fact that the University of Iowa Credit Union offers some opportunities for people that other banks don't. They handle their loans on a more case-by-case basis than most other lending institutions. They see it in two ways: secondary market loans where applicants need to fit into a predefined box of characteristics and in-house products that allow them to grant loans in situations where it simply makes sense. <b>They simply want to help people accomplish their goals.</b></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">They work out of a leased office space in West Des Moines and are currently working on building their own location. They started out as a credit union for the employees of the University of Iowa hospital back in 1938. The rules and regulations have since changed and progressed so that as long as you live and work in a community they serve, you can join!&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">They cover a huge area in the state and are currently the largest credit union in the state of Iowa! Additionally,<b> they are number two nationally in total return to member. </b>This means that they were voted the most competitive when it comes to giving the best rates on mortgages, the lowest fees, and the&nbsp;highest&nbsp;rates on their deposit accountants. They are very proud of this distinction, and would love to help you benefit from their services!</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">If you have any questions or comments about today's topic, or if you need real estate assistance of any kind, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
