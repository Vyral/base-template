Buying a new construction home isn’t the same as buying a resale home, so there are a few important things you need to know if you’re considering buying a new build.

Are you thinking of buying a new construction home? Here are a few important points for you to consider moving forward.&nbsp;

First, new builds aren’t placed on the MLS like a traditional home sale. This is why it’s very important that you work with a Realtor who knows about all the new builds happening in your area—you don’t want to miss out on any opportunities.&nbsp;

Second, these homes often sell before they’re built. This happens for a few different reasons. First, it gives the buyer the opportunity to pick the plot, floor plan, and design of the home. Also, the first buyers of a new development often get the best pricing because in the time it takes between the sale of the first home and the construction of the last, a lot of appreciation usually occurs in the area.

There are a lot of benefits to buying new construction, but there are also some risks to consider.&nbsp;

For example, a lot of first-time homebuyers are unaware that they have to sign a builder contract to purchase a new build, and these contracts can vary from builder to builder, so make sure your Realtor is a new-build specialist who can get you a fair contract.

Lastly, when working with a builder, it’s mainly a numbers game. Their main concern is whether you can secure a loan and close on the property. They care more about spreadsheets than your sentiment, which is why—again—you need to work with a Realtor who can negotiate for you and act in your best interests during the whole process.&nbsp;
