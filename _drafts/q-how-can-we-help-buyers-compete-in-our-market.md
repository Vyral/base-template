Needless to say, ours has been a crazy busy real estate market.&nbsp;

If you’re a buyer, believe me, **we understand your frustration about losing out in multiple-offer situations**, even on properties where your offered price was anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000 over list price.&nbsp;

If you’re looking for something specific, reach out to our team and let us know what price point you’re looking at. We can give you a heads up in the marketplace when a home that matches your criteria crops up to make your life a bit easier.

**Speak to a lender before looking at homes or attending open houses** if you haven’t been pre-approved for a mortgage yet and you don’t have a pre-qualification letter.

I would love to sit down with you and leverage our 23 years of experience in the industry as we discuss the home buying process and what strategy it will take to find you that perfect home. Don’t hesitate to reach out to us for any questions or assistance you need\!
