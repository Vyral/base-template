*Now that the new year is upon us, I’d like to take a moment to review our 2017 market.&nbsp;*

Now that 2017 is behind us, I’d like to go over a quick review of the year.&nbsp;<br>There are a few statistics I’d like to focus on, specifically. The first is the median number of days homes spent on the market in 2017.

Compared to 2016, **the number of days homes spent on the market was virtually unchanged in 2017.**At the end of the year, the median days on market was 18. This is still a historic low for that statistic.&nbsp;

Another statistic that remained nearly identical to what we saw in 2016 was the number of homes sold. In 2017, a total of 45,630.&nbsp;

As for the number of new listings that came on the market, there were 61,102 in 2017. This number is up approximately 1% from what we saw in 2016.

Median sales price, though, saw considerably more change. **This statistic was up from 2016 by more than 8% in 2017.** In 2017, the median sales price at the end of the year was $267,970.&nbsp;

We also had another phenomenal year in terms of appreciation. 2017 outpaced the previous two years. But as far as 2018 goes, I anticipate that we’ll see a slowdown in this area.&nbsp;

One statistic we saw in 2017 that I found particularly interesting was the median asking price. At the end of the year, the median asking price was $294,000. This is up nearly 11% from 2016. In other words, **there was a big difference in 2017 between what sellers were asking for and what homes were actually selling for.&nbsp;**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
