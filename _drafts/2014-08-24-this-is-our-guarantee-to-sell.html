Today we want to talk to you about our <b>guaranteed to sell program</b>. This isn't a program where we say "We will sell your home in x number of days or we will buy it". Our offer has no smoke and mirrors. We take a <b>90 day listing agreement</b> because we feel that is plenty of time for us to get you a result. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><b>We also offer a written, no questions asked cancellation policy</b>. If you feel our service isn't up to par and you'd like to go in a different direction, you can cancel <b><i>anytime</i></b> and go work with someone else. We think you will be more than happy about the level of marketing services you will get and the level of customer service you wouldn't expect to find from your average real estate broker.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you have any questions about our 90 day listing guarantee or our cancellation policy, let us know. Give us a call or send us an email and we will be more than happy to discuss things with you.</span></div></div>
