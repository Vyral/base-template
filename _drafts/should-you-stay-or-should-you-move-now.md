Should you stay or should you move now?&nbsp;

Over the last couple videos, we’ve discussed a few key things happening in the market. Interest rates are rising, the median sales price is stable, and we shouldn’t be heading toward a bubble.&nbsp;

**There are a lot of situations where quality equity has been built into homes** because 20% down payments are a standard in our area. Throughout the nation, large deposits and cash deals are integral in the market.&nbsp;

After you’ve spent all winter on Zillow and other home valuation websites trying to determine what your home is worth, now is the time to decide whether it makes sense for you to move. That’s where we come in.&nbsp;

We’ll ask you a few important questions. For example, when did you buy your home? Did you buy a new construction home recently? If so, have the gains in the market equaled what you need from your home sale? Did you buy before the market crash, or did you buy a foreclosed property when the market started to adjust? **These questions will help us determine if there is enough equity for you to take the next step.**

We’ll also help you figure out if it makes sense for you to refinance. If you are interested in selling, is your plan to move again in the next three to five years, or are you looking to establish some roots and stay somewhere 20 to 35 years?&nbsp;

You can use our **[home value tool](http://www.rioloresidentialgroup.com/cma/property-valuation/)**&nbsp;to get an idea of what your home is worth. We can even come over and see what updates you’ve made to your home in order to tighten up those numbers and see what makes sense for you.

If you have any questions about what your home is worth in today’s market or about real estate in general, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!<br>&nbsp;
