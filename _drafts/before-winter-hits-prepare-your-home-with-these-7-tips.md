<center>Before winter hits, there are seven things you should do to prepare your home. Follow these and your home will be more than ready for the cold weather.</center>

Since we’re moving through the fall season, we wanted to give you some home-maintenance tips to keep in mind over the next few months. Abiding by these will keep your property in tip-top shape and help you avoid disastrous situations from happening to your home when winter hits:

**1. Take care of your gutters and downspout**. These fill with leaves and debris, so make sure they’re regularly cleaned out. If not, they can overflow with rain and lead to water intrusion, or sitting water can freeze and create an ice dam.

**2. Maintain your windows**. As we get into the cooler months, you’ll want to make sure windows are in good shape and free from gaps, rotting wood, and other problems. While replacing windows is neither cheap nor easy, there are alternative ways to seal your windows until later seasons.

**3. Keep your chimney clean**. This often slips through the to-do list for many homeowners, but neglecting to clean your chimney can be a fire hazard. Make sure to have it professional checked, swept, cleaned, and repaired (if needed). Unchecked blockages can lead to uncontrollable fires or carbon monoxide poisoning if a fireplace is lit.

**4. Check your roof**. It’s easy to check your roof in the summer; it’s not so easy in the winter. Take a look before the snow begins to fall, or have a professional give you an evaluation and recommendations for preventative maintenance.

**5. Don’t wait to check your HVAC**. Too often, people don’t check their HVAC until they have an issue with it, which can lead to some very cold days in the home. Be proactive and make sure it’s good to go before the colder months arrive. Keep up on repairs, have someone service it, and make sure to be changing the filters when needed.

**6. Make major purchases ahead of time**. Now should be the time you stock up on salt for driveways, snow shovels, and snowblowers. As snowy weather creeps closer, hardware stores begin to increase prices for those unprepared. Get it out of the way early and your wallet won’t be hurting when the blizzards hit. Also, make sure your snowblower is working in the first place!

**7. If you’re selling in spring, prepare your home now**. The spring market comes in fast, and if you’re not completely ready then you’ll be left behind. Start now before winter rolls in and you’ll already have a head start on the booming spring demand.

If you are looking to buy or sell a home once winter ends, contact us for a free consultation. It’s a good idea to get the process started now in preparation for the competitive spring market. If you have any other questions or would like some more information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you.
