"Wes was good the entire time. He worked with our schedule and we really enjoyed Zach Sikes. Even after we bought, if we had a question he always answered it. He’s just been great. We recommend Wes to anyone for sure. Wes was good the entire time. Like I said, even after we bought, even after we were done with everything, if I had a question I’d shoot Wes a text and he’d answer back about whatever it might be. His customer service was really good. Wes was really knowledgeable. One thing we liked about Wes was [that] he didn’t try to persuade us into anything. He took in our thoughts on what our needs were, and then he gave us options and helped us find houses based on those needs and desires and wants. One thing my wife pointed out that she really like about Wes was when we looked at houses he was never pushy on anything. He just let us look and he pointed out things that we needed to know that we probably might not have known if he hadn’t pointed them out. We felt that he made us feel really comfortable in the buying process and I felt like he increased our knowledge base about houses in the area and structural things that you need to know about. Overall we just felt more comfortable and we trusted working with him and seeing houses. We really just enjoyed Wes. He would go down and check things that - like I said - we wouldn’t probably have checked or noticed, and that was pretty important to us. Overall, we recommend Wes to anyone. We really enjoyed his helping us with the house. Definitely, we recommend Wes for sure. He’s a good dude."
