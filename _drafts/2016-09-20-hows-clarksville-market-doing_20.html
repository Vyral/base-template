<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rUbzW9ekqtw" width="1280"></iframe> <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The Clarksville market is still heating up and it's still busy. For a better idea about how our market is doing, let's take a look at stats from last year compared to this year.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Year over year, the number of closed sales and the closing price are both up. Closed properties increased 15.9% from 1,999 to 2,316 and the average listing price increased from $170,000 to $174,100. You can list a home at whatever price you want, but what are these homes actually closing at?</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>Well, sales are up and market prices are up, too.</b> The average sale price in Clarksville rose by $6,000 from $167,000 to $173,000, or a 3.5% increase. After having a relatively flat market for three years before this, that 3.5% increase is great.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The other very important stat in this market is the sales-to-list price ratio. This is the percentage of the asking price that homes are selling for. Last year in our market, homes were selling at 98.23% of list price, and this year, <b>homes are selling at 99.37% of list price.</b> Sellers are getting close to full asking price!</span></span><br /><div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">Sales and market prices both rose since last year in Clarksville.   </div></div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Buyers who see a home out there they want need to make their best offer because there is not much room for negotiation! We just listed a house that had seven showings and two offers in one day. The market is hot.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">It's a great market for buyers if you work with an agent who can help you compete. It's a great market for sellers because of the market values.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">If you have any questions about our market, feel free to give me a call or send me an email anytime. I'd love to hear from you!</span></span>
