It’s a great time to refinance your home, and today we’ll explain why.

If you’ve been thinking of refinancing your mortgage, we’ve got some great news: Now is the perfect time to do so.

Why, you may ask?&nbsp;

Well, with interest rates currently at historic lows, homeowners have a unique opportunity to reduce the interest on their mortgage payments. In some cases, this can even help homeowners pay off their property more quickly.&nbsp;

**Some homeowners may find that a cash-out refinance is the best option for them.** By cashing out on the equity they’ve built up, homeowners can easily pay down other high-interest debt they might have, like that on a credit card.&nbsp;

Even with all of these benefits in mind, though, some homeowners might feel hesitant to refinance because of all the paperwork they assume it will require. The good news is that many refinancing programs make the process smooth and simple, like the FHA Streamline program—which doesn’t even require an appraisal.&nbsp;

The VA IRRRL (or Veterans Affairs Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan) is another great option. Our team recently helped a homeowner reduce his VA loan from an interest rate of 4.75% to 3.375% with no points and no lender fees. That’s nearly $300 in monthly savings.&nbsp;

**Current low interest rates are also majorly beneficial to buyers, who now have much greater purchasing power as a result.** And because we at Orlando Mortgages want to help homebuyers take advantage of this opportune moment, we’ve decided to lower our underwriting fees. Alternatively, we can also offer concessions toward closing costs to keep the loan balance as low as possible.

Whatever your real estate goals may be, our team would be happy to help talk you through your options. We would love to have a conversation about whether now is the right time for you to buy, sell, or refinance, so please give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
