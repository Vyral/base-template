  Today I’d like to teach you about the 1-3-5 business plan, also called the GPS
  plan. These are tips and tricks I’ve learned before and after creating my own
  millionaire-agent business and coaching for MAPS and some of the top real
  estate teams in the world. I’m offering these tips to you in an effort to
  fulfill my purpose of helping others achieve their own potential for
  greatness. The structure is simple: one goal, 3 priorities you’ll need to
  achieve that goal, and five strategies to achieve each priority. But there are
  rules you’ll need to implement to make sure it works. To find out more, watch
  my latest video.

I have a millionaire agent mindset tip for you today: how to create a one-page business plan to move your career forward.

What do you think the No. 1 that prevents people from reaching their goals is?

The answer is clarity. See, in real estate, we must start out by asking ourselves, “What’s the math that I need to do?” For instance, your units multiplied by the average home price will equal your sales volume. Your volume multiplied by your average commission equals your net income.

Is this going to take care of your big dreams? That’s the question you should ask yourself.

**Once you have the numbers nailed down, here’s what your 1-3-5, or your GPS plan (goals, priorities, and strategies), will look like:**

* One goal
* Three priorities necessary to achieve your one goal
* Five strategies under each priority to help &nbsp;you reach the goal

That’s the basic format—**here are the rules:**

1. Your plan must fit on a single sheet of paper.
2. Your whole team needs to use the same format that you do.
3. Everyone must follow the template.
4. Share it with others, or you won’t be held accountable.

Suppose the the real estate professional’s GPS goal is: I will close X number of homes, equaling X in volume, equaling X in GCI. With that, your number one goal will be a dollar amount.

**Priority No. 1: Number of buyers closed.**

You’ll need to decide on what percentage of that GCI will actually be buyers closing. Underneath that priority, your strategies could be :

1. Sphere of influence: what percentage of your buyers will you have to close via your sphere to hit your number?
2. Open houses: what percentage of the buyers will come from open houses?
3. Internet leads
4. Signs and flyers
5. First-time and move-up homebuyer classes

As long as all the strategies added up are greater than your priority, then you know you’ll hit it.

**Priority No. 2: Number of sellers closed**

Decide on a percentage and put in a number based on your goal. If you’re newer to the business, I find that 30% sellers an 70% buyers seems to be fairly normal, but as you age into the business, you’ll probably want to start focusing on the selling side. For the listing side, some of your strategies might be similar to the buyer side:

1. Sphere of influence: what percentage of your buyers will you have to close via your sphere to hit your number?
2. Open houses: what percentage of the buyers will come from open houses
3. Internet leads
4. Expired/FSBO listings
5. Farming

**Priority No. 3: “Who-Have-Know-Be”**

In order to get different results, you need to know different things, have different tools, know different people, and be in business with talent. Here are the strategies you might use to achieve success here:

1. Get a coach
2. Hire an assistant
3. Hire a showing agent
4. Get your systems in place
5. Educate yourself on leadership

If you really want to put the 1-3-5 business plan on steroids, you can create a separate page for each strategy, outlining five more strategy to accomplish each main one.

**The GPS plan is your roadmap: If you do it, you’ll find the holes in your business. If you share it, you’ll get results. If you unpack each strategy with further strategies, you’ll have a manual for how to run your business.**

In the next video, I’ll talk about how you can execute your GPS plan by using a document called a 4-1-1.

If you have any questions about today’s topic, please feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to discuss the GPS plan with you further.
