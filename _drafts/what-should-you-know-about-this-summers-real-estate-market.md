excerpt: >-
  The latest numbers are in and we wanted to give you a quick update on the real
  estate market for the rest of the summer. We are still seeing low inventory in
  the lower price points, but things are starting to pick up in the $425,000 and
  above price range. There are also some interesting home buying trends that we
  have been noticing and wanted to give you an update on. For example, some
  buyers are starting to waive their inspection in order to make their offer
  more attractive to sellers. To learn more, watch this short video.

  We have seen a number of buyers writing an offer, withdrawing it, then coming
  back to the table weeks later.
