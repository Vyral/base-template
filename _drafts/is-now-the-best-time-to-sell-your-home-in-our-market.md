If I asked you when is the best time of year to sell your home and told you your possible answers were spring, summer, fall, or winter, which would you choose?

If you guessed spring, congratulations! That’s probably not a shocker, but the real estate website HomeLight did some research on this subject and found that **certain niche areas, cities, and areas within those cities have different optimal sales cycles.**&nbsp;

What about the Phoenix/Scottsdale areas, though?

The real estate “season” in Phoenix runs from November to the end of April. The six-month period in between is considered the “off-season.” These seasonal markets are great for their specific time of year for obvious reasons, but they also have homes that sell throughout the entire year. Terra Vida, for instance, is a seasonal market, but there are people who live there full time.&nbsp;

**The greater Phoenix/Scottsdale market is very favorable for sellers right now,** and the current sales cycle should run until the beginning or middle of July. After that it will slow down until the holidays come.

This is great news if you’re looking to maximize your home sale and time the market through our seasonal sale cycle. The seasonal market is closing, but there are still some snowbirds out there who are holding over until they have to head back up north. There are also buyers who need to buy now to get their children’s school situations figured out.&nbsp;

An average good month in our market will typically have between 7,500 and 9,000 home sales. These months usually include March, April, and October. However, even a month like August, which competes with December as the slowest month for real estate, still averages around 4,500 home sales, so there is no “bad” month to sell.&nbsp;
