*Contrary to popular belief, the holiday season can be a great time to list. Here are a few reasons why.*

Many people hesitate at the idea of listing over the holiday season. Today, I’d like to address some of the reasons why selling during this time of year might actually be beneficial. To help me cover the subject, I’m joined by top agent Ali Garbero.&nbsp;

**A key benefit in listing at this time of year is that the market is full of motivated buyers.** People searching for a new home at this time of year are very serious about doing so.&nbsp;

Additionally, holiday listings see a much lower level of competition. There isn’t a ton of inventory available during these later months, so your home is going to be one of a small number of available homes.

When the snow begins to fly, there won’t be any looky-loos hanging around in the market. **Buyers who are willing to face inclement weather to look for homes this winter are truly motivated.** Between the low level of inventory and high level of motivated buyers, the holiday season creates the perfect conditions for you to obtain top dollar.&nbsp;

Also, landscaping costs can really add up when listing in the spring or summer. In winter, however, you can really take advantage of the weather and focus on the interior of your home, instead.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
