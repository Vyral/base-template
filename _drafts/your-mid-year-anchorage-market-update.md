excerpt: >-
  Unlike the lower 48 states, the Anchorage market has seen an increase in
  inventory over the last year, having risen by 7%. Where the rest of the
  country seems to be struggling with a demand that’s higher than supply, we are
  showing signs of recovering from our recession. Today I want to highlight the
  trends in the Anchorage market that will demonstrate how both buyers and
  sellers have opportunities to succeed with their transactions. To hear about
  what the market has been doing, watch my latest video.

  It’s a great time for sellers to put their homes on the market, since as
  interest rates rise, prices start to fall.
