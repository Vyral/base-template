  We have just closed on a home sale in southwest Portland and we wanted to
  share the story with you. The clients who were selling the home were a real
  pleasure to work with. Their friendly demeanor and receptiveness to my advice
  helped them to get an offer that was well over the list price. To hear more
  about these clients’ success stories, watch my latest video.

We just sold this lovely home on Texas Court in southwest Portland, and I just wanted to say that **it was a real pleasure to help good clients&nbsp;**in this transaction.

Think this was our seventh transaction in which we’ve helped them buy or sell. We were so pleased to get multiple offers on this home and to be able to sell it in just four days. This home has the highest price per square foot in the neighborhood.

A lot of credit goes to the sellers, who maintained this home beautifully and put in some lovely additions. They’re also great to work with because they followed our advice and guidance, which **resulted in an offer close to $20,000 over the list price.** We wish them the best in their new home.

If you or anyone you know needs professional representation or advice on getting top value for your home, please feel free to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you.&nbsp;
