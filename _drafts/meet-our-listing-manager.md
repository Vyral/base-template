Get to know the Carter Property Group. Today, we’d like to introduce you to Shannon Kelly, our listing manager.

As listing manager, Shannon gets involved in the process **whenever a home seller decides they want to work with us.** “I help prepare the home to go on the market,” says Shannon. Shannon lines up a professional photographer, gets all the keys necessary to access the property, and gathers background information on the home or condo.

She also puts together our online and print marketing materials and keeps everyone updated on the process until the seller gets a contract on their home.

“One of my favorite parts of the job is getting to go through the house with the photographer and making sure everything looks its best,” she says. “It’s really fun to get the look and feel of the property. I also enjoy staying on top of our online marketing presence. There are cool things going on with Facebook marketing, and **online marketing changes every day,** which I get excited about.”

A typical day for Shannon starts with making sure that everyone on the team has what they need. For example, a selling agent may have questions about how to access a property. She also puts together brochures and marketing materials, and sometimes she gets to go to a photo appointment or make keys for a property.

As for a few fun facts about Shannon: “I like to bike a lot. I’ve really gotten into biking recently; it’s my primary way of getting to work. I also have a dog that I probably talk too much about,” Shannon says, laughing. “Just ask anyone on the team.”

If you have any questions for Shannon, or anyone else in the Carter Property Group, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
