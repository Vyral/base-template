<br>A question we get asked almost every day in our business is, “**When is the best time for me to sell my house?**”&nbsp;

With our area being so dense, buying or selling a home can be done at basically any time of year. However, this doesn’t mean there aren’t seasonal factors at play. We live in a cold-weather market, which means our market cycle is different from those located in warmer climates.&nbsp;

**When the weather here starts to warm up, then the market tends to heat up too.** If you want to know when the best time to sell is, you’ve got to pay attention to current market statistics. Understanding market trends is the key to success in real estate.&nbsp;

So far this year, we’ve seen a decrease in the number of contracts being written compared what we saw this same time last year. Still, there has been a slight increase in inventory after a very long period of decreasing supply.

The market is set up statistically for a shift. With that information in mind, think about anyone you know who is thinking of selling in the next three to 18 months. Conditions are now slowly shifting toward a buyer’s market, so if you or anyone you know is thinking of selling, now is a good time to make your move.&nbsp;

**My team and I watch market statistics on a weekly basis, so we have clear evidence that this shift is on its way.**&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
