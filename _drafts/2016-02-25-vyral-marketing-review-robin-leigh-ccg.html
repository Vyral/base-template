<br /><br />&nbsp;“I’m the founder of CCG Alliance, and for about two years in my real estate and staging company, Vyral Marketing supported me expanding my contacts and staying in touch with my center of influence. I record a video they train me to record. It’s very, very easy and they provide me with the equipment. I send it off to them and they do some beautiful editing. I see how many people open the videos and [how long] they stay engaged in the show. They also help me incorporate all this into my YouTube account, my Facebook account, my blog [and more]. Vyral Marketing’s services are really comprehensive in addition to coaching ideas every week. Their staff is amazing. They make sure anything I need is taken care of. It really only takes about a half an hour a month to put everything together – it works very smoothly and it’s extremely effective.”<br /><br /><b>Robin Leigh</b>, Founder (Certified Charitable Giving Alliance)<br /><a href="http://www.ccgalliance.com/">http://www.ccgalliance.com/</a>
