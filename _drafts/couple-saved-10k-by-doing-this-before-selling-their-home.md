Did you know that our clients saved over $300k last year by only spending $400 on a pre-home inspection before listing their home?

When you go to a doctor, **you don’t know what’s wrong with you until you get a prognosis.** Finding the value of a home is quite similar -- you can’t know the price until a lot of research has been done!&nbsp;

Anyone that walks into your home and tells you a price is doing that simply to get your business; they aren’t acting in your interest. **You don’t want to hire someone who isn’t going to work on your behalf to competitively price your home.** Before you hire anyone, give them a call and ask them if they’re going to put a price on your home when they get there. If they answer affirmatively, you probably shouldn’t hire them!

When you work with us, we’re going to ask you the hard questions. In order to design a custom home selling strategy for you, we’ll start by asking why you’re selling. Then we’ll ask: What past experiences have you had with real estate? What are you expecting from the process? What are your financial goals? **The answers to these questions will help us set expectations for you** and start working to accomplish your selling goals.&nbsp;

There are a lot of factors that go into correctly pricing a home, and **a good Realtor will let you in on how they come to a certain number.** If they don’t, you may be working with an agent who will fail to get your home sold. Be sure to ask them what the absorption rate in the area is, and what comparable homes are selling for: these are just a few of the many important factors that should be looked at in the pricing process!
