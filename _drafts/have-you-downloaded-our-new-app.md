I'm very excited about the new technology we have to offer. So, today, I’d like to highlight some of these tools, which will help me better serve you as an agent and help you find your future home.

I want to start by talking about our new app. **If haven't downloaded it yet, I highly recommend that you do.** Whether you're looking to buy a new home or you just want to keep up-to-speed on home values, it's awesome.

Within the app there are a variety of ways you can search for homes, such as by the number of bedrooms or bathrooms, by price, or by area. We would love for you to try it out and give us some feedback.

One of the things we noticed among people using other apps is that they became frustrated by the amount of inaccurate information they contained. For this reason, **we are working extremely hard to to provide up-to-the-minute information for you about our properties.**

Even if you're not currently looking, this app will show you valuable information, like what your neighbors’ homes are selling for. It can also provide market snapshots to you.&nbsp;

**Another thing that I am super excited to share is that we now have Keller Mortgage available to our Idaho clients.** This mortgage, only available through Keller Williams agents, &nbsp;offers a ZeroPlus loan, helping save people thousands of dollars on a purchase or refinance. When you download the app, you can submit a loan application through get an estimate of what it will cost you to refinance or buy a new home with Keller Mortgage.

If you have any additional questions about our new app or Keller Mortgage, or if you're interested in buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to speaking with you soon.
