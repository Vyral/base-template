Although you'll want to know all there is to know about pre-approvals before searching for a new home, weeks, or even months, may pass before you’re actually ready to buy.

Most lenders are sympathetic to the time-intensive nature of buying a home, so, while your pre-approval has a “shelf life”, it won’t be an indefinite one. On average, most pre-approvals remain valid for about three months before being deemed “too old.” 

What exactly is a mortgage pre-approval? 

Consider this to be the first true step to buying a home. At the outset, you’ll get in touch with a mortgage professional and fill out an application to learn whether or not you’ll qualify for a home loan. 

How do you get the pre-approval? 

The lender will interview you to ask you questions related to your employment history and your credit score. They’ll also ask you for your W2s, your tax returns, and your bank statements. As invasive as this may seem, this information will give them the assurance that you’re qualified to purchase a home. 

Following their review, the lender will send you a pre-approval letter; this acts as a notice of good faith willingness to extend a mortgage on your behalf, and the amount you’re approved can be found therein. 

How long does a pre-approval last?

Although there’s no hard-and-fast rule for how long it’ll take to receive your pre-approval, it’ll likely be delivered to you in somewhere between 90 to 180 days. 

The three-month rule for pre-approval validity is in place because your financial life and state can change drastically in that span of time; you can purchase a new car, have a baby, lose a job, etc. 

This process is as scrupulous as it is because both the lender and seller need to have faith that the purchaser will be able to afford the note from one month to the next.
