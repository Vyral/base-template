  Today I am joined by Michael Lwin of Nona Title to discuss FIRPTA and how it
  affects foreign buyers and sellers in our Orlando market. First, what is
  FIRPTA? FIRPTA stands for the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act.
  What it is, essentially, is a withholding amount that is applied to a
  transaction when a foreign investor wants to sell a property that they have
  purchased here in the U.S. to learn more about FIRPTA and how it affects you,
  watch my latest video.

  If the property you are selling is being used as a primary residence, then you
  can bypass the FIRPTA regulation.
