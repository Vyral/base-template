{% include youtube.html %}I’m explaining the difference between appraisals and inspections.

When purchasing a home, everyone’s told to get an inspection and appraisal. However, some mistakenly think they’re the same thing.&nbsp;

**Any time you’re financing a property, your bank will hire an appraiser.** The bank you receive a loan from will use your home as collateral, and an appraisal provides proof of your property’s value. Some types of loans such as FHA, VA, and sometimes USDA have rigid requirements regarding the home’s condition, so any issues found by an appraiser must be fixed. If an appraiser says, for example, that three particular things need to be repaired, those fixes are mandatory.

An inspection is a little different. An inspector will do a more thorough examination of the house than an appraiser. **Issues found by an inspector are only recommendations,** and are completely negotiable between the buyer and seller. These may include a leaking roof, unsafe wiring, broken A/C, and more.&nbsp;

Bottom line: Appraisers look for value, inspectors look for condition. This is why it’s critical to have an agent in your corner to explain and help you through everything in a real estate transaction.&nbsp;
