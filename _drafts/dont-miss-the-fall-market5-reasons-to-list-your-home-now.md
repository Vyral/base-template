Today we’re counting down the top five reasons why fall is a good time to list and sell your home.&nbsp;<br><br>**5. It’s absolutely beautiful right now.**Your landscaping looks great. Flowers are still in bloom and the yard is green. The house looks great and your curb appeal couldn’t be better. &nbsp;<br><br>**4. It’s the perfect time to trade up to a larger home.** If you’ve been waiting for the market to turn, stop waiting. Interest rates are still really low. Homes priced under $600,000 are still selling in about two to three weeks. Homes in the higher end of the market take longer to sell, so there is more for you to choose from. The cost for your loan will be really low right now, so make sure you take advantage of the market and move up to a larger home.&nbsp;<br><br>**3. Buyers have been waiting for new homes to come on the market.**&nbsp;A lot of homes that were on the market have sold. The ones that are leftover have been on the market for a long time, and buyers don’t want them. They are waiting for great homes to come on the market. These homes should be in a great location, in great condition, and competitively priced.&nbsp;

**2. Buyers are highly motivated right now.**&nbsp;These buyers want to buy homes. They are not coming up to Tahoe for vacation like they do in the summer; they specifically want to buy a home for the winter. Instead of getting 10 or 15 showings like you do in the summer, in the fall you’ll get two to four showings. Those buyers are ready to write offers.&nbsp;<br><br>**1. Inventory is shrinking right now.**&nbsp;This is the best reason to sell your home in the fall. There is a smaller number of homes available than the number of sales. For example, in August of 2017, we sold 223 houses. In September of 2016, only 206 homes sold. So, inventory is shrinking but sales stay up.<br><br>Don’t wait for next spring. List your home this fall and enjoy a successful home sale.&nbsp;<br><br>If you have any other questions about selling this fall or you would like to know more about preparing your home for the market, just give me a call or send me an email.
