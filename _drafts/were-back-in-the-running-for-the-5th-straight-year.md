  For the past four years, we’ve been honored to hold the title of “Best real
  estate team in Northwest Arkansas.” It’s that time of year to defend our
  crown, but we need your help. There are a few different ways you can vote, and
  they’re both really short and easy. You can vote for us directly on the web,
  or you can vote for us via text. To get more details about both methods, watch
  this short video.
