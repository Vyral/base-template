We get asked all the time about opportunities for real estate investment. One of the things we think is pretty unique and interesting is the Airbnb strategy.

Rather than investing in normal rental property where you lease it out on an annual basis and then renew that every year, Airbnb rentals are short term and average a much higher price per night, so your cash flow is going to be huge.

There are three important factors to consider when using the Airbnb strategy for investing.

**1. Location and zoning.** You need to be in an area of town that allows short-term rentals. There are areas where you are not allowed to take advantage of this strategy, and even though some investors bend the rules, we wouldn’t feel comfortable showing you anything that could potentially be a risky investment. It’s best to approach investing in Airbnb rentals in a legal fashion so you don’t have any surprises later on.

**2. Using a management company that specializes in Airbnb rentals.** This is important because there is a lot that goes into moving somebody in and out, which is sometimes on a daily basis. The whole idea is to never have your phone ring. Using a management company means you don’t have to worry about the day-to-day upkeep, like if there is enough soap or clean towels. In fact, there’s a management company here in Portland you can check out. Just go to whitespiderpdx.com. You’ll pay more money to use one of these companies, but trust me, it’s worth it. The profit you’ll get from the investment will more than pay for it.

**3. Having a good exit strategy.** Like with all investments, we like to have two exit strategies. The first is to make sure we find a property that is zoned right and has strong appreciation so in the event we need to sell it quickly, you won’t have to take much of a haircut. Second, if you don’t want to sell it, we can also find something in an area with strong rental demand so you can switch it from Airbnb to a normal rental property with an annual lease.
