Recently, I’ve been receiving a lot of questions from people who want to renovate either a home they’re trying to purchase or one they already own: **Are there any loans that can help with home renovations?**

Definitely. There are a number of loan programs that allow for this, the most common of which is called the Fannie Mae Homestyle Renovation Loan.

This wonderful loan program allows people who own primary residences, second homes, or investment properties to renovate their property to their liking, with very generous allowances in terms of repairs, instead of moving in and waiting a few years to make the changes they want.

These types of loan programs are more complicated than the usual: **They typically take about 45 days to close, there will be general contractors involved, and there will even be a contingency reserve fund of about 10% of the total renovation costs.**

For example, if you’re going to purchase a home for $400,000, and there will be $50,000-worth of renovation costs, that means there will be a $5,000 contingency reserve. When you add up all those numbers, the sales price, in a lender’s eyes, is going to be $455,000. Therefore, any down payment that you make on that home will be based on the $455,000 figure.

Furthermore, by the IRS’s own rules, when you go to “substantially improve the property” via renovation, they will classify that debt as “acquisition indebtedness,” instead of “equity indebtedness,” meaning **there are also tax benefits available for homeowners who take advantage of this excellent loan program.**

If you’re looking to purchase a home that needs renovation or have any other questions about home loan programs, please feel free to reach out to me. I’d be honored to help
