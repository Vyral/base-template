Today we’re going to focus on a specific tax planning strategy: capital gains tax harvesting. This strategy isn’t for everybody. **If you meet the following criteria, however, you should seriously consider it:**

* Between the ages of 60 and 70
* Haven’t started the required minimum distributions from your IRA account yet
* In the 15% of the federal capital gains tax bracket
* Have a retail investment account with long-term capital gains {% include pullquote.html %}

If you check off these boxes, then you need to consider capital gains tax harvesting before the end of the year. When you’re in that 15% tax bracket, you pay $0 in federal taxes on the capital gains you realize. **This is a very powerful strategy that you can use to increase your spending money, or reinvest right back into the same investments.**

If you think this strategy might be a good idea for yourself or for someone you know, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.
