Are you planning on shopping for a home this spring? If so, I’ve got a few tips that could help you save time and money when you do so.&nbsp;

First of all, get into contact with a good lender. This will help you understand the financing options that are available to you. **Understanding your current credit score, your budget, and what loan programs you might qualify for will set you many, many steps ahead** in the home buying process.

The second tip I recommend you implement into your home search is to clearly identify the area you want to live in. Once you’ve done this, reach out to a professional real estate agent who can set you up on a customized automated home search.&nbsp;

This will make the process so much easier for you, since it will eliminate hours of time you would otherwise spend searching through listings on websites like Zillow and Trulia. **Instead of scouring the internet for homes yourself, your Realtor can send you email or text alerts** when homes matching your search criteria come onto the market.

My next tip is to obtain and use the HAR app, which is Houston-specific. After getting access to this app from me or another Realtor, you can use it to search for local homes, yourself.&nbsp;

Finally, there is one last simple tip I recommend: Do your homework. Educating yourself on not only the home buying process process but also on the neighborhoods you’re shopping in can make a big difference in your home search. **On top of researching neighborhoods online, I also recommend you visit them in person.** It is always a good idea to be informed about our market, in general, as well.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
