If youâ€™re in the process of preparing to list, certain small home upgrades can go a long way in boosting your selling success.

One of the things that you can do to make your home look more updated is to **change your lighting.** Chrome or silver lighting fixtures are both very popular right now.

**Another thing that you could do is repaint.** Giving your walls a fresh coat of paint can help the whole home feel fresh and new.
