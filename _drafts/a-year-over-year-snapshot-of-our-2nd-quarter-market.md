excerpt: >-
  Today we’ll do a quick market recap by comparing the second quarter market
  statistics from the Wasatch Front to the second quarter statistics of 2017.
  Thus far, the number of home sales has risen 5%. The average sale price has
  also risen 9%. Interest rates rose too, but there’s no need to panic over
  that. To find out why and get all the latest news and numbers from our second
  quarter, watch my latest video.
