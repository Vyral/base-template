  Today we’ll do a quick market recap by comparing the second quarter market
  statistics from the Wasatch Front to the second quarter statistics of 2017.
  Thus far, the number of home sales has risen 5%. The average sale price has
  also risen 9%. Interest rates rose too, but there’s no need to panic over

What’s the latest news from our Wasatch Front market? Here are the latest year-over-year numbers from our second quarter through June 21.&nbsp;

**Over 11,000 homes have sold so far, which is nearly a 5% increase compared to the 10,500 that sold during 2017’s second quarter.** We also saw a 9% increase in the average sale price. Interest rates rose from 3.91% to 4.62% for 30-year mortgages, and experts agree that we’ll probably see rates over 5% by the end of the year.&nbsp;

There’s no need to panic, though. Over the last 42 years, the average interest rate is 8.4%, so we’re still well below that mark. Even if we go back as late as 1990 and hit the reset button, the average interest rate is still 6.6%.

**The average days on market dropped 10% to 41 days, and our level of inventory for all housing types is 3.3 months.** Remember, all markets are driven by supply and demand. Generally, a market is considered “level” when it has between five and six months of inventory. Anything below that is considered a seller’s market; anything above is considered a buyer’s market.&nbsp;

For homes priced under $350,000 along the Wasatch Front, there’s only a 2.5-month supply of homes. Between $350,000 and $500,000, there’s just above a four-month supply. Above $500,000, there’s a 5.5-month supply.&nbsp;

As you can see, entry-level home availability is low, and I expect that we’ll continue to see tight inventory and lots of competition in that price range throughout the rest of the year.&nbsp;

If you’re selling your home, now’s a great time to act, but there are still strategies you must use to get the most for your home, so make sure you talk to an experienced agent. If you’re a buyer, you absolutely must work with an experienced buyer specialist to find and close on the home you want.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions about our Wasatch Front market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.&nbsp;
