When I first got into real estate sales, I quickly began to secure about one transaction per month. Not long after that, I was ready to transition my business to the next level—but I wasn’t sure how to do it.

From there, I decided it was time to seek the advice of those who already had a wealth of experience and knowledge in the industry. I met up with five top-producing agents and asked if they would be willing to schedule regular mastermind group meetings with me so that we could all grow from each other moving forward. They agreed, and these meetings had a near-instant impact.

**Just one month later, my business tripled and continued to grow over time thanks to my connections with these seasoned professionals.** I made over $250,000 in gross commission income last year working part-time while I was working full-time as a coach for agents at one of the most productive real estate offices in our state. &nbsp;

This year, my aspirations have changed. I plan to grow my brokerage to have over 100 agents. I also plan to grow my property management company to have over 200 properties. Meanwhile, on top of both of these goals, I will be coaching dozens and dozens of agents toward their own success in real estate.

So, how in the world am I going to manage to make all of these goals come true? Very simply: **By continuing to meet with that same mastermind group three times each year.** We lock ourselves away, take apart our businesses, and then put them back together. By drawing on the expertise of agents who are producing above the level I’m currently at, I’m able to continue growing my business more and more all the time.

This is my success story. Now, it’s time for you to write yours. If you aspire to reach a higher level of success in this business, the best advice I can give you is to find people who are already there. Connect to between three and five individuals who you consider mentors and form a mastermind group.

**Within my own mastermind group, every single person who is involved has experienced explosive growth in their business.** So don’t try to grow your business alone. Draw on the successes and failures of agents around you. These connections will be the key to your success.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
