The real estate market is cranking in North San Diego County in spite of what is going on in the rest of the world. Here are a few stats to share with you, please click the video to see the full report.

* The average sales price is up ~6% year over year for detached homes in North County. This time last year it was around $901,000, it is now around $955,000.
