Your mortgage lender will not only be with you every step of the way in the buying process, but long after as well. Find out why in today’s message.&nbsp;

When I’m working with a buyer and we’re able to close on their new home, they almost always ask, “What happens now?” They often think this is the end of the line, but in reality, the closing only marks the start of our relationship.&nbsp;

Now that you have your new mortgage, your circumstances will change from one year to the next. As your professional debt managers, it’s our job to regularly communicate with you to make sure the mortgage you’re tied to is appropriate for your needs at the present time. This is called an **annual mortgage review.**&nbsp;

During these calls, clients ask about all sorts of supplemental options. Some are in a best-case scenario with their current mortgage; others are able to refinance and lower their mortgage payment, thereby freeing up cash flow to invest; still others take cash out to pay off higher interest rate debt or allocate their cash-out proceeds to higher-returning investments.&nbsp;

Upon review, we might find that your homeowners insurance is exorbitantly high, and in that case, we can point you in the right direction for a second opinion. The same goes for your property taxes: If you feel that they’re unjustly high, we can discuss this further and work with you to protest it during the next available window.&nbsp;

If you or someone you know would like to go through this exercise, **please visit [TheBetzTeamAnnualMortgageReview.com](TheBetzTeamAnnualMortgageReview.com){: target="_blank"} and complete our short questionnaire.** From there, I’ll reach out to you and we can get the conversation started.

If you have any further questions or would like more information, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We want to be your lender for life, and going through an annual mortgage review with you helps us ensure that your needs are being met at every stage of homeownership.&nbsp;
