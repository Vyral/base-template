Before I begin, I wanted to point a few features of my blog. If you’re interested in selling your home, we offer a free property valuation. If you are looking for a property, we can set you up with MLS and property searches.<br /><br />&nbsp;<b>What is the Difference Between an Active and Passive Agent</b><br /><b><br /></b>The difference with an active agent is that they will be out prospecting for your buyers. I will actually pre-market your home before it even hits the market. I belong to a group of a about 20 tops agents here in Anchorage and before your home reaches the MLS, I have already given them details about your property. I will price watch to see what is going on in your neighborhood and also watch your comparables to make sure that we’re on the right track for pricing.<br /><br /><b>What Separates Top Agents from Others&nbsp;</b><br /><b>&nbsp;</b> <br />One of the things that a larger agent has the ability to do is offer multiple websites. We offer our clients 250-500 different websites that your property will go out to. Websites are so important in today’s market; 93% of all buyers come from the internet! This leads me to my last point which is how I will properly stage your home. I will make sure it’s prepared for showings by having it neat, clean and organized. Most buyers buy homes off of emotion and having pictures of a clean home will get buyers from the internet into your home.<br /><br />If you’re interested in selling a property, click the link below of call me at (907) 240-2804. Thank you and have a wonderful day!
