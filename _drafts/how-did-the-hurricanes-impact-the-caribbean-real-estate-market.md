  I’m coming to you today from the beautiful Caribbean island of Santa Lucia.
  Though the recent hurricanes had severe impacts on the infrastructure of the
  various countries and the lives of their people, Santa Lucia was untouched.
  Sadly, in places like Puerto Rico, there have been more than 4,000
  foreclosures and a huge drop in prices. This may be an opportune time to look
  into investing in their real estate market. For more information, watch my
  latest video.

This week, we’re on the lovely island of Santa Lucia in the Caribbean. We’ve been looking at properties ranging from $300,000 to $3 million with other international Realtors.

We were interested in the effect that the recent hurricanes had on the real estate market. Puerto Rico has had a lot of business failures and employment problems, which resulted in over 4,000 foreclosures and a 50% decrease in prices in some areas.

Because of this, there are some great buying opportunities in the short term. Places like St. Croix are still facing a lot of turmoil, so it might be better to wait in those cases. Santa Lucia, however, is completely unaffected.

If you know anyone who’s interested in learning more about investing and purchasing in the Caribbean, I have contacts and information for you that will help. Feel free to reach out to me, I’d love to talk with you.
