As Al explains, this happens from time to time and the buyer still has the option to purchase the home. Al stated that <b>if the buyer does choose to purchase the property, there is typically an arrangement between the buyer and seller where the seller lowers the asking price of the home so the buyer can close on their loan.</b></span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />As a lender, <b>Al confirms that the loan amount will always be based off of the appraised value, not the purchase price if it is higher.</b> In these situations, the buyer doesn’t want to overpay for the house and the seller still wants to see the house;<b> in order to move the purchase forward, the seller will adjust the purchase price in line with the appraised value.</b> If the buyer was willing to pay the seller’s asking price, they would have to come up with cash to cover the difference.</span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />In reaction to this situation, I have often been asked by both buyers and sellers if they could obtain a second appraisal. <b>Al says that they are more than welcome to, but they cannot use it due to government regulation.</b> Also as a result of government regulation, appraisers are chosen on a random basis. When ordering an appraisal, Al is in no control over who the appraiser would be and the decision dictated by the bank.</span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />If you have any questions about the appraisal or financing process, give myself or Al Ripple a call at (414) 852-7022. Thanks and have a great day!</span></span><b><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></span></b></div>
