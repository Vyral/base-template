The numbers are out for the first quarter of 2018, so I want to share a couple of stats with you today.

The inventory for single-family detached homes is down 10% from the first quarter of last year, and **the number of sales is up by 7%.**

If you’re thinking about selling your home, now is a good time. If you’re thinking about buying, now may also be a good time, because as inventory decreases and demand increases, prices will also go up.

If you have any questions or would like to know more about the market in your specific neighborhood, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
