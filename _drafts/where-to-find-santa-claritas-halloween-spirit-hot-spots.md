Halloween is one of the best holidays of the year. It’s a time for celebration, parties, and more.

Being such a family-centric community, Santa Clarita really lends itself to a lot of Halloween activity. Today, I want to bring you some information about some of the best areas around Santa Clarita when it comes to Halloween family fun, like trick-or-treating.

First, let’s start off with Bridgeport. I lived in Bridgeport myself for a while, and it’s a fantastic area. There’s a lot to do for kids, but also for the whole family. This is one neighborhood that is absolutely great for trick-or-treating. **Another great benefit is how flat the area is, so walking around will be less of a chore.**

West Hills Valencia, where I now live, is another great place for kids on Halloween. The number of hills makes walking a little slower, but there are plenty of street parties and houses along the way.

If trick-or-treating isn’t necessarily how you want to spend the holiday, there are many other things happening in our community. **The Tournament Players Club (TPC) and the Paseo Club both also have activities going on for the holiday.**

Overall, there’s going to be a lot of fun stuff going on this Halloween.

Santa Clarita is a place for family. Why not take advantage of the great opportunities our community has during this holiday and all year long?

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
