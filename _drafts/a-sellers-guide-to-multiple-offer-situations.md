Should sellers always accept the highest and best when faced with a multiple offer situation?

Not necessarily. There are a few additional factors sellers should consider when choosing an offer.

It’s important for sellers to examine an offer as a whole. Terms and price are two significant points, but you should also discern whether a buyer is offering cash or using financing to purchase a home. And, if they are using financing, you should determine what kind of loan they’ll be applying to the sale.

The amount a buyer is offering for a down payment also matters, as does the concessions they’re asking for. A cash buyer may ask for more concessions, while a financed buyer may be more flexible. That said, the key to choosing the best offer from among several is to examine each as a whole.

Keeping every aspect of an offer in mind will position you to secure the best possible deal and stay protected throughout the transaction.

Beyond just earning a high price and getting good terms, it’s important to make sure you aren’t selecting an offer that is likely to fall through later on.
