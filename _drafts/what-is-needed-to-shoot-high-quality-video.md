Today’s video is about how to make good video. Specifically, what you’ll need to shoot and edit your own videos to send out to your database.

If you’re going to shoot video to send out to your database, you need to make sure it’s good video. To give you a good idea of where to start, I’ll tell you what I use to shoot my videos.

First, let’s get into the gadgets you’ll need. Obviously, you’ll first need a camera. Believe it or not, I use my **iPhone X**. It has decent built-in audio, but you’ll need to do better than that if you’re shooting video.

An inexpensive option you can try is a lavalier microphone, which has a cord that you can plug into your phone on one end and clip onto your collar at the other. If you want to upgrade, you can try a **condenser microphone**, which people commonly use to record music.

Next, you’ll need a **selfie stick**. I use the Neewer selfie stick, which is a little different than a regular one in that you can also use it as a tripod.

After that, you’ll need some **good lighting**. The light fixture I’m using to record the video above is what’s called a “key light,” and it’s small enough to be mounted on top of my tripod/selfie stick.

Lastly, you’ll need a **gimbal**, which is a pivot support that you can attach to your selfie stick that automatically rotates the angle of the camera. If you’re shooting the interior of a house or doing a walk-through of a large area, you definitely need a gimbal.

After you’re done shooting the video, you’ll need to edit it, and there are three programs I recommend for doing so:

* [**iMovie**](https://www.apple.com/imovie/){: target="_blank"}: If you use Mac products like I do, this is an obvious choice since it’s their built-in software for video editing.
* [**Final Cut Pro X**](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/){: target="_blank"}: This program is a little more advanced and costs around $99.
* [**LumaFusion**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumafusion/id1062022008?mt=8){: target="_blank"}: This is a great program if you edit on your iPad.

If you’re interested in setting up a video blog, one platform you can try using is Vyral Marketing. This is the platform I use, and they offer a marketing program that pretty much takes care of everything for you. All you have to do is shoot the video.

If you have any other questions about this or any other topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
