Zillow has been in the news a lot lately; but, for all the wrong reasons.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>It’s hands down the most popular real estate website out there, but it’s very inaccurate when it comes to providing a value range for your home. Their valuation is called a Zestimate, and we see it causing problems between buyers and sellers all the time. If you’re a seller, you don’t want to rely exclusively on this Zestimate.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Spencer Rascoff, the CEO of Zillow, recently stated **that the national median error rate of a Zestimate is 8%.** If we take that same 8% rate and apply it to the median price of a Portland home, you’re looking at a $35,000, $40,000, or even $50,000 margin of error. That a huge amount to be wrong by. In 2016, Rascoff’s own home sold for 40% below its Zestimate.

Zillow is now facing a lawsuit from a homeowner claiming that her home’s Zestimate devalued it and prevented her from selling it for the price it was truly worth. This development was alarming enough that Rascoff created a contest for anyone who could come up with a modified algorithm to help Zillow determine more accurate prices for homes. This contest has a grand prize of $1 million.**&nbsp;
