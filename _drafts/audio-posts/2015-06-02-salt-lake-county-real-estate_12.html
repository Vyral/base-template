He had a lot of experience and he was very well-informed. We listed our house, and it sold within a few days! We had a different agent before, and the biggest problem with them was we never knew where we stood. Josh had great communication skills, and I really appreciated that!"  <strong>- Cheryl Saunders, Home Seller</strong>
