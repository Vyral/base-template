I registered on the website and they called me the next day to set up an appointment to meet with Mary Ann. In two weeks,  we were listing my house! The weekend that we had the open house, there were five offers and we closed a month later.  Mary Ann always went above and beyond  with everything she did.  She was always quick to answer back and proved to be extremely flexible. She is a go-getter! Mary Ann knows exactly what she’s doing and keeps everything on schedule. She was great to work with!”  <strong>- Jessica Smith, Home Seller</strong>
