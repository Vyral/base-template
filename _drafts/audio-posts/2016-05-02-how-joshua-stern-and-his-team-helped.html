The buyer, we&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">thought they could get qualified but they were unable to get qualified. The second one did go through&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">completion, so we sold it with minimal time. He met with us a year and a half ago about whether or not&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">the property could be sold and she could walk away. It was my mother in law’s home. Unfortunately, at&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">the time, the market would not support her high mortgage balance. We waited a year and I kept in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">touch with him and when we realized she couldn’t live independently anymore we called him again. He&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">came to the home and each time he provided a really nice documented book of the area with pictures.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It was a really nice set up, even though he didn’t have my business yet. On the second one he came&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">through gave us some recommendations we could do to improve the value of the home. We worked on&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">that for a couple of months and then called him and back and signed with him to list it. “</span></b><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>-Heather</b></span>
