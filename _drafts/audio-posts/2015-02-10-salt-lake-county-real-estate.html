I’m in Virginia, but we found Josh after going through my son’s paperwork. Josh had sold him the home in Salt Lake back in 2006. We went to Salt Lake City, and Josh gave us a very straightforward presentation. Josh first gave us different ways for us to sell the house to my friend’s kids, and when that didn’t work out, he put the house on the market. I went back to Virginia, and Josh worked with some of my friends in Salt Lake City to sell the house. He kept me updated throughout, and the whole process was so easy, even though it was long distance!"  <strong>-Una White, Home Seller</strong>
