The pictures went up on a Tuesday night, we had an open house on Saturday and then we got 4 offers! He absolutely lived up to his reputation. It as a quick transaction, he was professional, and he always followed up. Every step of the process, he’d send me a video saying here’s where we’re at in the process and here’s what’s going to happen. For me, that was above and beyond, I’ve never heard of an agent doing that and taking that kind of time." </i></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">- Phil Hahn, Home Seller</span>  <br /><br /><center><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/172450869&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false" width="100%"></iframe></center><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large;">Joshua Stern Reviews Paul Smith</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">How we helped Paul sell his home by helping him through every step of the process</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>"When we planned to move to Portland to be closer to family, we knew we were going to talk to Joshua right from the start because we’d heard about him on the news. He came out and did a market survey and told us that he could sell our home. Lo and behold, the very first person that walked through the door bought it. It was so quick and Joshua helped us through every step of the way. It was a pleasant situation and he did everything he said he was going to!" </i></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">- Paul Smith, Home Seller</span>
