Before we switched to them, the house was on the market for six and a half months. There were some offers, but they all fell through. Josh just had techniques and outlets that our previous Realtor did not have. We sold the house in seven weeks with Josh. They got back to me, and his whole team just did such a good job. I would recommend him to anybody.'  <strong>-Laurel Howard, Home Seller</strong>
