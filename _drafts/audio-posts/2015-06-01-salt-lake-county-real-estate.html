He was very professional. The first time we worked with him, we just randomly called Keller Williams because we needed an agent. We needed to fly in 24 hours later, buy a house in 24 hours, and fly back. He was very accommodating. He really got us acclimated to Salt Lake City, so he was more than just somebody who showed us through houses!"  <strong>- Kimberly Lewis, Home Buyer</strong>
