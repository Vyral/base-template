Initially, we went with another real estate firm. We had twelve showings in seven months with them. My wife did some research, and Josh came in. He’s on the ball. He’s sharp. He has a plan, and the passion and energy to execute that plan. He sold the house in three weeks. Any time I brought up some kind of issue, it always impressed me that he had a plan. He just goes right into problem-solving mode."  <strong>- Gary Fuller, Home Seller</strong>
