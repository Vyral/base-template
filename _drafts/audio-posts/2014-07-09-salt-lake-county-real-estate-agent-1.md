He was so professional and timely that it made selling my motherâ€™s house so much easier. My mother had passed away and Joshua showed up and had a market analysis done for us. He really bent over backwards to make it happen and he did an amazing job!"</i></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>-Paige McCleary, Home Seller</b></span>
