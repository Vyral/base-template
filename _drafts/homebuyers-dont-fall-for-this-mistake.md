  In today’s market, many buyers have been undergoing a trial and error process.
  These buyers have been on the market making failing offers over and over
  again, and today I’d like to share some information that could prevent you
  from making the same mistakes. Our market right now is very competitive, so
  making lowball offers simply won’t cut it. To learn more about how to win in
  today’s hot market, watch this short video.

I’ve been seeing a lot of buyers lose out on properties lately because they don’t understand today’s real estate environment. **We currently have a tremendous imbalance between qualified buyers and quality inventory.** This creates a competitive market where the highest and best offers typically win.

Buyers who encounter these situations are often initially excited to put forward their offer, but ultimately fall back into the old mentality of bidding below asking price.

In a hot market, though, this strategy doesn’t work. Unfortunately, it sometimes takes buyers putting forward several failed offers to realize this. Buyers are indeed at a disadvantage in our current market. **And the longer buyers wait for the right home, the more competition they will be up against.**

Beyond that, buyers who have already been on the market for some time will have the upper hand over buyers just now beginning their home search. But while learning from past mistakes can be an effective way to get ahead, I recommend skipping the mistakes other buyers have made altogether. If you’re serious about purchasing a home, put your best offer in first.

**Most properties on today’s market are very fairly priced, so you will absolutely be able to capture a good deal if you put forward a strong offer with the help of a quality agent.** So do yourself a favor and listen to your Realtor. They know what they’re talking about and will be a great resource in helping you secure the right property for your needs.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
