<center>Have you filed your homestead exemption yet? Don’t wait too much longer—the deadline is April 30.</center>

If you bought a home in 2017 and you haven’t done so yet, please make sure that you file your homestead exemption.

If you are living in your primary residence in the state of Texas, you can get a discount on your taxes by filing for the homestead exemption. **You have to file by April 30.**

Check out the websites for Travis County, Williamson County, and Hayes County to get the direct links to these forms. [HYPERLINK EACH COUNTY]

Don’t get scammed by any junk mail sent to your home that asks you to pay a fee to file for your exemption. **It’s free to file! There is no fee.**&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!<br>&nbsp;
