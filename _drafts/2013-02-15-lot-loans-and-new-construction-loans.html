Partly because the demand is rising and partly because our economy is finally rising up to the challenge that many in the construction industry had to face after our housing market crash several years ago.<br /><br />But today’s a new day and lenders out there are willing and eager to loan money to qualified future homeowners. We talked with Allan Ripple of Johnson Bank, who shared some of the excellent program his bank offers to people looking to build their dream home on a lot and those that just want to secure that piece of paradise to build on it later.<br /><br /><b><span style="font-size: large;">New Construction Loans Offer Financial Flexibility</span></b><br />These adjustable rate loans are offered in 1-year, 3-year, 5-year or 7-year terms depending on the end goal of each construction project. One of the greatest benefits of these loans is that during the first 12 months, the construction period requires only a payment obligation of the interest accrued on the amount drawn. In other words, borrowers are only paying interest on the money that the contractor draws to build the house during the first 12 months of the loan. This is a huge financial benefit that can easily offset some of the otherwise daunting expenses that come with a resale home purchase.<br /><br />During this time, there is no need for Private Mortgage Insurance plus the minimum down payment on the loan is only 5% of the total loan amount. Once the house is built, borrowers have the option to convert the construction loan to a regular 30-year fixed rate loan, which would result in a new amortization schedule starting from that point on. Private Mortgage Insurance would be collected in cases where a 20% down payment was not made on the 30-year fixed loan.<br /><br /><b><span style="font-size: large;">Vacant Land Loans Are Perfect for Short-Term Uses</span></b><br />There are also some loan products designed to assist buyers that are not quite ready to build but have found the land on which they would eventually like to build their home. Done as renewable balloon loans, borrowers have the option to choose 1-year, 2-year or 3-year terms with the expectation that these loans will mature.<br /><br />For the greatest financial benefit, however, the general consensus is to close on both the land and the construction of the home at the same time. This product requires a 15% down payment for lots that are fully improved with property subdivision clearance from the municipality, road infrastructure plus utility connections at street level.<br />~<br />For more information on how you can take advantage of these great loan products – or if you are looking to buy, sell or invest in a property, we invite you to contact us today!
