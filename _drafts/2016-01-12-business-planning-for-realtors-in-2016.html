<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One of my favorite things to do around the New Year is to plan for my business. <b>I like strategizing and setting out goals for myself and my team to accomplish in the upcoming year.&nbsp;</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I wonder about how my team will get more leads, how we will make our customers happier, and how we might help more people to buy and sell houses.<b> There's always something that you could be improving upon.&nbsp;</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I would love to sit down with you and discuss your goals in 2016. If you haven't written anything down, I urge you to contact me and we can discuss some improvements that need to be made within your business. <b>This meeting is free-of-charge and there is no obligation to work with me in any way.</b> I simply want to help you reach your goals.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I look forward to hearing from you!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span>
