Today I’ll let you in on one of the dirty little secrets of the real estate industry.&nbsp;

That secret is this: **In many brokerages, your broker doesn’t really care whether you ever sell a house or not.** This is because many brokerages are structured to make money on agents whether or not they ever achieve any type of success. Brokerages charge all types of monthly fees and dues that allow brokers to get rich while agents starve.&nbsp;

Personally, I’m offended by this type of thing. That’s why, at Abby Realty, we don’t make a cent until our agents have a closing. Even then, our modest fees are capped, because we’re committed to allowing agents who make the money keep that money in their own pocket.&nbsp;

It’s very contrarian, and frankly, it’s why Abby Realty is a disruptor in the Houston real estate market. **If you feel like I do, though, and it upsets you to see brokers take so much money to the bank while their agents struggle, give me a call.** We have a lot in common, and we should talk and see if there are ways we can help each other.&nbsp;

It’s my job to help agents achieve at any level, so if you have any questions or you’d like to talk more about this subject, give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to speak with you.
