I get a lot of questions about what the requirements are for a room to be considered a proper bedroom.

I reached out to a couple of local appraisers who let me know that **bedrooms do not actually require a closet to be considered a bedroom**. However, **a bedroom must have a window, and that window has to be large enough to enter and exit for safety purposes**. They may also take into account other things such as a door for privacy and whether you have to walk through a different room to get to that bedroom.

If youâ€™re looking to sell your home, have any questions, or would like some more information, reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you.
