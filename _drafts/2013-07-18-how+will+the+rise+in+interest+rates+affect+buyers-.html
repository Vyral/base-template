Thank you for joining us on our video blog today!</span></span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />We’ve had a lot of people ask us how these rising interest rates will affect buyers and sellers in the summer months. Well, in the past 60 days a lot of buyers have rushed into the market. We are seeing this rush because bond prices have fallen causing interest rates to go up. In the past 30 days, interest rates have jumped up about one percent.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: black;"><br /><b>How does this affect sellers?</b></span></span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b><br /></b>We’ve seen a record number of listings this year. And they are flying off the market; average days on market is only 51 days.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />Another great piece of news for sellers is we are getting 98.3% of the listed price! Inventory is so low, that sellers are able to stand firm in their price. It is a really good time to be a seller!</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br />Thank you again for watching! If you have any questions or are ready to get your home on the market call us at 903.561.2600!</span></span></div>
