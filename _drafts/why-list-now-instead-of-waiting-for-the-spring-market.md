There is a common misconception that it’s best to wait until spring to sell your home. Today, I’m having a little happy hour chat with my listing specialist, Chelsea Fratelli, to discuss why it’s best to get a jumpstart on the spring market now.&nbsp;

Most sellers feel that there are more buyers in the spring market than there are in the winter months. These sellers think that by listing in the spring, they will sell faster and at a better price.&nbsp;

**While this may have been true in the past, it’s not true in today’s market.** There are many reasons why.&nbsp;

One is that foot traffic is up for winter listings. In the past, there has been little to no activity during the holiday season or winter months. This year alone, activity has skyrocketed. Our current listings have showings every day.&nbsp;

Not only that, winter listings used to be on the market for six months. **Now, they are selling in about two months, which is a great reason to list your home now.&nbsp;**<br>&nbsp;

Fewer homes on the market means more access to buyers. You also have the chance to sell your home faster and for a higher price.&nbsp;

In addition to that, you will have less competition by listing your home now. If every potential seller is waiting for the spring market and you put your home on the market now, your home has a better chance of standing out. The buyers who are in the market now are ready and willing to purchase, and you will have a great chance at getting top dollar.

**It’s great to know that our market has turned around in recent years,** as we are seeing more consistent activity all year long, rather than in just the spring and summer months.&nbsp;

I would like to thank Chelsea for sitting down with me today. If you have any questions about selling your home or about real estate in general, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
