  If you’re not satisfied with your experience at your current brokerage or
  firm, making a change might be the right way to go. Today I have one of our
  own team members, Alyson Beasley, with me to discuss her positive experience
  with us. Perhaps you’ve already learned that in some traditional brokerages,
  agents are only out for themselves. McIntosh Realty does things differently by
  providing not only leads, but also systems that nurture those leads and help
  them succeed. To hear more about why you should consider joining the McIntosh
  Realty Team, watch my latest video.

Are you an agent looking to increase your production? If this is true for you, or if you’re simply considering a change in your career, I’ve got an important message for you. Today I’m here with Alyson Beasley, a team member of McIntosh Realty, to discuss the positive team experience and atmosphere our team prides itself on.

Here are Alyson’s thoughts about joining our team:

“Everyone at McIntosh Realty is so supportive of each other in working toward the same goals. **In some traditional brokerages, it seems like everybody’s out for themselves**; they don’t necessarily have the relationship with other agents that we get here.

“This is a firm that provides agents leads. In fact, not only do they provide leads to the agents, but **there are systems and processes in place that nurture those leads successfully and bring them to the finish line.** My role really provides an opportunity for an agent to spend less time on the phone qualifying leads.”

Your experience as a member of the McIntosh Realty Team may be a little different from what you’ve experienced in the past. **We’ve got flexible commission plans**, we encourage agents to bring their own business, there’s a higher commission split for someone who has their own business, and we also encourage agents (as buyer’s or seller’s agents) to explore the other side of transactions.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss the possibility of making a change, please feel free to reach out to me. I’d love the opportunity to speak and share in detail what you could stand to gain by switching to the McIntosh Realty Team.
