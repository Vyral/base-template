In our first episode of Level Up with Rosie Hayer, we face the crisis head-on and start the COVID-19 conversation. Here, we have Melanie Kenneman, the team leader in the KW Austin SW Market Center, sharing her perspective about what makes an industry thrive during a crisis.

<br>**Stepping up**

The pandemic came without warning; there was no playbook to refer to, and for a short while, it was difficult for everyone to have a good grasp of what’s happening. But Melanie reminds us that when confusion arises, it shows who can step up and decide proactively.

As for real estate, keeping up with the changes did not happen overnight. Building a sense of security was at the core of the solution. It was essential for companies to secure the safety of their agents so that they are in the right headspace to address the concerns of their clients. Purchasing properties is such a life-changing decision, and situating those choices in the time of a pandemic, makes it even more challenging. But to keep real estate up and running, it entails reinvention and the willingness to turn the page.&nbsp;

<br>**Support for success**

Sparking change is not just about knowing what to do next. It’s about taking action. “We were built for this,” Melanie shares how Keller Williams &nbsp;has leveraged resources to bolster its growth from the very beginning. So in these harrowing times when a crisis is at the forefront, we are primed to adapt and evolve.

There is no better time than now to start meaningful conversations with our clients, share technological resources, and encourage them to build a positive mindset. After all, self-care is of paramount importance.&nbsp;

By providing them with the support they need, we inspire them to come out of this crisis with a stronger faith to their vocation, a clear mind that understands what matters, and confidence to let go of circumstances they can’t control. Through this, we’re building a community of realtors who care for their clients, just when we needed them the most.

<br>**Sharing spaces**

We’re living in a time when work and domestic life meddle with each other. Instead of seeing this as a burden, Melanie emphasizes that we take this time to reset, remember, and reconnect. As we build the new normal, clarity and a sense of community will pave our way to a better future.

It pays to know the rules, to understand how they will affect our personal and professional lives, and to adapt to the ever-changing nature of our current society. We have to start working with our communities and think about the bigger picture when making day-to-day decisions. This interconnectedness will influence the success of real estate as we build solutions together for the greater good.

<br>**Sailing through**

When asked about the changes that she foresees for the industry, Melanie mainly talks about two things: communication and time.

Maneuvering through a virtual environment would require agents to be in-the-know with the latest resources they can adopt to make the process easier for them and their clients. That includes being able to communicate effectively through a virtual presence and building one’s confidence to successfully do so.&nbsp;

As we take big leaps from one shift to another, she reminds us to keep the good from the experiences that mold us today and apply the best practices as we sail through this crisis. In return, the energy, time, and effort that we invest in this shift will create happy clients who make sound decisions.

<br>Control. Clarity. Confidence. Community. These are what we can count on to bounce back from this crisis. Every industry is writing its history now that the world is facing a pandemic. In real estate, we want to be remembered as a community that empowered its leaders to see every opportunity for growth, unleash their fullest potential, and stay relentless with their visions.&nbsp;
