People in my industry are very good at helping people come into debt, but aren’t always so skilled in helping them review whether that debt is appropriate.

One of the ways I mitigate this is by guiding people through an annual mortgage review. **This review process gives me the opportunity to have a discussion with clients about their year**. I’m also happy to answer any questions they might have at that time, whether they’re about taxes, home improvements, or otherwise.

I’m always glad to be of value to those I serve. I don’t want you to think of me as just someone who can provide you with a loan. **I want you to think of me as the certified mortgage planning specialist that I am**.

The bottom line is that meeting with me for an annual mortgage review is essential because it will make sure you’re in the best financial position possible and that your mortgage is working for you. And you don’t need to be a current client of mine to take advantage of this service. **I highly recommend you visit [www.schedulewiththebetzteam.com](www.schedulewiththebetzteam.com) to set up your appointment, today**.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or know anyone who I could assist, please feel free to reach out. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
