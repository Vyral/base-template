In fact, over the past several months we’ve seen a marked change in the dynamics of our local real estate market and it isn’t without reason either.<br /><br />It turns out that among a few other key reasons for this dramatic shift from a seller’s market to a buyer’s market – one of the driving factors is our currently historical low interest rates. As we sat down to talk with Alan Ripple of Johnson Bank, we learned what the next several months hold for our busy buyers’ market.<br /><b><span style="font-size: large;"><br />Rates As Low as 2.55% Still Available On Some Loans</span></b><br />We have been seeing some of the lowest rates ever to become available in the history of our housing market and that trend continues. The reason for this is largely the Fed continuing to support the interest rate market with quantitative easing. Though our economy is not exactly at its height we are definitely not in a downturn either. Buyers for shorter-term loans are able to get rates as low as 2.55%.<br /><br /><b><span style="font-size: large;">Buyers Continue to Enjoy Significant Buying Power</span></b><br />With the low rates comes a lot more buying power. Not only is the overall cost to borrow money for a home more affordable but also the monthly payment amount due to lower rates is allowing buyers to purchase bigger and better homes for the same money.<br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b><br />Easy Marketplace Expected to Last for a While Longer</b></span><br />Though no one can truly predict future interest rate activity, it is safe to say the trends are pointing to at least a few more months of low mortgage rates. Currently 3.35% for 30-year fixed rates loans is the norm and as we move further into the year we can reasonably expect them to stay affordable. If the Fed chooses to end its support of the mortgage-backed security market things could change.<br /><br /><br />~<br /><br />As we get deeper into the heart of summer, a time when home buying and selling activity is on the rise, it’s a great time to consider your move.
