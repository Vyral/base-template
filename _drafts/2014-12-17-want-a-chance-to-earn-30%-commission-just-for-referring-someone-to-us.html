I'm reaching out to you today because it appears many agents from outside of Charlotte don't have a go-to agent to send referrals to.<br /><br /><b>We're offering a 30% referral commission to anyone who sends business our way.</b> We want to do a great job for your clients and be your go-to team in the Charlotte area.<br /><br /><b>We're a group of 6 agents, with closing and client coordinators. </b>We offer some of the better IDX products, with Tiger and BoomTown, for folks looking at homes. We do deals in the short sale, foreclosure, and new construction markets, and <b>would love to help your clients relocate to Charlotte.</b><br /><br />If you want to learn more about me and my team, visit <a href="http://readdansreviews.com/">ReadDansReviews.com</a> That will take you to my personal Zillow page so you can see what past clients have to say about my team. We would love for you to refer relocation buyers to us, so <b>we can include you on the final closing statement for 30% commission on the referral.&nbsp;</b><br /><br />If you have questions, or would like to learn more about my team, give me a call or shoot me an email. I would love to hear from you!
