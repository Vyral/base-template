You might be wondering why I'm joined by my colleague Wes Madden in today's video. We actually have some exciting news to share: **The Dar Walden Team and Madden Real Estate, two of the top real estate teams in Alaska, are merging!**

To put that into perspective, last year we served a combined 778 clients with almost $200 million in sale volume. The best part is that Madden Real Estate will be part of the Keller Williams group, the world's largest franchise that has more than 150,000 agents and 800 offices around the world.

We teamed up so that we could provide our clients with true statewide service, making us the only team that serves all of Alaska. Our website is actually your only broker-owned source for all Alaska MLS listings.

We also have a worldwide referral network. If you're moving out of state, we can take care of any and all of your needs thanks to our network of 150,000 worldwide agents.

**The merger also adds even more horsepower to our proven marketing systems.** You might already know that we have some of the most progressive and exciting marketing strategies, and our merger will let us have synergy between all of our ideas and campaigns. We also share many of the same endorsements, including Barbara Corcoran, Glenn Beck, and Gary LeVox from Rascal Flatts.

We also share a lot of core values; this whole deal simply wouldn't work if we didn't. Having a team with two people that carry the same belief system is truly an amazing thing.

So if you're interested in buying or selling a home here in Alaska or you're interested in a career in real estate, just give us a call or send us an email. We'd love to hear from you!
