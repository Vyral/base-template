We’re taking a bit of a break from real estate to talk to you about one of our favorite local businesses. [Jeannie Bird Bakery](https://www.jeanniebird.com/) is owned and operated by Bernie Vogel, and he has graciously joined us to tell us about his story, his business, and his love for the Westminster community.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>**If you’ve never visited Jeannie Bird Bakery before, you’re missing out.** It’s an old-world style bakery that makes everything from scratch with as many local ingredients as possible. They opened on Black Friday in 2014 and haven’t looked back since.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Bernie and his wife actually met in the restaurant industry in the mid 1980s. They had always planned to open a business of their own, but they also wanted to raise a family. They decided first to raise the family, right here in Carroll County. As the children got older, the idea to open a bakery was always on the backburner and they carefully documented all their ideas on the way. 25 years later, they had a solid business plan and were ready to start.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>They were able to test out their products first at the farmer’s market before opening up their own brick and mortar shop. They started to build a customer base, and then an opportunity came up that they couldn’t pass on. **The location they are at, 42 W. Main Street, is a Westminster institution.** It was a bakery for 42 years prior to Jeannie Bird, and Bernie wanted to continue that legacy in this community.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>As Bernie puts it, community is the key to their success. They work hard to hire crew members who live in and respect the community, and their dedication to customer service is inspiring. This is all a way for Bernie to give back. The community really helped him out when he lost his wife tragically. **Although the heartbreak was devastating, Bernie said it was the community who came together and carried him through the tough times.&nbsp;**
<br>&nbsp;
<br>One thing you might not know about Bernie is that he is an avid reader, backpacker, and hiker. If you have any questions for him or you’re just looking for something sweet, come on down to Jeannie Bird Bakery today.
