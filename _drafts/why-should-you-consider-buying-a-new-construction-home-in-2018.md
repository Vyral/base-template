There are many benefits to buying a new construction property. Not only do you not have to compete against other buyers, but you can save money by working with the builder’s preferred lender.

There are many great reasons you should consider purchasing a new construction property in 2018.&nbsp;

For example, many of our clients’ favorite part of purchasing new construction is the opportunity to sit down with an interior designer, pick out the finishes of the property, and design it to their tastes.&nbsp;

One of our favorite (and often overlooked) benefits of buying new construction is the opportunity to work with one of the builder’s preferred lenders. These lenders often offer great incentives toward closing costs and design center upgrades, **which can save buyers thousands of dollars.**

One of the biggest concerns we hear from homebuyer clients is dealing with after-closing repairs. Nobody likes surprises, so whether the water heater goes out or the furnace malfunctions, another great benefit of buying a new construction home is you’ll have a one- to two-year warranty that the builder will cover. You won’t have any out-of-pocket expenses, so you can move in, relax, and enjoy your new home.&nbsp;

**Purchasing a new construction property also gives you the chance to buy a home without competing against other buyers**, not to mention the opportunity to make a great financial decision that will benefit you and your family for years to come.&nbsp;
