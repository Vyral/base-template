{% include youtube.html %}The last time we gave you an update on how the Gulf Coast market was in the spring, but now we are in the dead of summer. Here’s what we’ve been seeing over the last few months.

Inventory is still down. We only have about six months on average across the coast. Some areas, like Ocean Springs, have only four months. That signifies a seller’s market. In a seller’s market: we see increased prices.

Case in point, the average price for a home along the coast is $150,000. That number jumps up near $190,000 in Ocean Springs. Those are just the average prices, though. **There are certainly options for every budget.
<br>{% include pullquote.html %}**
<br>Homes are spending an average of 104 days on the market along the coast, but there are pockets where they are selling much faster. Ocean Springs, of course, has an average around 80 days. Biloxi has dropped from 90 to 70 days. On the other end of the spectrum, Gulfport’s average rose to 135 days.

**Overall, we’ve had a really good run with housing lately.** If you have been thinking about buying or selling, now is a great time to get in the market while there is high demand for your home and you can buy a new home with a low interest rate.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
