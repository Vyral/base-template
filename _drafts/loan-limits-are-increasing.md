<center><em>Loan limits are increasing in 2020 for conventional, FHA, and VA loans. Here’s what you need to know.</em></center>

<br>Loan limits are increasing in 2020. What does that mean? First, there’s a difference between your purchase price and your loan limits. For instance, conventional loans have increased; in 2019 the limit was $484,000, and in 2020, the limit is $510,400. **That’s over a 5% boost in just one year**.

If you don’t have the 20% down for a conventional loan, an FHA product is an excellent option. It’s 3.5% down and those limits are increasing, too. In 2019, they were $339,250. In 2020 they are $356,500, a 5% escalation. This helps your buying power when you’re purchasing a new home with an FHA loan.

Finally, let’s talk about the VA product. The VA loan limits have had a 247% increase from last year. In 2019, the limit was $484,350. In 2020, it is $1.2 million (that’s 100% financing up to $1.2 million)\! That also works if you have multiple VA houses, meaning you can go up to that number collectively.

One thing to think about with VA loans: They allow up to $1.2 million, but not every bank will allow that high of a number. Check with your loan officer to confirm they have the product to get you all the way to $1.2 million.
