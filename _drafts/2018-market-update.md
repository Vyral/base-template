  Recently, I’ve been getting a lot of questions from buyers and sellers about
  what we can expect from the housing market in 2018. While I can’t predict the
  future, I can tell you that looking at the trends from 2017 will give us some
  insight into what will happen this year. Today I’m joined by Darrell Morgan,
  the Berkshire Hathaway director of operations for our area, to provide you the
  latest update for our market. Last year, we experienced tremendous growth. To
  find out more about last year’s impact on our 2018 market, watch our latest

What are the latest buying and selling trends in our housing market in 2018?

To get an idea, let’s look back to 2017. According to Darrell Morgan of Berkshire Hathaway, our market did great overall last year. **There was tremendous growth, with more and more ready and willing buyers looking at homes.** Because there were so many buyers flooding the market and so little inventory, we saw a lot of multiple offer situations.

On the flip side, properties listed on the market sold faster and for higher prices due to this influx. Mortgage lenders were also able to close loans within 30 to 45 das on a regular basis. On our team, our listings were on the market for roughly half of the time that there were in previous years. **In many cases, multiple offer situations resulted in higher sale prices for our sellers.**

Where are clients finding Realtors in 2018? In Darrell’s experience, many clients base their picks on reputation. Word of mouth from past clients is huge in this business. The internet is also one of the main resources, which means online reviews are extremely important.
