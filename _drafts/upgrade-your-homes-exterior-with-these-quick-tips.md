Whether you’re selling your home or making sure it’s well-maintained heading into spring, here are a few tips that will help you upgrade its exterior.&nbsp;

First, replace or clean the siding. Take a look around the outside of your home and search for any damaged siding that needs to be replaced. Also, spray off any dirt or mold or consider hiring a professional to power-wash your home.&nbsp;

Next, keep an eye out for any dry rot, especially around door and window frames. Scrape off any peeling materials, sand, and/or paint to make your home more attractive to buyers.&nbsp;

If you have any roof damage, have it repaired before putting your home on the market. If your concrete is in disrepair, that could become a hazard, so consider having any broken or uneven concrete fixed.

If you have a deck or patio, keep that clear of any debris. A great way to give these areas a great new look is to have them power-washed. If they’re made of wood, a fresh coat of stain can also go a long way.&nbsp;

Fences can sometimes fall into disrepair and give your home a shabby look, so make sure you have any missing boards replaced and painted or stained to match the rest of the fencing. Your gates should also open and close smoothly.&nbsp;

If you haven’t kept up your home’s maintenance or you have doubts about its condition, you can always **get a home inspection done before listing** to give yourself peace of mind knowing it will sell without any issues.&nbsp;
