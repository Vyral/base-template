Today I’m going to talk about why it’s a great idea to list your home over the fall season.

**One of the reasons why fall is a really great time to list your home for sale is that the weather is favorable.**

Lately, it's been really hot, and lot of times people didn’t want to go out because the weather was so miserable. Now it’s starting to cool off a little bit, and people are starting to do more outdoor activities and seeing more homes with their agents.

It’s a good time to get more people through your house, and the more people who come through your house, the more interest you’ll generate. Similarly, people want to take advantage of the time they have now before winter comes, and it gets too cold and rainy to go out.

**You should also consider the tax benefit of selling in the fall**. A lot of times people want to sell their homes so they can capitalize on the tax benefit for that calendar year.&nbsp;

Well, because of an escrow term, even if we listed your home, sold it, and got it into escrow today, depending on the loan type, it might already be the end of December before we were able to close that loan. That’s something to be mindful of, so take action immediately if you are looking for that tax benefit.

There are a lot of other reasons why the fall is a great time to put your home on the market. I’d love to talk to you about them and answer any questions you might have. Please reach out to us at any time. We hope to hear from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
