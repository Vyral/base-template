Getting this verification from a lender will help you know what you can afford and show sellers that you're a serious buyer.</i></span></span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><i><b>Selling your home?</b> <a href="http://www.myhomevalue916.com/" target="_blank">Click here for a free home value report</a></i><br /><i><b>Buying a home?</b> <a href="http://www.heidiphonghomes.com/" target="_blank">Click here to search homes for sale</a></i></span></div><br /><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">There are three reasons to get pre-approved for a mortgage before you shop for a home:<br /><br /><b>1.You'll know what you can afford.</b> People will come to me wanting to look at homes in a certain price range and then proceed to get pre-approved. Many times, these buyers end up qualifying for more than they thought and have more options for buying a home. You don't have to cap yourself because you'll know what you can afford.</span></span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>2.You won't know what interest rates will be until you lock them in.</b> If you look for a home first and then get pre-approved, you won't have a good idea of what your payment is. You might find out that payments are more than you can afford on a monthly basis, and we have to reduce the purchase price. Interest affects more than just the price, so you want to lock in your rate before shopping.</span></span></span><br /><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></span><br /><div class="quote-box"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span class="quote quote-left">“</span></span></span><br /><div class="quote-text"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Getting pre-approved tells you exactly what you can afford.     </span></span></div><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span class="quote quote-right">”</span> </span></span></div><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> <br />&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">3. </span>You can provide the seller with the pre-approval letter.</b> This is huge if you find yourself up against other offers. If you don't have a pre-approval letter and the offer you're competing against does, the seller will most likely go with the offer with the pre-approval. Why? All the lender information is there to verify that the buyer has the necessary funds. Sometimes sellers who go under contract with buyers who aren't pre-approved will cancel the deal within a week when they find out about their pre-approval status. <br /><br />Don't underestimate any of these three points about getting pre-approved for a loan before you look at homes.
