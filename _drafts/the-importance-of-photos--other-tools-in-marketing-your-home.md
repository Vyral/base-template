{% include youtube.html %}Why are professional photos so important when it comes to marketing your home?

Marketing, as it relates to real estate, has become an online game. In fact, 92% of all buyers start their search online. If you visit websites like Realtor.com or Zillow, what is the first thing you see? Photos. That’s why they’re so important. They’re the first tool we use to engage prospective buyers.

They’re not the only tool, though. If buyers like what they see, we use additional tools like aerial videos to give them an idea of where the home is in respect to its surrounding environment. Aerial videos are very engaging and give a different perspective of the home. We can write that at home “has canyon views,” but it’s a completely different experience if we can actually swoop through those canyons.

It’s also important to note that 11% of buyers in San Diego County come from outside the U.S. The top five countries they come from are Mexico, Canada, India, the U.K., and China. We take advantage of this with a program called Buyers Without Borders, which was started four years ago when our founder, Gary Keller, negotiated 84 agreements with MLS systems outside the U.S. Now, when we list a home in our local MLS, it gets syndicated to 84 other MLS systems throughout the world and reaches 500,000 agents globally.

To make that international marketing more beneficial, we also started using 3-D models. How does this work? We use 3-D cameras in each room of the home to create a virtual model of it in its entirety. That allows buyers from all over the world to use their smartphones, tablets, or computers to walk through the home as if they were there in person.

All four of these strategies (professional photos, aerial video, the Buyers Without Borders program, and the 3-D model) are utilized in our marketing program. We provide this program for all of our clients free of charge and use it for each one of our listings. How effective is it? 73% of the time, we receive more than one offer within the first two weeks of showings.

If you have any questions about this program or are thinking of buying or selling, please give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to helping you!
