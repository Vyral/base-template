<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">We can’t believe it’s December already. The year has really flown by. Real estate has been great in 2016 and all indicators point to 2017 being a good year too. One of the most common questions I’ve been getting lately is, “What can I do right now to prepare my home for sale when I’m ready to list?” I’ve got three tips to share with you today:</span><br />
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>1. Hire a professional real estate agent.</b> A professional will know the market and where to find buyers in it. They also know how to market your home so it attracts the highest number of buyers possible.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>2. Improve your curb appeal.</b> That’s the outside of your home. We spend so much time on the inside that we sometimes forget about our home's exterior. Focus your attention on the inside of the home as well.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>3. Stage your home to sell.</b> There is a difference between staging your home to live in and staging your home to sell. You can hire a professional stager or use your agent and their experience for advice on what you can do with what you already have.</span><br />
