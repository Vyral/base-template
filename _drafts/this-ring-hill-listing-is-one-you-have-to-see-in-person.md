As you can see in the video above, I have a wonderful new listing available that I’d love to tell you more about in person.

{% include pullquote.html %}

This lot is located in the desirable Ring Hill neighborhood in Woodinville, but it’s close to Duval and Redman. This property is also located in an RA-5 zone, meaning you can build one residential home per acre. If you have any pets, they’ll have plenty of room to roam, and there are numerous trails and equestrian parks nearby.&nbsp;

Since this area is great for building custom homes, **I’d be glad to show you a few custom homes so you can get an idea of how to build your dream home.&nbsp;**

Whether you’re looking to find or build your dream home, I’d love to help you. Just give me a call or send me an email and we can get started.
