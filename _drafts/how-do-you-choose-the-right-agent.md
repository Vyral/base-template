Today, we’ve got a great question coming out of East Memphis. That question is: “How do I evaluate a real estate agent to make the right choice?”

Choosing the right agent is incredibly important. My team and I have been helping people make real estate decisions for almost 18 years.

**My best advice is to ask questions and start with the end in mind.** Good agents will be willing to do whatever it takes, and these are the agents who will always know their numbers.

Since that’s the case, you should definitely ask how much faster a given agent is selling homes compared to the average agent in their same market.

This can help give you an idea of their performance.

**If you want to get the best price, you’ll also want to ask about the last 15 homes the agent sold.** Also, ask about the percentage of asking price to sold price for those homes.

I could talk all day about how to choose the right agents. I’ve sent the person who asked about today’s topic a great list of questions to ask any potential agents. If you text my team and I your email address, we can send you out that list, too.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
