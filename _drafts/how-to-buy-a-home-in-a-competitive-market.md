We have some helpful tips we wanted to share with homebuyers to help you win in a competitive market:

1. Put your best foot forward when you make your offer. Part of that is having a pre-approval ready to go. Your pre-approval will let you know what your budget is and show the seller that you are serious about purchasing a home.

2. Make your offer as clean as possible. One of the best ways to do that is to have some money set aside to pay your own closing costs.

3. Get your current home on the market now. That can make a huge difference between your offer getting accepted on the new home or not.

<br>4. Be prepared to make a strong offer. Of course, we will negotiate to get you a good deal. Keep in mind that sellers are getting 99.1% of the listing price in today’s market. That means you should make an offer at or above list price.

These are just a few general tips that can help you get a home in today’s competitive market. We realize that everyone’s situation is a bit different, so give us a call if you have any questions. I would be happy to help you!
