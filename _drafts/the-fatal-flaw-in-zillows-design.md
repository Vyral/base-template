<center>Zillow is one of the most popular real estate websites online today, but that doesn’t mean that it can replace the knowledge and experience of an agent. Here’s what you should know.</center>

Why shouldn’t you trust Zillow to help you find your next home?

Utah is a non-disclosure state, meaning we’re one of the very few states that disclose private sales of real estate. As such, **Zillow has a hard time identifying the true value of a property**; there are many things to consider when it comes to valuing a home, only some of which are accessible to the website.

**Zillow also doesn’t show 100% of what is available on the MLS**; oftentimes, they’ll show homes that aren’t even on the market anymore. Many brokerages opt out of the Zillow feed, so you’re not getting the full scope of what’s actually on the market.

Furthermore, **Zillow cannot replace the range of services that actual agents can provide**. As Realtors, we can give you an accurate view of your home not only in terms of value, but we can also give you a full diagnosis, including how to best position your home to maximize its value in the market. You wouldn’t go on WebMD to diagnose your illness, would you? Of course not; you’d go to the doctor.

So many times over the years a client has come to me saying that Zillow has valued their home a particular way. **We’ve actually been able to increase home values because we have the complete picture—full data and professional experience—to back that up**.

If you have any questions or would like additional information, please reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you with any of your real estate needs.
