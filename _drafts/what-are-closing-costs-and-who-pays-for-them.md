{% include youtube.html %}Today I’ll give you a quick overview of what closing costs are and who pays for them.

What are closing costs and who pays for them? These costs are the expenses in a real estate transaction that include lender’s fees and title fees. Different lenders will have varying costs for things like origination and processing fees, and you can shop between lenders to find the best deal. Title fees, meanwhile, cover the search and survey costs. Whoever pays for the closing costs in a real estate transaction is negotiable, but on our board contract, the seller pays for the title fees and the buyer pays for the lender fees. If you have any more questions about closing costs or you have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’d love to help you.
