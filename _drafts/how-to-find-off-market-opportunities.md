People often ask us about where they can find more off-market opportunities, so we’d like to tackle this question today.

Actually, **we at 1000 Calls A Day are more than happy to do the legwork for you in this regard.** Our team finds motivated sellers by cold calling the lists you send us. All you need to do is find a data provider that can give very detailed information about the listed sellers’ motivations, as well as information like the sellers’ age, the length of time they’ve lived in the home, and the amount of equity they have.

Then, you can easily extract these sellers’ contact information by skip-tracing the data. From there, our team can go through and call all the motivated sellers. We’re equipped to handle up to 5,000 records per caller each month, so if you’re looking to cover a large area, we’ve got you covered.

The most important thing to understand is that the quality of the data will impact the quality of your results. **If the data you’ve purchased lacks necessary information, we’re going to have a lower contact rate and, therefore, a lower conversion rate.**&nbsp;

To recap: The best way to find off-market deals is to have clean data, to have a target audience, and to consistently call those leads. We would love to take that last step off your plate.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
