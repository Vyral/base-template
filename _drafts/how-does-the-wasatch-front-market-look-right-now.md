Today we’re excited to share our third quarter market statistics for the Wasatch Front. These numbers are through October 4 of 2018 and we’ll be comparing them to the numbers that we saw through October 5 of 2017.

**As for home sales, they’re relatively stable and unchanged from last year.** Nearly 28,000 single-family homes, townhomes, and condos have sold along the Wasatch Front so far this year.

Our average sale price through three quarters of 2018 is $341,173 with the median price being $303,000. Last year, our average price was $309, 657 with a median price of $272, 761. **This means that our average price and median price have both increased by nearly 10% in just this past year.**

Interest rates are up about 1% year over year for 30-year mortgages. They’ve gone from just over 3% to about 4.62% year over year. As of October 4, we’ve seen five consecutive weeks of rate increases on 30-year mortgages. Additionally, we’ve seen the Fed increase their rate three times this year with a fourth on the horizon. Most experts predict them to raise rates an additional three times in 2019 and once more in 2020. **I think of this as more of a normalization of interest rates than a spike.** If you go back to 1990, our average interest rate is around 6.6%. Don’t be surprised if we get close to that number by the second or third quarter of 2019.&nbsp;

The average days on market along the Wasatch Front is 38 days, only 5% less from the same time last year at 36 days. Our overall inventory is currently sitting at 3.95 months of supply. This is a relatively low level of inventory. However, our inventory has gone up by 16% from the second quarter of this year.

As we’re seeing more and more price decreases among listing inventory with interest rates hitting a seven-year high, we’ve seen affordability drop, leading to more existing inventory and experiencing some price adjustments. **In fact, nationally, more than 25% of all homes listed on the market experienced a price drop in the month of September.** In areas of the country that have seen significant price growth in recent years like Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Portland, we’re seeing these rising interest rates put a halt on demand. These are areas with three or less months’ worth of supply and also have unemployment rates below 4%.

The general narrative here is that prices are up by about 10% on the Wasatch Front, while the supply of homes remains tight, especially in the entry-level price range. At the same time, supply levels above that price range are beginning to increase and loosen some of the pressure on pricing.
