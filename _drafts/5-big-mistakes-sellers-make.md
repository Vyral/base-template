Today I want to talk about the first of five common mistakes home sellers make when putting their house on the market.

I recently wrote an article describing the five biggest mistakes that sellers make when they put their homes on the market, and today I want to talk about just one and how future sellers can avoid making the same errors.

Well, knowing how to choose the right real estate professional isn’t just a gut feeling—you’ll need to look beyond what they say they do and pay attention to why they do it.&nbsp;

In the Greater Memphis area, **the average number of homes sold by an agent is four per year.** It might also surprise you to learn that over **90% of all the homes sold in our market are sold by about 12% of the agents active in the market.** So finding a qualified agent is key if you want to set a fair price on your home that will draw buyers in and get you the most money possible from the sale.

If you’d like to read it in full or if you have any questions, reach out to me. I’d be happy to pass it along to you and answer any questions you have.
