I’m back again with Attorney Justin D. DeCrescente to talk about inspection contingencies. Here’s a snippet of our full conversation on the topic.

In part two of our discussion with Attorney Justin D. DeCrescente, we’re talking all about the pieces of what a real estate contract looks like.&nbsp;

Each contract comes with its own set of contingencies. They include a financing contingency, mortgage contingency, and the inspection contingency, which we’ll be focusing on today.

I find the inspection contingency to be a very challenging piece. Once we get the contract, we’re only really halfway there.&nbsp;

The term “as is” comes up a lot, and buyers tend to use the inspection to find out what’s wrong with a home. **If major issues are found, even in a home that’s being sold “as is,”&nbsp; the buyer feels that the value has changed.**

Justin helps us out a lot in situations like this. He’s really great at helping us manage and communicate through this process.&nbsp;

Thanks so much to Justin for joining me again. Stay tuned for part three of our conversation, where we’ll talk more about contingencies.

If you have any questions for me about contracts, buying a home, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you. Also, you can reach out to Justin at (201) 227-8150.
