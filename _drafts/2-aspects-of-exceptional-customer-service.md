Whether you’re shopping on the internet or in a local store, you’ll agree that customer service is very important. One of my first jobs was at a sanitary restaurant, so I learned a lot about good customer service. Here are a few things to think about in terms of how customer service relates to the real estate business.

**1. Quick response.** In this day and age, cell phones, internet, email, and texting make it easy to follow up with a customer quickly. I personally try to do that within 24 hours of the initial message.

**2. Know your customer’s goals and objectives.** Going the extra mile in this business tells the customer that you’re in this for life. Forming a friendship and a working relationship with clients lasts forever.
