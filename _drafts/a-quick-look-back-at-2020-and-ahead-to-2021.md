<center><em>Thank you all for your support this year. We&rsquo;d like to return the favor.</em></center>

<br>2020 is almost over, and what a wild and wonky year it has been\! **Our business increased this year**, and we are so grateful for all the families and friends who trusted us to help them with their real estate needs. We know it wasn’t easy for everyone.

Now, though, we can say that we’ve been through a pandemic together. We’ve learned a lot this year; perhaps we’ve spent way more time at home than we thought we would, and we’ve certainly become a lot more comfortable with wearing a cloth mask over our faces\!

This year has hurt many people, but I’m so glad that the Tulsa community has come together to help each other get through these tough times while staying positive and productive. **We at the Wolek Group have done our level best to stay true to our mission**, which is to deliver an amazing client experience while giving back to our community, supporting local businesses, giving to local nonprofits, and empowering our youth and agent community through training and coaching.

Since times are tough for some, we want to be a resource for you. If you’re facing challenges finding employment or staying caught up on your mortgage payments, we are always available to have a confidential conversation with you. All you have to do is reach out to us\!

Thank you all so much for allowing us to do what we love, and we look forward to giving some real hugs very soon.
