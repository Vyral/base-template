Preparing your home properly is essential in having a successful home sale. Here’s why.

When we’re consulting with home sellers, one of the most common questions we hear is, “Is staging worth it? Does it really work?”

**There are two things that we can do to most effectively sell properties.** The first is pricing competitively. The second is preparing the property for sale. Typically, staging is directly tied to both of these components.&nbsp;

If a property has too much furniture, not enough furniture, or not the right size of furniture, staging can make a significant difference. If you have oddly shaped rooms, staging can really help there, too.&nbsp;

**In an ideal world, your property should be cleaned, painted, and staged.** The staging is the icing on the cake of the final presentation that buyers are looking for. It’s a major factor in the home-selling process.

If you have any questions about selling a home or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
