Lately, we’ve been getting a lot of questions from home sellers. They say, “I’ve had my home on the market with this other agent, and it’s not selling. Why isn’t it selling? What’s wrong with my home? Is this the wrong time to be on the market? Is it my agent?”&nbsp;

These are all valid questions. You have five options if your home isn’t selling.&nbsp;

I understand why homes don’t sell. In 2016, The Larkin Group sold 56 homes in a day or less. In 2017, we sold 73 homes in under 25 days. I say this not to impress you but rather to impress upon you that we have a system that routinely beats the market and routinely works. I am approaching your questions as an experienced real estate specialist who has sold over 1,100 homes.

So, here’s what you need to do if your home isn’t selling:&nbsp;

1. Check your price. You need to be really honest with yourself about your price. Is your home overpriced for the market? Your listing price is not about what you need or want, and it’s not what the appraiser or grandmother told you. Ask yourself, “What is the market value of my home?” You need to be very honest with yourself. This is a real man and the mirror moment.&nbsp;

2. Look at the condition and staging. Did your agent give you any feedback about your house? If so, did you ignore that feedback? Maybe your home is messy, or you need to update or neutralize the paint. It’s fairly likely that there is something you know you need to fix but didn’t, and that is what’s keeping your home from selling.&nbsp;

3. Marketing. Did you hire a real estate agent who spends thousands of dollars on radio, Zillow, Trulia, Realtor.com, and Homes.com? Is your agent marketing to other real estate agents and incentivizing those agents to bring buyers to your home? There is a good chance you don’t know what they are doing, so ask your agent about their marketing plan.&nbsp;

4. Fix it up. This goes back to my second point. You may need to spend some money to fix up your home.&nbsp;

5. Quit. You always have the option to quit and take your home off the market.&nbsp;

In most cases, the reason a home doesn’t sell is due to pricing. Be honest with yourself and your agent.&nbsp;

This market has been great for sellers, and a good agent should be able to sell your home in 30 days or less. If your home is still on the market, it’s time to have a heart-to-heart with your agent.&nbsp;
