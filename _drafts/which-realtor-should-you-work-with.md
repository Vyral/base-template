Purchasing a home is a huge investment. It only makes sense, then, that you should think carefully about the person you hire to help you make this move. There are thousands of Realtors out there, but you can (or at least should) only choose one. **So how do you choose?**

We’ll discuss the answer to this question exactly in today’s message, which is the third installment into our “Anyone Can Become a Homebuyer” series

There are a number of qualities your agent should have. **Beyond having a high level of expertise with real estate in general, they must also be highly attuned to your specific market.** The ideal Realtor should be a local expert in your market—someone who will listen to your wants and needs and leverage their knowledge, resources, and network to make your real estate goals a reality.

Despite the value that working with an agent provides, many buyers fear that the expense of hiring such a professional will be too much to handle. If this has ever been a concern of yours, allow me to clarify something: Buyers, in general, don’t have to pay a cent for professional representation. **It is the seller who pays the commission fees for both agents**, so working with an experienced Realtor on your next home purchase (in most cases) won’t cost you a thing.&nbsp;

As you consider all the points we’ve outlined today, don’t forget to also think about personal chemistry. Being knowledgeable and experienced isn’t enough. The best agent for you to work with should also be someone who you like, trust, and feel comfortable with.&nbsp;
