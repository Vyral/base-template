<center>Buying a starter home will make buying your forever home much easier down the line. Here’s why.</center>

Many buyers are unsure of whether they should wait to buy a forever home or start with a starter home. **In my opinion, you should absolutely buy a starter home if you can**.

For starters, it’s a great way to start building some equity. Does that mean you have to sell the house when you’re ready to move into your forever home? No. **You can hold it as an investment property to build long-term wealth**. If you do decide to sell down the road after three, five, or seven years, you’re going to have significant equity in the home that you can use as a down payment on your forever home if you wish.

**The average renter has a net worth of about $5,000 or $6,000 while the average homeowner has a net worth of around $225,000**. As you can see, owning a home will force your net worth to increase over time. This is going to be one piece of your investment portfolio that will serve you well in the long term.
