A pre-qualification letter is basically just a letter that says "this person is qualified".</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-d0ue_bzf0Ig/VEa4bDqSNLI/AAAAAAAAPf0/YJkDRbJFtkE/s1600/Christy%2BMorrison%2B10.21%2Bpart%2B2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-d0ue_bzf0Ig/VEa4bDqSNLI/AAAAAAAAPf0/YJkDRbJFtkE/s1600/Christy%2BMorrison%2B10.21%2Bpart%2B2.jpg" height="200" width="200" /></a><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>A pre-approval is different.</b> A pre-approval involves a lender collecting information, submitting it to a bank, getting an underwriter's blessing, and getting approved. All you have to do from here is find a property and your offer is much stronger with a listing agent and a seller. Especially if you are looking for something quick, if you are pre-approved, the process is much easier.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>By cooperating up front, and providing your lender with all the info you need, you will have a great customer experience.</b> Suzi says that her clients that have the most luck are the ones that get here everything up front.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If you are thinking of buying anytime in the next 3 months, pre-approval is very important. <b>A pre-approval lasts for 3 months</b> and getting it taken care of now will allow you to be ready to write an offer right away!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If you have any questions, don't hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.
