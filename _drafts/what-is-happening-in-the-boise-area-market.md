I wanted to give you a quick update on our market here in the Boise area.

To start, it is a super-hot market. It has been all year. In fact, it has been for several years and there isn't a slowdown in sight.

**Home values are up.** I talk to buyers and sellers daily, and there are many people moving in from out of state all over the valley.

I’ll share an example of this trend. About three and a half years ago, I was involved with a sale that went for $270,000. The same family that bought that $270,000 house took a job out of state recently and needed to sell. We sold the home in the last couple of weeks and they walked out of the title company with a check for $95,000. The appreciation has been so strong in this market that in only three and a half years, they were able to take nearly $100,000 worth of equity with them to purchase their new home.

I get asked a lot, “Have I missed the opportunity to do well in this market?” No, not at all. **This market is still strong.** There is no slowdown in sight and it's an excellent time to put your home on the market and sell for top dollar.
