Today I’m excited to be joined by a special guest, Carrie Cook of HomeSale Settlement Services, to talk about a very important subject: title insurance.

As you may already realize, there are a number of distinct expenses associated with the home purchase process. Title insurance accounts for one of these costs, but what exactly is it?

According to Carrie, **title insurance ensures that no one other than the buyer can claim ownership of the property.** When purchasing title insurance, buyers have two options: a standard policy or an enhanced policy.

While a standard policy provides the basic protection against false claims of ownership Carrie mentioned earlier, an enhanced policy provides a little extra security. **An enhanced title insurance policy also covers things like restrictions and building permit violations.&nbsp;**

If you purchase a property outright using cash, however, you do have the option to waive title insurance. But in Carrie’s expert opinion, it is never a good idea to forgo title insurance. She also advises against waiting until after your home purchase is complete to seek out and obtain title insurance.&nbsp;

You can reach out to Carrie for further insight into today’s topic by sending her an email at [ccook@homesale.com](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(99,99,111,111,107,64,104,111,109,101,115,97,108,101,46,99,111,109))).&nbsp;
