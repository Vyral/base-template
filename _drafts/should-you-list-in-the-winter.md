Should you list your home for sale in the winter, or should you wait until spring?

December is actually the biggest month for us out of the whole year. We sell more houses in December than any other time of year. There are a few other reasons why you may not want to wait until spring to put your home on the market.

For one, homes tend to show better this time of year. Tasteful holiday decor makes your home appear warm and cozy to potential buyers. Also, winter makes for an even playing field when it comes to curb appeal.

According to Redfin, 9% of winter listings are more likely to sell. On average, winter listings sell a week faster and for 1.2% more money.

During the peak season of the market, there are 45% more listings but only 23.5% more sales. More listings in January and February means more competition for you.

We have about 2,000 sales each month at any given time of year. There might be an extra push of sales in the peak of the market, but you will have more competition.

By selling in the winter, you will have less competition and more serious buyers. People don’t window shop for homes during a snowstorm. Even last year, when it was snowing for weeks and we had an ice storm, the real estate market kept going. It was amazing to see.

If you have any other questions about selling your home this winter, or if you are interested in buying a home before competition heats up this spring, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
