<center>Before your home is on the MLS, there are a few key ways you should prepare.</center>

Before listing your property, there are a few key things you need to do.

**The first step you should take is to call us and let us provide you with a free market evaluation.** We’ll give you information about recently sold properties in your area, your current competition, and anything else that could help you achieve listing success.

Next, we’ll get your home picture-perfect. This will involve decluttering, depersonalizing, and cleaning your home. 95% of homebuyers start their search online, so we want your property to look great and stand out both in person and online.

**After the sign is in the ground and the process is underway, it’s time to get packing.** Right now as we transition into spring and summer, winter items can be put away. So, make sure your closets and storage areas are as clear and clean as the rest of your home.

Also, you’ll want the outside of your home to sparkle as well. Pay special attention to your front door and patio, since this will play a major role in any potential buyer’s first impression.&nbsp;

**Finally, make buyers feel at home.** If you’ve got a backyard, for example, add comfy and cozy touches like a fire pit or lawn furniture. You want buyers to be able to envision themselves living in your home.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want to know how we can assist you with your listing, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
