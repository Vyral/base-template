Before buying your next home, there are a few things you’ll need to do to prepare.

**One of the first things you’ll need to do is to look at your finances.** Check your current credit score and meet with a lender to determine how much you can afford. Doing so will make sure that you don’t end up browsing properties that are outside of your budget.

**After you’ve started working with a lender, you’ll need to connect with the right agent.** The ideal agent won’t simply jot down your search criteria and then run a search on the MLS. The right Realtor for your needs will take all the fine details of your circumstances into account as they help you find the perfect home.&nbsp;

The things that matter to you are the things that should matter to your Realtor. Factors like the school district, distance from your place of work, and more will all be on the radar of top-quality agents.&nbsp;
