I recently read an article on Realtor.com that specified the five big reasons to sell your house now before it’s too late, and I’m excited to share that list with you today:

1. You won’t be the only house on the market later in the spring. There will be a lot more sellers on the market in the coming months, and that brings more competition and probably lower prices.

2. You’ll still make a handsome profit. The market has been appreciating year after year for the past seven or eight years. It’s a great time to cash out all those profits by selling before the market changes.

3. There is a high demand for homes under $350,000. A majority of buyers in Vegas are looking for homes in this price range. This gives you a much better chance of selling quickly and for top dollar.

4. Mortgage rates have dropped again. Right now, they’re around 4.56%. Just six months ago, we were over 5%. With lower rates, more buyers will be looking for homes in the market.

5. More millennials are entering the market. 87% of millennials intend to buy a house or invest in real estate.

If you have any questions about selling a home or real estate in Las Vegas, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
