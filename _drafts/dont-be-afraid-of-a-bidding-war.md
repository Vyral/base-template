excerpt: >-
  Inventory is extremely low in Portland, which means that bidding wars are
  fairly common. Many of our clients have told us that they don’t want to get
  into a bidding war. I understand that bidding wars can be intimidating, but
  just because there are multiple offers on a property doesn’t mean you have to
  overpay for it. Bidding wars can be subjective. To see what I mean, watch this
  short video.

  You can always make an offer that you are comfortable with and see what
  happens.
