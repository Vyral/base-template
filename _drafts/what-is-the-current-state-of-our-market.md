We’ve been getting a lot of questions about the market lately. One of the most common has been, “Are we in a buyer’s market or a seller’s market?”

<br>**The answer is that we are in a strong seller’s market, especially if you’re looking to buy a home priced under $300,000**. We’ve had an inventory problem this year in that segment of the market. What this means is that we haven’t had enough supply to keep up with demand for these homes. Once you get into the $400,000 and above market, supply is slightly higher and demand is slightly lower.

<br>Another important factor in our market is interest rates. Right now, they are in the low-to mid-3% range, which is historically low. We don’t expect this to last, however, and they have got to go up at some point. **Right now, you have a great chance to take advantage of rates that are really artificially held low. All good things don’t last forever**.

<br>What does this mean if you’re a buyer or seller in our market? For buyers, if you’re in the $300,000 and under market, be competitive with your offer because it’s got to be attractive to sellers for them to accept it. If your price point is a little higher, you might be able to negotiate a little bit in your favor.

<br>**If you are a seller in the lower price ranges, be prepared to move quickly when you put your home on the market**. They are selling fast. If your home is in that market and not getting a lot of showings or offers, you are probably overpriced. If you’re selling a home in the $400,000 and above price range, it’s still a good idea, but be patient because it may take a little longer to sell than other homes.

<br>If you have any questions for us or are thinking about buying or selling a home, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!
