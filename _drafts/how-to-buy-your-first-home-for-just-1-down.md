Have you ever imagined only having to put 1% down on the purchase of your first home? Well, this can be a reality.

Right now, the fall market is in full swing. A ton of inventory has come onto the market since Labor Day. Some of it has moved off, but some is still available.

If you’re a first-time homebuyer, now is the time to act. Right now, we’ve got some excellent mortgage products where you can get into a home with as little as 1% down if you qualify.

Also, we’ve got some great new properties under $200,000 coming onto the market right now. Some of these properties may need a little bit of work, but we’ve got the funds to make that happen through some of our loan products.

If you’re renting right now, you’re paying someone else’s mortgage. Now is the time to get into your own home.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want to know how we can help you purchase your first home, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
