excerpt: 'Today I wanted to check in and give you a quick update on the real estate market in northern Virginia. As we begin 2017, our market is favoring sellers. We have between two and three months of inventory, but if you list a well-maintained home now, it should sell in a matter of days. Prices have been climbing steadily at a modest rate for several years, and that should continue going forward. To learn everything you need to know about what’s happening in our market and what you can do about it, watch my latest video.'
