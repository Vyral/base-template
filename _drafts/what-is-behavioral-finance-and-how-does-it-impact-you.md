This past fall, a gentleman by the name of Richard Thaler won the Nobel Prize in economics after a distinguished 45-year career in studying behavioral economics.

What is behavioral economics?

It is simply the cross-section of psychology and economics. So, what did Thaler do to earn the Nobel Prize in economics?

He noted that his fellow economists all thought that we were very rational in our decision-making process. Now I know that you think you are, but what Thaler proved over and over again with his research is that we are not rational.

In fact, Thaler did some of his early studies on economics professors to prove that we’re not rational. If you are interested in more, you can check out his book, “Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics.” I encourage you to pick up a copy.

How does that relate to our work as retirement plan sponsors, advisors, and participants? It means that we are regularly making financial decisions that relate to the operations of retirement plans, how our employees use these retirement plans, and how they can access these plans.

Franklin Templeton recently put together a guide called “Six Barriers to Investment Success” that I would love to share with you. I think it can be very helpful, as it relates to your plan and how your participants might think.

If you have any other questions for me, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!<br>
