<center>How fast can you clean out a pumpkin?</center>

Join us on October 10th from 4:30 p.m. - 8:30 p.m. at Lone Peak Park for our annual charity event, Pumpkins Against Hunger. We will be cleaning out pumpkins in 30 seconds or less for you to take home. All we ask is that you bring one non-perishable food item per pumpkin you would like to receive. We will also have carving stations for you and your kids. We would like to invite everyone to get into the spirit early and dress up\! Weâ€™ll have some characters here who you can get your picture taken with.
