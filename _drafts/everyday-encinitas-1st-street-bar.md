1st Street Bar is a gem located right in the heart of downtown Encinitas. Here’s just a taste of what they have to offer.

It’s time for another edition of “Everyday Encinitas.” Our goal with this series is to showcase and highlight local businesses and organizations in the area. **Today we’re meeting with Mike Chopp at the historic 1st Street Bar in downtown Encinitas**.

Mike and his partners took over the space on July 3, 2015, and have been running it ever since. It’s in a great location, has a great atmosphere, and features some great live music.

The actual building that 1st Street Bar is in has been around since the 1920s. It’s the second oldest bar in Encinitas and has some great history behind it.

They carry a ton of different local beers, microbrews, tequilas, and whiskeys.

**One of my favorite events to attend here is karaoke**. In addition, Tuesday night is open mic night, Wednesday night has a house DJ, there’s a live band every Thursday night, and every day has happy hour until 7 p.m. This is one of the few bars in the area with live music every week.

One of the biggest draws here is the staff. Many of them have been here for five, 10, or even 15 years. They’re a tight-knit family and they always take care of their customers with a smile. **Another big draw is their seasonal drink specials**.

The next time you’re looking to get out of the house and find a new place to go out in Encinitas, come visit Mike and the staff at 1st Street Bar and see what they have for yourself.
