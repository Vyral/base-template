It’s the little things—that can save you a ton of money this year.

Here are six of them that I’d like to share with you!

Cancel a service – Take a look at your monthly credit card and bank statements.  Are you paying a monthly fee for a service that you hardly use?  Or can you find the service somewhere else for free?  For example—paying a monthly fee to Netflix when you can get it from the library.  Or paying a fee for a service that you didn’t remember that you had in the first place.

Use every ounce – Just when you think your mayo container is empty, it’s really not — because you’ll find at least a couple of servings left at the bottom of the squeeze bottle.  Same goes for shampoo and toothpaste.  As a test, a friend of mine made it a habit of turning the shampoo bottle upside down and emptying what’s left into another bottle just to see how much gets thrown away.  She was able to get two months’ extra supply of shampoo from the ‘empty’ bottle.

Watch your ATM Fees – If you have to pay an ATM fee, take out more money than needed because you’ll be paying the same fee whether you take out $20 or $120.  Another way to save money is use your debit card at a grocery store.  Buy what you need and use the “cash back” button to avoid bank fees altogether.

Don’t buy more than you need – Unless it’s a super-duper sale, buy only what you need.  You are spending your hard-earned money “now” for things you “may need” in the future.

Create a no-spend weekend – For one weekend per month, don’t spend any money—that means your credit card too.

Save dollar bills – This is kinda corny, but examine the serial number of your dollar bills.  Save the ones that begin with the letter A.  You can do the same thing with coins.  Put them in a money jar at the end of each day.  Then take it to the bank and deposit it into a savings account so you are not tempted to spend it.
