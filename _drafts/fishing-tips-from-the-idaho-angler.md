Today, we’re doing something a little different. Instead of talking about real estate, I want to share a fun activity for those of you who live in Boise: fly fishing.

**Lewis Hunt from Idaho Angler is here to talk about some of the primary fishing opportunities you have right now for trout and steelhead.**

For the next month, you can find trout in just about any stream in Boise. Lewis recommends checking out the Boise River in town, which has been fishing quite well. The south fork of the Boise is just starting to fish, and the Owyhee River has been fishing for the last several weeks.

As we move through the month and the weather starts to get warmer (hopefully), we’ll see more stillwater fishing. Check with Lewis at the Idaho Angler; he’ll let you know what’s fishing hot and what you need to fish those places ahead of time.

The steelhead are going to continue to fish as well. For fly fishing, it’s going to be a nymphing game until the weather gets more consistent. You can fish a lot of streamers in town and on the Owyhee River, but it’s still mainly a nymphing game.

**The Boise River is fishing as good as I’ve seen it in the last couple of decades.** If you are interested in steelhead, you have a few opportunities in the south fork of the Clearwater River. There’s some salmon outside of Riggins, but salmon is mainly between Stanley, Challis, and Salmon.

A lot of people think that it’s all nymph fishing or indicator fishing this time of year, but you can still swing some flys. Use a slower swing and find some slower water. You can stop in to get some flies from the shop and see what’s going on before you go out.

If you have any questions, you can call Lewis at the shop at 208-389-9957. As always, if you have any real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
