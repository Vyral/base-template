With a lot of seasonal buyers, dealing with the mail in our market can get tricky. Here’s a tip to help.

We have a lot of seasonal buyers in our market. With so many people constantly coming and leaving, I’m constantly getting questions about mail delivery. **For those of you living here now, I have a great resource to share with you.**

It’s called informed delivery and it’s really easy to set up on the USPS website. You can go **[here](https://reg.usps.com/entreg/RegistrationPortalAction_input?&amp;iom=B808-82ID-USRS-PS-USP-GO-XXX-AW-XX-X-INF&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_content=b808_82id&amp;utm_campaign=informeddelivery2018)**, set up an account, and then you can track all of your mail.&nbsp;

For example, if you’re expecting a package, you can track it every step of the way. Each time the package is processed by a USPS employee, you will get an immediate email letting you know the package’s status. **You can even arrange to receive your package without being there to sign or reschedule your delivery time.**

I just wanted to give you a quick tip to help you keep track of your mail, especially if you’re coming and going or changing homes on a seasonal basis.

If you have any questions for me about this topic or anything else in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
