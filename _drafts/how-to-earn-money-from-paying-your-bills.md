Today let’s talk about two great resources that can help you earn rewards for paying your bills.

How do the high-earning investors I work with pay their mortgages and bills while simultaneously earning cash back and travel points?

I’ve got good news: The techniques they use are something you can apply within your own life. So today I’d like to discuss two helpful resources for how you can replicate these earnings.

First of all, you can actually use certain credit cards to earn cash back. One example of this kind of card is the Alliant Visa Signature 3% cash back credit card. I’ve seen a lot of cards that only earn you 1% or 1.5% cash back, so the 3% you can earn from this card is quite a big deal. **You can find more information about this card here**.

The second resource I’d like to highlight is a service called Plastiq. **Plastiq provides a one-stop solution to paying bills, as the service writes and sends checks for you**. Plastiq is also an easy way to accelerate the rewards you earn from credit cards, so using it in tandem with the Alliant Visa Signature 3% cash back card could greatly increase the benefits you reap as you pay down bills.

Using Plastiq along with the Alliant card allows you to build your credit score while earning a little bit of cash back. Best of all, the earnings you gain from the Alliant card will most likely cover Plastiq’s transaction fees, which are currently 2.5% plus $0.30 per transaction. That said, though, you can **save some money when signing up with Plastiq by using this referral link**.

Using these two resources together is a great way to maximize your earnings. I highly recommend giving it a try.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
