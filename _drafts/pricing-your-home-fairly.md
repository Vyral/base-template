<center>If you want your home to sell quickly and for top dollar in our market, you have to price it fairly. To price it fairly, there are a few considerations you need to make first.</center>

As a seller, there are a few things to take into consideration to price your home fairly in today’s market.

The first is that **buyers are highly educated**. They have more technology and information at their fingertips than ever before, so they’re more aware of what the market is doing on a general level. Obviously, they still need to consult with a professional before making a decision, but they now have more information to begin with than at any point in history.

Second, **buyers are more capable of comparing your home to other available homes** because they can simply browse real estate websites like Zillow. There, they can see what properties are available in your neighborhood and at what price.

Third, **the market reacts well to a fairly priced property**. If the property is overpriced, the market will typically reject it. If this is the case, the signals will be loud and clear based on the little-to-no activity it is generating.

Lastly, **everyone who buys real estate wants to get a bargain**. You need to make sure your home is competitive when stacked up against the other listings in your area.

If you have any questions about pricing your home fairly or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, please feel free to call or email me anytime. I would be happy to help you.
