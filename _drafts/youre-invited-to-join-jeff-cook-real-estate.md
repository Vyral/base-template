We have an amazing real estate team that’s been in business for 15 years. Whether you have a license or not, I’d like to talk to you about a career with our team.

We help our agents succeed by providing the marketing, the leads, the systems, the processes, and the presentations that they need, along with the operation staff.

If you are interested in learning how to get a six-figure income and get paid for the amount and effort you put in, reach out to me to learn more about this opportunity.

Don’t just take it from me—here’s the story of one of our agents: &nbsp;

“I’m Stan Taylor, and I started working for Jeff Cook Real Estate in January of 2016. Before I started with Jeff Cook Real Estate, I worked for a small business downtown that helped all the attorneys here in Charleston with document management. I did that for about 15 years.<br><br>“Jeff Cook Real Estate has changed my life in significant ways, from income to flexibility at work to freeing up time to be with family and friends. I’ve also learned quite a bit about leadership and how to grow a business. It’s been amazing and I’ve loved every minute of it.

“It’s a very intense industry and very demanding, but it’s also extremely rewarding and worth every bit of hard work. Culture is huge, and the culture here is second to none. I cannot express how important it is to love going to work every day, going to an office where everyone wants to help and be supportive.

“Since day one, I’ve felt like I’m being groomed for leadership. This company devotes a lot of energy, effort, and time to all of the staff so they can be the best at what they do and pass that on to the next person.

“In my first year, I sold 15 homes. In my second year, I sold just under 30 homes. This year, I am set to sell 40 and 50 homes.”

If you are interested in a career with Jeff Cook Real Estate, just give us a call or send us an email. My team and I would be happy to discuss this opportunity with you.
