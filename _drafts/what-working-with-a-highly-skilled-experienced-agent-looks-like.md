Realizing success in your home sale or purchase starts with who you hire as you’ll learn from today’s video. &nbsp;

My good friends Van and Bonnie invited me back on their podcast show to discuss the importance of hiring an agent you can trust and who will deliver results when it comes to your buying and selling needs. A professional agent will always work to put your interests first and will go above and beyond in ways the standard agent won’t. &nbsp;

**In the video above, you can listen to my full interview with Van and Bonnie, where I cover such topics as our Love It or Leave It Program, other special services and tools we offer our clients, the emotional side of moving, and so much more. &nbsp;** &nbsp;&nbsp;

If you have any questions about what we covered today or if you’re looking for professional guidance in the buying or selling process, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you\!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
