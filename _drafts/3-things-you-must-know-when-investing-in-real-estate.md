There are three lessons all fix-and-flippers must learn, and I’d like to share them with you today.

If you’re considering flipping properties, there are three things you need to know: **At some point, you’ll likely go over your budget, get behind schedule, and need to fire your contractor**. No matter your level of skill or experience as an investor, these things can happen.

In fact, I recently had to fire two contractors during a fix-and-flip project I took on. It all worked out in the end, so despite this frustrating roadblock, it was a generally enlightening experience. After this project, I’ll never invest in real estate in the same way.

As I work on my current project, I’m only going to sell if the return I could earn completely blows me away. Otherwise, I’m going to keep it as a rental. With that said, **check out the video above to see the progress I’ve made on this project so far**.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
