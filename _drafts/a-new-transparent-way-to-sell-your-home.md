<center>My Rocket Listing gives sellers a choice in how they sell their home. Here’s how it works.</center>

What’s the newest, most transparent way to sell your home?&nbsp;

It’s our program called **My Rocket Listing.** We started it because we’ve sold thousands of homes, and my team and I realized that **there are some people who don’t want to go through the traditional way of selling.** It might be that they don’t want to go through the hassle of making sure the home is show ready, that they have a privacy concern, or that they’re relocating and need to sell very quickly.

Before this program came out, there weren’t really too many options. I think it’s a disservice, what we as a real estate industry have done by saying that there is only one way to list a house. It doesn’t work for everyone. **The new consumer wants options.**

It works as simply as this: We come out to your home after you contact us and give us the information; we’ll do an analysis on our computer system that will give us a baseline; we’ll do a walkthrough of the home; and then, within 24 hours, we’ll come back and give you a rocket listing price and traditional list prices.

It’s very transparent, and you get the make the final call. **We’ve seen about a 6% to 7% difference between the traditional listing and the rocket listing.** You don’t have to do any repairs and you get to pick the close date.

I believe that this will revolutionize the way real estate is done, and we would like to be on the forefront of that revolution.
