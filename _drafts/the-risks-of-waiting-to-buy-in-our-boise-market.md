  Should you wait to buy in our Boise market? Ultimately, the answer comes down
  to affordability. One factor that plays a big role in a homebuyer’s
  affordability is interest rates. Rates have risen since the beginning of the
  year and are expected to continue rising throughout 2018. To find out what
  this means for your affordability and why you may be better off buying now
  instead of waiting, watch my latest video.

The question of whether you should wait to buy in our Boise market boils down to affordability.

To determine your affordability, we must examine the one other factor that affects affordability just as much as appreciating home prices: **rising interest rates.**

For example, right now in Ada County, the median home price is $290,000. At the beginning of 2018, rates were at 3.95%, so the monthly mortgage payment for a $290,000 home would’ve been $1,239. Since January 1 rates have risen to 4.5%, which means that same monthly payment of $1,239 now only allows you to afford a $272,000 home. That’s a 6.2% reduction in buying power.

Keep in mind, rates are expected to rise two or three more times this year. If they climb as high as 5%, that would reduce your maximum affordability with a $1,239 monthly payment to $256,000—a 12% drop in buying power.

So to answer your question, **you can either roll the dice and wait to buy on the unlikely chance that prices and interest rates will go down, or you can buy now and lock in a comfortable mortgage payment.**
