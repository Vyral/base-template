Wow, this is such a special home with so much to offer, I am so glad we got it sold for the owners\! They had it listed for ~200 days with another agent before cancelling and calling on me. I spotted some key things the agent should have done differently to increase the appeal. We then launched my marketing plan and listed it at the exact same price the previous agent had it listed at when the sellers cancelled. We were able to generate multiple offers and get it sold in 5 days for $11,000 over list price and the sellers are elated\!\!

Check out the photos, extensive virtual tours and details to see how we really made this home shine\!

Let’s start with the location. The 3,895 square foot home and gated ~1-acre parcel sit at the end of a noticeably quiet cul-de-sac so there is truly little traffic out front with the exception of neighbors walking pets and local wildlife. Although the home is very private and you will feel like you are out in the country, everything you need is just a few minutes away. Grocery stores, dry cleaning, churches, schools, restaurants, etc. are all located within 5-10 minutes. If you want to head West to the beach or East to I-15 either one is less than 10-15 minutes from home. The weather is also amazing. Far enough inland to avoid a lot of the marine layer yet close enough to the coast to avoid extreme heat. Vista is referred to as the “climactic wonderland” for good reason, just about everything grows well here and the property is loaded with producing fruit trees. In addition, the owner recently installed a well that produces roughly 8-10,000 gallons per day and has a 5,000-gallon reserve tank with pressure pump, control system and extensive drip irrigation to keep the landscape lush.

The inside of the 5 bed/4.5 bath home is just as impressive\! The elevated parcel means gorgeous 360&deg; views in all directions and ocean view sunsets. &nbsp;When you walk in you will enter the main family room with huge picture window, loads of natural light, wood style floors, dual pane windows and new light fixtures. The kitchen has been renovated and includes loads of cabinet and granite counter space with large island/peninsula, SS appliances, recessed lighting and space for casual eat in dining or you can pull up a barstool and eat on the island/peninsula. The main floor also includes 300 square foot attached sun room that faces SW and has windows on all sides to take in the views, a separate living room with 2 sided fireplace into the living room on one side and the dining/family room on the other and a bathroom with stand up shower.

The private master suite is located downstairs so it is separate from the rest of the home. It is very spacious at ~300 square feet and includes wood beamed ceilings, tile flooring, tons of closet space, multiple windows and a luxurious master bath with soaking tub and separate steam shower.

Upstairs includes 3 separate bedrooms and full bath. The back bedroom has gorgeous views to the West and has been used as a home office due to its long, narrow shape but could easily be used as a bedroom.

There is a separate guest suite located above the garage which would be ideal for extended visits, college kids moving back home or multi-generational living. It measures 250+ square feet with plenty of room for a bed, dresser, and dinette table and there is a full bathroom right down stairs off of the laundry room so guests do not need to come into the house to shower or use the restroom.

Head into the backyard and enter your own tropical staycation oasis\! There is a beautiful Koi pond with waterfall and heated pool(new heater) and Jacuzzi located just steps away from the covered patio and lead directly to the view deck which is made of durable composite materials and takes full advantage of the views to the South and East.

Additional features include a high capacity solar electric system that is paid off and conveys with the sale, new air conditioning and heating system, new tankless hot water heater, newer septic system(installed 2011), new paint inside and out, a detached green house, a separate shop, separate storage buildings, electric gate, huge oval driveway with room for RV parking and more\! Interested parties are urged to move quickly, this is an incredibly special home with a lot to offer and it will surely sell quickly\!
