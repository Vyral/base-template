Staging your home is vitally important to selling it quickly and earning a higher sale price, and it’s all the more important if your home is sitting vacant.&nbsp;

Many sellers falsely assume that a vacant house appears smaller. By bringing in the right kind of furniture and making sure that it’s well placed, however, you can actually make your home appear larger.&nbsp;

**The key to staging is to paint a perfect picture of the home’s potential.** Too many sellers rely on buyers’ imaginations for this, but in actuality, many buyers don’t see what the seller hopes for in their mind’s eye.&nbsp;

Therefore, it’s up to the seller to aid that buyer’s imagination along through the use of staging, which allows buyers to develop a mental image of themselves enjoying a holiday dinner with their family, entertaining guests, and just living there. &nbsp;

On a related note, the NAR came out with a recent study in which they found that professionally staged homes will sell 79% faster and for 6% more money. **On average, home sellers see an 8% return on just a 1% to 3% investment.&nbsp;**
