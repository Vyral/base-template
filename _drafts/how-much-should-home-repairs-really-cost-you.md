I recently read an article in The New York Times titled, "Why Do All Home Repairs Cost $1,000?" The author was complaining that it didn't matter much what went wrong at home—be it a leaky faucet, broken garage door, or failed water heater. In each case, the bill came out to at least $1,000.&nbsp;

Most homeowners underestimate the costs of various home repairs, often by as much as four times the actual cost. Can anything be done about this? **Here are three recommendations to help you deal with home repair costs:**

**1. Save for a rainy day and create a special account for repairs.** The average homeowner spends $2,000 a year on maintenance. As a homeowner myself, I have a tax fund, a “happy fun day” fund, and a rainy day fund. When you use the rainy day fund to pay for your repairs, you’ll be in a much better financial position.&nbsp;

**2. Enjoy being a homeowner.** $50 in parts and a YouTube tutorial or a Google search will be enough to repair most home maintenance issues, so try focusing on the smaller, simpler fixes yourself and delegate the more complicated ones to the professionals.&nbsp;

**3. Negotiate smart.** This means getting multiple quotes from different professionals so that you get the best price. Also, don’t pre-frame the cost of a repair. A lot of contractors will agree to do something for $1,000 if you assume it costs that much, but not everything does, so don’t automatically pay them $1,000 for a job that doesn’t cost nearly that much.&nbsp;

Of course, if you reach a certain point where you’re constantly needing things fixed, it might just make more sense to look for a new home that won't require frequent repairs. &nbsp;

If you're considering buying or selling a home or if you need recommendations for contractors to fix those things you don't want to deal with yourself, give me a call or send me an email today. I can recommend several reliable businesses and I'm always here to help.&nbsp;
