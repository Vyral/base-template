It’s time for another real estate market update.

First, let’s take a look at some of the national real estate numbers that we’re tracking for you right now.

According to the National Association of Realtors, the number of projected sales dipped from 5.5 million last month to 5.4 million this month.

**The national median home price decreased 1.9%** from $264,000 last month to $258,000 this month. That said, the median sales price is up 6.2% from the same time last year, when it was $243,000.

Finally, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage interest rate dropped from 3.96% to 3.86%.

**Locally, we have 4.9 months of inventory available for single-family homes.**Anything less than six months is considered a seller’s market. I do think that number will rise as we head into the selling season.

Most people in Florida wait for the selling season (January through May) before they put their homes on the market. That is when a lot of people come down from up North to purchase property, so we can expect a rise in inventory over the next couple of months.

If you have any questions or would like more details about the market in your specific area, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
