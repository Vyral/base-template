If you’re a real estate investor, are you managing your own property? Most people who manage their own property don’t do so because they enjoy it—they do it to save on the management fee. Through our marketing techniques, we’ve been able to increase rent up to 9.5% on average, which puts money back into your pocket. To learn about these marketing techniques, check out our website **[WhitePropertyMGMT.com](https://www.whitepropertymgmt.com/){: target="_blank"}**. If you don’t own any investment properties but are interested in becoming a real estate investor, we invite you to attend our investor’s seminar on April 4 at Carolina Ale House.
