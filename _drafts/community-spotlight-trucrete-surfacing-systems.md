We’re excited to be joined today by Justin Myers of TruCrete Surfacing Systems. He has a pretty cool company and we’re excited to talk to him about it today. This locally owned and operated business is doing great things in our area.

**TruCrete specializes in decorative concrete, overlays, epoxy flooring systems, basements, patios, pool decks, and more.** They work with both commercial and residential clients and can bond new flooring to existing concrete.

They have some amazing finishes to choose from. One of the most popular ones right now is metallic epoxy. You can always polish your existing concrete, but you’re just polishing what’s there. **A finish such as their metallic epoxy allows you to start with a clean slate and seal the floor with something that looks great and is extremely sturdy.**

They’ve actually been able to help many homeowners recently with flooded basements to find a basement flooring that works for them now and in the future.

They’re also able to help homeowners apply modified concrete overlay and stencil it to any kind of design or pattern. **As you can see in the video above, their work is high-quality and wide-ranging.**

If you’re interested in learning more about TruCrete and how they might be able to help you, give Justin a call at (443) 205-4547 for a free estimate or send him an email to info@trucrete.com.&nbsp;
