Today I wanted to talk about the process from once a buyer receives an accepted offer to closing with most people wanting to know how long this process will take. Al explained that the timeframe is driven by the dates in the contract; usually that’s 30-45 days. The process is at mercy of the workload of the appraiser, having the documentation submitted and what the contract calls for.<br /><br />If the borrower is well prepared, the closing process can be done within two weeks. In regards to a buyer’s interest rate being locked in, we can lock the rate in for (at the longest) 70 days. The buyer can also let the rate-lock expire and lock at a different interest rate. Al also stated that the quicker the borrow locks their interest rate, they can usually obtain a lower rate.<br /><br />If you have any questions for Al, reach him at (414) 852-7022. Thanks and have a great day!
