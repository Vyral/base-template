What’s the fastest way to generate immediate business if you’re in a bit of a slow season?

The answer to this question is that it depends—it depends on who you talk to, what area of the world you’re in, and what season it is. Today, I have three of my own top answers that have worked for me year after year.

**1. Utilize your sphere of influence and trusted resources.** If I’m a little slow in business and can project a slow season coming up, I immediately get on the phone with past clients and people that I know and trust, check in and connect with them, and before I hang up, I ask one simple question, “I’m in a bit of a slow season, and I’m just wondering if you could think of anybody you know who might be looking to sell their home in the next six to 12 months?” If I do that consistently, I’m sure to come away with some prospects to follow up on.

**2. Prospect for expired listings.**There are different technologies like Vulcan 7 and RedX that offer expired data for properties that came off the market unsold. If used with consistency, you can generate some quick business. From those calls, you can generate a connection and possibly an appointment.

**3. High-traffic open houses.** If I do a really high-traffic open house in a great area, I’m bound to generate some quick business and connections that I can follow up with afterwards.

If you have any questions or suggestions about strategies that have worked for you when you’re in a slow season, I’d love to hear them. Just give me a call or send and email and we can go over them.
