<center><em>How COVID-19 Has Affected Our Market</em></center>

<br>Today this video comes to you from my truck because, as many of us are discovering, it’s loud and hard to work with kids around all the time. This is, of course, not the spring market we anticipated. **Real estate has slowed significantly during the health crisis**, and it appears it will stay that way for the foreseeable future.

Right now, if it’s not an urgent circumstance and you’re not suffering from hardship, it may be in your best interest to wait on your real estate plans until the crisis settles down. I believe it will take some time for people’s priorities to shift again after this is all over.
