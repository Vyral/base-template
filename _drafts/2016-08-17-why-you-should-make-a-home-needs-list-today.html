Make a list of your needs and ask your agent to begin shopping based on those needs. <br /></span></span><br /><div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Today we’re living in our homes for longer than we used to. </span></span></div></div><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br />On average, <b>Americans live in a house for about nine years.</b> Interestingly, that number has increased by three years from just a decade ago when the average time was six years. This means that we’re staying in our homes for just a bit longer than we used to.<br /><br />Remember, you can always trade up a few times before you find the ultimate home, but you don’t want to end up “house poor” either. Be sure that you don’t overextend yourself.<br /><br />If you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, call or email us today for a free real estate consultation.
