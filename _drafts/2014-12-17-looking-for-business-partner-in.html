I'm reaching out to you today because it appears many agents from outside of Charlotte don't have a go-to agent to send referrals to.<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OkAhrV_Yf70/VJGyy2aTa9I/AAAAAAAAAas/AlFr1iRaZyA/s1600/dan-jones-pull-quote-Dec.-2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OkAhrV_Yf70/VJGyy2aTa9I/AAAAAAAAAas/AlFr1iRaZyA/s1600/dan-jones-pull-quote-Dec.-2.jpg" height="200" width="200" /></a><b>We're offering a 30% referral commission to anyone who sends business our way.</b> We want to do a great job for your clients and be your go-to team in the Charlotte area.<br /><br /><b>We're a group of 6 agents, with closing and client coordinators. </b>We offer some of the better IDX products, with Tiger and BoomTown, for folks looking at homes.
