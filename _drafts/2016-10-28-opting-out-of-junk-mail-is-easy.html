Here are a few ways to limit the amount of junk mail you receive.</span></span></div><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">After you close a real estate transaction, there are certain documents that have to be filed with the county courthouse. The unfortunate thing is that county courthouse records are public access, and marketing companies will routinely buy this information to tailor their solicitations to new loan recipients.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span> <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">With that being said, there are three things you can do to reduce the amount of junk mail you receive from credit bureaus and marketing companies who purchase your information from other sources:&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span> <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>1. Go to <a href="http://optoutprescreen.com/">optoutprescreen.com</a>. </b>This is the shared web portal for the three major credit bureaus. By opting out of that website, you can remove your credit profile from being sold to third parties. All those offers and solicitations will cease, and you can opt out for any period of time, whether it be five years or permanently. If you do opt out permanently, there is a bit more paperwork you have to fill out.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span> <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>2. Opt out of direct marketing from <a href="http://dmachoice.org/">dmachoice.org</a>.</b> This is the police for all the catalog mail and other mail that isn’t tied to your credit profile. It does have a nominal fee and lasts for only five years at a time.&nbsp;</span><br /><b><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></b> <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>3. Visit <a href="http://catalogchoice.org./">catalogchoice.org.</a></b>&nbsp;If you want to take things a step further, you can visit this site and input the different vendors that slipped through the cracks from your other opt outs and block their solicitations as well.</span><br /><br /><div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">"The less junk mail the better"   </div></div><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>The days when we don’t receive any junk mail are sometimes the greatest days of all. </b>If you have any questions for us or any real estate needs we can help service, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.</span><br /><div><br /></div>
