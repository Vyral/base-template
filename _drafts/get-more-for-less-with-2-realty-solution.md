<center>At 2% Realty Solution, we do things differently so that our clients can get better results for less money.</center>

If you’ve ever wanted to learn more about our company and what we do, you’re in luck. Today, I’ll be covering everything you need to know about 2% Realty Solution.&nbsp;

**2% Realty Solution is a full-service real estate brokerage offering 100% real estate services for lower commissions.** We brand ourselves as the evolution of realty. We don’t have the big, fancy offices or the additional staff requirements of our competitors.&nbsp;

We’ve also built our business model in a way that eliminates the majority of traditional marketing expenses.Traditional marketing consisted of newspaper and radio advertising, while today’s advertising is done through websites and marketing. These digital marketing techniques are less expensive and more effective than many traditional methods.&nbsp;

When you list with 2% Realty Solution, you get full MLS exposure and your listing is put out across thousands of real estate websites worldwide. You also get professional photography, floor plans, and a top negotiator to work on your behalf. Additional benefits include the use of social media advertising and open houses.

The numbers from our local real estate board show that 68% of properties listed on our MLS in 2017 were successful in selling. **Our clients, on the other hand, had a 100% success rate in selling their homes with us in 2017.** On top of that, our average sales price was slightly over 100% of our clients’ asking price.&nbsp;

Part of the reason we’re so successful is that we offer competitive buyer agent remuneration to the agent who brings in your homes eventual buyer.&nbsp;

Another benefit of working with us is that we help clients save. On a $500,000 sale, our clients save around $4,300; on a $1 million sale, clients save around $6,300; and on a $2 million sale, our clients save over $20,000.&nbsp;

This jump in savings is due to our $10,000 commission cap. We offer all of our expertise and marketing regardless of your property’s sale price. We don’t continually charge more just because your home is worth more. We think what we charge is fair.&nbsp;

In the age of the internet, paying less doesn’t have to reduce the quality of professional service and expertise that you receive. **2% Realty Solution is celebrating 10 successful years in Canada, and we’re confident that you’ll be happy to partner with us.** With 2% Realty Solution, you don’t get less—you just pay less.
