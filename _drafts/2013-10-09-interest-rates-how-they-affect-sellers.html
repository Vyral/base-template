Welcome back to my video blog! Last time we spoke, we went over the effects the recent increasing rates has on buyers. Today, let’s go over how they affect sellers. Allan Ripple from Johnson Bank is here with us as well!<br /><br />Let’s recap what happens to buyers as rates increase: your buying power lessens with each percentage increase. This means homes can become less affordable and you are getting less home for your dollar. Because buyers lose power, sellers have to drop their prices. <br /><br />When rates increase, we see increased activity in the short term. Buyers get off the fence and purchase the home. As rates continue to increase and they become too high, fewer buyers will be able to afford a new home. Also, most sellers are buyers as well. <br /><br />If you have any questions, please give The Roth Team a call! Thanks for watching!
