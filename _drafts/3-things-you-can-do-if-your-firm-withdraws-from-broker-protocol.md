Morgan Stanley and UBS are withdrawing from the protocol for broker recruitment. The two firms decided to leave the protocol in the fourth quarter of 2017, and that has started this entire controversy surrounding what those advisers should and can do down the road.

This is a big deal. Trying to minimize or diminish this in any way is a mistake.

These firms are enforcing non-solicitor agreements and claiming that information you could have taken under the protocol (such as your client’s basic contact information) is now trade information or proprietary information.

The first thing to understand is that we are not in a 2003 world. To say that this is just like turning back the clock to a time before the protocol is disingenuous at best.

In the 20 years that I was in the business prior to the protocol, there was some litigation in the early 90s, where firms would sue each other. In those days, though, an advisor would go to Kinko’s in the middle of the night, get their books copied, and hand that information over to the new firm prior to departing from the old firm.

We can all agree that there was some smarminess around that, and that going to a Kinko’s in the middle of the night felt unethical. The protocol was at least partly designed to stop the exchange of that private information, and we are not going back to pre-2004 in terms of privacy laws.

If anyone who is recruiting you says, “Don’t worry, it’s just like 2003,” it’s at best disingenuous, so please don’t listen.

These two firms are saying that the five pieces of information you are allowed to take with the protocol are now proprietary to them, even though for 14 years that information was not proprietary. This is information that you’ve had in your cellphone for 10 to 20 years, and they’re saying those phone numbers are now somehow their property.

Basically, these firms are saying that those phone numbers are a trade secret, like the formula to Coca-Cola.

Of course, that’s ridiculous. Coke didn’t allow Pepsi access to their formula for 14 years and then change their mind, but that is what these firms are alleging.

The question is, what do you do now?

You’re an advisor at this firm and you want to leave, but you’re a little scared and intimidated by the new rules, so what are your options?

The first thing you need to do is consult an attorney. Every state in this country has different laws regarding privacy and employment. You also have a contract with the firm that is unique to you with your signature on it. The firm went through various degrees and different contracts over the years. There was the retention contract, which was signed during the financial crisis, and you might have had a trainee contract.

The best case scenario is that you’ve already moved your book from somewhere else to Morgan Stanley or UBS. You can make the argument that you already have the rights to that book because you transferred it from somewhere else to Morgan Stanley or UBS under the protection of the protocol.

Secondly, make sure that your clients have your cellphone number. In all of these non-solicitation agreements, the client is always allowed to reach out to you, so make sure that they are able to do so.

Finally, direct your client to an article I wrote for CNBC. This article explains to your client what happens behind the scenes when an adviser leaves the firm. The article explains what could happen in terms of the firm legally preventing you from talking to your clients. This way, your client will have a better idea of what might happen down the road. They can use the link above or just Google “Danny Sarch CNBC.”

This is an evolving situation, and I do think there will be some kind of protocol 2.0. As the world moves toward a fiduciary standard, it’s impossible for me to reconcile a fiduciary standard with litigation that keeps the client from communicating with you, their trusted adviser.

If you have any questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you.
