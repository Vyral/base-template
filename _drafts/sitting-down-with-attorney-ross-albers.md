<center>We had the opportunity to sit down and learn more about Ross Albers, a local attorney who is active in the community.</center>

As a local attorney, he handles a little bit of everything, including criminal cases, DUIs, traffic cases, personal injury cases, and even estate planning. There are five other attorneys on his team who help him handle most areas of law that people will come in contact with.

Recently, Ross has been growing his practice. **He hopes to continue that growth by acquiring and merging with law firms operated by older attorneys who may want to retire**. Instead of having the other attorneys that work under those professionals also leave the firm, Ross hopes to keep their practices alive by having those attorneys work for him. This allows him to add other practice areas as well as more value to his clients.

Growing up in Northern Virginia, Ross was brought to Westminster by his wife, who does pharmaceutical sales in the area. **He says that he chose his Main Street location because of the ease of telling others where it is** and gives him the opportunity to interact with some of the other business owners in the town.

**Outside of practicing law, Ross is also very active in the community**. He is involved with the Boys & Girls Club and their campaign to build their new building in the downtown area. He saw this club in particular as an opportunity to continue his grandfather's legacy. After WWII in Berlin, Germany, Ross's grandfather helped set up clubs to educate German youth about democracy and feed them. While it may not be the 10,000 kids that his grandfather helped, he feels that it has had a huge impact on the hundreds of kids he has worked with.

He has also helped coach lacrosse with Westminster Area Lacrosse (WAX), gotten involved with McDaniel College, and volunteers with the city for planning and zoning. He has developed roots and we think that Westminster is lucky to have him.

To get in touch with Ross, you can visit his website [rossalbers.com](https://www.rossalbers.com/) or give him a phone call at (443) 457-3890. He says that he is also available through Facebook and other social media.

If you have any other questions for us, please feel free to contact us. We look forward to speaking with you soon.
