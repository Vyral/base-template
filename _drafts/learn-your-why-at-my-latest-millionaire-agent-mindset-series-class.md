As the founder and instructor of the Millionaire Agent Mindset Series, I always seek to help others tap into their potential for greatness.

With that in mind, **I want to invite you to another live Millionaire Agent Mindset Series class I will be teaching on June 19 from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m.** There are no costs involved and no strings attached. The class will be held at 2121 South McClelland Street, Suite 201, Salt Lake City, Utah.

This month’s class will focus on the “why.” In other words, why the millionaire agent mindset produces massive success and how you can do the same with your personal mission (or your own “why”), which is the rocket fuel for life.

No one sets out to be average, yet why do so few agents make it past their first license renewal? It’s because they lack a “why.” They lack a vision or a clear purpose that causes them to get out of bed each morning with enthusiasm.

**In this class, you will complete a mission statement that outlines your vision, values, beliefs, and perspectives.** These factors will equal your “why.”

If you have any questions about this upcoming class, please feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I would be happy to speak with you. In the meantime, I hope to see you there!
