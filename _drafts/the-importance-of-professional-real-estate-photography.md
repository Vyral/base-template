Professional photography is an incredibly important part of marketing your home listing.

During online home searches, people are obviously drawn to the listings with the best pictures.

Pictures taken on a cell phone, in bad lighting, or where the photographer is visible in some reflective surface can all make an online listing look less appealing.&nbsp;

So, when you list your home, it is critical that you show it off in its best light using professional real estate photography. **The cost of professional photography is something we cover for everyone who lists with us.**&nbsp;

We believe that without a great product, you can’t have a great sale. Professional photography not only makes your home look great, but it can also help it sell more quickly.

Years ago, I conducted a market analysis of recent sales in our local market. The results of this analysis showed me an interesting correlation between the number of photos a listing had and the number of days it spent on the market. **Homes with the more pictures had fewer days on market.&nbsp;**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
