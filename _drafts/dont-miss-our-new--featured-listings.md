We’re here at our new listing at 3603 N Gomez Ave. This is a 2-bed, 2-bath single-family home with about 1,048 square feet.

Check out this exclusive tour before it hits the market.

**The kitchen has beautiful white cabinets and stone countertops.** Whenever you list your home, I recommend that you declutter. Get rid of unnecessary items, especially in the kitchen. We want to show how much space your countertops have.

As we walk through the living room, you’ll notice nice hardwood flooring throughout the living area, and crown molding on the ceiling.

The second bathroom features a stand-up shower. There’s a laundry room inside a house and a lot of storage space. Each bedroom has good closets and there is attic access throughout the house.
