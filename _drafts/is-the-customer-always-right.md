You’ve heard that the customer is always right, but does that hold true in the world of real estate?

If you’ve been in this business for a while, you’ve come across people who are rude, demanding, and, sometimes, a little bit crazy. What happens when you are working with one of these difficult customers?

First of all, I would say that **you should always be professional.** Don’t sink down to their level. Be very careful with your attitude and vocabulary. Maintain a professional stance at all times.

You may also want to keep your communication in writing. Explain to the client that because there have been some difficulties in communication and you want to be very clear going forward, you’re going to communicate primarily by email. **If things really do go south, you now have a written record of everything that transpired.**

Finally, if you just can’t handle the client, ask your broker for assistance or ask another agent to take over the client. Make sure that you compensate them with some type of referral fee. Referring a client to your broker is far better than losing the client entirely.

So, is the customer always right? Of course not, but as real estate professionals, we can always handle them in the right way.

I specialize in helping agents take their business to the next level. If you have any other questions about dealing with difficult customers or how to grow your business, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
