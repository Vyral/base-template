What’s happening in our San Diego real estate market for first quarter of 2017? Are we in a buyer’s or seller’s market?

Right now, we’re in a seller’s market. To give you a bit of background on how we determine this, we typically look at the supply of inventory. For example, if there are nine homes for sale in a zip code and three homes sell each month, we have a three-month supply of homes.

A buyer’s market is considered anything over a seven-month supply. A neutral market is a five- to six-month supply. Anything under a five-month supply is considered a seller’s market. As we speak, in San Diego County, we have a two-month supply of homes, hence our position as a seller’s market. &nbsp;

Interest rates pose a more interesting development. In the wake of the presidential election, we saw them shoot up over the last few weeks. They improved a little bit in the last couple days, but most experts predict that they’ll continue to increase throughout 2017.

<br>This means if you’re a buyer and you’re on the fence about whether to jump into the market or wait a little bit, you need to jump in as quickly as possible to lock in a great rate. Despite this expected increase, interest rates are still very low in a historical context.

Overall, we have an interesting dynamic happening because instead of having either a great seller’s market or a great buyer’s market, we actually have both. As I said, technically we’re in a seller’s market, but with inventory as low as it is and interest rates as low as they are, there is great opportunity for both buyers and sellers.

If you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, please give us a call for a free real estate consultation. We look forward to talking with you!
