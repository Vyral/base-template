Today I wanted to reach out to you about the coronavirus. Please stay safe and follow the guidelines that the governor has put in place. Real estate is considered an essential business, so we’re still working daily. If you have any needs because of the health crisis, please let us know we’d be happy to help. This is a strange time, but remember we’re all in it together.
