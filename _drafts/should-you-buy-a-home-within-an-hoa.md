If you’re thinking of buying a house within a Homeowners Association (HOA), there are a few things you need to know first:

**1. What’s the cost?** It could be $100 per month or $500 per month. This could impact your loan and it’s a real fee you have to pay each month.

**2. What does the cost cover?** Do they mow the lawn and remove snow, or just basically manage the community?

**3. What kind of restrictions are there?** The biggest one that we see has to do with investors buying townhomes. A lot of them get all the way to closing before finding out that the HOA doesn’t allow non-owner occupied investment properties. We also tend to see pet restrictions.

**In the end, make sure you do your due diligence, read your documents, and make sure that you can lean on your agent to help you.** We want to make sure that if you do buy in an HOA, they do a good job at maintaining the value of your home and increasing its value.
