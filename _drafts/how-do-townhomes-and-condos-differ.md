Today I’m here to answer two questions that often come up when people are talking about condos and townhouses.

**The first question is, “What’s the difference between a condo and a townhouse?”**

This is the best way to look at it. A townhouse is just going to share walls with somebody else. It may be two stories or three stories, but there will be nobody living above you or nobody living below you.

A condo, on the other hand, will have shared walls and a shared floor and/or ceiling. Some condos are part of an association where they don’t share a wall or ceiling, but the fact that they are one-story buildings set them apart.

The second question is, **“Are there pet restrictions in a condo?”** We hear this question a lot from people who are looking to move into a condo from a house. For the most part, we find that condos in this area are generally fine with pets. However, there are certain condos with pet restrictions. There might be a 35 lb weight limit for a dog, for example. It’s best to let your Realtor know about that before you start looking so that they can make sure your furry friend can tag along.

If you have any additional questions about condos, townhomes, or anything else relating to the real estate market, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
