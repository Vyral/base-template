We’re back again with another episode of “Market Minute.” The February statistics for our north San Diego County detached home market have now come in, and we’re going to go over them quickly for you today.

Our current median price, $678,000, is up from January. This is good news for homeowners and sellers alike.

The average days on market, meanwhile, is down since last month, now sitting at 45 days compared to the 50-day average we observed in January.

One statistic which has remained stagnant is current supply, which has remained steady at 2.6 months’ worth of inventory in both January and February of this year.

Even so, the number of homes sold has gone up. 616 homes sold this February, while only 528 sold the previous month.

And, finally, our interest rate is down—dropping from 4.51% in January to 4.41% last month.

To see these numbers in greater detail, check out this spreadsheet containing all the information I’ve shared here (and more).

Overall, the current market holds strong opportunities for buyers and sellers alike.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
