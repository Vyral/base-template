  What Makes Presto! Pizza the Best?   On this week’s edition of “AJ Eats,” I’m
  headed to one of my favorite local restaurants: Presto! Pizza. The pizza here
  is the best you’ll find anywhere.  Welcome to this week’s edition of “AJ
  Eats.”   This week we’re visiting Presto! Pizza—a great family-owned
  restaurant in Lake Ridge where I had the chance to meet up with two of the
  owners. Pat, his mother Pina, and their family started Presto! back in
  December of 2007.   Since then, they’ve held a philosophy that’s kept people
  coming back seven years later. Pat says that it’s all about freshness. But
  using quality ingredients for their pizzas and homemade sauce is just part of
  what they do.  Everyone here at Presto! Pizza has a true commitment to
  creating connections. Family is important to them, and they treat their
  customers like family.   "Family is important at Presto! Pizza, and they treat
  their customers like family."   Whenever I call in, Pat remembers not only my
  name, but also my favorite pizza—pepperoni and sausage. He says this extra
  effort is important, and they put it into the way they treat people and the
  way they make their food, as well.  I’ve always loved the pizza here, but
  today I got the chance to do something different and actually go inside the
  kitchen. With Pat’s help, I even got to make my very own version of my
  favorite pizza. It all starts with rolling out the ball of dough.   Using one
  hand as a guide and using one to mold, we shaped the dough out into a crust.
  Next, we added a sprinkle of flour before flipping the dough over and
  stretching it even more. From the beginning of the process, it was easy to see
  the level of care that goes into the food here. Every pizza is hand-stretched,
  hand-tossed, and hand-topped every time.   After we evenly spread out the
  homemade sauce, we added parmesan and mozzarella cheese. Finally, it came time
  for the toppings. Because Presto! Pizza has the best pizza in Lake Ridge, I
  arranged the toppings on the one I made into an “LR.”   The reason Presto!
  Pizza is the best isn’t just about the quality of their food, it’s also about
  the love they put into the restaurant. You absolutely can’t go wrong with
  coming here. I definitely recommend that you check it out. But don’t just take
  my word for it.  While I was in the restaurant I took the chance to interview
  Dominic, another member of the AJ team, about why he’s always here at Presto!
  Pizza. As someone with Italian heritage himself, Dominic says it’s worth
  coming back for.   We here at the AJ team love to help out local businesses,
  so if you decide to come out to Presto! and give it a try, be sure to tell
  them we sent you.  If you have any other questions or would like more
  information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward
  to hearing from you soon. Email This   BlogThis!   Share to Twitter   Share to

  22191, USA Join Us in Mentoring the Next Generation of Leaders   I’m joined
  today by Dr. Daria Groover, the principal of Featherstone Elementary School,
  and she has a special story to share.   I’m joined today by Dr. Daria Groover,
  the principal of Featherstone Elementary School, and she has a special story
  to share.  As some of you may know, myself and some of the other members of
  our team like to volunteer our time mentoring some of the students at
  Featherstone. Public school teachers and administrators have tough job, but
  when she came to me and told me of the successes of one of our mentees, I just
  had to share with all of you. Here’s what Dr. Groover had to say:  “We have a
  student who is being mentored by Allen and some of the members on his team.
  This student hadn’t always been successful in the classroom in the past, but
  he has come a long way this year. He ended up passing two of his state
  standardized tests and when his teacher asked him what inspired him to get it
  together, his response was the mentoring program. That’s how we know the
  program is working and our students are meeting their goals.”  The time that
  we spend coming in and talking to these kids about responsibility, leadership,
  having pride, and setting goals is priceless. All of these things make a
  difference for students here at Featherstone.    "We will be back next year,
  and we want you to join us in sharing your talents with the younger generation
  as well."   We will be back next year, and we want you to join us in sharing
  your talents with the younger generation as well. If you have any questions
  about the program or want to get in touch with Dr. Groover, give us a call or
  send us an email. We are also always here to answer any real estate questions
  you may have. We look forward to hearing from you. Email This   BlogThis!
