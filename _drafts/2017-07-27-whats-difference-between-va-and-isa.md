What’s the difference between a VA and an ISA? Can’t one person handle both duties?

What is the difference between a virtual assistant, also known as your dedicated outbound prospector, and an inside sales agent?

I speak with a number of business owners who think that it’s best to combine the ISA and the VA role. However, there are a few reasons why that’s not the best idea.

It’s very common for people to get VAs and ISAs mixed up, but **they are actually two very different roles.**

Some business owners want to do their own lead follow up while producing, and others want the VA to handle lead follow up for them.

The problem is, neither of those options are sustainable if you want to systematize your sales process and create predictable revenue.

When you do lead follow up on your own or have your VA handle it, there is usually a point of diminished returns about three to six months later. Why? Your prospector isn’t prospecting because they do lead follow up 90% of the time, or you’re not doing your lead follow up because you would rather be out in front of consumers to grow your business.

 **In order to truly systematize your sales process, you need these two separate roles.** VAs will identify the opportunity, add it to your sales pipeline, find the motivating fact, get them to verbally opt-in to be contact by an agent, and market-qualify the lead.

 Your ISA is the person who spends the bulk of their time on the phone with your leads, teeing them up so that you can sign a contract with them.

 The ISA’s job is to build rapport. They spend more time with your leads than anyone else in the sales process. I always recommend that our clients have an ISA in the office responsible for nurturing, educating, and converting leads. At 1000 Calls A Day, we take care of adding new opportunities to your pipeline and keeping your ISA busy.
