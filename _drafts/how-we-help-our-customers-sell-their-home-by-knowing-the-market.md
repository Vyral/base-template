"How do you feel now that your house is sold?<br>Relieved. We have a new place to move into and we can pay for it.

How did Eric get the most our of your home sale?<br>He had a strategy and knew what the market was. It was priced just right.

How did Eric's team go above and beyond the home sale process?<br>He was in constant contact with us and gave us lots and lots of feedback.

Do you have any additional comments you'd like to share?<br>I feel like the guidelines and strategy he gave us were really helpful."
