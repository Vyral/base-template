If you wait to get pre-approved, you could risk losing out on homes. You could find the perfect home, but if you aren't pre-approved, the seller may go in a different direction. <b>We come across buyers all the time who don't get pre-approved</b> because they don't think they will find something. When they don't find anything, it's a much more difficult process.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The pre-approval process is pretty straightforward for Suzi. <b>She looks through 2 years of income, bank statements, and employment situations</b> and if she submits your loan, you know you are pre-approved.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If you have any questions, about getting pre-approved, or about anything else, please feel free to give us a call. We'd love to answer them.&nbsp;</span>
