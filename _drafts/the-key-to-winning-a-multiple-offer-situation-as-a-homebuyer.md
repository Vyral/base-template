If you’re a buyer, the key to winning a multiple offer situation is working with an agent who can structure your contract in a way that beats out all the other buyers.

Right now there’s low inventory in our marketplace, and because of this, we’re seeing a lot of multiple offer situations happening with listed homes.

If you’re a buyer and you find yourself in a multiple offer situation, it’s important that you work with an agent who can structure your contract in a way that allows you to beat out the other buyers and their offers.

Some of the tactics our team has used in the past when negotiating on behalf of a buyer in a multiple offer situation include:

* Raising the earnest money
* Shortening up the closing time
* Writing an as-is contract

These are all options that can be assessed based on how the situation progresses. Ultimately though, when you make an offer on a property that has two, four, six, or even 10 other offers (which isn’t uncommon in today’s market), these are tools you and your agent can use to get the home of your dreams.
