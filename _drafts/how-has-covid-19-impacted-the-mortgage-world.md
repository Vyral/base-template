Matt Nader from <u><a target="_blank" href="https://firsthome.com/">First Home Mortgage</a></u> joins us again today. Certainly, a lot is going on due to the pandemic, and many people want to know whatâ€™s happening in the mortgage world. Matt will help us understand how the health crisis has impacted the mortgage industry, what specifically has changed so far, and what we may see in the future.

Some banks pulled services back, small banks went under, guidelines changed immensely, and more.
