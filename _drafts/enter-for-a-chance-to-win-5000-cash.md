<br>There has been a lot of bad news intruding on our daily lives lately. Today you have a chance to do something completely different, as I have some great news to share.

**What would you do with $5,000?** I want to invite you to enter the Maxwell 2020 Dream Vacation Sweepstakes. The previous year's winner came from our office, so maybe this year it could be you.

**All you need to do is <u><a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2I6dcQx">follow this link</a></u> and fill out the information**. There is no purchase necessary and no obligation required. If you win, you’ll get $5,000 to plan the vacation of your dream.

Maxwell is also holding smaller monthly draws, and I’ll be holding additional monthly draws for just my clients as well.

If you have any questions for me about real estate in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out.. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
