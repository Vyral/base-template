Do you ever feel like you’re running the agent rat race?&nbsp;

The market is good right now, so it’s easy for single agents to run themselves ragged doing business. We totally understand that—we spent a lot of time in our careers as single agents, and we believe that a team is a valuable way to get out of the agent rat race.&nbsp;

One of the myths it’s easy to talk yourself into if you’re a single agent is that you can do everything and skip paying for things like transaction coordination, communicating with title companies, and other services.&nbsp;

When it comes to this myth and agent activities, single agents like to believe their time isn’t worth what it should be worth. What they end up doing when they meet with a client who tries to beat them up over their commission is offer a discount—they discount themselves, their service, and their fees. They then stay in the rat race by convincing themselves they only need to work harder and put more time in.&nbsp;

The reality is, we all only have 24 hours in a day. As much as some of us want to think we’re Superman, there is not enough time in the day to increase business volume to what we think we’re capable of doing. This philosophy leads to agent burnout.&nbsp;

You can spend your time scurrying around, putting up signs, and hanging lockboxes if you want. On a team, though, you have someone else doing those jobs so you can focus on writing purchase agreements, getting contracts signed, and prospecting.&nbsp;

You can work hard and be effective as a single agent, but you will cap out at a certain volume because you don’t have enough time in the day to do it all.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about our team or are interested in attending some of our training sessions, don’t hesitate to contact us. We’d be happy to speak with you.&nbsp;
