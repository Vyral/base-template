For the current state of interest rates, Al tells us that rates are 1% higher across the board on all fixed-rate mortgages.<b> This equates to 4.3% on 30 year fixed-rate mortgages and 3.3% for 15 year fixed-rate mortgages compared to 2013 when that rates were hovering around 3.3% on a 20 year fixed-rate mortgage and 2% for 15 year fixed-rate mortgages.</b><br /><br /><b>Although there rates have slightly increased, they are still at great levels. </b>Over the course of Al’s lending career, he tells us that the highest interest rates he has seen was back in the early to mid-1990s when a conventional fixed-rate’s interest rate was 9% and government mortgages sat at 10%. To outdate Al, I was selling real estate in the 1980s when my wife and I obtained an adjustable-rate loan with an interest rate of 13.75%. The fixed-rate option was 18.5%!<br /><br />Needless to say, rates are still affordable; but in what direction are they headed? Al tells us that due to Fed signaling the tapering of bond purchases which has artificially been supporting the interest rates for past several years, interest rates will gradually rise.<b> Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have given Al an annual prediction of where interest rates will be and they believe that the interest rates for a 30 year mortgage may hit 5%.</b><br /><br />If you’re thinking about buying or selling, rates are headed up! Rates are still very low but when it comes to buying or selling, need to do it sooner rather than later. A special thanks to Al for joining us and have a great day!
