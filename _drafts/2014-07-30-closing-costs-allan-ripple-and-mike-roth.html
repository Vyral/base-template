Is it a fee the bank charges? Is it straight profit for the lender or does the agent get a cut? Today we're going to set the record straight so you know exactly where your money is going. Closing costs is a catch-all that includes a handful of different services that need to be taken care of before you move in. Here's what your money is going toward:</span></span></div><ul><li><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><b>Appraisals:</b></u> This is necessary to certify the value of the property. It is a way to ensure the lender isn't over-lending on a property and that you're not overpaying for a property. Appraisals serve to protect both the buyer and the lender and typically cost around $350 for a single-family home, although this price can vary depending on the complexity of the property being appraised.<u><b>&nbsp;</b></u></span></span></li><li><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><b>Title insurance:</b></u> The lender has interest in the title to make sure he or she has the first lien position on the property. Essentially, this has to do with the portion of the title insurance that the buyer pays a security interest on. This fee goes to the title closer, and is typically around $325-$350, but can be higher depending on the title company.<u><b>&nbsp;</b></u></span></span></li><li><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><b>Recording deeds:</b></u> There is also a fee to record the deed in the mortgage. In Wisconsin, they charge $30 per original document for recording. This fee gets paid to the registry deeds office.<u><b>&nbsp;</b></u></span></span></li><li><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><b>Flood certification:</b></u> You need to make sure your home isn't in a 100-year flood plain. If it is, you will be required to buy flood insurance.</span></span>&nbsp;</li><li><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In addition, there are certain <i><b>"prepayables"</b></i>, expenses you have to pay in advance, that you'll have to deal with. The prepaid interest for the month in which you close is included in this fee. Annual homeowner's insurance is also taken into account - depending on the value and location of your home, you will pay between $800-$2,000. </span></span></li></ul><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">As you can see, the closing costs you pay aren't going right into the lender's pocket. Rather, the fees get paid to 3rd parties that perform the necessary duties upon closing. It's a compliance function that ensures that the lender is complying with all the rules and regulations of the loan program - <b>your money is not paying for the lender's fee and it is not profit for the bank</b>. Now you don't need to get frustrated with having to pay the ambiguously labeled "closings costs" because you know where that money is going. <br /><br />If you have any further questions about the real estate process feel free to give us a call or shoot us an email.
