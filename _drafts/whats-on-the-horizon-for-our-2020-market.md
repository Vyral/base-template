With 2019 behind us, what’s in store for our 2020 real estate market?

We’re kicking off the year with really low interest rates—lower than they were at this time last year. **Now is a fabulous time to lock in those low rates with a home purchase.** Research tells us that more millennials than ever will buy homes this year, and they’re wise to take advantage of these low rates. Research also forecasts that rates will remain low all year long.&nbsp;

If you’re a home seller, high demand coupled with low supply spells opportunity. The market is starving for inventory, which means there will be a lot of demand for your home. Now is the time to start planning your home sale so you can maximize your profit.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about our market or would like help buying or selling, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;
