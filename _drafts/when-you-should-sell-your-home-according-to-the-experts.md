Most real estate experts can agree that the best time to sell a home is in the spring months. Now we have the data to prove why.

“What is the best month to sell your home?” is today’s topic and with it comes a bit of controversy. **Real estate experts across the country agree that spring is the best time to sell your home**. However, do the facts support this view?

Real estate web platform Homelight wanted to find the actual answer, so they looked at different markets to see when the best time was to sell a home. &nbsp;**What they found was that spring did come out on top in many situations, however, not all of them**.

For example, Greenville, South Carolina’s best month was July, which beat out the average sales price by 150%. &nbsp;Meanwhile, Breckenridge, Colorado’s February was the winner with a 106% increase over the average. And, Tomball, Texas homes sold in October for 133% more than the average for the year.

So, what does all this mean for you? If you want a broad recommendation for when to sell your home, list your home right now at the very start of spring. It is a recommendation that can't be beat.

While spring is best for selling your home, there are a lot of details that need to be taken into consideration when doing it. Weather is a big one. Recent real estate trends in the area, as well as the specifics of your own home and the kinds of homebuyers it is likely to attract, are also important factors.

For example, while there are fewer homebuyers in the fall and winter, they tend to be more serious and eager to find a place before the holidays. In the summer there may be added pressure because of school returning to session. In short, **it’s not as simple as saying that spring is the best time to sell** for everyone.
