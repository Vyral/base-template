*I want to thank you all for your support in 2017! You helped us exceed our goals and win four awards.*

I want to give a big shout out and thank you to all of our past clients, family, and friends who helped us exceed our goals in 2017.&nbsp;

We were the recipients this week of four special awards based on closings and productions, and **we couldn’t have done it without you!**

I would like to thank everyone for helping us get there. We look forward to helping you all in 2018.<br>&nbsp;
