 <br /><i><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">"The Lee Tessier team was on top of their game! We had 2 different Realtors, one for buying and one for selling, so each can focus on their own buying and selling. We thought they did a great job and that it was very cool that they can split that up. They’re very professional and they really know their stuff! I recommend them to everybody because they just know what they’re doing!"</span></span></i><br /><br />
