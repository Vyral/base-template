Allan Ripple is here today to answer some common questions I receive from my clients in Milwaukee regarding credit and financing.<br /><br /><u><i>Does it hurt my credit score when the lender checks my credit?</i></u><br />When a bank pulls a credit report, you will see a 2 or 3 point drop in your score. This doesn't affect the bank that pulled your score, but it will affect banks who pull your credit report after that. If you are not happy with the terms that are offered to you by the first bank, then when you come to me your score will appear a few points lower to me because of that recent inquiry. <br /><br />So, if you go to multiple lenders and they keep pulling reports, then eventually it would have an impact on your credit score. However, in the pre-approval process for buying a home, your credit will likely only be checked one time. <br /><br /><u><i>Is it really worth getting pre-approved before going out and looking for homes?</i></u><br />Yes, Absolutely. It's always a nightmare to find your dream home and then realize that you are not qualified to buy it. Typically I can get someone approved within a day. It takes about 10-15 minutes on the phone and then I'll have a client email me the things I need such as bank statements, pay stubs, tax returns, etc. The approval really takes no time and it can protect you immensely when buying a home. <br /><br />The bottom line here is that you should not search for a home until you have been approved to purchase one. <b>Besides, you will be a much more attractive buyer to a seller when you have been approved to buy a home.</b><br />&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">As always, if you have any questions about this or if you are looking to buy or sell in Milwaukee, then please do not hesitate to contact me. </span></span>
