There are a lot of potentially stressful moments in a real estate transaction, and today I’m joined by Heather Blanchard, one of our team’s agents, to tell you how we make our buyers’ home purchases as stress-free as possible. This will give you an idea of what you should expect from your agent.

In Heather’s opinion, **one of the most stressful periods of a home purchase is going through the due diligence process**. That’s when you have to get your appraisal done and conduct your inspections on the home. Sometimes, that inspection report can contain a long list of items to address. Fortunately, a lot of those items are typically nothing to worry about.

When we work with our buyers, **we go through each item on that inspection report and advise them on which issues they should fix and which they shouldn’t worry about**. After we negotiate with the seller over what repairs to make, we have a Rolodex of contractors we can put you in touch with who will quote you on how much each repair will cost.

Heather herself is a certified yoga instructor, so she knows a thing or two about stress relief.

“I try to help you take the stress out of the process by just reminding people that it’s good to take a step back, take a couple of deep breaths, and that everything can be resolved,” she says.

If you have any more questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
