Before you move into a newly built home, there are a few key things to keep in mind.

First, choose a reputable developer. Talking to people within the community and going over online reviews can tell you a lot about the kind of person you’ll be working with and the quality of work they do.

Beyond just knowing the quality of person you’re working with, you need to understand how the quality of materials will affect your new home. Add-ons like granite countertops, additional bathrooms, upgraded cabinets, and more will really add up in terms of price. **Choosing what is most important to you without going overboard is key. &nbsp;**

To ensure that your specifications are being met, that the process is going as it should, and that the job is being done correctly, stay in regular contact with the contractor. Always be involved with the building process by having regular meetings to discuss the home.

Even though you’ll be able to customize your new home, your neighborhood will be one thing you won’t have as much control over.

Having a qualified local agent give you information on things like crime rates and local schools can give you a better grasp on where you’ll be living. Remember to meet your new neighbors, as well.

Your agent can also give you tips on what to check for when you perform walkthroughs of your home—which you should do often during the building process. But remember to be flexible. Deadlines are in place for a reason. However, **when a new home is being built from scratch, you can expect issues and delays to arise.**

Always have a plan for where you’ll be staying if you need to move out of your old home before the new one is finished.

Once the home is ready, though, you should perform a final walkthrough before closing escrow. Inspect the property carefully for any defects. If everything goes smoothly, you still should look into new home warranties and insurance. Get a copy of the builder’s warranty, which usually lasts for 10 years, and also purchase additional coverage through a local home warranty company.

Your agent will be a wealth of knowledge throughout the process, so when as things come to a close remember to ask them for their recommendations on home insurance. They are there to help.

If you have any other questions or want more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
