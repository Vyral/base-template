Every so often, a veteran will ask me, “What happens if I want to rent out a room in my property?” The answer is through **boarder income,** and today I’ll bring some of the “gotchas” associated with that to light so that you can avoid any missteps. &nbsp;&nbsp;

One of the first things to take note of is that the area being rented out can’t exceed 25% of the overall square footage of the property.

As for “gotcha” No. 2, the veteran renting their property out must already possess two years of experience as a landlord. Without that experience, hiring a property management company that’s been in existence for more than two years is a prerequisite (or loophole) to having tenants on your property.&nbsp;&nbsp;

**If you plan to use your rental income to qualify, the rent you generate can only be used to offset your mortgage.** In other words, you won’t receive credit for rent that goes over and above the mortgage cost. Though it doesn’t occur often, it’s certainly something to bear in mind.&nbsp;

If you’re a veteran who is considering or already is renting out space in your property, please get in touch with me. Or if you’re a Realtor and you have a client who’s considering this avenue, reach out to me as well.&nbsp;

**Don’t forget about the credit we offer up to $1,500 for veterans and other heroes through our “Homes for Heroes” program.** It’s a small token of our appreciation and our way of saying thanks to the wonderful veterans who’ve served us. Now it’s our turn to serve you. &nbsp;&nbsp;

If you have any other questions for me, you’re encouraged to reach out. I’d be happy to help with any and all of your real estate needs\! &nbsp;
