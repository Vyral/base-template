{% include youtube.html %}<center>What kind of loans are used most commonly in our market? Let’s discuss.</center>

In our local market, there are four types of home loans we see used more often than any others. Today, I’ll share what each of them is and what they entail.

**1\. FHA loans.** While this loan is commonly associated with and used by first-time homebuyers, you don’t have to be buying your first home to make use of it. Buyers of all types will be happy to know that this loan allows them to get into a property for just 3.5% down. However, there is a $294,000 maximum loan amount for this product.&nbsp;

<br>**2\. VA loans.** These loans are specifically designed for veterans, who can use it to buy a home with zero down. The max loan for this is also fairly generous, at around $453,000. Better yet, the loan also reduces or removes the expense of mortgage insurance, depending on your circumstances.&nbsp;

<br>**3\. Conventional loans.** This is perhaps the most common type of loan product. Those who use it can put down as little as 3.5% down, but submitting a down payment of at least 20% is preferable if you want to lower your monthly payments.&nbsp;

<br>**4\. Jumbo loans.** If you need to borrow more than $453,000, this is the loan product you’ll need to get.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
