If you have any documents, paperwork, or mail you need shredded, you’re in luck. You’re invited to our upcoming shredding day on July 14. **The event will run from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m., so be sure to drop by our office (located at 3030 Old Ranch Parkway in Seal Beach).**

There will be three shredding trucks in our parking lot, and this event is absolutely free. **You’re certainly welcome to make a donation to KW Cares, but there’s no obligation to do so.**

Last year this event was a big success. We filled up three shredding trucks and actually had to close up early. There’s no need to RSVP, but you may want to show up toward the beginning of the event to ensure you’re able to get in.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
