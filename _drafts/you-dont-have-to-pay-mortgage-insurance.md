<center><em>When you buy a home with us, we can give you access to a program that can save you tens of thousands of dollars over time</em></center>

<br>There’s a large misconception that if you don’t put down 20% when you buy a home, you’ll be required to pay for mortgage insurance. Due to this, most buyers end up spending thousands of dollars on mortgage insurance over time.

However, **Franklin Loan Center offers a program that only requires 3% down with no mortgage insurance throughout the life of the loan**. This allows you to keep money in your pocket and fix your monthly payment to exactly where you want it to be.

If you or anyone you know has questions about this program, purchasing a home, or refinancing a home, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to answer any questions you have
