Each year for the last five years, Christine and Company has been selling homes for 6% more than local averages.

When I tell people this, I get one of two responses. People either roll their eyes, or their eyes go wide. The people who roll their eyes can’t imagine someone outperforming the market the way we do. **6% in this market is a huge deal—it’s typically a $30,000 price difference.**

People who roll their eyes at our performance simply don’t think that different agents have different results. This makes no sense. Every business has above, below, and average performers. This goes for real estate, as well.

People with the wide-eyed response, however, want to know how we do it. I’ll tell you. For starters, there is a 14-day program we put each house we list through. You can download that program here[LINK]. But, more importantly, we track that number. **I promise that if you ask Realtors what their sales-to-list price ratio is, most won’t know it off the top of their head.** Many Realtors simply don’t measure it.

The math behind our success all comes down to measuring numbers. We couldn’t get better if we didn’t take these measurements. We measure, then we hustle. From drone videos to door knocking and more, we do everything we can to achieve consistently above-average performance.

**For a deeper look at how we get 6% more on the homes we sell, pick up a copy of the book “Shortchanged by Shortcuts? 44 Surprising Ways People Rip Themselves Off When Buying or Selling Their Home.”** This book will help you educate yourself on the things my team and I do every day. It will teach you the importance of measuring numbers, and why you should never work with agents who don’t keep track of their performance.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
