Today I’m excited to share my predictions for the 2020 Phoenix real estate market.

**There are a couple of things we know for sure**. First, there is going to be a presidential election. Second, the market will probably continue on its current trend.

During an election year, we often see the market slowdown leading up to the election. People tend to freeze and wait for the outcome of the election before they feel comfortable moving forward with a big financial transaction.

A couple of other factors that directly impact our market include business growth, population growth, and retirees moving to the area. **I predict those things will continue because Arizona is a great place for businesses to operate**, often at lower tax rates and operating costs than they already were.

My prediction for 2020 is that our market will stay pretty consistent with mild appreciation.

If you have any questions for me or if you’re thinking about making a move in 2020, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you and help you start getting a plan together.
