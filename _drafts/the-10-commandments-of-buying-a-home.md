Today I want to talk about a few of the 10 commandments of buying a home.

It can take anywhere from three weeks to three months or longer from the time you're pre-approved to the time you close on a property. During that time, there are many things that can come up and affect your ability to be approved for your mortgage loan. **It is important that after you are initially pre-approved, your finances don’t change.  **

An example of a negative financial change is getting a new job. **Even if it is more money, it can still impact your chances of getting your loan finalized.** You also don’t want to quit your job during the home buying process because lenders must verify your employment 10 days before closing. Other things to avoid are buying a new car or spending your down payment money. To find out why as well as what the other six commandments are, you can read the full list [here.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/Wade+Betz/10+Commandments+for+Home+Buyers.pdf)
