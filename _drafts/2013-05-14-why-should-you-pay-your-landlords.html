Still, so many people are hung up on renting versus buying. Rather than wasting away thousands upon thousands of dollars every year toward someone else’s mortgage – why not invest in your own future? We take a look at just a few of the many advantages to owning your home as opposed to renting. <br /><br /><b><span style="font-size: large;">Very Few Choices, Lots of Rent</span></b><br />Most landlords these days know that renters are either leasing their apartment because they have credit issues, or because they simply don’t realize that buying a home these days is as affordable as renting. But with the many people that are out there renting, fewer properties are available for lease giving landlords the opportunity to charge more rent – a lot more rent.<br /><br /><b><span style="font-size: large;">Today’s Low Rates, Tomorrow’s Equity</span></b><br />Buyers today are able to leverage the historically low interest rates that are still available. They may not last forever but at least for now and projected until at least the end of 2013 you can get a great rate. The lower your interest rate, the stronger buying power you can expect to have when buying and building your own equity.<br /><b><span style="font-size: large;"><br />Comparable Monthly Payments, More Amenities</span></b><br />Think of the freedom one has when they own their own home. Now if you could buy a home for the same amount of money it costs you each month to rent, the amenities you will enjoy in a home far outweigh an apartment. You will have the freedom to do what you want with the space while enjoying the autonomy that comes with homeownership. <br /><br /><b><span style="font-size: large;">Tax Advantages That Put More Money In Your Pocket</span></b><br />Homeowners, particularly new homeowners, enjoy many tax benefits of owning their own residence. For starters, you can deduct all your property taxes from your income taxes. You can also deduct mortgage interest and if you have a loan that has private mortgage insurance, that too is a viable tax deduction. Also, depending on your tax bracket you may be able to afford more house for the same monthly payment amounts.<br /><br />~<br />To find out how you can maximize your housing dollars while at the same time invest in your future – contact us today.
