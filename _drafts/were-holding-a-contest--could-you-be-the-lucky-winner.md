Today, I’ve have a fun announcement.

First of all, you may have recently heard that the Washington Nationals baseball team just clinched the National League East Division title—which means that they will have home-field advantage in a five-game division series. (Go Nats!)

This five-game series starts on October 6th, and we couldn’t be more excited.

**Wicker Homes Group wanted to honor the Nats’ great season, so we’ve decided to run a contest.**

Because we know that all of our clients, friends, and supporters are as excited as we are, we’re giving away two tickets for the second game of the playoff series on Saturday night of October 7th.

**There are two things you have to do to enter f**or a chance at winning the tickets**:**

1. Like the [Wicker Homes Group Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/WickerHomesGroup/)
2. Share this video with your friends using the hashtag #WinWithWHG.

It’s really as simple as that. With just two steps, you can qualify to win two tickets to what we’re sure will be an awesome game.

There’s plenty of time to enter, so don’t forget to do so. **The contest starts on September 15th and the winner will be announced on Monday, October 2nd.**

We hope you’ll participate, because we’d love to make you the lucky winner.
