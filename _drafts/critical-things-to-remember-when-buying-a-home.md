<center>Dalton Davis, our lead buyer’s agent, breaks down what you need to know as a buyer in our competitive Phoenix market.</center>

Today I’d like to discuss what it’s like to be a homebuyer in the Phoenix real estate market. I’m here with Dalton Davis, our lead buyer's agent, who’s going to share with us some of the things that are critical for a buyer to take into consideration.

According to Dalton, **the home buying process starts with pre-qualification.** Make sure that you are getting in touch with a trusted mortgage and finance expert.

Also, **make sure you have strong representation.** Sit down and go through a buyer consultation so that everyone can know exactly what you're looking for. This can also help us expedite the process.

Finally, **give yourself enough time to mature through the process.** Give yourself about six to eight months to improve your credit. Find out what you're looking for, such as if you need to be in a specific neighborhood.

If you have any further questions for Dalton, you can contact him by phone or email. As always, don’t hesitate to call us if you are buying or selling a home. We will be happy to get you scheduled for a free consultation.
