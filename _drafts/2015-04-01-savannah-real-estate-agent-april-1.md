Last time, I touched briefly on the great market conditions we've had here in Savannah. Today, I want to follow up with some tips about this exciting spring season! If you're considering selling, there are some things you can do to increase your chances of a successful home sale.

* Plan: There are always tons of little things that need to be done around the home. If you plan well enough, you can list your home before the market gets too busy, which will generate interest and attract buyers.
* Landscaping: This is something that needs to be addressed every season. Anything you can do to increase your curb appeal should be done!
* Stage your home: Having a professional stager come in and make your home look fantastic will give you a huge advantage in the marketplace. Staging will show buyers the space in your home to its fullest potential.
* Touch up and make little repairs: Fix stains in the carpets and dents in the wall. New construction is making a comeback in Savannah, so many of the homes you'll be competing against will be brand new. Having your home looking the best is going to increase your chances of standing out in a crowded market.

If you have any questions about preparing your home for the market, or if you would like our assistance for any of your real estate needs, give us a call or shoot us an email. We look forward to helping you soon!
