Today I want to present you with something that can help you build a team and build your business.

In the video above, I have in my hands the organizational chart **many of the top agents here at KW Realty use to go from being a solo agent to building what we call a “seventh-level business empire.”**

What’s cool about this is Gary Keller talks about the seven levels of real estate success in his book “The Millionaire Real Estate Agent,” which was published nearly 11 years ago. On page 202 of that book, you’ll find a lot of the same models and systems this chart has.

This chart, though, has updated versions of them—they’re the new seven levels from a course we teach called “Business By the Book.”

I’d love to share these models and systems with you. <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/Jerimiah+Taylor/Email+Assets/San+Diego+Recruiting/mrea+2.0+org+chart+.pdf" target="_blank">You can download a PDF copy of this chart here.</a>

If you have any more questions about how you can build your business to the seventh level, give me a call so we can sit down together and get started. I’d love to help you.
