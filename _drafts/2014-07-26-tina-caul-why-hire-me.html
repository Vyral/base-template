If you're considering  buying a home, <a href="http://realestate.caulgroup.com/search-city.php">GO HERE to perform a Full Home Search</a>, or if you're a prospective home seller, <a href="http://www.caulgroup.com/form-cma.php">CLICK HERE to obtain a Free Home Value Report</a>.

With around 4,000 agents in real estate, how are you supposed to know who you can trust? Here are 3 reasons I think that I would be the best possible addition to your real estate transaction moving forward:</span></span></div><ol><li><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><b>Results:</b></u> The average amount of transactions per Realtor is 6-8 annually. In the last 12 months alone, I've helped over 135 buyers and sellers. <b>I feel that past experience is an indicator of future results.</b> My team does business differently than the rest, as our results clearly show.&nbsp;</span></span></li><li><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><b>Knowledge:</b></u> I've been in the business for 14 years and have helped over 800 buyers and sellers work through their real estate transactions. The industry is more complex than it's ever been - as many as 25-30 people are involved in a real estate transaction from start to finish, as well as over 13 different industries. Everyone on our team has a specific role, which means we have experts in every area of real estate to help make sure you have a stress-free experience.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><b>Communication:</b></u> The biggest complaint I hear from our friends and clients is that agents they've worked with in the past were poor communicators.&nbsp; An agent would list their home and they would never hear why it didn't sell, or weren't told what was going on with their closing or lending situation. In short, <b>the agents provided their clients with no feedback.</b> My team strives to stay in constant communication with you and believe that when we learn something about the transaction there should be an immediate follow-up to keep you informed. </span></span></li></ol><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to hire me over the average agent. My team goes above and beyond to ensure your real estate experience is stress-free. If you are interested in buying or selling a home, don't hesitate to call - you won't regret it.<i> </i></span></span></div>
