Today I want to tell you about the three top benefits of selling in the fall.

I’m sure you’ve heard the conventional wisdom that spring is the best time to sell a home. The reason people believe this is because that time of year is when we see the highest number of listings and buyers.

But as long as the levels of buyers and sellers in the market remains even, those benefits are sort of nullified. The fact of the matter is: the fall can be a great time to sell. Let’s go over some reasons why.

1. **There is less competition for sellers.** Fewer listings on the market mean your own home is going to stand out to the many buyers that are still out there looking.
2. **Buyers in the market are more motivated.** People who are moving in the fall and winter are doing so because they have to. You can be sure that the people who are looking at your listing aren’t just doing so for fun.
3. **The process goes quicker.** Because fewer transactions take place at this time of year, the contractors who will assist you in the process are less busy in general. This means that they will be afforded more flexibility. In turn, you’ll be able to have a faster transaction due to their lighter work load.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
