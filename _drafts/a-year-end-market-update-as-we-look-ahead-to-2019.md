Now that we’ve entered into the new year, we’d like to wish you all the best in 2019!&nbsp;

Let’s take a moment to look back at our active, yet unique, 2018 market.&nbsp;

**Spring of 2018 saw a strong upsurge in activity—the busiest season in our market that I can remember.** On the whole, this boom was generally characteristic of 2018’s market, and it led to a strong finish.&nbsp;

However, we saw changes in the market, as well. &nbsp;

As spring turned to summer, activity waned a little, which was likely due to an extremely strong market performance from the previous season and other factors typical of a market slowdown like kids being out of school, families going on vacation, etc.&nbsp;

We came out of the summer plateau with another burst of activity as fall arrived—it was, again, as busy as I can remember. We appeared to be well on our way to repeating (or even topping) that earlier boom we experienced in the springtime.&nbsp;

**But then, disaster struck—Hurricane Michael reached our shores.** Though it didn’t directly impact our area, it was definitely a catalyst for some changes in our market. The level of activity we saw throughout much of 2018 sunk a little from there.&nbsp;

Despite all of that, our year actually ended on a high note; market activity rebounded, and we were busy again as 2018 came to a close. This bodes well for our market in the new year.&nbsp;

**We have a lot of people discovering our area for the first time, and with more people working remotely from home, there are great opportunities for our residential market.**
