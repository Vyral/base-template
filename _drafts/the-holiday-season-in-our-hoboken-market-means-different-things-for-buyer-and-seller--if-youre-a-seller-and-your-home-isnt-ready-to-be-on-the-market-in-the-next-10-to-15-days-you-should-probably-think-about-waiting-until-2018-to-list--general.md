  The holiday season in our Hoboken market means different things for buyer and
  seller.   If you’re a seller and your home isn’t ready to be on the market in
  the next 10 to 15 days, you should probably think about waiting until 2018 to
  list. Generally speaking, the buyer pool decreases a tad from Thanksgiving to
  New Year’s and the market shifts away from you.   However, now is the perfect
  time to get started on your marketing for 2018, and there are a couple reason
  why. First, fall is a beautiful time of year, meaning your home’s photography
  will look a lot better. Secondly, now is the time of year when people focus on
  hosting friends and family for the holidays, which means homes will be cleaner
  and look nicer. From a staging standpoint, you can take advantage of this by
  taking pictures of the interior.  If you’re a buyer, this is one of the few
  times of the year that the market will work in your favor in our area. As I
  said, the buyer pool shrinks and homes tend to sit on the market longer.  
  Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, if you have any more questions about our
  Hoboken market or you’re thinking of making a move soon, don’t hesitate to
  reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
