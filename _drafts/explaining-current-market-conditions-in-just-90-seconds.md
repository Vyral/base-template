<center>Conditions have begun to even out in our real estate market, and today we’d like to share what this may mean for you.</center>

It’s time for another market update, and we’ve got some interesting developments to report today.

After rising for a few months, prices are beginning to level out. **From a lending standpoint, this is a very good thing**.

When prices are on the way up, a lot of appraisals come back short. But now, homes are more likely to appraise, and this allows more people to proceed through their home purchase with fewer issues.

We’re also currently seeing some advantageous conditions for sellers. **Even though conditions have evened out, homes are still selling quickly** and multiple offer situations are still quite common. Overall, our market is still in good shape.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
