Today we’re back to answer another common mortgage question: “What happens to your mortgage after closing?” and “What is Loan Servicing?”

**What is “Loan Servicing”?** That’s what most people associate a mortgage with. It includes the management of your monthly payment, interest, and escrow accounts. That’s the function of your servicer and that’s what we at Guardian keep on all the loans we originate, with very few exceptions. We continue to be your point of contact for payments, questions about your loan, managing your escrow accounts (if applicable), and keep track of principal and interest paid. At Guardian, we are dedicated to ensuring that our customers receive the highest level of service, the most accurate information, and timely responses to your questions.
