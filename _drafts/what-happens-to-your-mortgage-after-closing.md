Today we’re back to answer another common mortgage question: “What happens to your mortgage after closing?”

**Most people are not aware that their loan comes in two halves.** One half is the mortgage note, which typically gets sold to an investor so that we can get our money back and use it to lend to someone else. The only exceptions to this are portfolio loans, which are usually offered by depository institutions and stay on their books as an asset as opposed to being sold to an investor.

**The other half is the mortgage servicing**. That’s what most people associate a mortgage with. It includes your monthly payment, interest, and escrow account. That’s the function of your servicer and that’s what we keep on all the loans we originate, with very few exceptions.

We are looking for customers for life. The reality is that you’re paying us every single month for 10, 20, or even 30 years, so we need to make sure we live up to and exceed your expectations at every step of the process to have a happy partnership.
