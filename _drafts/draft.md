title: Why Are Firms Leaving the Broker Recruitment Protocol?
tags:

excerpt: >-
  Welcome to the first installment of my series about the sometimes crazy world
  of wealth management recruiting. Today, I want to talk about a major change in
  the business regarding the broker recruitment protocol—both UBS and Morgan
  Stanley have decided that they will be leaving the protocol altogether. Formed
  as an agreement in 2004, the protocol dictated the terms in which an advisor
  could take certain data and go from one firm to another without the fear of
  litigation. To find out what this major shift in the business means to you,
  watch my latest video.

I run a wealth management recruiting firm based in White Plains, New York, and believe it or not, I’ve been doing this for 33 years. This is the first of what I hope to be a series of videos in which I will talk about the crazy wealth management recruitment world.

Today, I’ll be talking about the **broker recruiting protocol.** If you’re in the wealth management business, this is important for you to understand.

The big news has been that **UBS and Morgan Stanley have decided to leave the broker recruiting protocol.**

**The protocol was designed as an agreemen**t among major firms in 2004, which **dictated the methodology by which an advisor could take certain data and go from one firm to another without the fear of litigation.** The firms signed it because they felt that they would be taking more advisors in than they would be losing. Therefore, it made sense to be part of the protocol.

The dominance of wirehouses in this business for the past four years has been dissipating, and\*\* they’ve now decided that they are at more risk of losing people going forward than they are of gaining more advisors.\*\*

If you’re convinced that you’re going to be losing more advisors than gaining, why would you stay in a protocol that makes it easier for advisors to depart? Since Wells and Merrill Lynch have the same challenges as big firms like Morgan Stanley and UBS do, it makes sense to me that it is much more likely than not that they will also leave the protocol sometime in 2018.

If you’re at Wells and Merrill Lynch,\*\* I think you owe it to yourself to learn from the playbook of what’s happened at these other two firms.\*\*

They’ve essentially given four days’ notice to their advisors that are leaving the protocol. At the end of the document, it states that you’re supposed to give 10 days’ notice. It’s not a requirement, by any means, but it is a recommendation. Obviously, this is not the case with UBS and Morgan Stanley.

Since you’re a planner helping your clients with portfolio insurance, life insurance, and disability insurance, why wouldn’t you now have career insurance? It is almost a certainty that at some point, your firm will leave the protocol, making it more difficult for you to leave.<br><br>If you’re convinced that you want to stay at the same firm for the rest of your career, I wish you luck; I have no rancor towards that decision. You might be emotionally mature enough to not care, and you can live happily ever after at your current firm.

However, if you’re thinking of leaving or if you’ve not been happy, you owe it to yourself and your career to do two things before your firm leaves the protocol:

1. **You owe it to yourself to explore and see what the best firms for yourself might be.**This might mean going independent or switching to a smaller firm. Whatever it is, you can’t know whether it’s right for you, your clients, and your practice until you actually leave. There is a lot of preparation for a successful transition that you can do with the protection of the protocol that is forbidden with said protection.
2. **Give me a call**so I can give you some advice about your options if your firm is leaving the protocol.

In my next video, I’ll be discussing what you can do if, unfortunately, you’re with one of those firms that has already left the protocol. If you have any questions about this topic, please give me call at (914) 682-4000.
