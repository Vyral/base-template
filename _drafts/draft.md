title: Set 5 Appointments By Talking to 100 People

  How do you set five appointments by talking to 100 people? The key is knowing
  what to say. I recently went through Keller Williams’ BOLD program, and one
  very important question I learned to ask that I wasn’t saying when previously
  interacting with people is whether they knew anyone who was buying, selling,
  or investing in real estate. To find out how asking this one question to 100
  people will yield five appointments, watch my latest video.

There is a way that you can set five appointments by talking to 100 people, and I’ll tell you how. &nbsp;

I just recently went through Keller Williams’ BOLD program, and it was an incredible experience. One of the things we were challenged to do there was talk to 100 people about real estate every single week.

On my team, we generally talk to 10 to 15 people about real estate every day, so taking that number up a notch was quite a bit of extra work. We learned that it’s definitely possible, though, and if you say the right things, you can set five appointments

One thing I learned to say that I wasn’t saying when previously interacting with people is the recognition that I’m in sales and my job is to find real estate problems and solve them. **What I was failing to do with everyone I talked to was ask them if they knew anyone who was buying, selling, or investing in real estate.**

This sounds really simple, but imagine if you talked to 100 people while knowing full well that each one of those people probably knows 200 to 250 other people, and that a certain percentage of the population moves each year. The reality is, if you ask that question to 100 people, you’ll get contacts, referrals, and prospects to follow up with who will be buying or selling a home within the next 12 months.

So after several weeks of BOLD training, my team and I have endeavored to ask one simple question to everyone we talk to on the phone before hanging up, and it goes something like this:

“Hey [name], great talking to you today. Before I let you go, I’m just curious—who do you know who may be buying a home, selling a home, or investing in real estate in the next 12 to 18 months?”

If you ask this question 100 times, we’ve found that you’ll get the names of all kinds of people in their various social circles. That’s my challenge to you today: **Build your pipeline with buyer or seller appointments by asking that question habitually before you’re done talking to anyone, whether it’s on the phone or anywhere else.**

As always, if you have any questions or there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
