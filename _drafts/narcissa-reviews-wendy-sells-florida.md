Both agents reached out to me and one of them was Michael. When I started to ask questions Michael was the most responsive agent. He was helping me understand the area, which houses were better than the others, and answering all of my questions. So, my decision was pretty clear. I contacted him when I was ready to look for houses and he was very supportive. He found houses for me based on my criteria. Everything was done quickly and in a very professional manner. I found a home that I liked and I reached out to Michael because I thought it might be a good one. However, there were no pictures and I didn’t know what to do because I couldn’t go down and look at it. He told me that I could contact Wendy and she would help me with pro’s and con’s of the home. I put in an offer, got the approval, and a few days later I came to Florida to see the house and a few others to make sure I made the right decision. Wendy was very helpful, she was doing everything she possibly could to accommodate my needs. She was more patient than I expected and very dedicated. I really really appreciated it.”*<br><br>**- Narcissa Pop, Home Buyer**
