Today I thought I’d answer a question that I’m often asked by sellers: “Should I be present during my home’s showings?”

Some times, sellers think they know their home more than their agent and can share that information with the buyer. However, when the seller is present at a showing, it can and does make the buyer a little uncomfortable. If you’re not there, they’ll be more comfortable, honest, and open. If you’re there, the buyer might be afraid to give that honest feedback because they don’t want to offend you.

You don’t have to be gone when they get there, but leave during the showing for a half hour or hour. You also want to make sure all the lights are on and all the blinds are open so you get as much natural daylight as possible in the house.

In the end, let the agent handle the selling of your home. If they’re an experienced professional, it will be no problem and will lead you to happy results. If you have any other questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
