<center><em>We’re not being overly optimistic when we say a crash isn’t imminent.</em></center>

<br>So many people expect that the housing market will fail as a consequence of what’s been going on with COVID-19 and its effect on the economy. Though some of us still bear the scars of 2008, there’s no reason to believe this new crisis will drag real estate down that same dark path again.

**There are indicators that we may even come out of this ahead**; inventory is still low, and it’s still a seller’s market. We don’t see the world through rose-colored glasses, we tell it like it is. That being said, the numbers simply don’t indicate that we’re heading for housing market doom.
