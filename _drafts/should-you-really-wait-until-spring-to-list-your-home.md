If you’re looking to sell your home quickly and for top dollar, you don’t have to wait until springtime.

Should you wait for the spring to list your home or should you do it now? When is the best time to sell your home?

Everyone assumes that the answer is spring, but think about it—if everyone has that same notion, that means you’ll have to compete with a ton of other sellers if you choose to list during that time.&nbsp;

When you list your home, you want it to stand out, and you give yourself a real advantage if your home is one of the first ones on the market that buyers can get excited about. That’s why we’re advising our clients to list their homes sooner rather than later. That way, they can also deal with buyers who are taking advantage of the still-low interest rates.
