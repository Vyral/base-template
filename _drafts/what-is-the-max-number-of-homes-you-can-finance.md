What is the maximum number of properties you can finance? Find out today.

I’ve worked with a lot of investors over the years, and they always ask me how many properties they’re allowed to buy.

Of course, the answer to that is, “However many you qualify for.”

However, **different investors in the secondary mortgage market will have different limits on how much exposure they’ll have to a single investor client.** That said, the traditional investors will build their rental portfolio using Fannie Mae financing: Fannie Mae allows up to 10 financed properties at once. If you own 15 and eight of them are free and clear, you haven’t yet reached the 10-property limit.

Fannie Mae is used on the first go-around because they have the best pricing for your real estate investors, but **once you get to that tenth financed property, we need to go to a different strategy.** Typically, this comes in the form of commercial financing, but even those commercial financiers will have limits to how much exposure they’re going to have to a single individual.

Overall, you need to partner with a lender who can grow with you as your investment plans grow and lay out a strategy to help you accomplish your goals.&nbsp;
