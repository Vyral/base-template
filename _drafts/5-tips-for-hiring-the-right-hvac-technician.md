HVAC is an important job. Take care when hiring for the work in order to get the best possible outcome.

## Look for these five characteristics before hiring a technician to repair your AC or HVAC system.

Maintenance on your home’s heating and cooling system can help keep your indoor air clean.

Most homeowners will require the assistance of an HVAC technician to make repairs to their heating and cooling system at some point in their lives. HVAC technicians are specially trained service providers who install, maintain, and repair these systems.

To help ensure the job is done right,&nbsp;[look for a HVAC technician](https://www.angieslist.com/companylist/hvac.htm){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;(the link will take you to Angie’s List) with these qualifications:

**Sufficient experience**

While you don’t need to hire the most senior technician you can find, you do want ![](/uploads/hvac04.webp){: width="450" height="285"}

one that has a wealth of experience. Most master technicians will gain experience in apprenticeships or similar programs that allow them to work alongside a seasoned technician. Make sure the crew you hire has technicians with several years of experience, and that those technicians will be assigned to your property.

I have made this mistake before, after all, we are consumers, we trust the people we call to be the experts.

**Proper credentials**

If a license is required for HVAC repair in your city or state, make sure you check credentials before making a hiring decision. Licensure shows that the technician has been trained and tested in your state to properly install HVAC systems according to the state’s building codes. Insurance means that both you and the technician are protected in case there is an injury or damage to property. Look for technicians with both of these credentials in place.

**Versatility**

If possible, look for a technician who has the versatility to work with all major&nbsp;[HVAC](https://www.angieslist.com/hvac/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;systems, and even a few obscure ones. The exception to this rule would be if you own a specialized or rare HVAC system. In that case, the specialized experience could help you.

**Excellent references**

Word of mouth is often the best way to find a reliable HVAC service repair provider. If a technician does not have strong references, you want to find someone else to hire. If he or she has strong references, then you can feel confident in selecting that individual.

If you do not have friends or family members who can provide a referral, ask the technician to provide you with a list of references, and make the effort to call them. You want to hear from someone else that the technician does good work.

**The right price**

The final consideration to make is the estimated price. This should not be your first thought, since an inexperienced technician may offer a bargain price just to get your business. You want to find someone with the right credentials and experience first. Then, if you have more than one technician with similar qualifications, you can use the price quote to make a final decision.
