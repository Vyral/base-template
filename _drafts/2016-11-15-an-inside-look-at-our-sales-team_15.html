<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vDrNdork-uc?rel=0" width="560"></iframe><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">We like to give you a behind-the-scenes look at how things work on our team, so today, I've invited ISA Weston Moran to join me to talk about how he works within the team.</span></span></i></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /><b>Selling your home? <a href="http://www.greaterphillyhomelistings.com/homevalue/value" target="_blank">Get a complimentary home valuation.</a></b></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Buying a home? <a href="http://www.greaterphillyhomelistings.com/search" target="_blank">Search the complete MLS.</a></b></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I wanted to give a behind-the-scenes look at how our team works. Many people have to come together from specialized positions to help us provide you service, so today, I wanted to introduce you to inside sales agent Weston Moran. </span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">When Weston takes on a listing, the first thing he does is puts the house online to get it in front of thousands of prospective buyers. To help get the word out, he starts in close proximity by reaching out to friends, family, and neighbors in the area. We always want to prospect for buyers to get more people through the door. This prospecting for buyers can be challenging, because if these buyers aren't in the market already, there is probably a good reason. For many people, the timing just isn't right. <b>Many times, though, these prospects can lead us to people they know who are looking for a new home.</b></span></span><br /><br /></div><div class="quote-box"><span class="quote quote-left">“</span><br /><div class="quote-text">A lot of people have to come together on our team for a smooth transaction.   </div><br /><span class="quote quote-right">”</span> </div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Weston not only spends a lot of time on behalf of our listings, he also spends a lot of time looking for listings. Currently there are a lot of people looking in the <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Tredyffrin/Easttown</span> school district which was recently ranked number one in the country. Since we have so many buyers looking to get into this area, Weston will not only make phone calls to homeowners living there, <b>he'll go out in person and knock on doors as well.</b> He wants to let them know that they're in a very popular area, and if they are looking to get a high value for their home, now is a better time than ever.</span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">If you have any more questions about how we do things behind the scenes or you're interested in buying or selling a home in the greater Philadelphia area, give us a call or send us an email. We'd be happy to help!</span></span></div></div>
