  I recently sat down with Van and Bonnie to talk some more about Central Iowa
  real estate. Specifically, I talked about a few different projects I have
  going on with Kimberly Development Company. They have been around since 1978,
  and the quality and attention to detail in their homes really shines. I also
  talked about Woodland Hills Villas, what’s in and what’s out in terms of home
  trends, and much more. To hear the full episode, watch this short video.
