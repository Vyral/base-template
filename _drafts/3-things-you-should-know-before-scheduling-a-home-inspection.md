<center>What should buyers and sellers expect from the inspection process? Today I will highlight three points to think about.</center>

When scheduling a home inspection, there are a few things you should keep in mind. To give you a better idea of these considerations, I would like to share a brief list of what you should know before proceeding with the inspection process.

**1. Make sure you understand a home inspector does, and how to find and contact one**. A home inspectorâ€™s job is to identify and report any major issues with the property. They will provide a general overview of the state of the property, and make recommendations as to whether they believe any specialized inspections should be ordered. As far as finding an inspector for the job, your agent should be able to make recommendations for professionals in your area.

**2. Make sure you understand the current market**. In the Phoenix market, for example, we have homes built in the 1950s and those built within the last decade.

**3. Be aware of what inspectors are looking for**. Home inspectors will find issues, it is just a matter of how severe they are. They have to identify something to make their time performing the inspection worthwhile. And once the inspection results are in, the buyer, the seller, and both of their agents can negotiate how to address what was found.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
