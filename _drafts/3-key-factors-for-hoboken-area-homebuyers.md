If you’re looking to purchase property in the Hoboken area in 2019, there are three points to keep in mind as you’re searching for property:

**1\. Don’t focus solely on getting a deal.** All the time, we see too many people focusing on getting the best deal to the point where they forget the fact that they actually have to live in the house with their family. Make sure you’re buying a house that’s best for your and your family’s situation, not just one that looks like a good deal. If you can get a great home for a great deal, then that’s just icing on the cake.

<br>**2\. Get pre-qualified by a lender before you start searching for homes.** Don’t put the cart before the horse\! By that, we mean that buyers go property hunting before they even talk to a lender. By sitting down for the pre-qualification process with a lender, you’ll learn where you stand in terms of buying power and how much you’ll need to budget in order to make your home purchase work. They’ll also help you assess your plan so that you can find the right mortgage product for you; there might be a particular program that makes more sense for you to choose. I’ve had buyers in the past look for $500,000 houses, only to later find out that they were approved to look for houses a few hundred thousand dollars more than that.

<br>**3\. Have a proper buyer consultation.** All too often, we read feedback and reviews about agents where buyers express that they were unhappy with the home buying process they experienced. Many of them later learn that they should have sat down for a proper consultation with their Realtor, where they would’ve discussed their needs, their goals, the market, and what makes the most sense for them.

All three of these points will help your home buying experience go smoother and ensure that your and your family's needs are met. If you have any questions about buying a home, feel free to reach out to us. Let’s get to the heart of your home buying needs together.
