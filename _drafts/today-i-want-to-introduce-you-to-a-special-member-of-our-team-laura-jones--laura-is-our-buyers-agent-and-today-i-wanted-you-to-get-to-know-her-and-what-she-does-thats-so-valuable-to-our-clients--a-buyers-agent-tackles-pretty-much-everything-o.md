  Today I want to introduce you to a special member of our team, Laura Jones.
  Laura is our buyer’s agent, and today I wanted you to get to know her and what
  she does that’s so valuable to our clients. A buyer’s agent tackles pretty
  much everything on the buy side of a transaction. That includes consulting
  with the client to figure out their needs, finding properties that suit their
  needs, taking them out to view the properties, and everything from writing
  offers to writing contracts. To learn more about what buyer’s agents like
  Laura do and why she loves her job, watch my latest video.
