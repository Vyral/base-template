<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Arizona contracts are very sensitive towards buyers because they have three contingencies that would allow them not to proceed with the contract. <b>Today we'll talk briefly about these contingencies.</b></span><br /><b><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>The inspection contingency is important, and I would recommend an inspection every time that you buy or sell a home.</b> In Arizona, sellers will provide you with a seller's&nbsp;disclosure&nbsp;statement, but&nbsp;that is just the seller's opinion of the home.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>The appraisal contingency is another major one.</b> This is not required if you're paying cash, but the banks will always want to run an appraisal to ensure that they're not lending you too much money. This is kind of a safety net to ensure that you don't overpay for a home.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>The loan contingency is important because it protects buyers in the case that they are not able to proceed with a loan.</b> If a buyer loses a job, suffers from a medical attack, or any other cataclysmic event occurs, the buyer is protected.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>These are three ways that buyers are protected when they purchase a home in Arizona.</b> If you need to buy in 2016, please don't hesitate to contact me. This is a great year to purchase because interest rates are only getting higher.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">best: Buyers have three layers of protection in Arizona.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">email sbj: Three ways that Arizona home buyers are protected</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">email:</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Purchase agreements in Arizona are very buyer-sensitive. There are three different contingencies that are meant to protect a buyer in the case of a catastrophe that would not allow the buyer to purchase. For example, if buyer lost a job before buying a new home, the loan contingency would come into effect and it would make the contract null and void. Watch this video to learn more!</span>
