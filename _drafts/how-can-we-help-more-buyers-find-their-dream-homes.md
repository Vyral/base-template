I just pulled up to Pioneer Title here in Nampa to meet with a builder and some buyers about custom-designing a home. This is a really good example of what happens in the early stages of building a home.

Our buyers saw a model and liked it, but wanted a few changes to be made. We set up a meeting between them and the builder to sort things out. **A lot of the builders I work with are very accommodating and want to do everything in their power to make sure what they build is the home of your dreams.**

If you’re interested in buying a new construction home, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’d be happy to answer any questions you may have and show you some of the great new homes in the area. I look forward to hearing from you.
