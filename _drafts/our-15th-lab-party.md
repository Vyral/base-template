We just had our 15h Limbird Agents Bonus party! This means that we’ve given back $22,000 to charities in the Northwest Arkansas area.

When you list and sell your home with us, **you are supporting the community we all live and work in.**

This party featured a double giveaway, so that’s $20,000. It’s our 15th party in just under three years, which means that after this party, **we’ve given away $150,000 in bonus commissions as a thank you to our agents for all their hard work.**
