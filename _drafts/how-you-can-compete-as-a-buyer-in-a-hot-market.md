<br>How can you compete as a buyer in a hot market?

First, **have your financing in place and be ready to make a move**. Oftentimes, buyers look for houses without having their financing in order, then once they have to compete in a multiple-offer situation, they’re scrambling to get their documents in order. That’s not the way to win the home you want.

Second, **make your offer strong** (with the guidance of a professional). Have as few contingencies as possible and make your offer at or over asking price. If possible, add an escalation clause.

Third, and most importantly, **hire a proactive real estate professional**. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve gotten an offer on one of my listings from an agent I’ve never spoken to, and I only know they saw the house because they sent a showing request. It’s very important that your agent is proactive in their communication with sellers’ agents. A seller’s agent will be more comfortable recommending your offer if your agent communicates properly and instills confidence.
