  Today, I want to help you get into the holiday spirit. Sometimes it gets a
  little bit challenging to get into the holiday season here because when we
  think of a “white” Christmas, we think of sand instead of snow. That’s why
  I’ve come up with a list of fun upcoming Christmas events happening in our
  area. We have a ton of interesting things going on, like parades, boat
  parades, and even a Santa’s workshop. To see a list of all the great events
  happening this holiday season, watch my latest video.

It’s hard to believe that it’s almost the holidays when we still have beautiful sunshine and 80-degree weather right here in South Florida.

Whether you’re looking to plan a trip down to South Florida, this is your first holiday season here, or you’re a native, it gets a little bit challenging to get into the holiday season because when we think of a white Christmas, we think of sand—not snow.

That’s why I’ve found some great ways you can get into the holiday spirit. We have interesting things like parades, boat parades, and a Santa’s workshop. And guess what? We even have our own version of a snowfall.

Local holiday lights guide:

**NORTH PALM BEACH COUNTY**

The Heights of Jupiter: Dozens of houses are decorated in this huge neighborhood just east of I-95. Just wind your way up and down the streets, but don’t miss the Liberman’s home at 6198 Hollywood Street, where Donny’s handmade Flying Santa—his sleigh is pulled by a team of Dachshunds—is just landing on the roof. Pompano Street is another must-see. When the weather is nice, lots of the homeowners are out in their yards or puttering in the garage.

Snug Harbor Drive, Palm Beach Gardens: Some say as many as 350,000 lights are displayed in this neighborhood just off Prosperity Farms Road in Palm Beach Gardens.

The Sullivan’s (private home), 202 Woodbridge Drive, Jupiter

Cheri Newman (private home), 18119 126th Terrace, N., Jupiter

**CENTRAL PALM BEACH COUNTY**

Gabriel Lane, Lake Clarke Shores: This normally quiet street lights up like a pinball machine for the holidays. Lots of families park their cars and walk the street.

The Novak’s (private home), 4988 Palm Way, Lake Worth: Dan Novak’s tireless pursuit of Christmas light perfection called for, well, more lights. According to the Novaks, they now have over 75,000 lights! His annual display is a neighborhood tradition.

Kevin Olsen (private home), 3771 Engle Road, Lake Worth: This private home has lots of lights and a great walkway to tour the lights.

Bill and Deb Desantis (private home,) 3066 Crockett Way, Lake Worth: This house is best for small children who will want to get out and get a better look of all the scenes handmade by the DeSantis family.

The Imbriecos (private home), 1434 W. Trammel St., Lantana: This family has been decorating for many years, but there’s always something new. You’ll want to get out and walk around. There are display cases with tiny villages and collectible figures and big blowup figures and lots of moving parts.

7580 Woodland Creek Lane and 7559 Hazelwood Circle, Lake Worth: Super bright decorations on the first two houses you see.

308 Dartmouth Drive at Pennsylvania in College Park, Lake Worth: Tons of lights on this corner lot.

Hoffman's Chocolates Winter Wonderland, 5190 Lake Worth Road, Lake Worth: From 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. nightly until December 30, Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus arrive every Friday, Saturday and Sunday at 6 p.m. Tour the magical display of ten thousand lights in the gardens, including a gazebo, cascading fountains, live fish, and electric trains and animated displays—including a life-size camel in the manger scene.
