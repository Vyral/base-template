What’s the situation for buyers in our market right now?

Our current market is extremely complex and probably as difficult to navigate as the one we saw in 2008 and 2009. The reasons why it’s difficult, though, are slightly different and mostly related to inventory. During the month of March, the national level of inventory stood at 3.8 months. By comparison, Portland’s level of inventory was 1.3 months. **That’s the lowest it’s been in three years, and we expect it to stay this way entering the summer.**

Even though most of the country is showing strong buyer activity, Oregon’s buyer activity is even stronger than all but a handful of states. This indicates that our national economy is healthy and people are investing in homes. We’ve found that buyers are having trouble getting offers accepted and getting into escrow, though. Two weeks ago, one of our agents wrote an offer for their buyer on a property that had 18 other offers for it. I myself wrote an offer for a client a week ago for a house that had 12 other offers for it.

If you’re a buyer, what can you do to remedy this situation?

**First, remember that it’s not always the strongest price that wins the home.** You should consider getting creative with your terms and doing things you wouldn’t normally do when buying a house. One of those things could be offering the seller to stay in the house rent-free for a month after closing so they can get their lives in order during the move.

Offering these types of incentives to sellers can often be critical in getting them to accept your offer. If you don’t explore these options, you might find yourself writing offer after offer without any success. This is especially true in the lower (e.g. entry-level) price points, which actually aren’t that low anymore because it’s getting more and more expensive to buy a home in Portland.

If you’re thinking about buying a home, it’s important to sit down with a qualified real estate agent to pencil out a strategy that makes sense so you can get your offer accepted right away. If you’re interested in doing that or you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help.
