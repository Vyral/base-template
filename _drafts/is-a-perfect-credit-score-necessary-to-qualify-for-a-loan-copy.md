Do you need perfect credit to qualify for a loan? Today I am debunking this myth for you.

After the last recession, a lot of lending guidelines were tightened up and the perception was that you needed a perfect credit score in order to qualify for a loan. While this was true then, things have really loosened up over the last few years.

As long as you have a 620 credit score or higher, you will qualify for most loan programs. The exception to this rule will be for most jumbo loans. With a conventional loan, however, 620 is going to be the cutoff.

**This is not to say that you will not qualify for other programs if you do not have a 620 credit score.** For example, a VA loan is an option if you are a veteran. There is no standard minimum score to qualify for it, although certain lenders do have their own internal minimum score requirements.

**The FHA loan is another option for someone with a lower credit score**. This is a great loan program that lends to people with very low credit scores. Any score lower than a 620 will result in some difficulty with getting approved, while anything below 580 will make it very difficult for you to get approved.

If you have a less-than-perfect credit score, you should consider speaking with a credit repair specialist. If you need an introduction to a credit repair specialist, I will be more than happy to assist you with that. They will take great care of you, as will my own team throughout the process.

And, **if you are one of the people who is not monitoring your credit score on your own, you should definitely start.** There are numerous consumer sites where you can pull up your credit report. Keep in mind that the report you see and the version that a lender sees are not going to be the same.

The higher your credit score, the easier it will be to reach your home buying goals. If there is anything that I can do to help you on your path to buying, please feel free to reach out. I would be happy to assist you in any way that I can.
