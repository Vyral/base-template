As we all know, technology is becoming more and more integral to our daily lives. This is true also of home technology, which is a rapidly growing industry.

Today, I want to share three different tech options that can add value to your home:

1. **Google Home or Alexa.** Using either of these, you can set your lighting, thermostat, or even play music. These are all things we can demonstrate for buyers who are looking at your home.
2. **Smart thermostats.** Probably the best-known version of this technology is The Nest. Using this or another similar product, you can set and adjust the temperature of your home. Smart thermostats will even learn your habits and your lifestyle to better accommodate you through the temperature in your home. Ecobee is another brand of smart thermostat. This particular thermostat actually has sensors that can detect motion and adjust the temperature according to where you are in the home.
3. **Video-capturing doorbells.** This technology allows you to see exactly who is visiting when they ring your doorbell. This also acts as a security measure.

All of these things are relatively inexpensive, but they add a lot of value to your home. Tech-savvy buyers will especially appreciate these items.

As a final note, I’d like to address people whose homes have flooded recently. If you find yourself in this situation and are wondering how to recover and make repairs,** remember to think about how long you plan on living there.**

If you will be there short-term, think of your home as an investment. If you are going to be there for a medium length of time, still think of it in terms of an investment but also remember you’re still going to be living there. You want to make sure you don’t hate your living situation.

If you plan on being in your home for the long-term, make repairs in any way you want. You don’t need to worry too much about what future buyers might like. By the time you plan on selling, you’ll likely need to replace many of the features you’re adding at the moment, anyway.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
