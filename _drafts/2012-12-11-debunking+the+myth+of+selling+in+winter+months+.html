The confusion comes with a combination of age-old  schools of thought that predict the spring season as being almost the  only season for homes to sell successfully. Not true.<br /><br />A lot of homeowners are under the impression that homes are not selling  at all, whereas in our own experience, time and again we continue to see  complete opposite results. So much so, that we are defying the  myths of never ending days on market statistics with many properties  going under contract in approximately two weeks. Here’s why.<br /><br />There are so many buyers in the marketplace right now that are eager to  lock in the phenomenal interest rates and market conditions that  continue to allow a very significant amount of buying power. The  interesting thing is that while it is a strong buyers’ market in that  sense, sellers are still enjoying an edge with the lower inventory that  comes with it being this time of year.<br /><br />Regardless of which side of the fence you are on, either way you look at  it the market is strong. People are out there buying. If there are  fewer homes available on the market, then that only means that there is  less selling competition. This of course translates to top dollar and  incredibly quick, hassle-free transactions in which everyone comes out a  smiling winner.<br /><br />So to answer one of the most frequently asked questions I am getting  these days, it IS a great time to sell your home. Sure, you could wait  till spring. But keep in mind that so will countless other sellers and  by the time springtime blooms are back out, so will equally as many more  “for sale” signs, competing with you.<br /><br />By listing your home now, you can harness the power of the buyers that  are striving to find that perfect property before the holidays kick in.<br /><br />Contact us today if you’d like a custom, home valuation report detailing  exactly what we expect your home will sell for in today’s marketplace.
