For the fifth installment into our Millionaire Agent Mindset series, we’ll be discussing an incredibly crucial topic: How to remove limiting beliefs.&nbsp;

Before we delve deeper, let’s first brush up on what a limiting belief is. A limiting belief is an inaccurate, negative conviction that prevents you from reaching your goals. I encourage you all to reflect now on the way you speak to yourself in your mind each day. How often do you think “I can’t do x, or “I’m not y?” By repeatedly telling yourself that you cannot achieve certain things, it should be no surprise when you struggle to follow through on the very things you believe yourself to be incapable of.&nbsp;

However, the truth is that **you aren’t inherently incapable of achieving your goals—you’ve simply established a self-fulfilling prophecy.** Trite as it may seem, you have to believe you can achieve high levels of success to actually do so.&nbsp;

So what can you do to remove these limiting beliefs? First, you’ve got to start small. You can’t expect to completely eliminate any and all limiting beliefs in a moment’s time. Rather, start by reversing your inner monologue.

**Write down limiting beliefs as they come to you, and then analyze how you came to believe such things in the first place.** After that, you can acknowledge these beliefs for what they are: beliefs—not truths.&nbsp;

When you realize this, you can “try on” new beliefs. Replace limiting beliefs with affirming beliefs, and then take different actions that align with your new, positive mindset.

Once you’ve done all of this, the final step in removing limiting beliefs is to practice affirmations. **The power of positive self-talk is incredible.**
