We are joined by Matt Nader of First Home Mortgage to learn all about him and what he does to make your mortgage lending go smoothly.

Matt Nader of First Home Mortgage, the title sponsor of our grand opening, joins us today to talk about what he does, why he does it, and what makes him different.

Matt tells us that he is a loan originator for First Home Mortgage and has been there for four months. He is a branch manager, which means that he manages 10 other originators and watches them grow.

As a graduate of Johns Hopkins, he started with Chase right after college in 2006 before going to a different small company and then started working with us here. He says that he is very happy with the transition and thinks things are running smoothly.

He says that making the move to First Home was a good move for not only him, but also his clients because of the support the company offers. As the No. 1 originator in Maryland year over year, First Home was built for the originator.

This has a lot to do with their process, in which&nbsp;**they try to sell the experience**. Buying a home and obtaining financing isn't easy. However, if they are able to streamline some things to alleviate the stress during the transaction for the client, that makes it much better for them. First Home's pricing is also competitive with an array of products available.

Matt says that **what makes working with him different is that he likes to back up and be more of an adviser as opposed to a "guy with a product."** When he takes an application or makes that first call, it is more than just telling the rate and the closing costs. Instead, he wants to know your goals are and where you want to be in three, five or 10 years. Once he knows what your 10-year plan is, then he can help suggest the type of product that fits you better.

He says that **he does his best to review all of your documentation and get you fully approved so that he can call the Realtors and let us know you are good to go**. In the interim, he looks at your financials again to solidify what is going to meet your needs for both short and long-term goals.

He is doing more than selling a product. It is a custom service and anyone who works with him knows that anyone can get him any day of the week at any time.

In our experience working with Matt, we have noticed how he sets the expectations of the clientele and makes sure that we make it to the settlement table. We deal with a lot of lenders in this industry and sometimes they just don't set expectations correctly and don't make it. This leads to a bad customer experience and leaves a bad taste in their mouths. That doesn't happen with Matt.

From our standpoint, **we don't have to worry that things are going to get done with Matt** because we know he has done all the legwork upfront to ensure that the approval letter is solid. This is definitely an advantage for consumers that are considering getting into the market and who are looking for lenders.
