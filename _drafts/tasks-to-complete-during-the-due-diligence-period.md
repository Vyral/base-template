During the due diligence period of your home purchase, there are a few important tasks you should do to give yourself peace of mind about your new home. &nbsp;

The two obvious ones most buyers already know about are **the home inspection and the pest inspection.** The home inspection will uncover any hidden items such as structural items, mechanical failures, and safety concerns. The pest inspection will look for things like termites (or conditions that are conducive to termites) and wood-eating ants.

There are some less-obvious things you want to do as well.<br><br>The first is **get a homeowners insurance quote.** You may think it’s a little early to do this, but your homeowners insurance representative will pull a clue report which will tell you if there have been any previous claims made against the home. You want to know about these during the option period so you can ask the seller about them.

Next, visit the surrounding neighborhood during all hours of the day. Neighborhoods look different during different days and different times of the day. For example, residents in some neighborhoods all park their cars in their garages, while residents in others prefer to park on the street, and that’s the kind of thing that might drive you crazy.

While you’re visiting the neighborhood during the evenings or the weekend, **talk to the neighbors.** They’ll be able to tell you a lot about your house and help you uncover certain things, especially if you’re buying a foreclosure home where there is no known history. Take it with a grain of salt, though, because it’s possible what they have to say is skewed by the fact that they didn’t like the seller.

**Do some research on Google.** Google the neighborhood and the subdivision’s name and make sure there aren’t any complaints you need to know about. Also, look into what’s going on with the local schools. In our area, we have some proposed school changes and bus route changes happening over the next couple years. Those types of things can affect home values and how easily your child can get to school. You may not have any control over those changes, but knowing them before you buy is important.
