Many people aren’t very clear about the differences between interest rates and APR, so today I’d like to clarify the issue.

{% include pullquote.html %}

APR stands for ‘annual percentage rate.’ One thing that tends to confuse people is why one’s APR is different from their note rate. The reality is that **the interest rate for which you’re quoted, locked, and signed via the note instrument at closing is naturally going to be different from the APR.** The reason is that the APR takes into account the first year’s costs of a loan. If there are closing costs associated with the loan, which is common, your APR will always be higher than the note rate. However, the only fees that go into an APR are some lender fees, and the ones that apply can often be found online.

Now, **if the alternative happens and you get a large lender credit, seller contribution, or something similar, that can actually result in negative APR costs**, and on rare occasions, your APR can actually be lower than your note rate. Don’t be alarmed if this is the case; it’s usually a good thing because your mortgage advisor would have walked you through the benefits of structuring the loan that way.

If you have any questions or would like to walk through a scenario you have in mind, reach out to us. We would be happy to help.
