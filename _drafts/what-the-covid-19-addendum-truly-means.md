{% include youtube.html %} Some real estate agents don’t fully understand the TXR COVID-19 addendum. I’m sharing how it’s really meant to be used.

We’re living in bizarre times, and that can make people panic about even the most simple things. When they hear COVID-19, some real estate agents think they must use that new TXR COVID-19 addendum for everything and disclose it when listing on the MLS. If you read the addendum, you’ll see that it is primarily written for the benefit of the buyer. For example, it states that, if due to quarantine a buyer isn’t able to make the closing date, the closure can be extended for 30 days. The seller can do this too, but it’s generally the buyer who wants to extend the closing date. To learn more about what the COVID-19 addendum truly means, watch the short video above.
