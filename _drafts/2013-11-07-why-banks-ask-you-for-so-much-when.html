Today we have a guest speaker, Al Ripple from Johnson Bank to discuss financing. One of the most common questions that Al receives is “why are you asking me for so much paperwork?” This is understandable as a few years back, none of this was really necessary.<br /><br />“Everything was based on your credit profile, but now the pendulum has swung back to where it was 10 years ago where you have to qualify for a loan prove it,” Al said. This has happened because everything is underwritten to the standard of an investment; lenders pool these loans and sell them into the secondary market. If you have a pool of loans that have the income, assets and credit histories documented, it shows they have the willingness to repay their obligations. Investors are only interested if the peace of mind is there. This is the reason for asking for all the paperwork; this has to be done in order to meet lending requirements.<br /><br />Typical things we ask for is the most recent 30 day pay stub, past two years of W2 and most recent 60 days of bank statements. Mistakes in years past of not verifying incomes and issuing loans to people with low credit scores and caused financial catastrophe.<br /><br />If you have any questions about what may be required for the loan process, reach out to Al at (414) 852-7022 or give us a call at (262) 797-6453. Thanks again and have a great day!
