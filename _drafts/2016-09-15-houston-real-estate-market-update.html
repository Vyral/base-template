<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nPynU7fdnQY" width="480"></iframe><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">What's going on in the Houston real estate market? You may have seen the report that showed the number of homes sold is down. We're down by more than we have been since this past winter; about 700 homes. That's not a lot for Houston, but <b>we're down on a year over year basis.</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">What does that mean for pricing? The median price is up about 4% and the average sale price is down .5%. We don't know if we're seeing a trend, but <b>we're seeing inventory creep back up toward a neutral market with about four months of supply.</b> For the last few years, we've been in an absolute seller's market.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Another interesting thing we're seeing is buyer sentiment; buyers are taking a 'wait and see' approach if they don't have to buy. We see that as a factor in the market slowing down a bit.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">We're seeing Houston trend toward a neutral market.     </div></div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The other factor is oil, with prices creating a bit of a slowdown right now. We've had job losses in the energy sector, with some of the jobs replacing the lost jobs being not as high-paying. Additionally, as we head into the September, kids are heading back to school so we see a bit of a dip because because people are focusing on different things.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">With inventory as good as it is right now, we're seeing good opportunities for buyers. On the selling side, you should keep a couple things in mind. Think of your house as being in the top three of buyers' minds for competing inventory. You want to make sure your home stands out. We do this by pricing correctly with trends (not history) and making sure your home shows well. Finally, we want to market your home aggressively to the biggest audience.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">If you do those things, your house will sell because there are still plenty of buyers. It's still a great time for buyers because interest rates are so low, but the groundwork has been laid for them to go up.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I hope this topic was helpful for you, and we look forward to speaking with you again. Until then, give me a call or send me an email with any questions you have. I'd be happy to help you.&nbsp;</span>
