To help explain them, I have invited Al Ripple from Johnson bank to join us. Al explains that <b>a hybrid mortgage is simply a new term for an adjustable rate loan</b> with the most common ARM’s being 1, 5 and 10 years. The current rate on a one year ARM, or a one year hybrid loan, is 1.875%; as explained, that is dramatically different than 4.3% for a 30 year fixed loan! After Al told me this, I understood why these hybrid mortgages were so attractive to people.<br /><br />Although the term’s rates are very low, I thought it would be important to understand how much the rate could fluctuate. Al clarified that<b> the adjustment maximums on a one year ARM are what’s called “2 and 6.”</b> This basically means that after the first year, the interest rate could adjust a full 2% which means you could be moving from 1.875% to 3.875% in just one year.<br /><br />After that, Al states that the loan will adjust once per year thereafter for the remaining life of the loan and not to exceed 6% over the initial rate. Theoretically, in three years after the initial rate expires, Al says your rate could be as high as 7.875%. <b>Essentially, these mortgages would be ideal for someone who was planning on moving within the next 3-5 years.</b> As Al stated, these are perfect for corporate transferees who, as I said previously, would be only be staying for 3-5 years.<br /><br />If you have any further questions on hybrid mortgages or financing in general, Al can be contacted at <span class="skype_c2c_print_container">(414) 852-7022</span><span class="skype_c2c_container" dir="ltr" onmouseout="SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.hideMenu(event)" onmouseover="SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.showMenu(this, event)" skype_menu_props="{&quot;numberToCall&quot;:&quot;+14148527022&quot;,&quot;isFreecall&quot;:false,&quot;isMobile&quot;:false,&quot;isRtl&quot;:false}" tabindex="-1"><span class="skype_c2c_highlighting_inactive_common" dir="ltr" skypeaction="skype_dropdown"><span class="skype_c2c_textarea_span"><img class="skype_c2c_logo_img" src="resource://skype_ff_extension-at-jetpack/skype_ff_extension/data/call_skype_logo.png" /><span class="skype_c2c_text_span">(414) 852-7022</span><span class="skype_c2c_free_text_span"></span></span></span></span>.
