According to a report by Bloomberg, <b>Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, was denied refinancing on his home.</b>&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hG_07YzS2wo/VLBBQ8e5J1I/AAAAAAAARuc/Q50wg7zHXvg/s1600/Pull%2BQuote%2BTemplate%2BMike%2BRoth.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="float: right; padding: 12px;"><img alt="Milwaukee Real Estate Agent" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hG_07YzS2wo/VLBBQ8e5J1I/AAAAAAAARuc/Q50wg7zHXvg/s1600/Pull%2BQuote%2BTemplate%2BMike%2BRoth.jpg" height="200" width="200" /></a></div><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">How is this possible?&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Well, when Bernanke initially bought his home, he was an employee of the Federal Government, with a salary and stable income. Once he left the position, he became a self-employed consultant.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><b>Refinancing is a little bit more difficult for those who are self-employed,</b> as Bernanke soon learned. <b>Typically, lenders require you to provide them with tax returns for 2 years of income before they can determine if you are going to be approved.</b> Mr. Bernanke only became self-employed this year, so his lack of tax returns as a self-employed individual likely caused him to be denied. <br /><br />Self-employed borrowers always present a little bit of a challenge due to their complicated tax returns. <b>If you are a self-employed borrower, you should make sure you have those 2 years of tax returns.</b> Showing all of your income is very important, as trying to pass off your business as something it is not could end up hurting you. Now, just because you are self-employed doesn't mean that it’s impossible for you to qualify for financing. <b>There are situations where lenders can take a look at your assets, or your retirement packages, and determine your income or net worth based on those figures. </b><br /><br />If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call. We'd be glad to help you out. <i><br />&nbsp;</i></span></div>
