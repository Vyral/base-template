Instead of talking about Northwest Florida real estate, today I want to bring you along on a tour of Grayton Beach State Park.

We locals often don’t take advantage of the number of stunning state parks around the Emerald Coast. We tend to forget how special these places are. A lot of tourists may not even know about these places.

**Grayton Beach is a great way to really escape and enjoy Florida’s stunning natural landscape.**

This park is just north of Watercolor and there is a beautiful, natural beach right near a great coastal lake that you can see in the video above.

Western Lake is also the perfect place to paddleboard or kayak. It’s a 100-acre coastal dune lake located right in the park.

I highly recommend this park. The Florida State Parks are all fantastic, and **Grayton Beach will be open to the public for free through Labor Day.** It really is a great place to take your family and just explore.

For more details about Grayton Beach, check out this [website](https://www.floridastateparks.org/park/Grayton-Beach). I hope you take some time to get out there and roam through this beautiful state park.

In the meantime, if you have any real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
