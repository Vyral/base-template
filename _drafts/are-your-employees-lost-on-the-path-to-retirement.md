title: Are Your Employees Lost on the Path to Retirement?

excerpt: >-
  Unfortunately, people sometimes draw near to retirement age only to realize
  their plan hasn’t adequately prepared them for this stage in their life. Most
  employees today contribute to opt-in 401(k) plans, which don’t provide much
  guidance. This is why, today, I’d like to offer an alternative: the opt-out
  401(k) plan. What is the opt-out plan? To learn more, watch this short video.

  With opt-in plans, there are really no metrics to help them understand that
  they must increase their contributions over time.

From what I tend to see, only about 20% of employees are on-track to replace their income before retirement, during retirement. So, **how do we as fiduciaries take this 20% and turn it into 80%?**

Let’s say an employee is about two years away from retirement and they go to meet with a financial advisor. This advisor tells them they’ll need about $500,000 to replace their pre-retirement income during retirement. For many people, this amount can be even higher.

Well, imagine the employee in this scenario only has around $300,000. They may come back to you, their fiduciary, and express concern. They may tell you they feel as if you didn’t properly prepare them, saying they never knew they weren’t on track.

In most cases today, employees are contributing to “opt-in” 401(k) plans. In this kind of plan, fiduciaries ask their employees if they want to contribute. There are really no metrics to help them understand that they must increase their contributions over time.

Today, I want to talk about an alternative to this route: the “opt-out” 401(k) plan. This is something my team and I do for our clients. W**hen your new employee is eligible for the plan, we automatically enroll them at 6%.** Each year after this, we will automatically escalate their contributions by 1% a year until they reach something like 10%. At that point, we automatically default them into the qualified default investment alternative, which is typically a target-date fund consistent with when they’re going to retire.

We can also help you improve the retirement outlook of employees who have been with you for years. Employees who aren’t 6% will be bumped up to this rate, and employees who are at 6% or higher will be escalated until they reach 10%. Then, as with new employees, they will be defaulted into the qualified default investment alternative. Of course, employees can opt out of one or all of these features. **They are in complete control, but most people will allow this plan to continue.**

If helping your employees stay on-track for retirement is important for you, you may be interested in our Plan Navigator Report. This report helps us go more in-depth with you regarding about plan features.
