Whether you’re just starting out in a position or you’ve been there for a while now, **there are plenty of things you can do to improve your opportunities for leadership within the company in the future.**

The biggest piece of advice I can give is to be visible. One good way to do that is by attending Toastmasters. Everyone can use the training and practice to become better speakers and presenters. When you're effective at that, it gives you many more opportunities to be visible in the future.

The next thing I would advise is to pay attention to Harvey McKay. **He’s one of the best out there when it comes to writing about leadership and leadership skills.&nbsp;**Subscribe to any of his newsletters or read any of his books and you’ll see what I mean. The techniques and tips he offers are invaluable.

Finally, do the small things. Come in early. Ask if you can help with a project that may be a bit outside of your wheelhouse. Make yourself visible in front of others you don’t normally work with. Putting yourself out there makes you available for opportunities you don’t even know about yet.

These are just a few tips for getting ahead and becoming a better leader. If you need any more tips or have any other questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
