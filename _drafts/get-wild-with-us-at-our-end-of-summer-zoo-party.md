  Thank you to everyone who attended our movie matinee recently. But whether you
  were able to make it to our last event or not, we wanted to reach out today
  and let you know that the fun isn’t over. We’ve got another great event just
  around the corner on August 19. This time, we’re headed to the zoo for a
  free-of-charge, end-of-summer party, and we hope we’ll see you there. All of
  these client appreciation events we’ve been hosting lately are just to show
  our thanks. The more support we receive from you, the more fun opportunities
  we hope to give back. And because these events are for you, we would always be
  happy to hear any ideas for events you’d like to see us host or charities
  you’d like us to give to. Once again, thank you for support. To see our full
  message, watch this short video.
