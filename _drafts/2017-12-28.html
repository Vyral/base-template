<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><i><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_iJ6I2seGI" width="560"></iframe></i></span></span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><i>Are your schedule and general thought-process adding value to your life?  If not, switch things up so that they do.</i></span></span></div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Today I want to talk about self-mastery. It’s one of the Six Personal Perspectives that Gary Keller, Co-Founder &amp; Chairman of the Board for Keller Williams Realty, wrote about in his NY Times Best Seller, <i>The Millionaire Real Estate Agent</i>. <b>He discovered that the most successful real estate agents have a similar mindset when it comes to success</b> and boiled this mindset down to six fundamental perspectives that are at the core of Keller Williams Realty’s education for its agents.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Self Mastery is the mindset, process, and habits associated with making sound decisions for desired results &amp; self growth. It's the self control that comes from having a clear vision &amp; the determination to see it physically manifest.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">In other words, it's "KAIZEN" a Japanese term and philosophy meaning "continuous improvement" or "change for better." You've mastered "Self" when your thoughts, words, actions, and reactions all align with your goals/mission.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b><br /></b></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>Self-mastery is to continue to work on, and ultimately master, you.</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I’ve been thinking about scenarios from my own life and business that I could share with you to help you understand what I mean. One of the things I’ve done for myself is created a habit of getting up early and having “me time” while exercising on the treadmill.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I was using that 30 minutes of walking on the treadmill in the morning to watch Netflix and TV series from Amazon Video that I normally never watched. It was just guilty-pleasure time, and I think it’s important to have that. However, I was noticing that I was filling my brain with silly stuff—<b>things that didn’t matter or add value to my life.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">Self-mastery is to continue to work on, and ultimately master, you.</div></div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">So I switched that routine. Instead of mindless shows, I started listening to audiobooks about growth, mindset, and leadership, or else inspirational and motivational videos with John Maxwell or Tony Robbins—<b>anything that could add value to my life.</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I’m not saying that you shouldn’t take time for yourself and do some of those guilty-pleasure things, because those are fun and enjoyable as well. I just had found that I wasn’t growing. And by listening to these different thoughts on leadership, business, and life balance, I was able to trigger thoughts in my own mind that <b>inspired me to think of new ways and ideas to better my family, business, friends, and community.</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Do these little things that tweak your mind and your schedule to where you’re adding some value to yourself so that you can continue to improve.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Let me know how you work on your self-mastery, and I can in return share some more ways to grow through this practice. Life is a journey; we’re continuing to grow every single day.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">If you have any questions about this or other topics, please feel free to reach out to us.
