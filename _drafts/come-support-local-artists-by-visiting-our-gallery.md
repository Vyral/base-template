It may come as a surprise to some of you, but Prosper Properties actually has an on-site gallery. There, we showcase paintings and wood-burning artwork by local artists.

**You’ll find many different mediums and styles of artwork here. Each piece is beautiful and unique.**

Best of all, the beautiful artwork here is for sale. If you have an art-lover in your life, why not consider taking home a piece of our gallery as a holiday gift?

Or, if you or someone you know is an artist yourself, we are also looking for more work to display. We’d love to showcase more local pieces.

Since we opened this space more than two years ago, we’ve done our best to support local artists. **We don’t mark up the artwork or make any profit; we simply want to help people in our community sell their work.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
