<center>Do you need agent representation when meeting with a new home builder? If you want to get the best deal possible, the answer is yes.</center>

As a homebuyer, you should always have an agent by your side when meeting with a new home builder.

Why? First of all, the builder represents their own interests, so having an agent by your side will help you truly understand what your costs will be and help you negotiate the deal. Also, new home builders operate under a set of rules that are slightly different than what you’d find in other real estate transactions.

For example, they may try pressing their own lender on you, and that’s fine—they might be a great loan officer—but don’t forget that there are other local brokers you might be better off working with. Don’t feel like you have to work with the builder’s lender just because they’re offering you a credit. Oftentimes, the fees these lenders charge are very high and nullify whatever you save from these credits. Again, having an agent means having a second set of eyes to help you with this kind of thing.

The best part about having an agent represent you in this situation? It doesn’t cost you anything. We’ll help make the experience smoother and less stressful. There are a lot of hidden fees involved in purchasing a new construction home, so we can also compare the cost of these fees with resale homes to see if you’re truly getting the best deal possible.

As always, if you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.
