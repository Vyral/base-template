It's not a sterling situation for sellers, <b>but if you've been having trouble selling, then this could actually aid you</b>.</li><li><b>Inventory has steadily been decreasing and pushing our Birmingham market towards a more neutral market.</b></li><ul><li><b>I expect in the next 12-18 months to see the market shift again towards a seller's market as inventory decreases.</b></li><ul><li>So, if you're looking to buy a home, you'll want to do it soon.&nbsp;</li></ul></ul></ul>So whether you're buying or selling here in Birmingham, you're going to find a market that will suit your needs. <b>Sellers  will be happy with a relatively low inventory that will bring them  multiple offers, and buyers will be happy with lower mortgage rates and  home values</b>.<br />If you have any interest in buying or selling a home, or just want to  know what's going on in our area, feel free to contact me at your  convenience.
