What’s the latest news from our current market? Which two home maintenance tips do you need to remember now that spring is here?

Let’s start with an update from our market. The average purchase price in Ada County is about $283,000, which is an increase of 9.7% compared to this time last year. Our average days on market is 39 days, which doesn’t seem like a lot, but it is for our market. In Canyon County, the average purchase price is $185,000, which is an 11% year-over-year increase. The average days on market in this area is slightly lower, at 29 days.

One trend we’re noticing is that **as prices increase** **in Ada County, some buyers are turning their attention toward Canyon County** where homes are more affordable.

Now, onto my two maintenance tips.

**First, don’t forget to change your HVAC filter now that spring is here.** This is something people don’t often think about, but doing it can improve your home’s air quality, efficiency, and longevity. The Filter Factory Outlet near Maple Grove and Franklin is offering a $2 discount for all their filters, so this great upgrade comes cheap as well.

**Second, replace the batteries in your smoke detector.** I’m sure you’ve played the game Marco Polo before, but have you ever played Marco Polo with your smoke detector at 2 a.m. when its batteries have gone out? Save yourself some time and the aggravation of a sleepless night and get your smoke detector’s batteries replaced.

If you have any more questions about our market or these home maintenance tips or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you.
