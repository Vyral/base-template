Today we are going to talk about HBRinstantoffers.com. **This program is typically for people that are unable to wait 30, 60, or 90 days to receive an offer on their house**. It is usually used by someone who is in a distressed situation, needs help, or needs to cash out right now.

We decided to provide this opportunity for you after consulting with many of our clients. Some people found that they needed money now.
