Don’t let all this talk about rising interest rates scare you. Rates are still historically low and there are plenty of great opportunities out there for homebuyers.

Did you know that when we bought our first home, our interest rate was astronomical compared to today’s rates?

It’s true. We actually usually invite homebuyers to ask their parents or their grandparents what their interest rate was when they bought their first home. If you try this, you’ll get numbers ranging from 8% to 18%.

We’re not *that* old, but we can tell you that, **historically, a normal interest rate is between 8% and 11%**. That sounds crazy these days, but that’s the reality. Last week, interest rates got moved up again, and they’re currently hovering around 5%. That’s still about half of what ours was for our first home.

The point is that there are still opportunities out there for you if you’re a homebuyer. Don’t let this talk about rising interest rates scare you. We’re still in a historically low interest rate environment and **what we especially love about today’s interest rates is that they’ve helped us cut back from being a hyper seller’s market**. In fact, more and more sellers are helping buyers get into homes by offering closing credits.

Don’t let this opportunity pass you by. If you lock in a great interest rate today, you’ll have it for the next 30 years.
