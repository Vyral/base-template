Let me tell you a quick story about an experience that changed my life forever—for the better.

About 10 years ago, I was volunteering at a landfill in Managua, Venezuela to help the people who lived and worked there under destitute conditions. Some of these people were children. My own kids were young at the time, and I saw some things at that landfill that inspired me to help the kids who lived there.

I got involved with an organization called Forward Edge International, but I realized there was something more I could do. I believe everyone wants to make a difference, but sometimes you just don’t know how. That’s when my good friend Eric Hatch and I started Sell a Home, Save a Child.

What is Sell a Home, Save a Child? It’s is a movement. More specifically, its a collaboration of agents, title companies, mortgage representatives, builders, transaction coordinators, and other professionals in the real estate industry all around the country who want to make a difference in kids’ lives.

**For every home sold through this program, we donate 10% of our commission to Forward Edge International** to help transform the lives of children in Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Kenya, Mexico, and the US. Our goal last year was to raise $1 million. We fell just short of that mark, but we still raised $900,000. That sum can make a big difference in a lot of kids’ live around the globe.

How can you partner up with Sell a Home, Save a Child? **If you have a home you need to sell or you know someone who does, give us a call.** For the first home we sell each month, we donate 100% of our commission to Forward Edge International instead of just 10%. Some lucky seller out there will not only get top dollar for their home, but they’ll donate to a good cause at no cost to them whatsoever.
