Today I’m going to be discussing some tips on how to prepare yourself for a move, whether you’re buying or selling.<br><br>I recently moved, myself, and I learned a lot. As Realtors, we tend to focus on the technical aspects of real estate. We are professionals in negotiation and marketing. We try to offer extensions of service through different contractor recommendations and different providers for services associated with real estate.

But it’s not very often that we go through a full move ourselves. As a result of my recent experience, I want to share some tips that I learned through the process with the hope that it will make your move a little easier.

First, start packing and purging as far in advance as possible. We tend to collect things over time, whether they’re hand-me-downs or extra things you’ve outgrown or don’t use anymore. Get rid of those things. Rooms you don’t use should be packed as early as possible so when it comes down to the 11th hour of your move, you’re not scrambling or throwing things in boxes. The purge and the move can happen simultaneously; you can donate or toss things along the way when you’re cleaning up and packing.<br><br>Secondly, you can hire a moving company. Treat yourself. Trust when I say that a moving company is worth every dollar. They can be expensive, but they offer a whole spectrum of services such as hauling your already-packed belongings to your new home or helping you pack your things in addition to helping you move them.

The third tip is to contact all your utility companies in advance, usually about two weeks before the move. Make sure that all your payments and obligations are settled with them. You can also schedule installations around the same time for your new home, to save you the hassle of juggling those appointments at the last minute.

Fourth, take off more time from work than you think you need. There’s more to moving than getting your stuff from point A to point B. You also have to make time to unpack, organize, decorate, tear down boxes, and a general clean up. If you try to do it over one weekend, you’ll find that you needed an extra day, and you might dwell on what you have left to do once you’ve returned to work. Before you know it, you’re spending your evenings and weekends for months at a time on finishing those things you didn’t get done initially. So just take a little bit more time and get things finished up.<br><br>The fifth and most valuable tip is to enjoy it. Laugh about it. Things will go wrong, appointments will be missed, installations will be missed, things will break, and certain other things won’t line up the way you imagined. But make the best of it and exercise some humility.<br><br>If you have any questions or have a move coming up, we can help recommend different service providers and moving companies. Feel free to give us a call; helping you move is just an extension of the service that we as real estate agents provide to you. We hope you had a great holiday season, and we wish you health and prosperity in 2018.
