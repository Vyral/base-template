  There is a lot of talk in the media about impending bubbles and other
  distressing real estate disasters. While I do not have a crystal ball, I can
  say with confidence that our market is red hot right now. Inventory is low in
  the mid- and low-end markets, which means that buyers in those price points
  will need to act swiftly and competitively if they are serious about
  purchasing a new home. The higher-end markets are stabilizing, with around 40%
  of the homes above $750,000 selling. But is this all going to come crashing
  down soon? To hear my thoughts about the fate of the market, watch my latest
  video.
