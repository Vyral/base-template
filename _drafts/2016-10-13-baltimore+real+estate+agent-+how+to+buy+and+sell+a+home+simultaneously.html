Is it possible to buy a new home while selling your current one? Though this is not an overly common situation in our area, it does happen. In the event that you’re unable to find a home after going under contract on your current one, a good real estate agent will be able to find you a home you love or negotiate to get you more time. To find out how we help our clients do this, watch this short video.</div><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RE7wrTCe5TU" width="480"></iframe><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Some of our clients worry about being able to find a new home after selling their current one. We don’t often see issues with this today, but there are certainly instances of this in more of the hot pockets of Baltimore and Harford County.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">If your home does sell really quickly, <b>generally we can negotiate a home-of-choice contingency for you to be able to find a home, and sometimes we can get that extended</b>, if need be.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">We are often able to negotiate rent-backs and extensions with buyers.    </div></div><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">For example, recently, one of our clients was not able to find a home that they liked within that 30-day time frame, so we were able to negotiate another 30 days, plus a rent-back period. This was a win-win for both these sellers and the buyer who purchased their home, since the buyer knew that they would still be able to buy the house and the sellers were given an additional 60 days after settlement to move out. <b>This gave these sellers a 120-day period to find a house.</b></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">A good real estate agent will be able to help you through this process so that you don’t have to worry about ending up homeless after your home sale.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">If you have any other questions about buying and selling a house simultaneously, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.
