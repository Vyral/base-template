It’s always important to verify the quality of an agent before you work with them, and today we’d like to share a few ways you can do so.

One of our clients recently asked us how they can verify that an agent they’re thinking of working with is as good as they claim. **Moving from one home to the next is a huge milestone, so it’s obvious that you want the best person or team for the job by your side**.

A great way to verify the quality of an agent is by checking out their reviews. Seeing what those who have worked with them in the past have to say about their service can tell you a lot about what to expect.

Of course, not all reviews are legitimate. **If you see that an agent has only sold 12 homes in the past year but has 200 reviews, then you can be sure that most of that feedback is illegitimate**. Anyone can ask their friends and family to write up a phony review, after all. It’s always critical to make sure that the number of reviews an agent has makes sense in relation to the number of sales they’ve handled.

If an agent’s reviews are legitimate, don’t be surprised if you come across one or two bad ones in the mix. Agents are only human. When you happen upon negative reviews, don’t let them scare you away before you check to see how the agent handled their response. If an agent who has mostly positive reviews conducts themselves with grace when replying to negative feedback, this is a good sign.

On the other hand, **if a Realtor is hesitant to put you in touch with people who can provide testament to their service, this is a major red flag**.

If you have any other questions or would like more information about what to look for in an agent, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
