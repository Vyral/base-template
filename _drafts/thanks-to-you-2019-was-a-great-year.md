Today I’m sending out a huge thank-you to all of our clients who have trusted in us this year. We’ve been beyond blessed to have your trust and business—thank you so much\! We helped a record number of families in 2018 and were able to get in business with a record number of agents, as well. With all of those blessings that you’ve given us, we’ve officially outgrown our space\! We’ll be moving from our humble beginnings and into a great new space within the next month or so. Be sure to keep an eye out for future announcements\! As always, if you ever have any questions that we at Homestead & Co. can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’re here to help you.
