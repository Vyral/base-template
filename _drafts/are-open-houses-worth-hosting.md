Should sellers still host open houses? Let’s explore this question today.

In today’s digital age, many sellers are no longer sure whether open houses are worth hosting. However, in my professional opinion, open houses are the No. 1 source of advertising a listing can have. Open houses are a low-pressure alternative to one-on-one showings. Not only that, but open houses also generate a lot of foot traffic and allow buyers to simultaneously see the home and their competition in person. This helps boost demand for your home. The bottom line is yes: Open houses are still a great marketing tool. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
