<strong>Get to Know Rob Ellis / About Rob Ellis / Meet Rob Ellis </strong>

I’m Rob Ellis, and welcome to my site. I’ve been in real estate for three years. I went to Ohio State University, where I studied finance. I got to know a lot about real estate during my senior year and decided to get licensed right away. 

I started out leasing apartments and found my niche in the apartment and investor side of real estate, which is where I work today. 

Our goal is to help people on the residential and commercial side. On the residential side, our team works to create happy homeowners and raving fans. As an investor, we want to contribute to your bottom line and help you become profitable, reinvest, and become lifelong clients. 

The REllis Group is based out of Grandview Heights, close to the downtown area. We are centrally located so that we can service all of Central Ohio and Columbus. Right now, there are seven agents on our team. A couple of them work on the residential side, while the others work on the investment side. It all depends on their interest and specialty. 

As for me, I love to travel locally or internationally. I love to be a leader. I may look young, but I work extremely hard. My goal is to serve you as a client always. 

<strong>Purpose of the Rellis Group</strong>

We specialize in multi-family properties and commercial assets in Columbus and Central Ohio. We are committed to always beating the market for our clients through equity, getting a higher return, raising rents, or lowering expenses for these buildings by 40 or 50%. 

We want to beat the market for our clients so that you will continue to work with us to build your portfolio. We are experts in the Central Ohio market, so whether you’re curious about the macroeconomics in our area or you are interested in investing in multi-family properties, give us a call. We would love to help contribute to your bottom line. 

<strong>The Services We Offer</strong>

As a multi-family brokerage, we work with buyers and sellers to put transactions together. We spend several thousand dollars marketing to multi-family owners in need of purchasing additional properties, selling their current ones, or using a 1031 exchange to move their money around. We sell all kinds of multi-family properties from duplexes to 40 unit properties that run anywhere from $300,000 to $5 million all over Central Ohio. 

If you’re interested in investing in office, industrial, or retail properties, we can guide you through that process as well. 

We also help people who want to flip homes, buy properties that they plan on selling or refinancing a few years later, hold assets, or sell off smaller investment properties to buy a larger one. We even work with developers to identify land for apartments or condo development.

In addition to our commercial branch, we also help residential clients. It all depends on what you are looking for. We are here to help you.
