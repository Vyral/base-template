<p>Throughout her 17 year real estate career, Jennie Wolek has learned the importance of creating leverage with people, systems and tools.  By discovering her mission—to empower others to live a focused, purposeful life—Jennie has a new found enthusiasm for building relationships, both in her community and with real estate agents. She enjoys expanding her team to help more families and give back to her local community by supporting small businesses, promoting and donating to non-profits.  Jennie also loves adding value to other agents through her Your Journey with Jennie blog and by traveling to fun destinations for in-person training! </p>

<p>Last year Jennie and The Wolek Group helped 109 families, generated and shared over 100 referrals and donated more than $20,000 to deserving local and national charities. She created a class and trained Magnify Your Mission across the country, launched TWG Rock Stars program, and established the non-profit, Keys to the City. With even bigger goals this year, Jennie and The Wolek Group will Help More, Give Back, Live Large, and Have Fun!</p>
