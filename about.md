<h2>Philipp Fries</h2>

In 2008 I moved to Tampa from Dusseldorf, Germany to pursue my MBA at the University of Tampa. I have always been passionate about experiencing the customs and people in other parts of the world, so I jumped at the opportunity to relocate. Here I fell in love with Floridian culture and my wife Michele. Since then, we have had a beautiful baby and begun a wonderful life, and now a business, together.

Before I began my career in real estate, my professional background centered heavily on customer-relationship management, as well as sales and marketing for companies such as 3M, AAA-Auto Club South, and Air Berlin. My love for interpersonal interactions and the opportunity to work with people of all different backgrounds is what has propelled me through my various careers, and ultimately led me to real estate.

<h2>Michele Dupree</h2>

Born and raised right here in Tampa, I have a deep seeded love for the community, from running on Bayshore, to trying to local restaurants, to Lightning games with our whole family. Now, as a new mother, I understand just how important finding the right home for a family here can be. I have over ten years of experience in the mortgage industry and have specialized in business analytics, management, and negotiations, making me well equipped to handle all of your real estate needs. Like Philipp, I have a passion for working with others, not to mention shopping, both of which come in handy when helping our clients search for the perfect home at the perfect price.
