<p>Today we’re sharing how we at The Mikki Ramey Team are staying safe and still serving needs. First and foremost, we extend a heavy thanks to all the nurses, doctors, and other healthcare providers—the real heroes—who are out there every day doing their best to take care of patients. On our front, we’re of course trying to stay home and help flatten the curve.</p>

<p>What that means in the real estate world is that we’re going out and creating virtual tours of our listings. The tours we’ve filmed are highly detailed, almost as if I were in the home with you, going through every part of the property slowly. To learn how you can watch these tours, check out this short video. </p>
