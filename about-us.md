<h3>What makes AmeriFirst Different?</h3>
<p>We all know there are a million different lenders, bankers and brokers out there and everyone basically gets their money from the same place. Well let’s say 95% of the time the money comes from the same place. So how does a company stand out? Here are 8 reasons The Spring Mortgage Team @ AmeriFirst stands out from the crowd.</p>

<h4>2 – Our People</h4>
<p>We are a team and we are a family; a small group of, husbands, wives, mothers, fathers best friends and college teammates and roommates.</p>

<h4>2 – Our communication</h4>
<p>Communication is by far the most important part of the loan process. Our calendar system and open access to everyone on the team insures each buyer, their respective Realtor and Sales Rep know exactly where we stand every week.</p>

<h4>3 – Our PYT program</h4>
<p>Protect Your Transaction is a $10,000 closing assurance program that pays the buyer $10,000 if we fail to perform on our loan commitment. All our resale buyers have the option to participate in PYT. For new construction clients to use this program AmeriFirst must be on builder’s preferred lender list.</p>

<h4>4 – Our flexibility</h4>
<p>We are a Fannie direct Seller/Servicer and a full correspondent mortgage banker and broker with 20+ investors. We underwrite to the manual with virtually no overlay requirements. We take a common sense approach to underwriting, a refreshing change to what some other lenders experience.</p>
