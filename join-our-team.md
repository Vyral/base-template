<h1>Join One of the Fastest Growing Real Estate Teams in {{site.data.settings.client.market}}</h1>
<h5>How would your life change if you consistently earned $60,000, $75,000, $100,000 or more as a full-time real estate agent?</h5>


<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>I understand you may be working at a brokerage or you may be just starting out as a newer agent who’s not seeing the kind of success you hoped for in this business.  </p>

<p>Agents usually find themselves in this situation for a couple reasons. They either don’t have the leads to sustain the business they want or they’ve been working solo for so long that they’re sick of doing paperwork, marketing, and handling everything else and want to specialize in doing what they do best, which is servicing customers. </p>

<p>These kinds of problems are why 87% of all real estate agents fail within their first five years in the business. Some try to solve them by trying to find an “easy” button or buy their way out. They may be successful, but they’re only getting paid every two or three months because their business isn’t consistent. If you’re doing it all yourself, you inevitably become overextended. </p>

<p>Another factor that may be keeping these agents from reaching the level of success they want is fear. They’re afraid of change. Also, sometimes it’s a matter of their ego—they feel like they’ve failed if they have to join a team. Other times, it’s literally just paperwork or a lack of money. </p>

<p>If you’re facing these problems and you don’t find a way to fix them, you’ll end up as one of the 87%. You’ll have to get another 9 to 5 job in another industry because you’re sick of working around the clock without anything to show for it. </p>

<p>The good news is that I can help you. How? I’ve been there before. For eight years I burned the candle at both ends without any help, trying to do everything for everybody. Then I joined a brokerage that taught me how to form a team. For once in my life, I followed the rules instead of trying to tweak them, and I got leverage with tasks I wasn’t good at or didn’t like doing. I know how it feels to be in your shoes, but I also know how it feels to form a team, be in an environment with others who compliment your skills, get leverage, and stay in your strength zone. </p>

<p><strong>I can offer you these things by joining my team.</strong> We do a lot of business and we have a strong reputation in Portland. Our success is achieved through our specialization—we have people focusing exclusively on important tasks like transaction management and marketing. All the pieces of the puzzle are in place to get a huge number of weekly referrals. </p>

<p>Our team is unique in that what we do, we do very well. Over 80% of our business happens through repeat customers and referrals because we have a lead generating system, a specialized support staff, and the experience to back them up. </p>

<p>By joining us, you’ll walk into an environment with leads, systems, training, marketing support, and a communication platform that’s set up to ensure you succeed. We have over 13,000 buyers in our database, alone. You’ll also be able to take a breath because you’ll have a consistent financial stream. You’ll be able to close a minimum of two deals a month, and you won’t have to worry about doing everything—you’ll only be doing one thing, which is work with clients to buy or sell houses. </p>

<p>Of course, you have other options. You can either continue to go it alone with sporadic income, high expenses, and a heavy workload, try finding another team that’s ranked in the top five in the Portland-area MLS and did $78 million worth of business in 2017, or give up and go back to working 9 to 5.</p>

<p><strong>The success of our own team members is another hallmark of the way we do business.</strong> We have a buyer’s agent who’s been with our team for only three years who’s easily making $10,000 a month just by following our system. We also have another agent who started just last December and already has two closings in escrow. </p>

<p>If you join our team as one of our buyer’s agents, you’ll have plenty of buyer leads, a support staff, marketing, and myself helping you to reach a new level of success. My buyer’s agents contact leads, cultivate relationships, perform buyer consultations, get buyer agreements signed, and show houses. The minute they find a house for a buyer, they can move on to the next buyer. </p>

<p>That’s right—you don’t have to write offers on our team, which means you don’t have to negotiate repair addendums, worry about appraisals, or worry about anything in the 30- to-45-day closing cycle. Your job is done once you find the house. For that, you’ll earn a 25% commission split, and bear in mind that our average price point is roughly $200,000 higher than the average price point in the Portland area. </p>

<p>Once you’re on board with us, you’ll undergo a 100-day training program that will give you all the tools you need to be successful. You’ll learn our systems, our CRM, how to follow up on leads, and how to use our communication tools within our team. If you do this and follow our systems and training, we guarantee that you will close a deal within your first 90 days and make a minimum of $50,000 to $75,000 in your first year. </p>

<p>We only have a limited number of positions available, so don’t hesitate to apply if this sounds like something you’re interested in. </p>

<p>Here are some additional FAQs to give you a better idea of how our team functions:
<ul>
<li><strong>Why shouldn’t agents get too caught up in the word “split?”</strong> Because what they should really look at is income, or their expected compensation and what they have to do for that compensation. When you can make $10,000 a month on our team without writing a single offer, that’s a valuable proposition.  </li>
<li><strong>Where do you get all your leads?</strong> Aside from referral leads, we’re plugged into all types of media and have a prominent presence on all the major real estate websites. The kind of money we spend on marketing most people can’t replicate for themselves. At the end of the day, you have to have the business to be able to spend the money, and we have the business. </li>
</ul></p>

<p>All this can be yours if you join our team. We care about your success—not just in our business, but in your own life as well. Reach out to us, and we would love to help you reach all of your personal and professional goals. </p>

<p>I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
