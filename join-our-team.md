#### **How would your life change if you consistently earned $60,000, $75,000, $100,000 or more as a full-time real estate agent?**

#### **Dear Real Estate Agent,**

Do you want to earn $70,000 a year selling 24 homes? I know you’ve been doing all the “right” things so far in your real estate career. Listening to podcasts, watching training videos, and going to training events all in hopes of bettering yourself so you can earn more money.

I understand how many “shiny objects” there are to build your real estate business, and it can get really overwhelming. It’s a fact that 87% of real estate agents fail within their first five years in the business because they run out of money, get too distracted, and don’t have the guidance or mentorship they need to succeed.

It’s likely that you’re working for a broker, but not getting the training and support you need. So, now, you’ve landed on this page looking for more. For that, I congratulate you! Everyone knows that if you don’t build up a consistent pipeline of listings (or even buyers), the money runs out—and that causes all kinds of problems. Trust me, I have been there. You don’t want this to happen. Let’s just get that thought out of your head!

My name is Misty SOLDwisch. I’ve been selling real estate for 19 years. Last year, my team sold about 340 homes. My team is the highest producing team in our market, and I’ve built up a real estate business that provides my team and I with consistent and reliable income.

Would you like to work directly with me on my team? We have the systems, processes, and leads for you to earn $70,000 a year working 40 hours a week in a position you will look forward to every day. I can provide you with the training, support, mentorship, accountability, and tools you need to build a consistent and reliable income in real estate.

Working on my team gets you a full CRM (Customer Relationship Management software, $200 value), 30 leads per month ($500 value), broker support ($5,000 value), and inside sales support (ISAs) to qualify your leads ($1,000 value).

These are all things that you have to pay for yourself or figure out on your own as a solo agent, but you won’t have to pay for any of these things with us! We provide you with every tool you will need, at no cost to you. This means that you will have the software and the systems to manage all of your contacts so that no opportunities fall through the cracks. You won’t have to rely on cold calls alone to get your business. You will be confident in your deal-making ability to close homes because we will guide you through every step of the way. You’ll have someone to follow up with your leads and set appointments for you! How good does all of that sound?

You can do it yourself and take the risk, but you may not be in the position to do that. You can join another company that charges a flat fee, but you won’t get the leads and support.

I recently took on an agent that had been licensed for one year and worked with another large real estate office here in the Des Moines area. In his first year, he closed one home. Greg just finished his first year on my team, and he sold 53 homes and made over $130,000.&nbsp;

I took on another new agent (from the same company that Greg worked for) and again, same story. One year in the business, less than three closings, and she just wasn’t making it. Katie has now been with our team for a year and has closed over 25 deals worth $75,000. She’s hoping to double her production this year!

Another great success story is that of Jason. He joined my team about 18 months ago. Same story. Had his license for about year, didn’t have a pipeline built up, and he wasn’t making it in real estate. Jason joined my team and closed over 40 deals last year, earning well over $100,000, with no monthly expenses!

I invite you to come work on my team in return for splitting the commission 50/50. Even at this split, you’ll take less risk, work fewer hours, and earn more money than working someplace else for a 70/30 split or 100% with a fee. I can show this to you and have the proof to back it up.&nbsp; We also offer splits up to 90% with no monthly fees for independent agents.

If you like this plan, once you apply here’s what will happen . . .

* We’re going to have a short phone conversation to make sure you’re a good fit with our team.

* You’re going to attend one of my free training events, where you will write a quick business plan.

* We’re going to go lunch or dinner to talk about your one-, three-, and five-year goals and vision for your life.

* You’re going to shadow me or a current agent for one week.

* You’re going to start calling some of the leads in our database with the following scripts (watch the video below to watch one of my team members doing this, so that you know what this looks like)

I guarantee I will meet with you personally for at least one hour every month as long as you work here and you will never be forgotten.

If you take me up on this, I have leads right now for you to call, and you’ll likely have a commission in your bank account, ready to spend, within 90 days if you apply right now. If you have any questions for me in the meantime or if you’re ready to get started, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

I hope to hear from you soon,
