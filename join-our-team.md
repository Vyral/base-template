<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>It might be that you’re already working with another brokerage or as an independent agent. If so, think about this: Are you where you’d like to be in your career? Are you funding the sort of lifestyle you’ve striven for? Be honest with yourself. If you’re not where you’d like to be, then you’ll want to hear this.</p>

<p>Working in real estate isn’t always easy. Without a proven business strategy, this industry can leave you in the weeds; you’ll be lying awake at night and wondering where your next deal will come from, how you can make enough money to make ends meet, and how you can bring order to the chaos.</p>

<p>Nine out of 10 agents fail in their first five years in the business. You might not have the money, focus, or the guidance and mentorship to meet your goals. Many agents invest tremendous amounts of money into their brokerages, but without proper leadership and connection to other members of your office (be it large or small), that investment will turn sour.</p>

<p>Perhaps you know what I mean already. Many agents in this situation will turn to assistance outside their brokerage by hiring coaches and mentors, or by paying for training programs. You’re sinking money into a business that isn’t taking you where you want to go, and if you don’t change something soon, you may have to leave the business, continue in your business but live with the weight of failure, or simply limp along and hope something better happens across you.</p>

<p>You can turn all of that around right now if you do one simple thing: join my team.</p>

<p>By joining me and my team, I can offer you a multi-tiered solution to your pain. On my team, you’ll have access to live training classes every week, as well as 24/7 access to recorded training classes which are uploaded to YouTube. In these trainings, you’ll develop skills with:
<ul>
<li>Contract mastery</li>
<li>Lead generation and conversion</li>
<li>Team building</li>
<li>Management</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Additionally, I offer personalized coaching to each agent, where I will help you create a business plan based on your personality and the sources of business that you prefer. For each source, I’ll assist you by creating a strategy for success, including the knowledge, skills, and daily activities required to implement that strategy. I’ve also put together peer groups of agents to hone their skills, which will take the form of six-week sprints in such topics as sphere-of-influence marketing, demographic farming, and Facebook leads.</p>

<p>Why am I so confident that my offer is the answer you’ve been looking for? Because it’s proven to work. I have a long track record of turning agents’ careers around, having been a coach and consultant for Re/MAX for 20 years. In that time, I have produced at the highest levels. My achievements speak for themselves:
<ul>
<li>I was the designated master trainer for the Re/MAX agent training program.</li>
<li>I went to the world headquarters every month to train all of our new franchisees in that agent productivity plan.</li>
<li>I’m certified in almost every national agent coaching program.</li>
<li>I was the business coach at the the No. 1 most productive Re/MAX office in Texas for five years.</li>
<li>Last year, I made $270,000 GCI working part-time while also being a full-time business coach.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>And it’s not just me, either. Adam Olsen worked with Keller Williams for seven months and never sold a single house. When he was referred to my team at the age of just 18, he made over $100,000 in his first year. Now, three years later, he’s the No. 1 listing agent in his county.</p>

<p>You can certainly ignore this offer and continue to be frustrated in your situation, spending money to hire someone else to do what we, as your team, could do.</p>

<p>But if you want to fund the lifestyle that you desire for you and your family, to be able to travel where you want to travel, and contribute to whatever causes you deem important, you would do better to give this some serious consideration.</p>

<p>We are looking for agents with a flair for the business. We want agents who can serve clients at a high level and also make a living for themselves. We’d like someone who can fit in with the culture of our company—someone who sees the value in what we do.</p>

<p>Someone who wants to be a part of something great.</p>

<p>Here’s what you stand to gain: a 90/10 split commission with a $10,000 cap and $100 transaction fee. Right after you join, I’ll send you a license transfer invitation through the Texas Real Estate Commission where you’ll be able to transfer your license to work with us. Then, you’ll be given access to our resources such as our logos, business cards, yard signs, etc. When you’ve joined with us, we’ll sit down together for a two-hour business planning session to help you get started. We want you to succeed.</p>

<p>Better yet, if you join with us before April 30, you’ll be eligible to win a cruise trip for two—up to a $2,000 value! I’m not done yet: whoever refers you will also be eligible to win this prize.</p>

<p>If you’re hesitant about applying with us, I’ll make you a guarantee: If you don’t make significant progress towards your aspirations, I’ll refund the money you invested in marketing materials and send you back to your former company, no hard feelings.</p>

<p>Right now, the world is our office. We use our title and mortgage partners for training rooms, conference rooms, and meeting spaces. When we have 100 agents on our team, we’ll fund our expansion into our own office using revenue, rather than going into debt.</p>

<p>The choice to join our team is yours, but I believe that if you’re the sort of agent who’s struggling to find their way in the wild world of real estate, you’ll find your way to us.</p>

<p>Hope to hear from you soon.</p>
