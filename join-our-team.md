<div class="markdown"><p><strong>How would your life change if you consistently earned $75,000, $100,000 or $150,000+ as a full-time real estate agent?</strong></p><p>In a competitive, ever changing industry like real estate, it’s easy to become distracted from the core of our business: serving clients to our highest ability in a way that earns us a fulfilling and profitable living. We have cracked the code to help real estate agents NET more money than over 90% of agents in the Central Iowa market. You don’t have to have years of experience to join our company BUT you must have the desire to do what it takes to become successful. <strong><em>And we will show you how.</em></strong></p><p><strong>We have an agent-centric culture. A commitment to training, coaching, and education. A model that rewards our agents as true partners.</strong></p><p><strong>AND… We want YOU to become part of our growing company!</strong> However tough it’s been for you, whatever you’ve been through, regardless of how discouraged you may feel right now – we can likely relate to your situation. We have created a better way to succeed in real estate and we’ll gladly share with you what we’ve learned.</p><p>Are you a NEWER AGENT to the business, looking for an environment with more collaboration and opportunity?</p><p>Are you an EXPERIENCED AGENT wanting to start a team?</p><p>Are you a TEAM LEADER looking for an environment that supports the unique needs of a team and “gets” how to make them at team at the highest level?</p><p>We are doing something very special at <strong>Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Innovations</strong>. We’ve built one of the highest production teams in the country by assembling a group of highly driven, success hungry, real estate professionals. Agents who will accept and adopt our methods for lead follow-up and fulfillment, client service, and team work will enjoy a high rate of success…plain and simple.</p><p>In our business, success and a high rate of pay, go hand in hand. Nothing in this business stays the same and if you don’t have a systemized business approach, a proven methodology and support,&nbsp; then making a living in real estate in the “new economy” is going to be very hard.</p><p><strong>This opportunity might be a PERFECT fit for YOU…</strong>We’ve recently found ourselves in need of competent, hard working, professional sales people to join our company and take advantage of our stellar lead generation, conversion and management systems.</p><p>If you’re tired of the daily grind, tired of NOT making money, tired of being lost…then take advantage of my offer. Do you feel like a stranger in your own real estate office, with a revolving door of people in and out that clearly are not making it in the business? Do you feel you’re your broker is out of touch with the reality of being an agent today? Check out the steps at the bottom of this page and let’s see if we can forge a relationship of mutual benefit.</p><p>While it can feel like brokerage and agents in our market are RACING to the BOTTOM with a focus on “CHEAP”, “FLAT FEES” and “COMMISSION DISCOUNTS”, I can assure you there is a place in the market for QUALITY and SERVICE at a PREMIUM PRICE.</p><p>Our brand – Better Homes and Gardens - is synonymous with Quality. And in real estate, that means a focus on RESULTS and a WORLD CLASS EXPERIENCE. This sets you apart from the competition and earns you more! Just like the old adage about high end service says: “Nordstrom doesn’t panic when Wal Mart has a sale”, we will teach you how BRAND POWER and a VALUE PROPOSITION overcomes pricing objections.</p><p><strong>There are a number of advantages to you for moving forward on this…let me highlight a few of them here for you:</strong></p><p><strong>NO BROKERAGE OR OFFICE FEES</strong> – beyond your phone, car, and MLS &amp; Board Dues and the basics to keep your license with the state…you’ll have none of the brokerage, advertising or lead generation expenses you’re faced with now. We have an innovative, STRESS FREE program, whether you are newer to the business, growing a team, or a team leader. You’ll enjoy NO MONTHLY OFFICE FEES thanks to our great compensation package. We aren’t going to nickel and dime you or require you to have a Mathematics degree to compute your compensation. We’ll even supply you with an office space, business cards, your first 5 real estate signs, and even an event for your past clients &amp; sphere!</p><p><strong>BEAUTIFUL AND RELEVANT MARKETING &amp; ADVERTISING</strong> – Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Innovations has the newest technologies that will help you market yourself and your listings AND the amazing powerhouse PinPoint database supplied by Meredith Corporation thanks to it’s database of 100 million subscribers and their consumer habits.</p><p><strong>ALL THE TOOLS &amp; TRAINING YOU NEED TO QUICKLY GET TO THE CLOSING TABLE</strong> – Cutting edge technology tools, buyer and listing presentations, and the training to go with them will be given to you so you can begin succeeding immediately. Our “Agent Mentor” training programs will ensure that you stay focused on the activities that will get you productive as quickly as possible.
