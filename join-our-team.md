<p>Dear Fellow Real Estate Agent,</p>

<p>We understand that you may be frustrated right now with your current brokerage or team. Perhaps you feel as if you arenâ€™t receiving much, if any, support in building the wealth and the life you deserve. You might lack the training, coaching, and mentoring to get you there.</p>

<p>Many agents, both seasoned and new, are overwhelmed with all the hours you need to work just to close a few deals or find new leads. Non-money generating tasks such as administrative work may even be taking up the time you could be create a consistent lead flow.</p>

<p>If this sounds like you, you are not alone. In fact, 87% of real estate agents fail and return to their corporate world jobs because of this. Instead of trying to work more hours only to worry about how you will pay for your next grocery trip, you can work with The Stern Team. <strong>Our team has a successful retention rate of 90%, meaning that the people who join our team stay.</strong></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because <strong>we focus on training first.</strong> When someone new comes on our team, they are put through 30-,60-, and 90-day onboarding programs so that they can learn not only our systems and processes, but also our scripts to help win over clients.</p>

<p>As they learn each new piece, new team members meet with me weekly in a one-on-one setting to ensure that they have all the tools and resources to meet or exceed their goals.</p>

<p><strong>Our training works so well that it helps us to close on 300 homes per year.</strong> It also helped teach us how to generate anywhere between 700 and 1200 leads per month by doing daily lead generation as a team from 9 a.m. to 11a.m. All of this work helped every agent on our team in production make over $100,000 last year.</p>

<p>While many companies may offer onboarding promises, they don't provide a clear pathway for growth from an inside sales agent to a buyer's agent to a lead buyer's agent like we do. <strong>We can show you the track records of every agent on the team</strong> about how they developed in both a leadership and financial perspective.</p>

<p>Our company has great knowledge and coaching available from the large database of over 3,000 people that agents have access to to the best performing Realtors in the State of Utah, as well as Josh Stern and Leigh Stern. They can help provide a level of knowledge that is not found anywhere else.</p>

<p>We want to help you have a life worth living where you don't have to worry about your next paycheck. You can choose one of the following alternative routes:
<ul class="indent">
<li>Stay where you are at.</li>
<li>Join a different brokerage.</li>
<li>Get out of the business forever.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>However, <strong>joining The Stern Team with over 15 years of proven growth in both transactions and agent count, is the solution for for long-term prosperity.</strong></p>

<p>Consider the stories of Marita and Jeremy, two agents on my team. Marita is now our lead buyer agent and has been working with us for two years. Before joining The Stern Team, she was working 60 to 70 hour weeks. By utilizing our training and coaching platforms, however, she is now consistently closing 40+ deals each year while working a normal 40-hour work week.</p>

<p>Jeremy, meanwhile, is a listing agent who was with a different brokerage less than a year ago. In just five months, he has closed 30 deals by using the tools he learned from his onboarding training. He is doing so well that he will be our first expansion agent in Tooele and is currently hiring his own listing agent.</p>

<p>But don't just take my word for it. Our agents, when asked why they work with us at The Stern Team, have given many different reasons, such as:
<ul class="indent">
<li>Being on the number one team</li>
<li>The opportunity for growth, culture, and the freedom to implement creative ideas</li>
<li>Finding financial with great mentors to learn from while having fun</li>
<li>Learning from the professionals to see how and what it takes to rise to the top</li>
<li>Opportunity for professional growth</li>
<li>Unlimited potential with the support needed to build</li>
<li>Mentoring and opportunity</li>
<li>Working with the best and to become the best</li>
<li>Learning from the best</li>
</ul></p>

<p>If you are making up to $1.5 million in volume currently, whether part-time or full-time, I want to talk to you because I know that you are a hard-working individual. <strong>I can show you on paper how you can work less hours by using our system</strong> and model of generating future business on a consistent basis to have the opportunity of a six-figure salary.</p>

<p>If you take the offer, you will be taken through our 30-, 60-, and 90- day process in a one-page document that focuses on the tasks and behaviors that you will be 100% proficient in at each check-in day. We call this your 20%. During this time, you will be trained for your future position. Starting with learning our scripts, systems, and dialogues to convert leads, you will then be trained on our buyer presentation. You will deliver it to our leadership to ensure consistency of our brand before you go out and set your own appointments so you can start earning your split of commission based on your position.</p>

<p><strong>Our goal is to have you in full production within 90 days.</strong> I can guarantee that you will have more leads than you know what to do with as you learn from the training how to convert them.</p>

<p>Of course, space is limited because I can't bring on 20 agents at one time. So if you are interested in joining our team, please feel free to give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to speaking with you soon.</p>
