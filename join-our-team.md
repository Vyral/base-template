<p>Dear Frustrated Real Estate Agent,</p>

<p>We understand that you may be frustrated right now with your current brokerage or place of work. Perhaps you feel as if you can’t figure out how to get a consistent flow of leads and listings in your business. <strong>You may even feel as if you have no room to grow in your current situation, or as if you simply aren’t being paid up to your worth or getting the support you need.</strong></p>

<p>There’s a good chance you are already taking steps to solve your problems. Maybe you’re watching YouTube videos, looking for coaching and training, and trying to get a plan for the future put into place.</p>

<p>If any of this sounds like you, you aren’t alone. <strong>In fact, 87% of real estate agents fail within their first two years in the business.​</strong> They either run out of money or don’t have the support or structure needed to be successful in this business long term. An agent needs many things in order to be successful, including training, support, coaching with accountability, structure, and leads.</p>

<p><strong>Going into real estate can feel either like the best or the worst career move you’ve ever made.</strong>​ So, how can you be sure that your real estate career won’t end in disaster? You join a quality team—one with the right resources, training, and culture to help you grow as an agent.</p>

<p>With the proper tools, your real estate career can go from barely surviving to absolutely thriving. We have those tools here at The Dan Ellison Team. <strong>Over the last 5 years, we’ve consistently helped new agents sell over 24 homes their first year in the business.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Whether you are a new agent, an experienced one, or are just thinking of entering the world of real estate, we can help you. The Dan Ellison Team can give you access to a number of helpful tools and resources. These include:</strong>
<ol class="indent">
<li>Support and training on our systems and tools</li>
<li>1 on 1 and group coaching</li>
<li>Established scripts and dialogs that work</li>
<li>Leads (Including internet leads, sign calls, circle dialing, FSBO, and expired)</li>
<li>A top tier CRM to hold your database and a methodology to systematically follow up with leads</li>
<li>Mojo Dialer</li>
</ol></p>

<p>You could also always try staying in your current situation and applying our concepts from scratch. But, why risk trying to replicate our success when you could simply join us?</p>

<p><strong>But, don’t just take my word for it.</strong> ​Here is what Ashley had to say: “​Joining the Dan Ellison Team was the catalyst in launching my career . The teamwork, training and processes in place set me up for success from the start. I learned how to set goals, track numbers and work with intention in every part of my business. Having the support system of the team made me feel confident in being able to go out and learn. Although it's never easy, the team made it simple and because of that I have been able to excel at a rapid pace.”</p>

<p><strong>There is no better place than The Dan Ellison Team to grow as a business person and a leader.​</strong> That’s a guarantee. We want you to see great personal and financial success with our team so that you won’t be back to bussing tables or working another dead-end job.</p>

<p>To take the first step in the right direction, give us a call or send us an email today.</p>

<p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>Dan Ellison<br>
