<p>Dear Fellow Real Estate Agent,</p>

<p>We understand that you may be frustrated right now with your income and consistency in your real estate business. Perhaps you feel as if you are working hard and you’re just not seeing the results you desire. You might lack the training, coaching, and mentoring that will help you get to where you want to be.</p>

<p>Many newer agents are overwhelmed with all the information in real estate school and then all the details of a contract and learning this new language. There’s pressure to choose a broker immediately after getting your license and it’s hard to know if you have made the right decision. Maybe you’re afraid of struggling to learn and do it all yourself. Or, maybe you have wasted money on marketing, tools, and technology that didn’t work.</p>

<p>If any of this sounds like you, you aren’t alone. In fact, 87% of new real estate agents fail within 10 months. I myself was a single agent for 10 years with the fluctuating income and stress of doing it all myself while being a mom and wife. I allowed buyers and sellers to walk all over me, showing a home at the drop of a coin or going to an unqualified listing appointment in the evening, only have them not choose me.</p>

<p>Going into real estate can feel either like the best or the worst career move you’ve ever made. So, how can you be sure that your real estate career won’t involve financial stress, wondering when your next closing will be or staying up late to catch up on emails because you are doing everything yourself? You join a top producing team, like ours, to provide great training, systems, and leverage with accountability and lots of fun. You will also have consistency in your income and know that if you go out of town for vacation, you have backup and support.</p>

<p>With the proper tools, your real estate career can go from barely surviving to absolutely thriving. At The Wolek Group, we can help you can avoid the family and financial stress of working alone and managing the hundreds of tasks in a real estate transaction, as well as help you to be present for those important moments in your family's lives.</p>

<p>I know this fear and stress because I lived this way and it almost broke me in both my finances and family life. However, by changing my mindset and getting great systems and help in place, my whole world changed.</p>

<p>Now with over 18 years of being in business and growing a successful team for over the past 5 years, we get to do what we love and help lots of families. Our motto is to Help More, Give Back, Have Fun and Live Large!</p>

<p>The systems we have in place help us sell well over 100 homes every year while still putting family first. We leverage administrative tasks to our talented Operations Team and we utilize technology and systems to keep us on track. We generate referrals from our past clients, local community, business partners, family, and friends, as well as from agents from across the country.</p>

<p>By having a proven system that generates a referral-based business, you will have more time to spend with family and friends. You will also get to spend time working in your strength zone instead of wasting time on the stuff you don't like or that isn’t dollar productive. Our culture focuses on giving back to the community while connecting with clients and friends at events, while we continue to learn and grow together.</p>

<p>By joining The Wolek Group, you’ll be on the fast track to success in real estate.</p>

<p>You can join another team and company, however, you'll miss out on being at the top of the market and industry with The Wolek Group and Keller Williams Realty. You also will miss out on being part of an award-winning team with national recognition that can help you learn the best practices and tools to be successful all while earning a great salary.</p>

<p>You don't have to take my word for it. Consider these two success stories from agents on my team, Nate and Brittany. Nate, who was a single agent with a small, local brokerage for three months, joined my team and sold 44 homes in his first year while netting $100,000. So far this year, in 7 months, he’s already surpassed his previous year's production. Brittany, meanwhile, came from a background in new construction sales. She worked with a local builder and was always stressed about money. After a year on the team, she noticed that she was already pacing ahead of her goal and upped it from netting $60,0000 to $100,000.</p>

<p>If you are an agent who has attended my trainings, subscribed to my podcasts or blog, joined my Facebook group, sent me referrals, or are just around town and looking for a new opportunity, give me a call. I look forward to speaking with you soon about how The Wolek Group can help you achieve your real estate goals.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
