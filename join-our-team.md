Dear Real Estate Agent:

The world of real estate can be a pain. **Agents without a proven business model might lay awake late at night, worrying about where their next client will come from, when their next close will be, and how they’ll pay to support themselves and their families.** If they can’t figure out a way to stabilize their income, they may well be out of a job.

But it doesn’t have to be that way.

**87% of agents fail in their careers because they don’t have the money, focus, or guidance from experienced agents to help them succeed.** Perhaps they were never trained on how to consistently and properly generate leads. They also likely didn’t have a system of accountability, training, and support to provide a foundation for their business strategy.

If you relate to these struggles in any way, I have the solution to your problems: Join me, Nick Good, on the Good Home Team.

**Trust me, I understand your pain.** As a new agent, I had no money, and no clear path to growing my business. I had eight deals fall apart. At one point, I applied for a job that would pay me $60,000 a year to work six days a week.

That’s when the lightbulb in my head went off.

I realized that if I generated leads and understood scripts and objection handling, there was nothing stopping me from making at least $100,000. **I turned that job down and now I’ve been making six figures each and every year since 2009.**

By joining us, you will be on a team of agents who want to work hard to build a successful business through implementing systems and training—just like you.

You don’t have to be an industry veteran—whether you’re a new agent, seasoned, or if you’re not even an agent at all yet, we want you to know that the Good Home Team has a proven model that guarantees growth, support, training for all our agents. **As a team, we will meet on a weekly and monthly basis to discuss how we can continue build the business in a positive direction.** You will be valued and acknowledged on our team. Don’t let analysis paralysis prevent you from making clear choices to better the future of your career.

It’s okay to be honest about the fact that money might be a motivating factor in your career. With my business model, I’ve built a successful team of agents that sold 212 houses in 2017, and on average, the agents who work on our team make $65,000 per year. **In fact, one of our top agents, who has only been in the business for three years, now makes slightly under $200,000 a year.** How do they manage this? It’s because of our team’s structure, training, and systems of accountability that we’re able to hold agents to their goals.

On our team, we have a full training program, both online and in-person. **You’ll be able to take advantage of our CRM software (customer relationship management) that will allow you manage leads and clients. Honestly, we have more leads than we can handle.**

Additionally, we have a call center to implement outbound calls to new sellers and buyers, an inside sales department to set appointments for our agents (you), and a full-on marketing and operations department who will do much of the work for you.<br>&nbsp;

Working with sellers, you’ll get 25% commission. **Like I said, the operations department does most of the work, so it’s largely hands-off for you. When you work with buyers, you get a 40% commission.** Our structure will enable you to make more money each year than if you were selling on your own; most brokerages don’t allow their agents to work with both buyers and sellers.

By joining the Good Home Team right now, you’ll be a part of a top-100 team in Texas with ground-floor opportunity in our vision and growth plans.

**This is an opportunity that few other agents have.**

We can set you up to make a six-figure income in 24 months or less. **In the first 30 days after you join, you’ll receive call training and circle prospect training to learn lead-generation techniques and methods.**

Only the strong will make it in this business, so if you have the drive, determination, and guidance to grow, you’ll do well on our team.

<br>If you’re interested in joining our team, just sit down and meet with us. We’ll show you our structure and the opportunities you stand to gain. Give us a call right away.<br><br>I hope to hear from you soon!
