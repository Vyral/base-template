<p>Dear Future Team Member,</p>

<p>If you’re looking to take your life and career to the next level, today’s message is for you.</p>

<p>Perhaps you’re a newly licensed Realtor searching for the perfect place to make your start, or you’re a seasoned agent not currently seeing the results you’d like. Maybe you aren’t currently in real estate at all but are ready to give working in the industry a try. </p>

<p>Of course, as those of you already working in real estate will know, finding success in real estate isn’t as simple as some might assume. In fact, statistics from the NAR concluded that 85% of newly licensed realtors leave their careers within two years. </p>

<p>Many agents, perhaps including yourself, become frustrated with the lack of support, lack of direction, and lack of resources they’re receiving from their current team or brokerage. <strong>Agents in this position find themselves faced with a host of problems—problems like:</strong> 
<ol class="indent">
<li>Having no accountability.</li>
<li>Having no access to training.</li>
<li>Having no idea when or where the next paycheck will come from.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>If these problems sound familiar, it’s time for a change. You don’t have to be another statistic. </p>

<p>My name is Michael Wolters. I’m Director of Sales at the Stern Team, and <strong>I would like to offer you a path to the results, income, and success you deserve.</strong> </p>

<p>The Stern Team has been consistently growing in both agent count and sales volume for the past 15 years, and, over that time, we’ve developed proven systems that allow our agents to work fewer hours and achieve the success they’ve always wanted. </p>

<p><strong>Consider the stories of Marita, Jeremy and Troy who are three of the agents on our team.</strong> </p>

<p>Before joining the Stern Team, Marita was working 60 to 70 hours each week. But now, by utilizing our training and coaching platforms, she has become our lead buyer agent. She now works a normal 40-hour week, yet still consistently closes on more than 40 deals each year. </p>

<p>Jeremy has a similar story. Less than a year ago, he was working with a different brokerage with little success. Now, as a listing agent on the Stern Team, Jeremy has closed 30 deals in just five months by leveraging the skills he learned through our on-boarding program. He’s doing so well with us that he’s about to become our first expansion agent in Tooele. </p>

<p>Troy was a retail sales veteran with 20+ years of experience, but had long ago reached his career ceiling. Through a robust onboarding and training program, Troy has left the corporate world and successfully immersed himself into his new real estate career, with a thriving pipeline and unlimited income and development potential!</p>

<p><strong>Here’s just a taste of what we offer our agents: </strong>
<ol class="indent">
<li>Opportunities for growth. </li>
<li>Top-quality mentorship. </li>
<li>A supportive, team-oriented culture. </li>
<li>Consistent leads. </li>
<li>Consistent income.</li>
<li>One-on-one training.</li>
<li>Financial, personal, and professional freedom.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>All of this and more will be available to you when you join the Stern Team. Instead of getting stuck spinning their wheels on administrative work or non-productive tasks, agents on our team see real, repeatable results—all thanks to our superior resources, training, systems, and culture.</p>

<p>Of course, you don’t have to take my word for it. The numbers speak for themselves. With 100% of agents in production on our team making over $100,000 last year, it’s no wonder that the Stern Team has a 90% retention rate. </p>

<p>We focus on training first. Agents who join us are put through a 30-, 60-, and 90-day onboarding program that teaches everything they’ll need to know in order to meet and exceed their goals. </p>

<p><strong>Here are just a few more reasons why joining us is the right next step for you.</strong> </p>

<p>The Stern Team operates with the support of some of Utah’s top-performing agents— and by drawing on their exclusive knowledge and leveraging our database of more than 3,000 people, we’re able to close an average 300 transactions per year. </p>

<p>I can guarantee that if you join us and follow the proven path we’ve laid out, you’ll have more leads than you know what to do with, as well as the opportunity to earn a six-figure income.</p>

<p><a name="form"></a><strong>If you’re ready to start living your own success story, we need to talk.</strong> </p>

<p>Of course, space is limited. So if you’re interested in joining our team and making a career move that will change your life, please feel free to give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
