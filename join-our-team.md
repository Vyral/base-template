Dear Fellow or Future Real Estate Agent,

We understand that you may be frustrated right now with your current brokerage or place of work. Perhaps you feel as if you aren’t receiving much, if any, support in building the wealth and success you deserve. **You might lack the training, coaching, and mentoring to get you there.**

Many new agents are overwhelmed with all the information in real estate school. **There’s pressure to choose a broker immediately after getting your license and it’s hard to know whether you’ll be able to earn the income necessary.** Maybe you’re afraid of not earning enough income or converting as many leads as you need to.

If any of this sounds like you, you aren’t alone. **In fact, 87% of real estate agents fail within their first two years in the business.** They either run out of money or don’t have the support or structure needed to be successful in this business long term. An agent needs many things in order to be successful, including training, support, coaching with accountability, structure, and leads.

**Going into real estate can feel either like the best or the worst career move you’ve ever made.** So, how can you be sure that your real estate career won’t end in disaster? You join a quality brokerage—one with the right resources, training, and culture to help you grow as an agent.

With the proper tools, your real estate career can go from barely surviving to absolutely thriving. We have those tools here at The Michael Kaim Team. **In the last seven years, we’ve sold over $500 million worth of real estate and are consistently ranked the No. 1 team in the state of Ohio for our brokerage, Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices.** The biggest tool comes in the form of Michael himself, who personally sells over 100 homes per year and prospects daily to train our agents to follow in his footsteps.

Whether you are a new agent, an experienced one, or are just thinking of entering the world of real estate, we can help you. **If you have a strong work ethic and you’re looking to make a career in real estate and start earning income right away, here’s what we’ll provide for you:**

* Buyer leads (Zillow, Realtor.com, Pay/click, etc.)
* Listing leads. (RedX & Vulcan)
* MOJO - automated dialer system
* Full-time Staff - Listing Team, Closing Team, Leads Coordinator, Legal Advisor, ISAs (Inside Sales Associates)
* Premiere Listing Status on all major public search engine sites
* Assigned Accountability Coach and Accountability Teams
* Standard ads for listings and open houses
* Professional 6ft. Post For Sale signs and lockboxes (delivered/picked up by our courier)
* Just listed/sold e-cards and/or postcards
* Up to 250 introductory announcement mailings to sphere
* Up to $200 worth of annual mailings
* Free desk space - private, semi-private, or group area based on production.
* Use of office computer, and landline phone
* Free company training through BHHS on systems and processes as well as free team training, including mentoring & shadowing with top agents on the Team
* Plus, Discounts on national Mike Ferry Training Seminars - The #1 Real Estate Coaching and Training System in the world

By joining BHHS Professional Realty and The Michael Kaim Team, you’ll be on the fast track to success and 40+ deals per year. **Here are your alternatives:**

1. You can work for a competing broker and go out on your own. But, you have to pay for all marketing, lead systems, office/desk space, etc.
2. You can work for Berkshire Hathaway as an independent agent. However, you will have to process all of your listings and contracts on your own.
3. You can join a "new" team that is just starting and learning to set up the systems. The same systems and solutions we have had in place and are continually perfecting since 2001.

You could also always try staying with your current brokerage and applying our concepts from scratch. But, why risk trying to replicate our success when you could simply join us?

**But, don’t just take my word for it.** Consider the story of Jacob, who was waiting tables and making $22,000 annually before joining us. Jacob sold nearly $7 million worth of real estate in his second year with us, and he has made well over $100,000 by following the same systems and using the same tools that we’re offering to you.

You also may be interested in having a look at some of our most frequently asked questions like, “Why are your commission splits different from your competitors?” or “Will you provide me with leads?”

We can answer those questions for you and any other questions you may have about our team if you just give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Regards,

Michael Kaim<br>[{{ site.data.settings.client.phone }}](tel:{{ site.data.settings.client.phone }})<br>[{{ site.data.settings.client.email }}](mailto:{{ site.data.settings.client.email }})<br>[{{ site.data.settings.client.url | remove: 'http://' | remove: 'https://' }}]({{ site.data.settings.client.url }})
