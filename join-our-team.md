					<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>
					<p>The world of real estate can be a pain. <strong>Agents without a proven business model might lay awake late at night, worrying about where their next client will come from, when their next close will be, and how they&rsquo;ll pay to support themselves and their families.</strong> If they can&rsquo;t figure out a way to stabilize their income, they may well be out of a job.</p>&nbsp;
					<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way.</p>&nbsp;
					<p><strong>87% of agents fail in their careers because they don&rsquo;t have the money, focus, or guidance from experienced agents to help them succeed.</strong> Perhaps they were never trained on how to consistently and properly generate leads. They also likely didn&rsquo;t have a system of accountability, training, and support to provide a foundation for their business strategy.</p>&nbsp;
					<p>If you relate to these struggles in any way, I have the solution to your problems: Join me, Nick Good, on the Good Home Team.</p>&nbsp;
					<p><strong>Trust me, I understand your pain.</strong> As a new agent, I had no money, and no clear path to growing my business. I had eight deals fall apart. At one point, I applied for a job that would pay me $60,000 a year to work six days a week.</p>&nbsp;
					<p>That&rsquo;s when the lightbulb in my head went off.</p>&nbsp;
					<p>I realized that if I generated leads and understood scripts and objection handling, there was nothing stopping me from making at least $100,000. <strong>I turned that job down and now I&rsquo;ve been making six figures each and every year since 2009.</strong></p>&nbsp;
					<p>By joining us, you will be on a team of agents who want to work hard to build a successful business through implementing systems and training&mdash;just like you.</p>&nbsp;
					<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be an industry veteran&mdash;whether you&rsquo;re a new agent, seasoned, or if you&rsquo;re not even an agent at all yet, we want you to know that the Good Home Team has a proven model that guarantees growth, support, training for all our agents. <strong>As a team, we will meet on a weekly and monthly basis to discuss how we can continue build the business in a positive direction.</strong> You will be valued and acknowledged on our team. Don&rsquo;t let analysis paralysis prevent you from making clear choices to better the future of your career.</p>&nbsp;
					<p>It&rsquo;s okay to be honest about the fact that money might be a motivating factor in your career. With my business model, I&rsquo;ve built a successful team of agents that sold 212 houses in 2017, and on average, the agents who work on our team make $65,000 per year. <strong>In fact, one of our top agents, who has only been in the business for three years, now makes slightly under $200,000 a year.</strong> How do they manage this? It&rsquo;s because of our team&rsquo;s structure, training, and systems of accountability that we&rsquo;re able to hold agents to their goals.</p>&nbsp;
					<p>On our team, we have a full training program, both online and in-person. <strong>You&rsquo;ll be able to take advantage of our CRM software (customer relationship management) that will allow you manage leads and clients. Honestly, we have more leads than we can handle.</strong></p>&nbsp;
					<p>Additionally, we have a call center to implement outbound calls to new sellers and buyers, an inside sales department to set appointments for our agents (you), and a full-on marketing and operations department who will do much of the work for you.</p>&nbsp;
					<p>Working with sellers, you&rsquo;ll get 25% commission.<strong> Like I said, the operations department does most of the work, so it&rsquo;s largely hands-off for you. When you work with buyers, you get a 40% commission.</strong> Our structure will enable you to make more money each year than if you were selling on your own; most brokerages don&rsquo;t allow their agents to work with both buyers and sellers.</p>
					<p>By joining the Good Home Team right now, you&rsquo;ll be a part of a top-100 team in Texas with ground-floor opportunity in our vision and growth plans.</p>&nbsp;
					<p><strong>This is an opportunity that few other agents have.</strong></p>&nbsp;
					<p>We can set you up to make a six-figure income in 24 months or less. <strong>In the first 30 days after you join, you&rsquo;ll receive call training and circle prospect training to learn lead-generation techniques and methods.</strong></p>&nbsp;
					<p>Only the strong will make it in this business, so if you have the drive, determination, and guidance to grow, you&rsquo;ll do well on our team.</p>&nbsp;
					<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in joining our team, just sit down and meet with us. We&rsquo;ll show you our structure and the opportunities you stand to gain. Give us a call right away.<br /><br />I hope to hear from you soon!</p>
