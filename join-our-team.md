<p>Dear Frustrated Real Estate Agent,</p>

<p>We understand that you may be frustrated right now with your current brokerage. Perhaps you feel as if you can’t figure out how to get a consistent flow of lead and listings in your business.  <strong>You may even feel as if you have no room to grow in your current situation, or as if you simply aren’t being paid up to your worth or getting the support you need.</strong></p>

<p>There’s a good chance you are already taking steps to solve your problems. Maybe you’re watching YouTube videos, looking for coaching and training, and trying to get a plan for the future put into place.</p>

<p>If any of this sounds like you, you aren’t alone Still, staying on top of all of this can feel overwhelming. One of the biggest worries people have is about the money to pay for the classes, webinars, and masterminds that will be essential to your success as an agent.</p>

<p><strong>Going into real estate can feel either like the best or the worst career move you’ve ever made.</strong> So, how can you be sure that your real estate career won’t end in disaster? You join a quality brokerage—one with the right resources, training, and culture to help you grow as an agent. Here’s our solution.</p>

<p>A career with Keller Williams, the country's fastest growing real estate brokerage, can help you achieve this. We are looking for passionate, motivated individuals looking to begin a career with us. We have the coaching, training, and business-tracking programs to help you generate consistent business. We have successful, proven business plans and models that many other agents have followed on the path to great success. <strong>In fact, both of our offices are the #1 office in their respective markets.</strong></p>

<p>Nobody has consistent training programs like ours. Nobody else has a support staff and a team culture like us either. We’ve got everything you need to start and/or strengthen a long and successful career.</p>

<p><strong>Whether you are a new agent, an experienced one, or are just thinking of entering the world of real estate, we can help you. Keller Williams can give you access to a number of helpful tools and resources. These include:</strong>
<ol class="numbered-list">
<li>  Access to free and affordable training programs. These programs are designed to help agents at every level of skill and experience.</li>
<li>  A launch coaching program (and a launch coach) to take you through your first five transactions from A to Z.</li>
<li>  Productivity coaching for agents doing 5 to 10 deals per year in order to help them get to the next level of their career.</li>
<li>  A turnkey database and CRM system, complete with marketing drips and business tracking software.</li>
<li>  Coaching and leadership from some of the best and most productive real estate agents in the area at our market center.</li>
<li>  The opportunity to be a part of our Keller Williams culture—helping agents grow even in times of need through Keller Williams Cares.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>You could also always try staying with your current brokerage and applying our Keller Williams concepts from scratch. But, why risk trying to replicate our success when you could simply join us? </p>

<p><strong>Here’s a little preview of what joining our team looks like:</strong></p>

<p>First, we’ll set up a time to meet with you and interview, consult you on your specific business needs, and create an action plan to help you overcome those challenges. Then, we’ll match you up with a coach who will guide you to the next level and help you create a 1-year business plan and roadmap for you to refer to throughout your first year. </p>

<p>If you respond right now, we will show you our 7-step system to closing 17 deals in your first year from open houses alone.</p>

<p><strong>There is no better place than Keller Williams to grow as a business person and a leader.</strong> That’s a guarantee. We want you to see great personal and financial success with our team so that you won’t be back to bussing tables or working another dead-end job. </p>

<p>To take the first step in the right direction, give us a call or send us an email today.</p>

<p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>Dan Ellison<br>
