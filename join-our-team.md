Dear Frustrated Real Estate Agent,

I understand you may be new to the real estate industry or are dissatisfied with your current brokerage.

Many people in your position either don’t possess the habits it takes to be successful in the real estate industry or lack direction in terms of how to build a real estate business. They lack the tools, resources, habits, leads, systems, and technology tools necessary to thrive.

It’s not surprising, then, that **over 80% of all newly licensed agents in Florida quit after just one year in the business.** Aside from that, the average agent only sells five homes per year, and the average agent who’s been licensed less than three years only makes $8,000 per year.

Most of these agents don’t know how to solve this problem and crumble under the pressure. It’s shocking how often we talk to agents who want to succeed but have absolutely no clue how to do it. Most end up signing with a brokerage because they are promised a bag of goods and the best training and support in the world only to find out that that brokerage’s office is a ghost town and the training they offer is watered-down at best.

These agents are hungry to grow their business and become high-level real estate professionals, but they ultimately get paralyzed and burned out by the fear, rejection, or pain of not seeing success. Their true potential goes to waste because they never had the proper training, coaching, and direction to realize that potential.

If you’re experiencing these same problems but don’t want to end up as one of the 80%, we can help you.

The Nickley Group is one of the fastest-growing and highest-producing real estate teams in central Florida. We will sell over 300 homes this year with over $75 million in volume. EVERY agent on our team joined us as a new agent and has built their business with us. **Our average agent sells 30 homes a year and makes over $100,000 per year, and our average first-year agent makes $60,000 per year.**

We consider ourselves more of a coaching company than a real estate company, and we offer world-class training on everything it takes build a real estate business. We have a full-time sales manager, a scripts coach, and a mentorship program. Our 30-day boot camp for new agents teaches them more in their first 30 days than an average agent will learn in their first two years. We train on every aspect of the sales process and generate over 700 leads per month for our agents. We have full operational support (transaction manager, listing manager, marketing manager) and cover all marketing and associated expenses. We also have a top-notch 100-touch past client marketing program to turn past clients into a massive referral source for our agents.

Most of all, our team is a true team with an amazing culture that cultivates success. We are in the office working together every single day and collaborating on how to grow our business, share ideas, and learn from each other’s successes and failures. Our team culture is truly one of a kind and one of the best in the industry. We are changing the lives of our agents, team members, business partners, and clients through the creation of a world-class real estate experience.

**We have the tools, resources, systems, coaching, and accountability to teach agents how to succeed at the highest level and build their business.** The blueprint we have created has proven to be duplicatable and repeatable with all of our agents, no matter their background or prior experience.

If joining our team isn’t for you, we understand, but if that’s the case, you only have three other alternatives:

**1. Go it on your own.** Trying to teach yourself the ropes of real estate can be overwhelming at the least. This is the most likely way to fail because you have no point of reference and no ability to learn right from wrong. The majority of people are not cut out to be their own boss and don’t have the tools and resources it takes to learn what is needed to be successful in this industry.

**2. Join a traditional brokerage.** As a said, most of the training and support offered by most brokerages is watered-down at best, and they lack the true support and leadership that is needed to be successful.

**3. Hire a real estate coach.** This can be a good option for some, but the amount of hands-on time you get with your real estate coach is usually limited to an hour a month.  There is no day-to-day accountability, direction, coaching, or leadership. Also, there are no leads, support, culture, and team environment to tap into.

Our own agents are our greatest success stories. Our top agent joined our team three years ago. She’d previously been an occupational therapist with no sales experience, but she sold 28 homes her first year, 42 homes her second year, and 54 homes her third year. She will make over $300,000 this year and she doesn’t even show homes anymore because she leverages a full-time showing assistant our team offers. All the while, she’s maintained a very healthy work/life balance.  

If you join our team, you’ll earn more, just like the rest of our agents. We offer an unmatched opportunity for buyer specialists to elevate their potential income substantially with our proven, differentiated marketing system that provides unlimited qualified leads. Our team members spend the most time doing more of what they love (converting leads, selling and making money) and less of what they don't (handling time-consuming paperwork during a transaction).

If you accept our offer, you’ll undergo our 30-day bootcamp that will immediately immerse you into our team’s culture, daily habits, and workflow. Our comprehensive training program combines an extensive online library of video and audio training, live in-office training, and an immersion into our team’s daily prospecting and business-building habits. During this time, you will learn and simultaneously implement world-class systems and habits to set you well on your way to smashing your personal and professional goals.

We are so sure that our system will work for a candidate that meets our requirements that **we guarantee a first-year earnings of $60,000 or more...or we will pay you the difference!** 
Experience is NOT required, but this is a full-time position which requires some evening and weekend work, so please do not respond if you are seeking part-time employment.

We are looking to add a total of three new agents to our team, so we’re accepting applications now, but time is limited.

If you have any specific questions about this position or our team or you’re interested in taking this opportunity and joining us, just give us a call or send us an email today.

We look forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
