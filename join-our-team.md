<p>Dear Fellow or Future Real Estate Agent,</p>

<p>We understand that you may be frustrated right now with your current brokerage or place of work. Perhaps you feel as if you aren’t receiving much, if any, support in building the wealth and success you deserve. <strong>You might lack the training, coaching, and mentoring to get you there.</strong></p>

<p>Many new agents are overwhelmed with all the information in real estate school. <strong>There’s pressure to choose a broker immediately after getting your license and it’s hard to know whether you’ll be able to earn the income necessary.</strong> Maybe you’re afraid of not earning enough income or converting as many leads as you need to.</p>

<p>If any of this sounds like you, you aren’t alone. <strong>In fact, 87% of real estate agents fail within their first two years in the business.</strong> They either run out of money or don’t have the support or structure needed to be successful in this business long term. An agent needs many things in order to be successful, including training, support, coaching with accountability, structure, and leads.</p>

<p><strong>Going into real estate can feel either like the best or the worst career move you’ve ever made.</strong> So, how can you be sure that your real estate career won’t end in disaster? You join a quality brokerage—one with the right resources, training, and culture to help you grow as an agent.</p>

<p>With the proper tools, your real estate career can go from barely surviving to absolutely thriving. We have those tools here at Cadwell Realty Group. Since 2013, when CRG was formed <strong>we’ve sold over $425 million worth of real estate and are consistently one of the top companies in the Willamette Valley.</strong> The biggest tool comes in the form of Jason Cadwell himself, who personally sells over 150+ homes per year.  Jason’s goal is to train our agents to follow in his footsteps.</p>

<p>Whether you are a new agent, an experienced one, or are just thinking of entering the world of real estate, we can help you. <strong>If you have a strong work ethic and you’re looking to make a career in real estate and start earning income right away, here’s what we’ll provide for you:</strong>
<ul class="indent">
<li>Plug and Play Database Mailing System</li>
<li>Mentoring</li>
<li>Open House Opportunity (After proper training)</li>
<li>Training for Buyer leads (Zillow, Realtor.com, Pay/click, etc.)</li>
<li>Full-time Staff – Access to Transaction Coordinator/Agent Services</li>
<li>Assigned Accountability Coach</li>
<li>5 For Sale signs and lockboxes</li>
<li>Access to Just listed/sold e-cards and/or postcards</li>
<li>Up to 250 introductory announcement mailings to sphere</li>
<li>Free desk space - private, semi-private, or group area based on production.</li>
<li>Use of Multiple Office locations</li>
<li>Free company training through CRG systems and processes as well as free team training, including mentoring & shadowing with top agents</li>
<li>Plus, Discounts on national Ninja Selling Training Seminars – One of the top Coaching and Training Systems in the world</li>
</ul></p>

<p>By joining Cadwell Realty Group, you’ll be on the fast track to your OWN success.  We teach you how to <strong>EARN YOUR OWN WAY</strong>, by being self sufficient and keeping MORE COMMISSION. Our goal is to get you to 100% Commission quickly. <strong>Here are your alternatives:</strong></p>

<p>You can work for a “Team” Broker but here is why I would advise against that:
<ul class="indent">
<li>You have ZERO control of your personal branding.</li>
<li>You give away most of your commission</li>
<li>You don’t own anything all marketing, Lead systems & Clients <strong>belong to THE TEAM NOT YOU</strong></li>
</ul></p>

<p>You could also always try staying with your current brokerage and applying our concepts from scratch. But, why risk trying to replicate our success when you could simply join us?</p>

<p><strong>But, don’t just take my word for it.</strong> Consider the story of one of our Agents JN, who was working in the Construction industry and making $40,000 annually before joining us. In the first year JN hit 100% Commission status and in his second year with us he blew past that and make over $200,000 by following the same systems and using the same tools that we’re offering to you.</p>

<p>You also may be interested in having a look at some of our most frequently asked questions like, “Why are your commission splits different from your competitors?” or “Will you provide me with leads?”</p>

<p>We can answer those questions for you and any other questions you may have about our Brokerage if you just give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
