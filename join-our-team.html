<p>Dear real estate agent or frustrated employee,</p>

<p>I understand you may be a new agent who just got licensed, you’re currently employed in a traditional corporate job, or you’re currently working at a real estate brokerage.</p>

<p>If this is the case for you, you’re likely experiencing some challenges and frustration. Perhaps you’re employed somewhere where you’re not happy because you’re not growing, you have little freedom, or you simply aren’t earning the money that you need and deserve. You may also be stuck in a negative work environment.</p>

<p>For most, the idea of a successful career in real estate is exciting, but the reality is that at most brokerages, you have little support and accountability with your broker. Four out of five agents leave the industry within their first five years because they run out of money. 87% of all agents fail in the first five years. What most don’t realize is that real estate can be a very challenging industry to break into without the right systems and support. Not having a consistent source of income can be downright scary.</p>

<p>You can spend months or even years trying to figure things out, and spend thousands of dollars making very costly mistakes. Worse still, you may end up working tirelessly without ever seeing the fruits of your labor, only to find yourself in a situation that’s worse than you were in before you started.</p>

<p>However tough it’s been for you, whatever you’ve been through, regardless of how discouraged you may feel right now, we can likely relate to your situation. The Dave Friedman Team has created a better way to succeed in real estate and we’d be glad to share with you what we’ve learned.</p>

<p>My name is Dave Friedman and I’m committed to this work. I’ve been named a top-producing Realtor for 13 years and am in the top 1% of Realtors worldwide. I’ve closed over hundreds of transactions in my 15+ years in real estate. I have surrounded myself with leading experts in the field and am committed to continuing our team’s education so that we can always ensure we are offering the best advice and information possible.</p>

<p>We’ve developed a business model that makes good agents great, and great agents extraordinary! Agents who are willing to adopt our systems and models will enjoy a high level of success with a predictable and sustainable income and career.</p>

<p>When you join our team you’ll enjoy the benefits of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A guaranteed income of $60,000 in your first year</li>
<li>Constant, continuous, high-quality leads</li>
<li>Full administrative support by our coordinators of chaos</li>
<li>Consistent training and coaching</li>
<li>A team-oriented and learning-based environment</li>
<li>A career track to earn a six-figure income</li>
<li>A fun, enjoyable place to work</li>
</ul>

<p>Take action today and schedule a time to meet with me to talk about your goals and answer any questions you may have. Together we’ll decide if we’re the right fit. You don’t need to have a real estate license to apply.</p>

<p>If you are, you’ll start in our training program as a junior agent performing in outside sales. Once you’ve hit our training standards, you can work your way up into a buyer’s agent role.</p>

<p>So if you’re an aggressive, competitive, high performer who enjoys working with people and wants the opportunity to make a great living in a thriving business, give me a call or send me an email today.</p>

<p>Until next time,</p>
Dave Friedman
