Today I’m excited to launch the first half of a two-part series covering the top 10 questions I hear about VA loans. We’re going to share five of these common queries today and finish with the remaining five in our next message.

**1\. What kind of credit score do you need to qualify for a VA loan?** Believe it or not, the VA does not set a specific threshold for credit scores. Instead, they allow affiliated lenders to set a parameter they believe to be appropriate. So if you’re curious about applying for a loan, yourself, connect with a local lender to determine whether you’ll qualify. Typically, though, the minimum limit will range between 580 and 640.

**2\. What kind of income counts toward qualification?** Disability payments, child support, retirement income, pension, and many other sources can be applied to your application. So long as your income is steady and verifiable, it should qualify.

**3\. Is it difficult to obtain a VA loan?** Actually, not really. Your debt-to-income ratio will be the most important factor, but if you have an experienced professional to guide you, it shouldn’t be too difficult to secure lending.

**4\. Can I have a co-borrower on a VA loan?** Only spouses or another person with military benefits can act as co-borrowers on a VA loan.

**5\. What kind of property can a VA loan be used on?** Single-family homes, duplexes, triplexes, or fourplexes can all be purchased using the VA loan. You can also buy a manufactured property so long as it sits on a permanent foundation.

This covers the first five of our most common VA questions. Be on the lookout for our next installment, at which point we’ll cover five more.
