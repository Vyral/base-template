If you’ve ever had your credit pulled without your permission or you’re worried about identity theft happening to you, a new federal law was recently passed that allows you to freeze your credit if you want to. &nbsp;

The best part? You can do it for free.

**All you have to do is contact all three major credit bureaus—Transunion, Equifax, and Experian—by phone, written mail, or online, and ask them to lock down your credit.** If you make this request online or by phone, your credit will be frozen within one day. If you do it through written mail, your credit will be frozen within three days.

Then, if you want to unfreeze your credit at any time, all you have to do it contact them again and ask. &nbsp;
