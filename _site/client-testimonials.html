"We had an offer on our home within four days and we closed in about six weeks. I enjoyed getting the once a week follow-up. I don't know if that's above and beyond but I appreciated that where they were letting me know what had been going on during the week seeing if I had any questions."

"My experience with The Canovo Group was amazing. My wife and I had been looking for the last two years to get into a home. When I was able to get in touch with a member of The Canovo Group, Ali Garbero, it was like a night and day difference. We were able to get listings on a weekly basis but also on a daily basis. She was right there with us the whole way, step by step. I can't believe how amazing it was to have that whole process laid out simply for us so that we could finally get into a home."

"It was nice dealing with the whole team I felt like they accomplished the goal. When they approached us they said they'd get above asking price, and they 100 percent did. We were very well satisfied and happy with the end result. They were always good to deal with, it went well for us. My work schedule is pretty full on, so a lot of times I'd be calling them after hours and they were on family vacations and what not, but they'd always answer and get back to me. They were very good to deal with, where I'd think normal people would have just ignored it or let it go to voicemail."

"It was great! We bought a house about two months ago. They were awesome, they helped us every time we requested to look for houses. The house was only up for 36 hours and there were a bunch of people that put offers in. They did a really good job helping us get it. They would come late at night and late in the evening if we needed to or on the weekends. I would highly recommend them. I couldn't imagine a better group to work with."

"Ultimately, we got a house we're happy with, so that's the main thing. A couple of times I was able to schedule things around my own schedule where they were able to show us houses on really short notice which was very helpful."

"We were really happy with everything we did with The Canovo Group. Our buyer's agent was really fast at getting us in to see what we wanted and getting us exactly what we wanted. Our transaction agent was just great about everything that needed to be handled. They were right on top of things as well. We were very pleased. We were initially on the market last fall, and we had a contract fall through. Our agent actually called us up after the fact to talk and help us through it. Even though we weren't on the market anymore. She followed back up with us a number of times in the spring to help us get going again."

"We chose them because they were short sale specialists and that's what we wanted to do with our home. I thought they were fine. It took us two years to sell the home, but that had nothing to do with them because they had tons of walk-throughs. We had several offers, but the bank just took a really long time with processing [the transaction]. They did a great job. The house actually got broken into at one point. Some of the copper wiring's got pulled out. They had been keeping really good tabs on the house because we weren't living in it at the time. Dane, the Realtor, notified us immediately and helped me out with figuring out how to take care of it and negotiating with the bank. From that end, it was really helpful and took a big stress load off of us because had a bunch of other stuff going on at the time."

"I was really satisfied with them. We were able to buy a house and Ali our realtor was able to really get a good deal for us even after we got an appraisal that was less than what we offered. So she's a go getter. I think the whole thing was above and beyond especially when we pretty much thought that the sellers were going to back out because the appraisal came in less than we what we offered. She really continued to fight for us and get us the best deal. It was just awesome. She continued to work and I mean she could have just said oh well let's just go find another place, but she didn't. She continued to work for us."

He always kept in touch with me, always gave me updates of what he was doing, what's been done, and what needs to be done. He was really helpful as far as getting everything set up goes. Making sure my home inspections were on track; making sure my home appraisals came in - I would definitely recommend them. As soon as we found a house we were closed in less than 30 days, so I was really impressed!</p>
