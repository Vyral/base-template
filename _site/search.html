        "content": "As we come closer to the end of the year, weâd like to wish you all a happy holiday season. Thank you so much for all of your support throughout the year; weâve grown by 50% in our number of units sold in 2018!Before we enter the new year, weâd like to do a quick recap of what we saw in our market throughout 2018.The first half of the year was extremely strong and on track to exceed the units sold in 2017âs market. However, the second half slowed down a bit, meaning weâll end up with about 1.7% fewer homes sold compared to last year.âWeâve seen excess appreciation over the last several years, but now itâs beginning to normalize.âA lot of people have been asking me if weâre seeing a correction in our marketâwe are! Weâve seen excess appreciation over the last several years, but now itâs beginning to normalize. This isnât a bad thing. Weâre not seeing prices decrease or anythingâwe actually anticipate a 4% to 6% increase in appreciation over the next year.People have been seeing their homes stay on the market for longer, and some homes arenât selling at all. This has been the case in our market as a whole. However, our teamâs average days on market remains at 10, and our listing-to-sale price ratio is still at 100%.Â If you need any real estate advice, have questions, or would like some more information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to helping you! In the meantime, Happy Holidays!",

        "content": "Todayâs message will be twofold. First, we would like to remind you of our upcoming second annual pumpkin giveaway, and second, weâd like to encourage you to help support Hurricane Florence relief efforts.In the wake of the recent tropical storm, we could all use a bit of levityâso letâs begin with the lighter of these two subjects: Our pumpkin giveaway. This event will take place on Saturday, October 14 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Riverfront Park in Mount Pleasant, and we hope to see you there. We gave away over 1,000 pumpkins last year, and we have just as many to offer this year. To reserve your place, and your chance to snag one of these pumpkins, go to http://www.davesevents.org/. The giveaway will be first come first serve, so donât delay.Of course, there will be a lot of other things to enjoy at the event, as well. There will be a professional photographer offering family photos, a number of food trucks, and a face painter for the kids. Best of all, our team will also be using this event as an opportunity to give back. Weâve partnered once again with Lifeline, a great organization that places foster children into homes, to raise money for that cause. We raised more than $11,000 at last yearâs event, and we hope to raise at least that much again this time.Overall, this is going to be a great event. You wonât want to miss it.Next, letâs move on to the more essential of todayâs two topics: The relief efforts for Hurricane Florence. We in Charleston are very fortunate that the storm didnât hit us, but many other areas along the Carolina Coastline were impacted.âWe in Charleston are very fortunate that the storm didnât hit us, but many other areas along the Carolina Coastline were impacted.âStill, many of us stocked up on toiletries, nonperishable food items, and other essentials in anticipation of the storm. Now that the potential for danger has passed, though, many are wondering what to do with these things. Our team would like to recommend that instead of leaving them to sit in storage, you donate them to those who were affected by the storm.Weâre taking donations at our office (located at 496 Bramson Court, Mount Pleasant), so we encourage you and anyone you know who has items to spare to join us in making a difference for those in need. Weâre accepting over-the-counter medicine, canned food, bottled water, pet food, paper goods, construction tools, toiletries, and other such essential items. Our hope is that, after collecting these items, we will be able to take an 18-wheeler full of them up to North Carolina where we will distribute the goods. If youâre able to contribute, we would highly appreciate your help.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "Today I want to cover two topics: First, a recap of a special event we recently participated in, and second, an update on the market.We just wrapped up our fifth annual community appreciation event and fundraiser for the MUSC Burned Childrenâs Fund, and it was a blast. A ton of people came out to support the cause, and we met our goal of personally donating $5,000 to the fundraiser, and we raised a total of $22,000 for the 22nd anniversary of the MUSC Burned Childrenâs Fund and for Camp âCan Do.âWe had an opportunity to go down to the camp and visit the kids there. It turned out to be a life-changing event for me. We learned what kind of an impact this camp has had on the kids and how it has shaped and changed their lives. To learn more about this organization and the awesome cause they serve, click here.Now, on to our market update.The market has been great this year. As a whole, the market has appreciated about 6%, which is a little bit higher than what youâd typically see; usually we see gains of around 3% to 4%.There are some areas that have reached double digits, and much of Charleston is in the high single digitsâaround 8% or 9%.This increase in the median sales price is likely due to the amount of new construction in the market.Other areas like Goose Creek and Summerville have seen value appreciation of around 5% to 6%.âThose with realistic expectations of their homeâs value are going under contract, while those who overestimate arenât having as much success.âOverall, the market is healthy. Year over year, we havenât seen any increase in sales; this is because we donât have as much inventory on the market as we did last year.One thing Iâve noticed is that some sellers have the perception that their home is worth way more than it really is. If you look at active listings in the MLS, on average, theyâre priced 11% higher per square foot than the homes that are actually selling. Those with realistic expectations of their homeâs value are going under contract, while those who overestimate arenât having as much success. Those sellers might feel like thereâs a market bubble that has burst, but really, theyâre just forced to be more realistic about their homeâs value.If you have any questions about the market or our fundraising events, please reach out to me. I hope to hear from you soon.Â ",

        "content": "Our teamâs âComing Soonâ program, which we do for our sellers, is absolutely phenomenal. In the last 12 months, we have sold every single listing weâve taken on in just seven days, on average, and for 100% of the asking price. A lot of these sales can be attributed to our Coming Soon program.This program attracts buyers to your listing before we ever actually put it on the market. By the time we put it on the market, we inundate our sellers with showings. This results in multiple offers.One of the ways that we achieve these results is through extensive marketing. We post your home on over 400 different websites and advertise that it is âComing Soon.â Since there is such an inventory shortage, the anticipation we build around your listing gets buyers excited and allows your home to gain traction. And when your listing does hit the market, we end up scheduling many different appointments for showings from the very first day that itâs active.In addition to that, I have a massive database of buyers that are currently looking for homes. So, I go through every single one of those buyers and call them to let them know about your home.We also do a lot of social media marketing. Social media has a massive influence in todayâs world. So if you want to get your listing in front of people, you have to do marketing on social media.âBy the time we put it on the market, we inundate our sellers with a lot of showings which results in multiple offers.âOur client development team also helps by making phone calls. They call up and down the streets of your neighborhood to see if anyone wants to move. Some people may need a larger home but still want to stay in the same neighborhood, so we want to make sure theyâre aware that your property will soon be available. Those people may even know someone who wants to move into the neighborhood as well. They provide us with referrals for us to contact.Finally, we advertise for a mega open house. For the very first few days that your home is on the market, we will do this and drive a ton of attention to it. Once your home is on the market and interested buyers see it, a sense of urgency and excitement builds. As a result, we often see multiple offers and weâre able to get our buyers under contract usually within seven days for 100% of the asking price.If you have any additional questions about our coming coon program or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to contact me.

        "content": "Today I wanted to give you a quick market update for Charleston as well as a few great events that are going on around Charleston.A few recent events just occurred here in Charleston, including the James Beard Awards. Rodney Scott of Rodney Scott BBQ actually won Best Chef in the Southeast. I live right down the street from his restaurant and itâs fantastic.Additionally, FIG won the award for the best wine program in the country and The Charleston School of Business won an award for their MBA program. They were voted the top MBA program for post-graduates in the country as it related to post-graduation job placement.As far as some other things that are coming up, there is the 13th Annual Sweetgrass Festival, 2nd Sunday on King is back in town, and the Charleston Rum Fest and Charleston Beer Mile are also coming up soon. You can learn more about these and all the other events going on in the area by checking out this document.Â âReal estate is still a great investment in our market and I donât think weâre heading toward a bubble.âAs far as real estate goes in the Charleston market, we are up 7.2% in terms of home value in the last year. The last two years, we averaged around a 4% increase, so this is a big jump. Weâve actually seen the same number of home sales this year as last, so the increasing prices are a result of low inventory.There are still a lot of buyers out there and a lot fewer homes for sale, and as you can see, this is forcing prices up. Thatâs not going to be sustainable in the long run, but does it mean we are in a housing bubble? Not in my opinion. I think weâll continue to see great appreciation for at least two more years. After that, I donât think weâll see a dip. The research Iâve done has shown that weâve only seen a massive decrease in home values since 1991 during the 2008 market crash. When markets shift normally, they tend to just flatten out for a few years as opposed to crashing and falling.Real estate is still a great investment in our market and itâs a great time to buy or sell a home right now. Our team is seeing record-breaking sales numbers and homebuyers are still going to be able to take advantage of the great appreciation weâll see in the next few years.

        "content": "A lot of sellers have been asking how commission splits work in the real estate business. Itâs actually pretty simple.On a 50% commission, for example, half goes to the buyerâs agent and half goes to the listing agent. Listing agents can use this money to attract buyersâ agents to your home.A listing agentâs commission is used in the marketing of the property. 93% of buyers last year found their homes on the internet and through other advertising, as opposed to through the recommendation of a buyerâs agent.Â This goes to show the importance of allocating funds to these marketing resources.âA portion of the listing agentâs commission is allocated to marketing resources.âA big portion of funds on the listing side also go to the brokerage and to the government. Whatever is leftover becomes income for the listing agent.If you list with my team and I bring you a buyer, myself, we will only charge you half of the commission fee since there was no buyerâs agent involved.As always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "What is an escrow account?An escrow account is essentially a holding tank for money thatâs held by a third party. Itâs used in several different capacities, but here are a couple examples to help you understand how it works.The first is when you make an earnest money deposit on a home purchase. That earnest money is then held in an escrow account by an attorney or title company (or a real estate broker in some cases) and not released until the terms of the contract are complete. If the contract releases, the escrow officer has to release that money to either the buyer or the seller. Whoever the terms of the contract say the money should be released to, the escrow officer has to fulfill that obligation.If the home closes successfully, that money usually goes toward the proceeds of the transaction. That way, itâs not held by the buyer or seller, but rather a third-party whoâs just fulfilling the terms of the contract.âAn escrow account is essentially a holding tank for money thatâs held by a third party.âAnother example of how itâs held is with your mortgage. Your mortgage is more than likely escrowing your taxes and insurance. They take a small piece of your monthly payment and put it into your escrow account. The goal for them is to build that account up until it has enough money to satisfy your tax bill at the end of the year and your insurance bill whenever thatâs due.If, for whatever reason, your payment changes, itâs likely because your loan officer miscalculated the estimated taxes and insurance due. In that case, they could actually request more money. If theyâre taking too much money and thereâs too much money building in that account, you can adjust it. In this example, the escrow account provides protection for the bank to ensure youâre paying your insurance and your taxes.If you have any more questions about how escrow accounts are used or you have any other real estate topics youâd like to bring to my attention, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Recently, Iâve noticed that a lot of people are curious as to whether working with a team is truly better than hiring an individual agent.These days, the truth is that most people undergoing a real estate transaction tend to utilize a team.This is a great option since a team costs the same as an individual agent but provides you with more services for your money.Hiring multiple professionals for the same price as you would pay for one simply makes more sense.Â Working with a team means you will have access to a higher level of communication, better marketing, and a wider base of expertise.I recently pulled a report from the multiple listing service to help illustrate this point. According to these statistics, the average days on market for a listing sold with a single agent was typically greater than 50. Also, listings sold with a single agent tend to sell for 5% less than list price.âGetting more service for the same price is always the obvious choice.âWhen you look at my teamâs statistics for this year so far, itâs a very different story.Â With us, a homeâs average days on market is five, and all of our listings sell for 100% of asking price.Think of it this way: if you needed surgery, would you rather trust a single surgeon working out of his car, or go to the hospital under the care of a professional team? Getting more service for the same price is always the obvious choice.Buying or selling a home is a huge life eventâthatâs why itâs critical to work with the right people.If youâre interested in working with us, have any other questions, or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "A lot of people have been asking me if the fall and winter are good times to sell.My answer is, âYes!âToday letâs go through the top 10 reasons why I think fall and winter are great times to get your home sold.1. You will be a non-contingent homebuyer.This gives you much more leverage as a purchaser in the market when you do have a home to sell.2. There are a lot of rental vacancies, which will make it easier if you have to do a double move.3. You can restrict showings during the holidays. It is perfectly acceptable to restrict showings to accommodate any holiday plans you might have.4. January is the biggest month for transferees. A lot of big companies will end up hiring and transferring employees during this month, so those employees will begin house hunting in November and December.5. People are looking to buy for tax purposes, especially investors. By purchasing before the end of the year, these buyers can enjoy tax benefits for the 2017 tax year, instead of waiting for those benefits to apply to the 2018 tax year.6. Buyers have more time to look for homes. Things may be slower at their workplace, or they may have more time off to dedicate to searching for a house.7. Buyers are more emotional.A lot of buyers will make decisions based on emotion, so the holidays are great for appealing to a buyerâs sentimental side.8. Homes will show better.Decorating a house for the holiday season will help buyers fall in love with it, enabling them to imagine themselves living there with their families during the holidays. Again, this time can really appeal to a buyerâs emotions.9. Supply will dramatically increase in February and March, so youâll have more competition at that time when it comes to selling your home.10. Buyers are more serious and have fewer options. People also have a limiting belief that there arenât as many buyers in the market during the holidays. There may not be as many lookers, but the buyers in the marketplace are more serious. Additionally, the lack of supply suggests that your home could sell for more money since buyers will have fewer options to select from.âItâs impossible to time the market perfectly, but donât be gun-shy when it comes to listing during the holidays.âUltimately, the best time to sell is when it makes the most sense to you. Itâs impossible to time the market perfectly, but I wouldnât be gun-shy when it comes to listing during the holidays.If you have any questions, donât hesitate to reach out to us.",

This was done to help decrease the amount of mold growing inside their home.During this process, we began to talk to the family about what had happened. According to the family, it was late at night when they found out the levees were going to be opened near their home. Progressively throughout that evening, water levels began to rise in their neighborhood. By about 4 a.m. there was approximately six feet of water on the street and six inches of water in their home.âThis was an absolutely incredible experience and weâre so humbled to help.âAt this point the family was forced to evacuate by boat, only to return to their home two days later with nowhere else to go. The water had receded, but the damage was done. So many families are going through such terrible hardship right now, and it is absolutely tragic.The family weâve been speaking about today has actually filed four insurance claims already. Within the last two weeks, all four of these claims have been lost by the insurance company.With so much having befallen her family, the matriarch of the family said that she was beginning to lose her faith. On the same day she was telling this to her family, though, we showed up.They had absolutely no idea we were coming. According to the wife and mother, it was us showing up that helped to restore her faith. This was an absolutely incredible experience and weâre so humbled to have been able to help them.It is hard to describe the feeling of seeing the things weâve seen here. Imagine opening a cabinet to find fish sitting in pots and pans. Some homes were filled with mud while others were just completely destroyed.This is exactly why we thought it was so important to help. Weâve supplied some manpower and made donations toward the relief effort.If you have any goods or supplies to donate, weâre shipping supplies out from our Charleston area. Monetary donations are encouraged, as well. Weâve already raised about $10,000, and weâre still raising more. Anything you can give, even if itâs only a dollar, is appreciated. You can find the link to our donation page hereÂ If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "There are some big changes happening right now in the Greater Charleston area. We usually see a bit of a shift around this time of year, but some of the things we are noticing are pretty atypical.Over the last three months, weâve had 5,200 homes come on the market. However, our pending listings have dropped from 3,500 to 3,000 in that same time frame. Thatâs a significant difference. In addition to that, the price per square foot is in the high $160s right now, but homes are selling for about $134. It tells me that there are a lot of homes on the market right now that are overpriced.âWhether this shift continues or not depends on buyer confidence.âPart of the reason buyer activity has slowed down is because buyers are deciding that homes arenât just worth what sellers are asking for them and itâs causing a bit of a shift. Will it continue? I have no idea, but it depends on where buyer confidence is above all else. If buyers continue to not buy and decide homes are overpriced, the market will slow down.If youâve been thinking about selling your home, right now is the perfect time. In fact, this is one of the best sellerâs markets Iâve ever seen.If you have any questions for me or want any buying or selling advice, give me a call or send me an email.

For a $300,000 home, that margin of error could swing from $240,000 to $360,000.Â Zestimates are within 10% of the sale price just 70% of the time as well. In our $300,000 example home, the Zestimate could be off by $30,000 on the high or low side seven out of 10 times.âZestimates are within 5% of a homeâs actual value less than half the time.âFinally, Zillowâs Zestimates are within 5% of the sales price just 45% of the time. Thatâs still a $30,000 margin of error, and thatâs as accurate as they get.Â As a professional real estate agent, I would have been out of the business a long time ago if I was off by 5% on home value estimates that often.

        "content": "A lot of people have been asking me recently, âWhatâs up with the buyer agency agreement? What does it even mean?âWhen you call the number on a âFor Saleâ sign inquiring about the home thatâs for sale, you end up talking to the listing agent that the seller has hired. That person has a legal obligation to sell that personâs home for the most amount of money in the least amount of time.Is that the person you want to work with? The person who has a direct responsibility to the seller to fulfill those obligations? I donât think so.Thatâs why the state came up with buyer representation. In the words of a good friend of mine, âItâs the best money you havenât spent.â It doesnât cost you anything to work with a buyerâs agent, so why wouldnât you?There are many benefits to working with a buyerâs agent, such as:  We make sure you donât overpay for a home.  We shop interest rates for you to make sure you have the best financing available.  We negotiate the best deal for you.  We find the best home inspector to make sure the home doesnât have any problems. If it does, we have the seller fix them for you.Furthermore, there are other guarantees packaged into our teamâs buyer agency agreement. For example, you can cancel our agreement at any time. Most Realtors want to lock you into a late fee contract, but not us. We want to hold ourselves accountable to you because we know for a fact that as long as youâre happy, youâll have no reason to work with anybody else.âWorking with a buyerâs agent is the best money you havenât spent.âEven if you walk into a home and immediately fall in love with it, weâll give you reasons why you shouldnât buy it. We donât want you to make a bad decision, which alludes to our second guarantee: if you buy a home and youâre dissatisfied with it for whatever reason within the first 24 months, Iâll come over and sell it for free. Lastly, if we canât negotiate a home warranty into the contract for you, then weâll buy the house for you.If you have any more questions about the legal obligations and requirements of the buyerâs agency agreement, donât hesitate to give me a call.

        "category": "",
        "content": "When you are preparing your home for the market, you may want to make some renovations in order to net more money on your home sale. Which renovations get better returns than others?Keep in mind that less is more. Large-scale jobs arenât likely to return their full costs but there are investments worth doing in anticipation of an upcoming sale. Some renovations return 100% of their costs while others get less than half of the money back. Still, some renovations can improve your market position and the probability that your home will sell.Lower cost projects tend to return greater value. For example, the national average cost for a steel front door replacement is $1,200. That is the least expensive project on the list and it also gets the highest return. In fact, you can expect a 101% return on investment. In 43 of 102 markets surveyed, new doors recoup more than 100% of their costs.Other projects that get a good return on investment are mid-range garage door replacements or upscale garage door replacements, mid-range wood window replacements, and minor kitchen remodels. Notice a pattern here? With the exception of a kitchen remodel, these are all replacement projects.In general, replacements cost less and provide a bigger payback than remodeling or adding square footage to a home. First impressions are very important to buyers, so replacing things that they will see right away, like the front door, garage door, or siding will help you net more money on your home sale. Manufactured veneer gets a 92% return on investment.When it comes to remodels, though, kitchens will still get you the most bang for your buck. For example, a small, $20,000 remodel will get you a payback of 80%.Just how much you recoup from home improvements depends on which updates you make and which region of the country you are in. Other factors to take into account include figuring out which updates are typical for your specific neighborhood and, of course, the quality of the work.Check out this cost versus value report before you get into any renovations or remodels. We even have a professional stager on our staff who can tell you exactly which repairs will help your home sell for the most money.If you have any questions, please donât hesitate to reach out to us.

Since the election, rates have risen in total by about 0.75%, and we can expect them to rise further by a full percentage point by mid-summer.What does that mean for you as a buyer or seller?If youâre a buyer, the same home that you couldâve purchased last year will now cost you more. The monthly payment for a $500,000 house, for example, will now cost $200 to $300 more. If youâre a seller, your buyer pool is shrinking because not as many homes are affordable to them anymore.The good news is that we still have historically low inventory and interest rates. There are also still plenty of buyers out there looking to buy. We know this because, despite this uptick in rates, we still get a lot of inquiries. Buyers even have a bit more wiggle room to negotiate than they would have had in the past because there arenât as many multiple offer situations happening.If youâre planning on buying, do it now while you have a much better chance to lock in a low rate.

        "content": "We all know that weather can be unpredictable, and although hurricane Matthew was luckily not as bad as we expected it to be, it showed how important it is to have flood insurance in the Charleston area.Insurance expert Mark Allen dropped by to explain why itâs so important to have an insurance plan in place and what to look out for when selecting a policy. Here are some things to consider when selecting flood insurance:  Think of your insurance policy as an invisible safety net. Living on the coast has its perks, but if Mother Nature takes a turn for the worse, having a plan to fall back on for repair or damage costs will make sure you can sleep easy.  Most homeowners insurance policies will cover not only flood but also wind and hail damage. Making sure you cover all your bases when it comes to unpredictable weather is key. Luckily, you can select a policy that will have you covered in any circumstance.  Make sure you check to see if you have one or several policies covering you for flood and weather related damage. Homeowners insurance should cover everything, and itâs much easier to have one policy than have several with different deductibles and coverages.  Remember that not all policies are created equal. Different policies will include different deductibles or coverage amounts and different types of coverage as well. Make sure your policy is right for you and your home.  Donât fall for the âsticker price.â Many insurance agencies will try to sell you a policy without combing over the fine details. Different coverage amounts and types of coverage can sneak in, so make sure you know exactly what is and is not in your policy.  Donât forget about your personal items inside the home. Make sure you have proper coverage for both the inside and outside of your home.  Talk to someone who will insure your home in the way they would want their home insured. 1. Finding an insurance agent who walks you through your policy and makes sure you understand all the details, like what you are taking out or including, will help make sure you are getting the right coverage for the right house.  Get a flood quote. At the very least, you will understand what it is going to cost to include your personal items in your flood coverage.If you have any further questions regarding flood or homeowners insurance feel free to give Mark a call, visit 1stCapitalIns.com, or shoot him an email. If you have any questions about the Charleston or Mt. Pleasant real estate markets or youâre considering buying or selling a home, give me a call or send me an email. Iâd be happy to help.",

        "content": "As we all know, weather isnât exactly predictable. Thatâs why, as a homeowner, itâs absolutely necessary that you have an insurance plan in place that will protect you and your property in the long run. Insurance agents provide an invisible safety net that saves you money and time down the line.With that in mind, today weâre joined by Mark Allen from 1st Capital Insurance to explain the basics of what sort of insurance plans you should investigate and the typical costs of obtaining them.According to Mark, the number one thing that Lowcountry residents need to look out for when looking for insurance in a home are the deductibles. What are they covering? There are differences between an âall other perilâ (AOP) deductible and a âwind and hailâ and/or ânamed stormâ deductible. The named storm or wind and hail deductible is normally a percentage of your dwelling. For example, letâs say you have a $300,000 house and you have a 2% named storm or wind and hail deductible. That means your cost would be $6,000. The all other peril deductible has to do with fire, vandalism, theft, water damage, and other things of that nature.As to how much flood insurance costs, it depends on your houseâs location and its elevation. Normally people in Markâs business get what is called an âelevation certificate,â which tells them how high the house is and how well the house is vented so that they know how much to charge appropriately.To Markâs estimate, the typical cost of a flood policy for a $300,000 to $500,000 home would be around $500 a year, which covers $250,000 on the building and $100,000 in contest. Thatâs the maximum that FEMA allows. You can get other policies that cover you over and above that, but thatâs the typical FEMA policy.âLowcountry residents need to be mindful of deductibles.âFor homeowners living around water areas, Markâs advice is to watch for how much the house would cost to rebuild, because thatâs what insurance companies measure to determine their rate. If you make any major changes or renovations to your home, make sure to call your insurance company and update your policy information.Stay tuned for part two of our series with Mark where weâll cover the business of homeowners insurance in greater depth.

        "content": "All home buyers have one thing in common: they do not want to get ripped off. In todayâs increasingly busy housing market, sales have risen to 5.46 million, which, according to the National Association of Realtors, is 7.7% higher than last year. In this busy market, itâs especially important to make sure that youâre getting the right price.How do you know if youâre getting a fair value? Even if youâre in a tight market, you can figure out if a home is priced fairly before you make the offer. There are certain ways you can evaluate whether the price of any home is a sound investment or if youâre getting ripped off.First of all, look at recently sold comparable properties. Comparable properties are similar in size, condition, neighborhood, and amenities. Your real estate agent is your best resource for accurate, up-to-date information on comparable properties, also known as comps.You should also look at comparable properties that are currently on the market, under contract, or not selling at all. If a comparable property failed to sell because it was overpriced, the property you are interested in is probably overpriced too.âLook at comparable properties to see if the home you want is priced fairly.âYou also have to consider the appreciation rates in the area. Are prices going up? Are prices going down? What do the days on the market look like? If you are in a sellerâs market with very low inventory, high demand, and low days on market, you will have a better idea of what a seller is willing to accept. In an appreciating market, you can buy now and reap the benefits of further appreciation down the line.If you are in a market with high days on market, lots of inventory, and very little demand, then you know that prices are starting to depreciate. In that case, make sure you buy 5% to 10% below the market value so that you donât lose value as prices continue to drop. In depreciating markets, you need to buy your equity up front in order to make the best investment.If you have any other questions about determining market value or about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Iâm often asked about appreciation, so I wanted to talk about how you can predict the annual appreciation or depreciation for your real estate investment.My team and I study the market daily to predict appreciation rates for our clients. We look at sales over the last year compared to the current inventory, and based on this, we can determine the months of inventory.Because real estate is very location-driven, the months of inventory will change from neighborhood to neighborhood. Months of inventory will determine the appreciation (or depreciation) rate you can expect for your home or investment. The future prospects for your chosen neighborhood can have a big impact on price.If a big development is planned, such as a big mall or an extension of a light rail or highway, or thereâs a new company moving to the area, the prospects of future appreciation look good. Even small developments like plans to add a road or a small school are good signs. On the other hand, if grocery stores and gas stations are slowly closing down, then you can probably determine that home values will depreciate, and you might consider moving out of the area.New developments in housing can take it either way. If the area is hot, itâs likely in high demand and increasing your homeâs value. However, if there is a surplus in new development (like a lot of new construction that youâre competing against), it could hurt the value of your home and your appreciation.If a builder came in and bought land at a very good value and started developing a lot of homes and devaluing homes in the surrounding area because of what they started selling those homes at, it could have a negative impact on you.If youâd like a report about appreciation rates in your specific area, Iâd be more than happy to put one together for you at no cost. If you have any questions about the Charleston market, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!",

        "content": "Why does it make more sense for a person to own a home rather than rent one? There are many benefits, but according to a recent study done by Harvard University, all of them fall under two categories: financial reasons and emotional reasons. These two reasons can sometimes overlap, but weâll review some of the financials first.For starters, housing is a leveraged investment. Ask yourselfâwhat else can you get a 30-year fixed low-interest rate loan on for an investment? On top of that, homes in our area appreciate anywhere between 3% and 5% per year. The second financial benefit is that youâre paying for a home whether you own it or rent it. You need shelter and a place to live, right? You might as well own it and turn it into an investment instead of making your landlord rich.The third financial benefit is that owning a home is a forced way of saving money. By that I mean a portion of that mortgage payment youâre making is going toward the principal that you owe on the home. As you pay that principal down over time, that becomes equity in your home. When you sell it, you get all of that money back.There are also substantial benefits in regards to property taxes. For example, you can write off certain expenses of your home investment against your income. At the end of the year, then, youâll either be paying less in taxes or getting a larger cash refund. For greater detail on all the specific tax benefits, be sure to talk to your CPA. Owning a home also allows you to hedge against inflation, since real estate is a tangible asset.The emotional reasons need far less explanation. For one thing, we all share the basic human need for physical shelter. After thatâs accomplished and you perhaps decide that you want children, you need a place to raise them. After those boxes are checked off, you have the ability to pass along wealth to your family. And finally, owning a home means having control over your living space.If you have any questions about real estate or homeownership, give me a call or send me an email. Iâd be happy to help you out!",

        "content": "We want to invite you to a Charleston RiverDogs game at Joseph P. Riley Jr. Park as a way to say thank you, and weâre also raising money for charity. All of our friends, colleagues, and past and current clients are welcome. The game is on June 14th, and our free picnic will start at 6:00 p.m.For every person that attends, we will donate $10 to the MUSC Childrenâs Fund in order to send children to Camp Can-Do, which is over on Seabrook Island.Our goal is to donate at least $3,000, but we need your help to do so! We still have lots of tickets left, so just call the number on the screen and tell us how many tickets we should reserve.There will be free food and drinks starting at 6:00 p.m., and the baseball game will start at 7:00 p.m.Last but not least - itâs still a great time to sell a home in Charleston. Weâre still in a sellerâs market, but when rates rise it may be more difficult to sell a home. If you list now you can cash out and then buy a home when the market is in your favor.Buyers should also be aware that itâs a great time to purchase with interest rates still so low. However, they may see a small rate hike in June that could affect affordability. If youâre thinking of buying, get in touch with us now before your affordability takes a hit and youâre knocked out of your ideal price bracket.If you have any questions about this event or about our local real estate market, please donât hesitate to contact me!",

Halley is an Auburn grad, and Dave roots for anything related to Michigan and Detroit as he grew up in southeastern Michigan. Dave and Halley love sports, and staying active in life and in the community. Dave whole heartedly believes in giving back. He has always been and continues to be extremely involved in several non profits. He has organized many successful events for the American Red Cross. Habitat for Humanity, Lifeline and many more.</p>

<p>Dave has proven that he has what it takes to find or sell your home. He has been a Top Producing Realtor for 18 years, and is in the top 1% of Realtors worldwide. Daveâs also been featured on HGTVâs show House Hunters. He has closed well over 1,500 transactions in his 18+ years practicing real estate, earning countless raving fan reviews. He works hard to get you the deal a buyer is looking for and averages 4% more savings than the average buyer transaction. Dave sells 95% of his listings within 6 days, and within 99.5% of asking price, far exceeding the area average of 95%.</p>

<p>Dave has spent the past 18+ years analyzing the home buying and selling process for his clients. He has dedicated his time to streamlining the process and improving the results. Dave surrounds himself with the leading experts in the field and is committed to continuing education so that he can always ensure heâs offering the best advice and information for todayâs market. Part of Daveâs business philosophy is that itâs better to be great at one thing than to be okay at several things.
