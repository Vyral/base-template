        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Moving up is an exciting topic, but itâs also one that generates a lot of questions from homebuyers. There are three questions, in particular, we get asked most commonly, and asking yourself these questions will help you get a better idea if nowâs the time for you and your family to move up.Â 1. What is my current home worth? There are a lot of factors that go into this, but the majority of offers youâll receive for your home will be using financing, which means your home will undergo an appraisal.Â Aside from knowing what your home is worth, you also need to know what makes it unique and what features make it stand out. Itâs not just about how nice your home is and what other homes are selling for in the areaâitâs about what other homes people can buy in your community, your city, or the surrounding cities.Â 2. How do I time the move? Once you know your homeâs value, youâll know what kind of proceeds youâll get that you can carry into your next home purchase. In this scenario, we create a net sheet for our clients to use. If you can buy without needing to sell your current home first, that makes you more attractive as a buyer because youâre not a contingent buyer. However, the downside is you may have to pay two mortgages at once for a short time. There are strategies around this scenario, such as renting out your home, that weâd be happy to discuss with you further.Â âAside from knowing what your home is worth, you also need to know what makes it unique and what features make it stand out.â3. What happens if I sell but I donât find the right home to move into? On our team, we always put our buyers in a strong position, so to prevent this from happening, we only accept offers that are subject to you being able to find a suitable replacement property. If you canât find one, you donât have to sell. This reduces your risk all around.Â Buyers will want assurances that youâre looking for other properties, and once youâve found the next home youâd like to purchase, that seller will want to know that your current home is on the market and is desirable.Â This can be a stressful situation, but certain life events (e.g., a new addition to your family or a job promotion) either necessitate more space or allow you to buy a bigger home. In any case, weâve created an in-depth guide for moving up that weâd be happy to share with you if youâd like to know more about this topic. Just send me a comment with the words âmove upâ and Iâll send you a copy.Â If you have any other real estate questions I can answer for you, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.Â Â ",

        "title": "How Is Our Orange County Market Right Now?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Summer is in full swing here in Orange County, and our real estate market has definitely seen some interesting changes throughout this season. Today, letâs take a look at some of the most notable developments.For one thing, inventory is way down. This July, there were 11% fewer listings available on our market than there were during that same month last year. The number of new listings hitting our market has also slowed, with a growth of just 2% year over year this July.âBuyers, sellers, and investors alike can enjoy the unique opportunities presented by todayâs dynamic market.âHowever, given that homes are still taking approximately 91 days to sell, our market remains fairly balanced. Neither buyers nor sellers have a distinct advantage. This might surprise sellers who have fallen for the myth that summer is the hottest time of year to sell, but the truth is that spring, not summer, is actually the most active season for real estate.Â Once spring passes, the rate of home sales (and the rate of new inventory coming to the market) tends to slow down. And activity drops even more significantly by the time fall arrives. Â This year, though, low interest rates have prevented our market from slowing down quite so severely as we progress further into summer. This is because demand is rising more quickly than supply, which allows our market to keep moving forward even as fall draws near.Â In short: Buyers, sellers, and investors alike can enjoy the unique opportunities presented by todayâs dynamic market. Whatever your goals, we would be happy to help you meet them.Â If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "title": "How Are We Giving Back?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "For the past three years, our real estate team has partnered with [Organization] to source backpacks for local children, so that families without the resources to provide them on their own can still send their kids to school with all the necessary tools.Â In addition to The Purist Group, we also work closely with local law enforcement to create these opportunities year after year for our areaâs youth.Â I like to think of our impact on the community as being similar to the old folk tale of the young boy throwing starfish back into the sea after a storm. In the story, thousands of starfish have been stranded on a beach. The boy throws back as many as he can, but is obviously unable to save them all. As heâs working to help the starfish, an old man approaches him and says, âYou arenât making a difference. You canât save them all.ââEvery good deed matters.âThrowing back another starfish into the sea, the little boy looks at the old man and says, âI made a difference to that one.âIn this same way, even knowing that we canât help every child in America, our team is proud to know that we are making an impact at all. Every good deed matters. One local woman, a special education teacher named Karina, exemplifies this point.Â Three years ago, it was Karina who came to us with the idea of beginning our now-annual backpack drive. Fast forward to this year, and weâre about to donate 2,000 supply-filled backpacks to children in our community. Katrinaâs idea has grown into something amazing, and each of us has the capacity to make a difference, just like she did.Â In our real estate business, for example, we strive to do this every day. More than just selling properties, itâs our mission to connect families with their next home. The bottom line is that there are many ways to make a difference. Even something as simple as smiling at a stranger or holding open a door for someone has a positive impact.Â If you have any other questions about todayâs message, would like more information about how we can serve your real estate goals, or would like to talk about other ways to give back, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "title": "What the Looming Recession Means for Our Housing Market",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "A recession is looming, but thereâs no reason to believe it will look anything like the crash of 2008.Â Â The stock market is close to all-time highs, unemployment is extremely low, and inflation is still seemingly in check.And yet, this might be the last party before the crash.Â A recent Wall Street Journal poll of 73 economists found that the majority believe a recession is coming in 2020. Current homebuyers in the market echo these predictions, with 70% believing a recession will come in the next few years.What does this mean in terms of our housing market? Nationwide, home prices continue to slow in growth. On top of that, the number of homes sales has slowed down too. This reminds me of the time between 2006 and 2008, but do we automatically think history will repeat itself? I donât think so, and there are a couple of reasons why.First of all, unlike in 2008, there arenât a ton of bad mortgages out there. Back then, practically anyone could qualify for a mortgage. These days, a lot of rule changes have been implemented to protect the future of the housing market.Â âA lot of rule changes have been implemented to protect the future of the housing market.âSecond, the looming recession will not be an exception. In recessions past, the housing market as a whole wasnât affected the way it was in 2008. In my opinion, homes that are still desirable will continue to sellâeven in a recession. Homes that are overpriced, donât have the same features as the rest of the homes, or are somewhat affected by this recession will take longer to sell. Thatâs just the reality of the situation.Â If youâre a home seller, this means you need to focus on your needs, goals, and circumstances. After that, examine the market environment and look toward the future to see what makes sense for you. If youâre curious what your Orange County home is worth, you can use our home value calculator right here on our website.Â If youâre thinking of buying a home and are wondering if nowâs the time to do it, you need to figure out what your short-, medium-, and long-term goals are. It might be in your best interest to rent, but itâs a good idea to get a feel for the available inventory before you make a final decision.Whether youâre looking to buy, sell, or invest, everyoneâs needs are different, so if you have any more questions about our current market and how it affects you, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. Iâd love to speak with you and help you reach your future goals.Â Â ",

        "content": "Real estate investing is hotter than ever, and itâs no wonder why.Â Mortgage rates are low, home prices continue to grow, and demand for rentals is strong.But if youâre interested in investing in real estate, where do you start? And what do you need to know? Here are five crucial tips Iâve gathered from successful real estate investors to help you out:1. Donât stick to your own backyard. Many fledgling real estate investors limit their search to neighborhoods they know well. This might cut into your potential for profit. The best deals might be a bit further away, and emerging neighborhoods might offer better growth potential and tax incentives.2. Use the 1% rule. A good rule of thumb for real estate investing is to look for properties that will offer a monthly return that is greater than 1% of the sales price. In other words, if a home costs $100,000, you should only invest in it if you expect to get at least $1,000 a month in rent.âIt pays to know the many possible tax benefits associated with real estate investing.â3. Donât over-rehab. An investment property doesnât have to look like a Pinterest photo shoot. Instead of trying to convert an investment into your dream home, go with middle-of-the-road fixturesâand save yourself both time and money.4. Look to single-family rentals. Single-family homes tend to consistently appreciate. They are also most likely to attract good tenants, and they are something you have direct experience withâand can evaluate personally.Â 5. Understand the tax benefits. It pays to know the many possible tax benefits associated with real estate investing. These include deductions for depreciation, mortgage interest deductions, and maintenance, as well as the benefits that come from investing through qualified plans like self-directed IRA accounts.Now, these five tips are valuableâbut they are only a start.If youâre seriously considering real estate investing, Iâd advise you to first take a look at some of the great homes available around the Orange County area. And if this gets your investment appetite going, give me a call. There are two reasons why.Â First, I can give you my impressions about which types of homes (and in which neighborhoods) might make for a sensible first investment.Â Second, I can also point you to other professionals I personally trustâmortgage brokers, tax advisors, contractorsâwho can help you make that first investment profitable with the minimal amount of fuss.If you have any other real estate questions, feel free to reach out to me as well.

        "content": "If youâre in the market to buy a new home, Iâve got some advice for you today. Here are the top things you should take into consideration before making the plunge:1. Location, location, location. Youâve probably heard this phrase before. When youâre looking at a new home, itâs important to know where youâre at and what school district youâre in. Even if you donât have kids, the future resale value of your home is going to be affected by the district itâs in. Also, how close is the home to local shopping, dining, and entertainment options? These are all things to consider.2. Financial commitment. Real estate is a long-term investment. If you want to move in a few years, you might want to consider renting instead. Having your money tied up in a home is not a great short-term investment.Â 3. Running the well dry. Most buyers spend every penny that they have to get into their new home, especially first-time buyers. Even though weâll make sure you have a home warranty for your first year, itâs important to have a home savings fund for any repairs or maintenance that happens outside of that.âThese are just five of the things that you need to consider.â4. Loving your space. The reason that you want to love your space is that itâs not just the indoor area that youâre going to enjoy. Youâre going to want to set up an entertainment area or spend a nice night in the backyard. However, if youâre busy, you might want something a little lower maintenance like a townhouse or a condo.Â 5. Untapped potential. The truth is that there are a lot of different neighborhoods, but finding one thatâs undergoing a renaissance is ideal. You might be able to find a home at a great price in a neighborhood thatâs a little rough at the moment, but youâll have the opportunity to be part of something great going forward as the neighborhood grows, improves, and changes.These are just five of the things that you need to consider as a buyer. If you need help in your home search or just have any questions at all about the process, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "As home buying season really kicks off, sellers are in a prime position to earn top dollarâthat is, assuming they take the time to properly prepare their properties for the market.Â If you want to sell quickly and for a great price, you need to make sure your home is in the best possible shape before you list it. But not all home upgrades are worth making.Â Today Iâd like to share a list of three projects that will bring a high return on your investment so that you can avoid wasting money on projects that wonât.Â 1. Improve your curb appeal. A fresh coat of paint and some landscaping can go a long way. The way your home looks from the outside serves as a buyerâs first impression, after all. Updating your curb appeal tends to cost between $3,000 to $5,000âan amount youâll more than likely earn back (and then some) because of the positive impact this upgrade has on buyers. If you need design ideas, check out local new construction properties in your area. This will help you understand current popular styles, color palettes, and more.âIf you want to sell quickly and for a great price, you need to make sure your home is in the best possible shape before you list it.â2. Upgrade your bathroomsâbut not too much. Mid-range bathroom upgrades bring about $1.71 for every $1, while high-end bathroom upgrades could actually hurt your bottom line. In other words, you need to choose your projects carefully. Adding in dual sinks, swapping out flooring, and changing out cabinets are all good upgrades to make, but make sure you donât choose the most expensive options for each of these projects. Otherwise, your bathroom will look out of place compared to the rest of your home.Â 3. Install new windows. Mid-range, energy-efficient windows can bring you $1.15 return for every $1 spent. Not only do these new windows look nice, but they will also help your homeâs new owner save money on their energy bills.Â If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me or my team a call or send us an email.

        "content": "First-time homebuyers often focus on two things: the price of a home and the monthly payment theyâll be bound to after purchasing it. This is quite understandable. However, thereâs one more thing you need to consider when buying a house: the future value of the property.In a nutshell, appreciation, or the increase in prices over time, is how a majority of wealth is built in real estate. Thatâs why homeownership is a great, stable, long-term investment.There are ultimately two ways to take advantage of your homeâs equity: actively and passively.âHomeownership has traditionally been one of the most stable opportunities to build wealth.âBy paying off a mortgage during your working years, you actively eliminate a big expense from your plate during your retirement years.Â Whatâs more is that if youâre not great about having a savings plan, owning a home is a great opportunity to passively create a financial cushion that renting canât. If you start when youâre young, it gives you a longer opportunity to create wealth.Now, owning a home doesnât necessarily guarantee that you can have a greater net worth, but homeownership has traditionally been one of the most stable opportunities to build wealth. Obviously, real estate values do fluctuate over time, but itâs still a great vehicle for stable growth for many people. It gives you an opportunity (and a structure) to build wealth.

To read the full article, click here.Â In the meantime, here are some of the main points to take away from it.Things youâll love:  Increased inventory. There are more homes to choose from, so you need to focus your time effectively and distinguish between areas you love and areas that are less desirable.Â   More open houses. As more and more homes hit the market, there are more and more open houses taking place that give you a great opportunity to match what you see online with what you see in person and size up the competition from other buyers. As always, use your time effectively when sightseeing open houses.âYou need to focus your time effectively and distinguish between areas you love and areas that are less desirable.âThings youâll hate:Â   More competition.

Like I said above, youâll have to make decisions quicker in this market. If you have to sleep on it, odds are, you wonât get to sleep in it. Doing as much prep work up front as possible while working with an agent who has their finger on the pulse of the market will help tremendously in this regard.Â Â   Increased prices. It all boils down to supply and demand.

Interest rates peaked during the worst time in 2018âright around the holidays, rates hit 5.05%.

The current average days on market is 140 days, which means weâre in a different market entirely compared to last year.In past years, there was a quick run-up of multiple offers on every home, but these days, youâll need to be a little bit more selective: Market aggressively, but also be sure to price your home in a way that will get the most attention from buyers in the shortest amount of time.No matter if youâre looking to buy, sell, or invest in real estate this year, feel free to reach out to us.

Instead, the two styles will meld together. Rustic chic will incorporate more modern colors, as well as asymmetry.Weâre also noting a focus on effortlessness in regards to technology these days. Products like Google Home, Amazonâs Alexa, and Appleâs HomePod will undoubtedly impact home design. The way that weâre experiencing our homes is different in todayâs world, and itâs helping us modernize and automate our lives just with the sound of our voice.Itâs expected that weâll see a continuation of the industrial focus in home design, with matte black and bronze really complementing the industrial look. Colors like grays and moody blues will continue to demand top dollar in the market when youâre selling your home or setting it up as a vacation rental.HGTVâs popular show âFixer Upperâ really ushered in the farmhouse chic look. However, one thing weâve seen is that the farmhouse door made with reclaimed wood (popularized by the show) is giving way to the same farmhouse barn door, though refined with a modern appealâyou can expect wood thatâs been more squared out, as well as more glass and metal accents.âColors like grays and moody blues will continue to demand top dollar in the market when youâre selling your home or setting it up as a vacation rental.âBold, trendy colors like âmillennial pinkâ that were all the rage a couple years ago are slowly moving out, making room for more earthy tones and other colors that can appeal to a wider audience, from light gray to matte black.

        "content": "When it comes to buying a remodeled home, thereâs usually more to it than meets the eye. Here are five tips to help you avoid buying a remodeled home that might be more than what you bargained for:1. Make sure all of the major systems work. Having new floors and counters is great, but if you have to replace the homeâs heating system or electrical system, that might cost you more than the remodel itself.2. Make sure the kitchen doesnât disappoint. A good way to make sure the builder didnât cut corners in this area is to double check that the backsplash is even.3. Make sure there was attention to detail in the bathrooms. If they remodeled the bathrooms, you need to make sure they invested heavily in themânot only with high-end tile, but also with new supply valves, shut-off valves, trim rings, etc. This will tell you whether they finished the job or not.4. Make sure the home is on even footing. Poorly installed laminate or hardwood can buckle and pop over time. A good way to know if your floors are even is to kick off your shoes, slide across them, and see if you catch any corners (think of Tom Cruise in âRisky Businessâ).5. Make sure they took pride in the work they did. A good way to do this is to check the molding in the corners and frames of each room.âHaving new floors and counters is great, but if you have to replace the homeâs heating system or electrical system, that might cost you more than the remodel itself.âAs a Realtor, Iâve seen just as many terrible remodels as Iâve seen great ones, so if you have any more questions about how to tell if a remodeled home youâre thinking of buying is a good investment, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "category": "",
        "content": "I recently read an article in The New York Times titled, âWhy Do All Home Repairs Cost $1,000?â The author was complaining that it didnât matter much what went wrong at homeâbe it a leaky faucet, broken garage door, or failed water heater. In each case, the bill came out to at least $1,000.Â Most homeowners underestimate the costs of various home repairs, often by as much as four times the actual cost. Can anything be done about this? Here are three recommendations to help you deal with home repair costs:1. Save for a rainy day and create a special account for repairs. The average homeowner spends $2,000 a year on maintenance. As a homeowner myself, I have a tax fund, a âhappy fun dayâ fund, and a rainy day fund. When you use the rainy day fund to pay for your repairs, youâll be in a much better financial position.Â âSometimes it can make sense to look for a new home that wonât require frequent repairs.â2. Enjoy being a homeowner. $50 in parts and a YouTube tutorial or a Google search will be enough to repair most home maintenance issues, so try focusing on the smaller, simpler fixes yourself and delegate the more complicated ones to the professionals.Â 3. Negotiate smart. This means getting multiple quotes from different professionals so that you get the best price. Also, donât pre-frame the cost of a repair. A lot of contractors will agree to do something for $1,000 if you assume it costs that much, but not everything does, so donât automatically pay them $1,000 for a job that doesnât cost nearly that much.Â Of course, if you reach a certain point where youâre constantly needing things fixed, it might just make more sense to look for a new home that wonât require frequent repairs. Â If youâre considering buying or selling a home or if you need recommendations for contractors to fix those things you donât want to deal with yourself, give me a call or send me an email today.

        "content": "One thing that some people donât know about me is that I actually worked for the REO Division at JPMorgan Chase. âREOâ means âreal estate ownedâ; we dealt with the bank-owned foreclosed properties. Since then, Iâve been able to help a number of clients successfully purchase foreclosed homes.Â Sometimes, however, foreclosed homes are more than people bargain for.Every foreclosed home is sold in as-is condition, meaning that no repairs will be done. This is why itâs very important to have a thorough and effective property inspector go through all the major systems, including the plumbing, electric, water, and HVAC systems. These are all things that could end up costing a lot of money to repair if theyâre not in good shape. Additionally, donât forget that California is termite country, so be sure to have pest control come through to look for signs of potential infestations.When a home is foreclosed upon, sometimes there are unpaid contractor liens, homeowner association dues, and tax liens on the property. These are all things that will come up on the title report, so itâs a good idea to review that to be sure there arenât any nasty surprises.It should come as no surprise that when a home is foreclosed, the seller may not have left on the best of terms. Sometimes, fixtures have been removed or there are other damages on the property. I once purchased a foreclosed property myself; all the toilets removed, door handles were missing, windows were broken, and there were holes in the walls. Itâs wise to go into a foreclosure home purchase understanding that these types of things are typical.âIt should come as no surprise that when a home is foreclosed, the seller may not have left on the best of terms.âBecause these homes have often been vacant for a long time, itâs also smart to get a home warranty. That will protect you for all the major systems in the home, and it offsets some of the costs you might be incurring when you buy one of these properties.In the previous downturn of the market, foreclosed homes were plentiful and often ignored. However, in our current market, there are investors that are specifically looking for these types of properties. This can lead to frenzied bidding wars that raise the price up to market value. Be sure to review all other relevant sales in the area that are comparable in neighborhood and in the content of the property.The bottom line is that thereâs definitely an opportunity to get a value when purchasing foreclosed homes if youâre educated and have someone on your side who knows the ins and outs of what to expect. I purchased a home at $45,000 below market value, after which, I invested about $30,000 in upgrades. Recently, we closed on a home that was worth $800,000 for the neighborhood, but we got it for $750,000.If you do your homework and then create and execute a smart plan for pursuing a foreclosed home, you can definitely be successful.If you have any questions about foreclosed properties, you are encouraged to reach out to me.

This look reminds me of the first time that I went to the Tropicana Hotel; Iâd recommend something more neutral and less reminiscent of Las Vegas.  1:20âUpside down photos. I was initially very confused about this photo; how and why did the homeowner manage to install an elevated washing machine? Then I realize they had uploaded the photo to the MLS upside down. You only get one chance to make a first impression, so double-check your photos before making this mistake.  1:45âThis photo looks like every horror movie Iâve ever seen was filmed here. To make it less creepy, Iâd move the sparing items on the right and showcase the floor to brighten it up.  2:20âCarpet in the bathroom. Alone, carpet in the bathroom is a turn-off for buyers, but this photo really takes it over the top: They not only have a toilet, but also a bidet and a sitting chair all in the same bathroom. This photo should have focused on the countertops and less on the urinal in the middle of the room.  2:50âA woodsy, surf-and-turf disaster. Instead of focusing on the mounted deer head, marlin, and monkey, the photographer should have focused on the room, instead of the just the corner in which this odd arrangement of mounts. If taken from a different angle, the photo could have shown off the roomâs size or flow and helped a potential buyer appreciate the space more.âAlone, carpet in the bathroom is a turn-off for buyers, but this photo really takes it over the top: They not only have a toilet, but also a bidet and a sitting chair all in the same bathroom.âI always tell my sellers that you should always want to make sure the home speaks to as many buyers as possible.

They spend the duration of the program learning about homelessness, hunger, kids with terminal diseases, and how to support our troops. The program is run in Orange County, Los Angeles, and Arlington, VA; just this spring, they launched the program in New York City.Julie is proud to mobilize our youngest citizens to become change-makers, to connect with social issues, and to create a country that truly invests in our kids and puts our resources where our words are.âJulie started the organization to let all children learn that theyâre strong enough to make a difference in the world.âWe have recently partnered with Team Kids to develop a new program here in Orange County: The Superhero Program. Modeled after the Team Kids Challenge Program, the Superhero Program serves to involve children with their communities to create a positive impact by learning how to support their heroes, the hungry, the homeless, and those who have undergone tragedy. With each project, they earn stickers and are eventually launched as superheroes to address key issues.If youâd like to learn more about the Team Kids organization and see what theyâre doing to create change in their communities, visit www.TeamKids.org and follow them on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.If you think your children would be interested in participating and becoming superheroes themselves, or if you have general questions for me about real estate, please feel free to reach out to me. I hope to hear from you soon.",

        "content": "What questions should you be asking your mortgage lender? Today Iâll discuss eight of them.1. âWhat type of loan is best?â This depends on your scenarioâhow long you plan to own the property, if itâs a primary residence you plan to live in for a long time or if you plan to rent it out at some point.2. âWhat is the interest rate and annual percentage rate (APR)?â The interest rate is the rate the loan is at, but once you include the cost of obtaining, that is how you get the APR. Itâs a better indicator of the overall costs.3. âWhat are discount fees and origination points?â This is a percentage of the loan amount, and its often between a quarter of a percent and 1%, depending on the loan amount you obtain. In a way, itâs prepaid interest to buy down your interest rate. Itâs also another expense related to your loan, so review it accordingly.4. âWhat are all the costs?â There are discount points of origination fees, application fees, appraisal fees, and others besides the costs of general homeownership. Be sure to ask for a detailed list of fees so you can review them and plan accordingly.âItâs a better experience when they can approve the loan in-house because itâs much faster; they can walk over to an underwriter to review the loan directly at that time.â5. âWhat is a loan estimate?â This is a breakdown of all the expenses related to obtaining the loan.6. âDo you offer rate locks?â Sometimes you can obtain a rate and your lender can lock it for a period of 30 days, which is the average escrow timeline to close. However, theyâll also sometimes float the rate, meaning they canât lock it until itâs been approaved. This means that if the interest rates go up during that time, youâre at risk.7. âDo you offer in-house loan approval?â Itâs a better experience when they can approve the loan in-house because itâs much faster; they can walk over to an underwriter to review the loan directly at that time.8. âHow long is it going to take to fund the loan?â This is important especially in the case in which youâre purchasing a house and you only have 30 days to accomplish the transaction. If youâre just refinancing and looking to reduce your payments, 60 days is the average time. You will want to review this with your lender to make sure.If you have any further questions about loans, please feel free to reach out to us.

        "content": "Having a home security system comes with both benefits and drawbacks, and if youâre thinking of getting one for yourself and your family, there are a few facts you should know before making a decision.Â A study by HomeFacts found that just having a theft deterrent was beneficial, but one of the main reasons homeowners decide against getting a home security system is the cost involvedâthereâs usually an upfront setup fee and ongoing maintenance costs. Between these two expenses, the overall cost of a home security system can vary widely.Â âThe average home break-in costs $1,725âHaving a home security system should go beyond providing peace of mind and also make sense in terms of dollars and cents. An FBI study found that the average home break-in costs $1,725 in terms of stolen valuables and damage. Another study also found that one in four homes is likely to be broken into.Â These days, there are plenty of programs that are less expensive relative to the amount of monitoring you get in return. You can also purchase an ongoing monitoring system so that when a door or window is open, the police are automatically notified. Itâs all a matter of deciding which option is best for you.If youâre curious about the best kinds of home security systems out there or you have any other questions about this topic, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "title": "A Market Crash May Not Be on the Horizon After All",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Is there a housing crash on the horizon? We donât think so, and there are eight key reasons behind our perspective:Â âRight now, loans are of higher quality than they have been since before the last crash.â  The state of subprime loans. Before the crash in 2008, subprime loans constituted $620 billion and made up 20% of the total mortgage market. Today subprime loans account for just $56 billion (5%) of the total mortgage market. Right now, loans are of higher quality than they have been since before the last crash.Â   Credit scores have increased. Over the last 15 years, FICO scores have been steadily rising. In 2009, the average credit score for borrowers seeking a loan was 686. In 2001, it dropped down to between 490 and 510. Since then, though, weâve seen significant improvements.Â   Lending is far more strict. CoreLogicâs Housing Credit Index reports that loans originated in 2016 were of higher quality than any filed in the last 15 years. Tightened lending standards have reduced the impact of fix-and-flip investors. Currently, lenders only finance 55% of home value in the âflipâ market. This is a major shift from the 80% or more banks lent out during the subprime crisis.Â   The number of homes sold right now is 20% below the pre-crash peak. Right now, thereâs less than two monthsâ worth of available inventory in Orange County.Â   Young people are having to save more money due to the past recession. As a result of this, homebuyers are submitting larger down payments in recent times, which provides an additional level of security in their real estate investment.Â   Total home equity is still significantly lower than in 2006. Instead of an explosion of home values, recent growth has been steady. There was $85 billion in equity in 2006, and today there is about $14 billion.Â   Home prices today make sense if you factor in inflation. Between 2012 and 2017, home prices have risen 6.5% per year on average, and surpassed their 2006 peak as a result. However, these increased prices actually indicate an adjustment for the 11 years of inflation weâve seen.  Home builders are focusing on high-end properties. This is likely due to changes in demand, but the question of whether demand is stronger today than in the past is one no one can definitively answer.Â The bottom line is this: No one has a crystal ball, but looking to recent market data and forming an educated perspective based on that information can help you gain a general sense of where things may be headed.Â If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

This sum shows sellers how serious you are about purchasing their home, so today letâs discuss a few of the most common, and most crucial, questions people have on this subject:What is an appropriate amount to offer when submitting an earnest money deposit?On average, a good earnest money deposit should be between 1% and 3% of the total purchase price. This will, however, depend on your area.Â âIf a real estate deal proceeds without issue, the earnest deposit will be applied toward your down payment or closing costs.âWhen is the earnest money deposit due?Â As a general rule, earnest money must be submitted within three days from the time you sign the purchase agreement.Â Where does the earnest money deposit go after itâs been submitted?Earnest money deposits will be held by the bank in a third-party escrow account until closing.How do you get the earnest money deposit back?When you sign a purchase agreement, certain contingencies will protect you against losing out on this deposit.

Keys that do not work. If the potential buyer and their agent cannot get in, they may become frustrated by the experience.âIf a room has excessive or poorly arranged furniture, it may appear less spacious than it actually is.â3. Dingy or faded front door. The front door will serve as a buyerâs first impression, so make sure itâs in great shape before they arrive.Â 4. Animals. I love animals, and I think that most people do, too. However, itâs important to clean up after them by eliminating messes, hair, and odor before buyers enter your home.5. Furniture arrangement. If a room has excessive or poorly arranged furniture, it may appear less spacious than it actually is. Buyers will have a very difficult time looking past ineffective staging.Â 6. Junk drawers and packed cabinets. Overly full storage areas will reflect poorly on your home.Â 7. Cluttered countertops.

You can never be too safe, so instead of assuming your carbon monoxide and smoke detectors are working, double-check just to make sure. The summer is a great time to do this.Â 2. Change the filter in your air conditioner every 30 days. Changing them every 30 days will increase your air conditionerâs efficiency and lengthen its lifespan.Â 3. Keep your ceiling fans dust-free. Otherwise, theyâre just swirling dust around inside your house.Â âThese tips will keep your home in tiptop shape over the summer.â4. Use a clothesline instead of your dryer. This will not only help you save energy, but it will also keep your clothes smelling summer-fresh all week long.Â 5. Get your grill on. Clean your grill at the beginning of summer so you can grill all summer long.Â 6. Let the sunlight in. Longer summer days mean longer sunlight, so clean your windows and enjoy the warm, ambient light for as long as you can.Â 7. Check for leaky faucets. Weâre not in a drought anymore, but itâs still a good idea to check that youâre not wasting any water. Leaks can also cause damage to your home that you wonât even notice until later on when itâs much more costly.Â 8. Stop dirt at the door. Keep dirt out of your house by using a coarse doormat on the outside of your entryway and a soft doormat on the inside.If you have any other questions about how to keep your home well-maintained over the summer or you have any other real estate needs, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "Should you trust Zillowâs Zestimate tool? The short answer is no, but today I will explain why.Â A lot of people go to Zillow for real estate information. The website has home evaluations called Zestimates and, while this feature is a good barometer for general information, the truth is that Zestimates cannot account for certain key differences between homes.Â Zestimates do not take home upgrades, for example, into consideration. They also donât factor in what kind of views you have from your home.Â âAll homes are different and Zillowâs Zestimate feature does not account for the differences.âÂ It really takes a professional to go through all of a homeâs features and compare it to what is going on in the market, what has sold, and more importantly, what is going to be on the market - because the market is constantly changing. At the end of the day, what you need is an âexactimateâ which you can only get from a licensed real estate professional such as myself.Â If you want more information about this or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to me by phone, email, or through my website.

			<p>Alexander Yu graduated Magna Cum Laude from Chapman University in Business with an emphasis in real estate. His previous careers involved working with high net worth investment advisory clients and a real estate advisory role with JPMorgan Chase. During his tenure working alongside the wealthy and representing the interests of the Fortune 500 bank, he realized that homeownerâs deserved the same quality of service and insight into the changing real estate market. In his free time, he volunteers and donates his resources to causes including youth services, animal care and homelessness.</p>

<p>He consistently ranks in the top tier of productive agents and prides himself on being a resource and helping others reach their real estate goals. Whether it is a first home or tenth investment property, he is an invaluable asset. For buyers, he provides key market analysis and creates strategies to win offers. For sellers, he provides cutting edge marketing and a global reach to get homes sold for the highest dollar amount in the shortest span of time.</p>
