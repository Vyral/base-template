        "title": "How to Qualify for a VA Loan",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Whether you are a veteran or active duty, the VA loan is a great option for you. In my opinion, the VA loan is the best loan in the country. Iâll break down everything you need to get a VA loan for your home purchase today.First, though, I want to explain the three main benefits of the VA loan:1. The VA loan offers 100% financing, which means there is no down payment involved. There are still closing costs, so talk to your lender and real estate agent. The lender can offer you a credit, and the agent can see if the seller would be willing to help with closing costs.2. Thereâs no mortgage insurance with the VA loan, which saves you between $200 and $400 a month compared to an FHA loan.3. The VA can intercede if you are ever in a situation where you may lose your home. If you have financial problems, the VA can help try to come to an arrangement with your lender so that you can keep your home.That said, there are two sides to eligibility requirements. One is the individual obtaining the loan, and the second is the property itself.The property must be VA-approved. This is usually not an issue for a single-family residence. The appraiser will determine if the property is VA-approved. The VA will not allow you to overpay for a property, so the appraised price does have to line up with the purchase price.âYou can have more than one VA loan, just not on properties in the same county.âIf you are buying a condo or townhome, your lender can help you determine whether that property will be VA-approved.So, what determines if you do or do not qualify for a VA loan? It all comes down to your certificate of eligibility. After we meet with you, we send your DA14 to the VA. The VA then issues a certificate of eligibility that shows how much you qualify for.The amount you qualify for will be very different in San Diego than in Riverside County. A lot of VA clients are moving to the Riverside area. We are able to help you there as well, but the VA rules do change from one county to the other, so keep that in mind.You also need to be employed. If you are active duty, we need your latest LES to determine how much you qualify for.The property must be owner-occupied. You cannot use the VA loan for second homes or investment properties.Since you canât use the VA loan for second homes, many people wonder, âAre you able to have multiple VA loans?â You can, but you canât have two VA loans on two properties in the same county. If you had a VA loan on a property somewhere else and got transferred to San Diego, you can get another VA loan for the San Diego property. We would just have to determine how much entitlement is left.You need a minimum credit score of 580 to qualify for a VA loan. If your score is not quite there, donât worry. We offer free credit counseling for VA clients. We want to help you get to the point where you are able to buy a home.If you are looking to buy a home with a VA loan, just give us a call. We will see what you can qualify for and what your payments will be. Thank you for your service, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "title": "Expert Tips for Refinancing Your Mortgage",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "For the past month, Iâve been meeting with previous clients and doing their yearly loan reviews. When the topic of refinancing comes up, I keep hearing the same things. âRefinancing only means taking money out of your mortgage or your house.âThatâs not necessarily true. When refinancing, you have several options.Â The most common is refinancing an FHA loan into a conventional loan so that you can remove your mortgage insurance.Another reason people refinance is to lower their interest rate. Depending on how much you have on your loan, this could save you thousands and thousands. Itâs always good to try to lower your interest rate by at least 1% if you refinance.âThere are many reasons to refinance.âWhen you refinance, you are able to take money out due to appreciation. Last year, properties in San Diego appreciated by close to 10%, which you can tap into as an owner. Equity is imaginary money until you put it to good use. You can refinance take some of that equity out, and use it to remodel your home to increase your equity even more.Refinancing also means changing the terms of your loan. For example, if you own a home with an adjustable-rate mortgage, your payments are going to jump dramatically at some point if they havenât already. Always switch from an adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate mortgage if you are able to.Finally, you can refinance to shorten the term on your loan and lower your rate. You can switch from a 30-year loan to a 20- or 15-year loan.If you have any questions for me or youâre considering refinancing anytime soon, Iâd love to sit down with you and go over your options. Donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email anytime.",

      "8-questions-you-should-always-ask-your-lender-html": {
        "title": "8 Questions You Should Always Ask Your Lender",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "When buying a home, there are a few questions that you should make sure to ask your lender.1. What is my interest rate? This is important because the interest rate determines what the principal and interest portion of your mortgage payment will be. Make sure that you discuss interest rates up front so that you know what your payment will be at the end of escrow. If they donât disclose the rate right away, you may end up with a higher payment than you thought you were going to get.2. What is my monthly mortgage payment? Your mortgage payment includes the principal, interest rate, taxes, and insurance (PITI). Some lenders may just tell you the principal and interest payment, but you need to know the total payment. In San Diego, property tax rates are around 1.25%, so take that into consideration, as well as insurance payments.3. Is my interest rate fixed or adjustable? If you have a fixed interest rate, your payment will be the same for the term of the loan. Adjustable rate mortgages got a lot of people in trouble in 2007 because the rates would change and their mortgage payments would go up. In order to have a consistent mortgage payment, get a fixed rate.4. What fees are involved in the transaction? Whether you are buying a home or refinancing a home, you should ask if the transaction involves any points being charged to you. Some lenders charge 1% of the loan amount. If you are buying a $400,000 home and they charge you 1% up front, then you are paying $4,000 just to do the loan. If you are buying a house, those fees are included in your closing costs.âAdjustable-rate mortgages got a lot of people in trouble in 2007.â5. Does the loan have a prepayment penalty? You will be stuck with that loan for however long the penalty term is. The prepayment penalty can be between 3% to 5%. If you buy a $300,000 property and your mortgage has a prepayment penalty, that will cost you between $9,000 to $15,000 to get out of that loan. Make sure you donât have any prepayment penalties.6. What is the minimum required down payment? The down payment amount is dictated by what type of loan you get. Conventional loans require 5% to 20%. FHA loans have a minimum requirement of 3.5%. Itâs important that you go into the transaction knowing how much of a down payment you will need.7. Does the loan have private mortgage insurance? This is an additional payment on top of PITI. Call me if you have any more questions about private mortgage insurance. Itâs a bit complicated, and Iâll be able to go more in-depth about this on the phone.8. Do you have any other products that offer a lower interest rate? Loans are not one size fits all. There are a number of different options available. See what your options are and if you can get a lower mortgage payment.I hope you found this information helpful. If you have any other questions about buying a home or refinancing, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

        "content": "How does the recent interest rate increase affect you? There are a few ways you need to be mindful of.First, you need to know that when the Federal Reserve moves interest rates, what theyâre actually doing is moving the federal funds rate. The federal funds rate is the rate at which banks lend money to each other.The first way this affects you is through credit cards. Most credit cards have variable interest rates, so as the Fed moves the federal funds rate (or prime rate), more of your monthly payment goes toward interest instead of your principal. Basically, youâre paying more for interest, and it will take you longer to pay off your credit card.Rising interest rates also affect student loans. If you got your student loans before 1996, then those student loans have a variable interest rate. As the prime rate increases, your student loan payment will increase as well. The only time rising interest rates donât affect you is when you have fixed interest rates.Rising interest rates make car payments more expensive as well. If you currently own a car and you have an adjustable rate, your payment will be higher this coming month.âThe only time rising interest rates donât affect you is when you have fixed interest rates.âRising interest rates impact your mortgage payment too. You might say, âWell, I have a fixed interest rate, so I have nothing to worry about.â You have nothing to worry about now during your fixed period, but what happens when you want to refinance, take some cash out to make some improvements, or get a line of credit? Your payment will be higher because youâre subject to that higher interest rate. Even with a fixed rate, youâll be affected if you decide to refinance or change your terms.The same applies to people with adjustable-rate mortgages, which is why theyâre so dangerous. You have a small payment now while interest rates are low, but according to Freddie Mac, rates are expected to rise from 4% to 4.6% at the end of 2018.If youâre in the market to buy a house, rising interest rates means your purchasing power diminishes and your house payments increase. If you want to take advantage of the currently low interest rates to either buy a house or refinance your property, give me a call so we can review your situation and see if itâs conducive for you to do so.If you have any other questions about how rising interest rates might affect you or you have any other real estate needs, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "One question I hear frequently is, âIs right now the best time to buy a house?âWell, Iâd like to let you be the judge of that. Today Iâll provide you with some facts and figures about our market, so that you can get an idea of whatâs really going on. The numbers donât lie.When it comes to the time of year, though, right now is undoubtedly a great time to buy. First of all, thereâs less competition. Most people arenât buying near the holidays, so you have an advantage on the market.Secondly, sellers are worn out. Sellers who listed their property during the summer but havenât sold yet will likely lower their price, if they havenât done so already.Also, because fewer transactions occur at this time of year, you will have the undivided attention of whichever real estate professionals you work with.Finally, this time of year is great to buy because depending on how you buy your property, some closing costs may be tax deductible.âIs right now truly the best time to buy? The answer is yes.âSo, now that weâve established that this time of year is the best time to buy in general, what about right now, specifically? Is this moment in time truly the best time to buy? The answer is yes.Currently, you could get a 30-year mortgage at an interest rate at 3.5% for a monthly payment of approximately $1,475.35. But this wonât last. Interest rates are going to rise. While your interest rate may not impact your monthly payment much, a higher interest rate would absolutely mean a lower loan amount.The difference between a loan you obtain now versus one you get later could be tens of thousands of dollars. So, why wait?If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "There are two major changes that will take place in the home lending industry in 2018.The first is an increase in lending limits, both locally and nationwide. Here in San Diego, the lending limit will increase to $679,500. In Riverside, the lending limit is increasing $453,100. This affects conventional conforming loans, FHA loans, and VA loans. This means youâll be able to buy a bigger, more expensive house in 2018 than you were this year.The second change is the introduction of new lending programs. Today, Iâll list three of those programs.The first is the Bank Statement Program, which is designed for individuals who are self-employed. Instead of having to show two yearsâ worth of taxes, we take the average of all of your deposits for the past 24 months to calculate your purchasing power.âYouâll be able to buy a bigger, more expensive house in 2018 than you were in 2017.âThe second is the 90%, one loan, no mortgage insurance program. This loan is perfect if you bought a house last year or two years ago and are waiting for the property to increase 20% in order to remove the mortgage insurance. With this loan, thereâs no need to wait that long. If your property has appreciated as much as 10%, we can refinance your loan, switch it from an FHA loan to a conventional loan, lower your interest rate, and remove your mortgage insurance. Youâll save hundreds of dollars each month!The last program is the Fresh Start Program, which is for those who filed for bankruptcy or had a short or a foreclosure. With this program, you donât have to wait as long as seven years to buy a house again.If you have any questions about these changes or youâre looking to buy or refinance a home, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "People always ask me why someone should refinance their home. To answer that question, Iâve got a few smart reasons why refinancing your home loan could be a good option for you.  To lower the term. You could go from a 30-year mortgage to a 20- or even 15-year mortgage. Refinancing to a shorter term will help lower your interest rate and also the amount youâre paying for your home.  To lower your rate. If you had a high interest rate when you purchased your home, now is the time to refinance. Whether itâs going from a 5.5% rate to a 4.5% rate, or even from a 4.5% rate to a 3.5% rate, youâll be able to shorten your term and save hundreds every month. âRefinancing could lower your rate and help you save money.â  To take cash out. If youâve owned your property for a couple of years and have accumulated equity, you can take some of that equity out and reinvest it into your home. You could also use it to pay off some debt.  To move to a conventional loan. This is probably the most common reason people refinance. Changing from an FHA loan to a conventional loan, for example, could allow you to get rid of your mortgage insurance.If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want to know if refinancing is right for you, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "What are the steps you must take when buying a home?Whether youâre a first-time homebuyer, youâre buying your second home, or youâre looking for an investment property, the first step is to get pre-qualified. Everybody typically does the fun stuff like look at properties online, but getting pre-qualified is the first step you must take.There are three main factors that can affect your qualification.The first is your credit. Most programs require you to have at least a 580 FICO score to qualify.The second factor is your income. You need to be employed for at least two years in the same industry. Not the same jobâthe same industry. For example, if you work in construction and switch companies but you continue working in construction, thatâs perfectly fine. If you go from working construction to working at a bank, the clock gets set back two years. Your income determines your debt-to-income ratio, and that determines how much youâll be able to qualify for.âGetting pre-qualified is easier than you think.âThe third factor is the down payment. Different programs require different down payment amounts. With the new government down payment assistance programs, you can put as little as 0% down. There are also FHA programs for first-time homebuyers and conventional programs that offer 5%, 10%, or 30% down.Once you complete the pre-qualification step, then you can start looking at properties and interviewing agents. Getting pre-qualified is easier than you think. It can be done either over the phone or in-person.

The effect can actually be between 20 to 60 points, so make sure you are always punctual with your paymentsâAlways keep your credit card balance 30% below your limit.â2. The length of your credit history. The longer you have an account open, the more points youâll rack up over that time. As a side note, if you want to pay off an account and credit card, never cancel that account. If you do, all of the credit history will disappear and cause your score to go down.3.

        "category": "",
        "content": "For most homebuyers, their mortgage is their biggest monthly expense. However, most owners do little to no preparation, negotiation, or shopping in order to get the best deal possible. Here are three of the biggest mortgage mistakes you can make and how to avoid them:1. Believing the advertised rates are what youâll actually pay. Unless you have near-perfect credit, most advertised rates are out of your league. To get boasting rights on a good rate, you have to pay part of a point, or even a full point. A âpointâ in the mortgage world is roughly 1% of your loan amount.2. Not comparing lenders. Just like everybody knows a real estate agent, everybody knows a loan officer or mortgage banker. However, they arenât the same thing. A loan officer works for the bank and can only offer packages the bank puts together. A mortgage broker pre-qualifies you like a loan officer, but can shop around to get the best deals for you. Just like you wouldnât go to buy a car without visiting a few different dealerships, you shouldnât get a mortgage after talking to just one lender. âMost advertised rates are not what they appear.â3. Not paying attention to the terms. The true cost of the loan lies in the APR, which includes various fees from the lender. There are so many ways lenders can inch those up, including with loan origination or processing fees that can vary widely. Make sure you know what youâre going to be paying before you sign on the dotted line.If you have any questions for me or want any more tips about how to get the best possible rate and terms for your mortgage, give me a call or send me an email.
