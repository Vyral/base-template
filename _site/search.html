        "title": "What You Need to Know About Down Payment Assistance Programs",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Down payment assistance programs are an invaluable tool in helping some homebuyers with their down payment. With that in mind, I’ve invited Alejandro Juarez of AMEC Home Loans to answer a few questions you may have about these programs.What’s important to understand about down payment assistance programs?Down payment assistance programs allow you to obtain a mortgage loan and skip the down payment aspect of it. A lot of times, you’ll hear down payment assistance loans get referred to as “zero down” loans because lenders take care of the down payment and build it into the loan itself. There is a lot of flexibility with down payment assistance loans, and you can receive up to 5% worth of financial assistance from them. If you have a $200,000 loan, for instance, you can get $10,000 worth of assistance, which can cover both the down payment and the closing costs. What are the requirements of qualifying for a down payment assistance loan?Credit is a very important thing to keep in mind in terms of qualifying for a down payment assistance loan because they don’t have the flexibility of a normal loan. You need a credit score of at least 620, and you’ll need to fit certain income requirements. In the Austin metroplex and the greater central Texas area, your annual income can’t exceed $93,000. The most important thing you need to think about in terms of qualifying for one of these loans is whether it fits your needs. A normal loan and a down payment assistance loan look very different, so you’ll need to compare how each option benefits you. Interest rates are generally higher with down payment assistance programs, so make sure the assistance you’re getting is worth the higher interest rate. According to Alejandro, most clients are happy with this tradeoff because it allows them to get into their very own home, and they always have the option to refinance into a normal loan later on. “Think about whether a down payment assistance program really fits your needs before you decide to apply for one.”Are there any prepayment penalties attached to these programs? Yes. Some down payment assistance programs have what’s called a “recapture tax.” If, for example, you get an MCC credit and it goes toward your taxes and you sell your home within six months, you may have to repay the tax amount you saved with that program. Of the down payment assistance programs that don’t have this tax, Alejandro favors the T-Shack loan the most. This loan allows you to provide that assistance in the form of a grant. As long as you live in the home for six months and don’t refinance, you don’t have to pay the amount back. There are also other loan programs that aren’t grants. Rather, they’re loans attached to the larger mortgage loan, and eventually they will have to be paid back. They’re usually 0% interest loans, but they still get attached to the total balance. What other ways can you take advantage of these programs?You can use these programs to save money when you buy a house, as long as you’re buying the house as a primary residence. I brought a client to Alejandro not too long ago who didn’t necessarily need help with his down payment, but he was able to take advantage of the program anyway. His income was just below the limit for the county he was purchasing in and he had a huge amount of savings. Because of this, he was able to use the funds from the program and keep his out-of-pocket savings.Down payment assistance programs are always changing, so if you’re interested in using one or you have any other questions about them, you can call Alejandro at (512) 710-9456 or email him at &#097;&#108;&#101;&#106;&#097;&#110;&#100;&#114;&#111;&#046;&#106;&#117;&#097;&#114;&#101;&#122;&#064;&#097;&#109;&#101;&#099;&#105;&#110;&#099;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;.As always, if you have any other questions or real estate needs, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’d be glad to help you.",

We spoke about the reasons he decided to start working with a broker after years of independent success, the significance of video marketing, and the importance of balancing your work life and home life.Kyle told us that the biggest reason for the change was his desire to get off the hamster wheel where you have to continually run or you do not earn income. With a brokerage, he was able to get more support and tools as well as revenue shares for not only him but his entire team. His clients even benefited from the transparency his new brokerage, eXp Realty, offers.To learn more about Kyle and why he thinks video marketing and balance are so crucial, watch my latest video.",

Specifically, the ordinance states that “A CO detector must be installed near a bedroom if there’s anything in your home that uses fuel or gas, as well as inside the bedroom, if the room has or connects to a room that has fuel or gas.”The National Association of Fire Protection takes it a step further by recommending that you install your CO detector in a central location outside each sleeping area and on each level of the home.“This ordinance is about you and your family’s safety.”If you’re getting your home ready for sale and you don’t have a CO detector installed, that will come up on an inspection report once you get an offer.

You can learn more about the process of how to do that in this video that I recently did on the topic.“This hot market makes it an incredible time to sell.”For buyers out there, we still have a hot market where we’re seeing multiple offers. I’m working with several buyers right now who are having a hard time finding properties to meet their needs. Hopefully, more sellers will list their homes as we move into the spring. If you’re buying, you need to have all your ducks in a row and be ready to make an offer when you find the property that suits your needs. There will probably be several other buyers competing for the home as well.

Search all homes for saleThe good news is, many homebuyers are looking for a pet-friendly home.Two out of three of us have a pet, and 61% of pet owners say they have trouble finding a home that is a good match for their pet.In fact, a recent survey estimates that 31% of animal owners frequently don’t put in an offer because a home would not suit their pet.This means that if your home is a good match for a pet, it will be attractive to a large pool of dedicated animal owners.On the other hand, 67% of Realtors also estimate that actually having a pet in your home can make it harder for you to sell.So what can you do? Here are three things I typically recommend:1. Repair any damageFloors, walls, doors, the yard — these are some typical areas that pets love to chew, scratch, and dig up.Repairing this damage is an investment that will pay for itself many times over in terms of a higher selling price.“PET OWNERS ARE LESS SENSITIVE TO ODORS IN THEIR HOME THAN PROSPECTIVE BUYERS ARE.”2. Get a professional to remove pet odorsMany pet owners are less sensitive to odors in their home than prospective buyers will be.That’s why you should hire a professional cleaning crew to clean any carpets, rugs, or upholstery that have absorbed pet odors.Once you’re done with the cleaning, ask a friend or your Realtor for a sniff assessment to make sure the job is really complete.3. Take your pet out during showingsSome people are afraid of animals. Others are allergic. And regardless of the time, money, and effort you’ve put in to clean and repair your home, many buyers will be prejudiced by knowing that a pet currently lives there.That’s why I recommend taking your pet out during showings and also removing any pet objects such as toys, food bowls, or scratching posts.By following these three simple guidelines, you will be able to sell your home for top dollar, whether the buyer is a pet owner or not.And in case you have any questions or concerns about preparing your home for a sale, give me a call.

Get a FREE home value reportWant to buy an Austin Home? Search all homes for saleIn case you haven’t heard, a recent lawsuit was filed against Zillow by an Illinois homeowner and it’s causing ripples in the real estate industry. How does this affect you?First, let me start by saying I’m not here to hate on Zillow like so many other agents do. I actually love Zillow, and many of the clients I have today first got in contact with me after reading my reviews on Zillow. I think they do a great job of mapping out neighborhoods and providing information about certain areas, school districts, etc.Now, the homeowner in this lawsuit claims her home is valued at $626,000, but Zillow values it at $562,000, which is a $64,000 difference. This woman feels that the typical buyer will feel that her home is worth less because of its Zestimate. Zillow responded by saying that a Zestimate is just a starting point to determine value, and it’s not an official appraisal.Even well-known real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran of ABC’s “Shark Tank” chimed in on the matter on “Good Morning America,” which you can watch here.When you start your online home search, Zillow is a website you’ll likely land on because they do a great job capturing nearly 64% of all real estate-related web traffic. Is it a good start for determining the value of your home, though?Barbara Corcoran says that it’s a starting point, but not a reliable starting point, which I agree with.“ZILLOW IS A STARTING POINT FOR HOME VALUE, BUT NOT A RELIABLE STARTING POINT.”You may not know this, but Zillow admits that its fault factor is around 5.6%. That means that less than half of the values in a given area are less than that fault factor percentage and half are even further off. To put that into perspective, on a $250,000 house, that’s a $14,000 difference one way or the other.In Texas, Zillow doesn’t even offer a percentage of error because we’re a non-disclosure state, meaning our sales prices aren’t publicly disclosed at closing. You need to hire a professional to get that information.The good news is that Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff is opening up their platform and offering a $1 million prize to any person or team who can improve their algorithm. I encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity if you think you can do so. In the meantime, if you really want to know the value of your home, call me.

        "content": "How are home inspections and appraisals different? Melanie Taliaferro from SWBC Mortgage joins me to explain.Want to sell your Austin Home? Get a FREE home value reportWant to buy an Austin Home? Search all homes for saleWhat is the difference between an appraisal and an inspection? Melanie Taliaferro from SWBC Mortgage joins me today to explain this a little more fully.When you make an offer on a house, there is something called the ‘option period.’ During that time, you have the opportunity to do your due diligence as a buyer. You should always hire a licensed home inspector to come in and do an inspection on the property.A licensed home inspector will check everything from the roof to the foundation. If there is a major issue with your air conditioner, roof, or any other system in the house, then the home inspector may recommend that you get a specialist’s opinion. The inspector will also give you a 50-page report of everything they found in the home.Some people use the terms ‘inspection’ and ‘appraisal’ interchangeably, which makes things confusing. However, the appraisal is very different from the home inspection. After you order the home inspection and decide you want to move forward with the purchase, the lender will require you to order an appraisal. This happens after the option period because you have completed your due diligence and decided that you want to buy the home.“THE LENDER WILL ORDER THE APPRAISAL AFTER THE OPTION PERIOD HAS ENDED.”During the appraisal, a licensed appraiser will come out to inspect the property. They won’t do a true, detailed inspection like the home inspector did. The appraiser is just there to provide an opinion of the value of the property.The appraiser will pull comparable sales of similar homes within a half-mile radius from the last six months to see if the purchase price matches the market value of the home. The appraiser looks for similar-sized homes with similar amenities in order to make that decision. The appraiser will then tell the lender whether or not the market value of the home matches the purchase price you and the seller have already agreed upon.The appraiser may also recommend certain repairs. If something comes up in the appraisal affecting the safety or livability of the property, then the appraisal will be subject to repairs.Ultimately, although appraisals and inspections are very similar, the appraisal is the biggest piece of our property approval process. The main difference is that the inspection is part of the buyer’s due diligence while the appraisal has more to do with the lending side, getting a loan, and making sure that the investment is worth its value.If you have any questions about appraisals or the lending side of buying a home, you can reach Melanie at 512-400-0342 or at Melanie@TheTaliaFerroTeam.com.

Search all homes for saleToday I’m joined by Melanie Taliaferro from SWBC mortgage to answer the question, “What is the difference between being pre-approved and pre-qualified?”People use the terms pre-approved and pre-qualified interchangeably when it comes to mortgages, but there is definitely a difference.A pre-qualification can be as little as a verbal conversation with a borrower in which the lender asks about income and credit then tells the borrower based on their answers that they are pre-qualified for a home loan. That confirmation can be verbal or in writing, and the strength of a pre-qualification can range.A true pre-approval means that a lender has not only gotten a written loan application, but has also pulled your credit report and evaluated your income and assets to get an overview of your whole financial picture before issuing a pre-approval letter. Having a pre-approval letter, then, will make your offer much stronger and put you in a position to beat out someone who might have only been pre-qualified.“A PRE-APPROVAL LETTER WILL ALWAYS MAKE YOUR OFFER STRONGER.”If you have any questions for Melanie, you can give her a call at 512-825-1196.

        "content": "Has your mortgage payment gone up recently? If you don’t know why, this might be the reasonWant to sell your Austin Home? Get a FREE home value reportWant to buy an Austin Home? Search all homes for saleAre you curious why your mortgage payment is going up this time of year? Today I’m joined by Melanie Taliaferro to help shed some light on this subject.According to her, it’s important to remember that property taxes change every year, especially in the Austin area with values increasing as they are. That amount gets paid at the end of each year. When it’s paid out, there may or may not be enough money in your escrow account to cover it. Once it is paid, the mortgage company may realize there’s not enough money to pay the bill. They then have to increase the monthly payment in order to cover the deficit.Because you just paid taxes for a property you lived in the whole year, there’s a shortage that needs to be covered in addition to what has to be planned for the following year. That can almost result a double increase for some people. The best thing you can do is take your most recent mortgage statement and send it to a mortgage professional so they can help you decode it.“KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON YOUR MONTHLY MORTGAGE STATEMENT.”Also, pay special attention to your county value assessment, which you’ll typically receive in April or May. That will tell you what your projected taxable value on your property is for that year. That’s something a mortgage professional can look at and adjust your payment proactively if it needs to be increased.This can be a frustrating topic, so if you have any more concerns, you can reach Melanie by phone at (512) 400-0342 or email her at Melanie@thetaliaferroteam.com.If you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to me.

I have four reasons to share with you today.Want to sell your Austin Home? Get a FREE home value reportWant to buy an Austin Home? Search all homes for saleAre the holidays a good time to sell your house? Absolutely. Let me give you a few reasons why:      Interest rates are still low. This means there are still many buyers out shopping for homes.        There are fewer homes on the market this time of year than there are during the peak season. Right now, sellers can beat a wave of competition that will hit the market in the springtime. With so few homes on the market right now, you can beat that competition.  “HOMES DECORATED FOR THE HOLIDAYS SHOW BETTER.”      Homes decorated for the holidays show better. Christmas decorations and lights give a home that cozy feel, and they show better because of it.        Buyers are more serious. You may have fewer buyers come to your home overall, but the buyers who do come through will be much more serious about buying. They usually want to get a deal done before Christmas or before the new year.  Here in Austin, the market is strong, so it’s still an ideal time to get your home on the market.

Their main focus is to make the cleaning process as stress-free for the customer as possible, which is why Shiloh will personally come out to properties and deliver the customer an estimate before actually starting the cleaning process.“MENTION THIS VIDEO AND YOU’LL RECEIVE 25% OFF YOUR FIRST CLEANING!”What tips does Shiloh have for floor upkeep during the winter season? His advice for home buyers who have recently purchased a new construction home is to make sure all of the grout around your tiles and hard surfaces is sealed before the holiday season.The same goes for carpeting. One of the things that FloorScapes Austin does that many other floor care companies don’t do is scotch guard your carpet with carpet protectant. With all of the snow and foot traffic of the holiday season, a carpet that is not scotch guarded can get grungy very quickly. A scotchguarded carpet can be cleaned much easier with regular vacuuming.For all of my clients who have recently bought a home with our team, Shiloh has a special for you. Reach out to him on his personal cell phone number at 817-729-5653, mention this video, and you’ll get 25% off your first FloorScapes Austin service.If you have any other questions about buying or selling real estate in the Austin area, feel free to give me a call or send me an email anytime.

        "content": "When I’m sitting down with a client helping them write an offer on a home in a multiple offer situation, they always ask me the same question: “Kurt, how much should I offer?”In order to know what a fair price is, you’ll need to sit down with your own agent and look at the comparable home sales. Depending on the neighborhood in question, you may want to look back as far as six to 12 months. Try to compare properties in an “apples to apples” sense. For example, you don’t want to be comparing two-story homes with single-story homes, as single-story homes typically have a higher average price per square foot.“COMPARE PROPERTIES IN AN “APPLES TO APPLES” SENSE.”From there, your agent should be able to guide you through the stats to figure out what a fair, competitive price would be. It’s important to remember, though, that sometimes numbers on paper don’t mean a whole lot. Homes tend to speak to people’s emotions above all else. It wouldn’t hurt to formulate a strategy to appeal to these emotions, too, so you can win the house you want.By the way, our Anew Real Estate Crew is hiring! We’re currently looking for part-time administrative help and, as always, some fantastic buyer’s agents. If you or anyone you know would be interested, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.If you have any more questions about multiple offer situations or real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to helping you in any way I can.",

With the summer season over, home builders are looking to sell off inventory.Want to sell your Austin Home? Get a FREE home value reportWant to buy an Austin Home? Search all homes for saleIt’s been a very busy summer in our market and there are a lot of people moving to the Austin metro area.In areas like Cedar Park and Williamson County, we’re seeing a massive amount of new construction happening as well. Many of the builders are offering fantastic incentives to purchase their homes, so if you’ve ever thought about buying a brand-new home, now is the time.The back-to-school selling season is over, so builders really want to get the inventory that didn’t sell during that time off the books as the end of the year approaches.In our market, we’ve seen average home sale volume go down for the second straight month, according to the Austin Board of Realtors. However, the average median sales price continues to climb. Across the Austin metro, the median sales price is $285,000, with the median price in Williamson right around $265,000.“IF YOU’VE EVER THOUGHT ABOUT BUYING NEW CONSTRUCTION, NOW IS THE TIME.”As we end the year, I expect to see the market soften up just a little bit. Interest rates are still very low, so we’re still going to see a lot of people moving here and buying a home, and at the same time, it looks like inventory is building.If you have more questions about the local market or you’re interested in new construction homes, give me a call or send me an email.

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "One question I get asked all the time is, “How much money do I need as a down payment if I’m going to buy a home?” Basically, you have two different options:The first is to go online and check. The Internet features an array of different websites that function as mortgage calculators. One of my favorites is SmartAssets.com, where you can scroll through the site quickly and let them know what kind of loan you’re looking to apply for and it will give you a quick approximation of how much money you need to put down.“There are many different loans out there.”For a more accurate estimate, your second option is getting in touch with a mortgage professional. There are many different loans out there. Depending on your financial situation and your credit, it might be difficult to ascertain which one works best for you. Additionally, it’s important to keep closing costs in mind, as they will be a part of your initial down payment when buying a home.If you have any further questions about down payments or real estate in general, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email.
