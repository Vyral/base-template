        "content": "If you are a veteran of the armed forces, youâre active duty personnel, youâre a part of the National Guard, or youâre military reserve, you can apply for a VA loan to buy a home.There are five great advantages that come with this particular loan:1) You donât need a down payment. Most people consider a down payment a huge hurdle to homeownership because it sometimes requires you to put up to 20% of your overall loan amount down. With a VA loan, you get to bypass that hurdle.2) It has more lenient requirements. For example, most people need a credit score of around 650 or 700. With a VA loan, you only need to have a credit score of 620 or above.âThere are several great reasons to apply for a VA loan if you qualify.â3) You donât need mortgage insurance. The only thing they require is an upfront funding fee, but that can be rolled into your payments, and itâs tax deductible.4) It limits your closing costs.5) It provides appraisal assistance. They can notify your agent and give you 48 hours to provide any additional information you might need to boost the appraisal value.At the end of the day, the VA loan is our societyâs way of saying thank you to all the men and women who have served our country.If you have any more questions about how a VA loan can benefit you or you have any other real estate needs, donât hesitate to reach out to us. Weâd be glad to help you.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Although you are not required to get a pre-listing inspection on your home before it hits the market, there are a few advantages of doing so.First of all, a pre-listing inspection will uncover any issues with your house before it goes up for sale. This saves you a lot of time because contracts often depend on whether or not you can repair certain items in your home.âA pre-listing inspection will give you more credibility with future buyers.âGetting the inspection in advance gives you a little more time to repair those things in your home and save you money in the long run. By making repairs before the home hits the market, you wonât have to worry about buyers reducing their offer price after they order an inspection on your home.Finally, a pre-listing inspection can boost your marketability. People want transparency. They want to know whatâs wrong with the house up front. Even if you donât have the money to fix everything before you list your home, you will be able to say, âWe know that there are some issues with the house, and those issues were taken into account when we created the listing price.â That will give you a lot more credibility with future homebuyers.If you have any other questions about pre-listing inspections or selling your home, just give us a call or send us an email.

Itâs a common belief that couldnât be more wrong.A lot of people think that the best time to sell their home is in the spring or summer, and while that may be true, itâs also true that you can sell your home just as well in the fall. Letâs talk about why selling in the fall can work for you.1.) Depending on when you closeâfor example, if you close before December 31âthereâs a chance you could get some awesome tax breaks and write-offs for the next year.2.) Itâs a wonderful idea that you could be in a brand-new home for the holidays. Thereâs nothing more special than spending the holidays in the home that youâre going to live in and build memories in with your family.âThereâs nothing more special than spending the holidays in the home that youâre going to live in and build memories in with your family.â3.) It might be the right time to get just the right price for your property because there is less competition on the market during the fall season. Your home could definitely stand out in the crowd.4.) Itâs a great time to fix up your home to sell because there are awesome holiday sales everywhere you look, Black Friday prominent among them. Itâs an opportune time to fix up any areas that youâve been wanting to tweak a little bit so that it would be even more of a great buy for someone whoâs interested.If you have any questions about how to sell your home this fall, feel free to contact our group at any time. One of our agents would be happy to call you and set up a personalized home-selling plan just for you. We look forward to hearing from you!",

Try to light up your yard so that people can safely walk from the sidewalk to your front door and back.âDonât forget your own costume!â3. Try to hide valuables from your front porch or yard.Â Weâre not worried about a robbery. This is simply about preventing any accidental damage. Someone might knock into an important valuable on the porch and, suddenly, itâs broken. Remove anything of great value until Halloween is over.4. Stock up on candy. We also suggest getting candy for kids with allergies, and maybe even some sugar-free candy thatâs friendly to everyone, no matter what kind of candy they can have.5. Donât forget a costume! Dressing in costume just helps seal the whole experience when you open the door decked out in your own character.Whether you are preparing for Halloween or going to fall festivals this October, we hope you enjoy the season.As always, if you have any real estate questions, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!",

        "content": "There are a lot of things to think about when staging your home for sale. Today, Iâve got a few staging tips that can help you sell for top dollar.First of all, you need to think about curb appeal. How does the front of your home look? A few changes here and there can really set your home apart. Consider a welcome mat to make buyers feel more at home as they enter your property.Also, make sure that your yard is clean and well-kept, and that all of your exterior lights are in working order.âThe goal is to showcase your homeâs potential.âAnother tip to consider is creating an inviting ambience in your home. This means you should think about smell, sound, and taste as well as sight. You can engage buyers beyond the visual level by leaving out cookies, playing soft, instrumental music, and having an air freshener plug-in in each room.Next, embrace floor space to make rooms appear as large as possible. Moving furniture away from the centers of rooms, and adding mirrors to smaller spaces can really open things up.Donât forget to embrace any unusual or quirky parts of your property. Why not turn a smaller space into a reading nook? The goal is to showcase your homeâs potential.Finally, play up the lifestyle surrounding your home. With our area being so near the beach, we like to play up this surf and sand lifestyle by adding beach decor to a home.If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want to know how we can offer you a professional consultation with a home stager, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.",

As a homeowner, it can be enticing to get into the spirit of things and do something like let your home overflow with pumpkins, but if youâre selling your home this fall, there are certain points you need to remember.First, consider your curb appeal. Make sure your yard is free of leaves. When prospective buyers view your home, they want to see it in the best shape possible. Keep your fall decor to a minimum and donât overdo anything because everyone has different tastes and styles.Second, avoid any gory decorations. Not everyone celebrates Halloween with ghosts, goblins, blood, and gore. While you may think itâs fun to have zombies hanging from tree limbs, you donât want to upset or scare any buyers when theyâre looking at your house.âIf you follow these tips, we guarantee your home will be a top contender to sell this fall.âThird, let in a lot of natural light. Our days are getting shorter, so clean your windows, pull back the shades, and do everything you can to let natural light in.Lastly, make your space inviting. Consider placing a few plush, fall-themed pillows on the couch or a few throws on the bed. You might even consider making some homemade cookies and leaving them on the counter for buyers to see when they walk through the home.If you follow these tips, we guarantee your home will be a top contender to sell this fall.

        "category": "",
        "content": "When youâre considering buying a home, itâs important to remember that there are many important factors to consider beyond the house itself.Today, I want to bring you five specific essentials to think about when buying a home.1. Contained pool fun. Pools are a great addition to a home and can be a huge draw, especially during the heat of summer. But as fun as pools are, they also come with a lot of safety requirements, some of which could be specific to your area. Additionally, consider whether youâll be able to control who enters the pool. If the pool doesnât already have features like locks or safety gates, how much money will you need to spend to get them installed?2. Backyard fire zones. Barbeques or fire pits are great for entertaining your family and guests alike. But, once again, safety is important. When it comes to fire zones, you should be especially careful of placement. Fire zones shouldnât be placed near play areas. Remember to make that if you have small children or grandchildren, your yard and its features are being kept kid-friendly.âBy talking to a Realtor who knows the area, you can be sure the home you choose will be safe.â3. Aging danger zones. A deck or patio may be beautiful for a time, but without proper upkeep these features can become extremely run down over time. On these kinds of features be sure to look out for wood rot and any other aging defects.4. Landscaping liability.Â As gorgeous as trees can be as a part of a homeâs landscaping, they can be dangerous and costly to remove. Make sure that any trees in your yard are removed promptly and correctly if they die.5. Curbing danger.Â As a potential buyer, you may only visit a given home at a time of day when traffic is at a minimum. At other points of the day, there could be much more noise and much more danger. By talking to a Realtor who knows the area, you can be sure that you are choosing a home that is safe for you and your family.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "When selling your home, keep these three things that buyers look for in mind:1. Curb appeal: Buyers should be impressed from the moment they pull up to the curb. Sweep the driveway and entryway, power-wash the exterior, and plant fresh flowers outside the home. You want them to be excited as soon as they step out of the car.âEven if your home has a lot of space, you want to declutter as much as possible.â2. Space: Get rid of all the clutter in your home even if you have a lot of space; excess clutter is one of the biggest turnoffs for buyers. You could rent a storage unit at a minimal cost. For a better return on your final sale price, get rid of all the knicknacks and make sure all countertop and floor space is available.3. Updates: You donât need to replace the whole kitchen, but try to upgrade things that are outdated. That could be the countertops, appliances, or hardware like the faucet and cabinet pulls.Weâll be back soon with more tips, but if you have any questions in the meantime, you can always call or email us.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Weâre back with part two of our conversation about the common mistakes home sellers make and how you can avoid them. To catch up, you can watch part one here.As you might recall us mentioning previously, when picking your agent itâs important to make sure they answer the phone when you call. Itâs also important that they know your market and have done business in it. Verifying this information can be done easily by reading their testimonials on Trulia and Zillow. That will tell you whether theyâre a good agent.When putting your home on the market, make sure it stays showroom-ready, meaning you can show the house at any time. In order to sell your house, you must make it available for buyers to see it. If they canât see it, theyâll move on and purchase something else. 80% of all Realtors wonât reschedule an appointment thatâs been canceled. We donât want to make it convenient for youâwe want to make it convenient for the purchaser to come and look at your house.Another point I want to reiterate from our previous video is not to be emotional with your house during its sale. Divorce yourself from the house as soon as you put it on the market. Itâs no longer your property, so if a buyer comes in and says theyâre going to repaint it, donât get upset.â80% of all Realtors wonât reschedule an appointment thatâs been canceled.âIf you find something in the house that needs to be fixed, fix it. If the buyer finds it, it will cost four to seven times more money for you to fix it than if you wouldâve found it yourself. When youâre tidying up, you also want to paint the front door. The front door gives the first impression of your house, and you want a great first impression when buyers show up at that door.Lastly, remember to declutter the house and depersonalize it. Remove any family pictures and store any extra clutter in a storage bin if you have one. If you donât have one, you can always rent one.If you have any questions or youâre thinking about buying or selling a home in our market, donât hesitate to reach out to us. If you send us a question and we use it in one of our videos, you will receive a $25 gift card. We look forward to hearing from you.",

        "content": "Selling a home is a long and complicated process. If you arenât careful, you could be making major mistakes without even knowing it. We wanted to drop by today and talk about some of the most common mistakes we see from sellers in hopes that you donât make them as well.One of the biggest and most common mistakes for home sellers is getting too emotional about the sale. Youâre always going to overvalue your home because of all the memories youâve made in there and how much work youâve put into it. However, overpricing your home can lead to it sitting on the market for much longer than it needs to. You should work with your agent to come up with an appropriate price, which will set your expectations at a level place and remove a lot of frustrations for you and your agent.Another big one is ignoring small flaws throughout the home. Even though you may not have seen or even thought about that little corner of the wall that the dog chewed on, buyers will notice it right away. You want to make the best first impression possible, and taking the little bit of time and money necessary to fix those imperfections will go a long way when it comes time to sell.âExcess clutter really turns buyers off.âExcess clutter is another huge no-no. You want to create a blank slate for buyers with minimal furniture and decorations. Decluttering helps buyers envision themselves and their stuff in your home.Finally, you need to avoid joining ranks with the wrong Realtor. You need someone who is passionate about selling your home, will work hard to get the job done, and have good communication with you throughout the process. If your Realtor isnât answering your calls or texts right away, you might want to look for someone new.If you have any questions for us about selling your home or if you want to know what we can do differently to get you the results you want, give us a call or send us an email.

			<p>My job requires me to run my business on a daily basis, while listing and working with buyers, I also have to inspire and help teach my agents to be the best they can be. I try and tell my agents donât knock it until you tried it. I do have selected hearing, because I do not like excuses, you might as well be preaching to the choir. because I am not listening. I think to be a great Realtor or Team Leader, you must have FUN or make if FUN!! If it is not fun, then you can count me out! I admit that I am not the best teacher in the world, because I do not get it when they do not get it. I try and teach my agents to get 30 to 40% of their business on their own and not depend so heavily on me providing them with leads alone. Because to be successful in this business you must treat it like a job, not a hobby. There are far too many Realtorâs that think they can work when they want too, well I would question how successful they are. You always need a plan of attack, a worth while goal and a purpose of reaching further than you thought you could reach. I do not want to be a baby sitter, I want people who are motivated to achieve their goals and I also believe you cannot motivate someone who has no motivation, you need to have the Fire in the Belly to make it fun, have time off, and be financially successful. Sales people are the Highest paid people in the world if you are good at it, the best sales people make more money than Rock Stars and Actors!</p>
