Frankly, we’re surprised at how well consumers and agents have adapted to an industry that’s gone virtual. We have sellers showing buyers homes via Zoom, Skype, etc., inspectors showing up to houses wearing gloves and hazmat suits, and more. We have a responsibility to protect each other while continuing on with life.We thought there would be a drop in activity, but virtual showings, meetings, open houses, notary signings, etc., have kept opportunities readily available for buyers and sellers.“We’re surprised at how well consumers and agents have adapted to an industry that’s gone virtual.”What do the Pikes Peak MLS numbers say specifically? In the week leading up to the recording of this video, 329 new listings hit the market. Out of all the homes already on the market, 1,057 went under contract, and 1,218 sold.If you’d like to know more about our market or aren’t sure how to navigate the new normal, give us a call and we’d be happy to help. More importantly, if you know someone who’s going through financial hardship and may have to sell their home or is in need of supplies, please reach out to us as well. We have the resources to help, and we’re here to serve our community.From our home to yours, we hope you stay safe and healthy.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Here&rsquo;s the truth behind iBuyers and their automated valuation models.An iBuyer is a real estate investor that often buys the home quickly using cash. They use an AVM, or automated valuation model, popularized in the form of Zillow’s Zestimate. Typically, an iBuyer will purchase the home without ever having seen it.Having someone offer cash for your house sight unseen seems easy, but watch out for scams. There’s a lot of fraud that floats around in the real estate industry, like wire transfer fraud. If you do decide that an iBuyer is the best route for you, make sure you go with a reputable one and close only at a local escrow or title company; never, ever, ever wire your money out somewhere.“The average consumer that takes an offer from these iBuyers takes 13% to 15% less than the value of their home.”The reality of the iBuyer program is that it’s not as sexy as it sounds. According to Forbes, the average consumer that takes an offer from these iBuyers takes 13% to 15% less than the value of their home. That’s massive! These iBuyers will also order an inspection, point out all of the issues they want fixed, and if you refuse, they’ll take even more off of their offer. It’s not a great deal. It’s important to be educated about what really occurs in these transactions.If 13% to 15% less than your home’s value sounds appealing, go for an iBuyer’s offer. Then again, you could go with a trusted team of professionals to represent you. Don’t leave money on the table! Reach out to us by phone or email anytime if you have further questions about iBuyers or are interested in buying or selling soon.",

        "content": "Here are the three things you should never do when buying a home.When it comes to purchasing a home there are three mistakes you should always avoid making during the process if you want to succeed:1. Go on vacation. If you’re going on a vacation to Greece during the process of buying a home it will be very hard to complete the purchase. We can’t do everything on your behalf, and being far away makes coordination difficult. Wait to go on vacation until after you’ve closed on your home if you want to avoid undue stress.2. Don’t pay off any debts. This may sound crazy, but it’s not. If you pay off a debt entirely, that will impact your credit—for better or worse, we don’t know. Consult your loan officer before you pay off anything.3. Don’t finance any large purchases. Be it a new car or furniture for your new home, don’t take out any additional lines of credit.“We can’t do everything on your behalf.”If you’re careful to avoid these mistakes, your home purchase may go off without a hitch.Feel free to reach out to us with any questions you have about the home buying process.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "If you&rsquo;re buying or selling in our Colorado Springs market in 2020, here are three insider tips to keep in mind.As we begin 2020, there are three key points to know about our Colorado Springs market.First, there will be an inventory shortage, which means we’ll see more multiple-offer situations. America’s Space Force is coming to town, and with it, its 15,000 personnel and their families. We don’t know where they’re going to live, but our team is ready to help all of them! In any case, be ready for this shortage.Next, the forecast remains good for interest rates. 2019 ended with fantastic rates, so you might expect that they can only go up from here, but they’re predicted to stay low. This means that even though home prices are rising, buyers will still be able to afford more house and make competitive offers for the houses they’re looking at.“Contact your real estate professional to ensure you’re in good hands going into 2020.”Lastly, whether you’re a buyer or seller, it’s important to be prepared. We know that interest rates are low, so buyer demand will be high, but we have no inventory. What does that mean? As we said above, there will be a lot of multiple-offer situations.

        "content": "Loan limits are increasing in 2020 for conventional, FHA, and VA loans. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.Loan limits are increasing in 2020. What does that mean? First, there’s a difference between your purchase price and your loan limits. For instance, conventional loans have increased; in 2019 the limit was $484,000, and in 2020, the limit is $510,400. That’s over a 5% boost in just one year.If you don’t have the 20% down for a conventional loan, an FHA product is an excellent option. It’s 3.5% down and those limits are increasing, too. In 2019, they were $339,250. In 2020 they are $356,500, a 5% escalation. This helps your buying power when you’re purchasing a new home with an FHA loan.Finally, let’s talk about the VA product. The VA loan limits have had a 247% increase from last year. In 2019, the limit was $484,350. In 2020, it is $1.2 million (that’s 100% financing up to $1.2 million)! That also works if you have multiple VA houses, meaning you can go up to that number collectively.“The VA loan limits have had a 247% increase from last year!”One thing to think about with VA loans: They allow up to $1.2 million, but not every bank will allow that high of a number. Check with your loan officer to confirm they have the product to get you all the way to $1.2 million.If you’re in the market and you’re looking to buy in 2020, go explore your options with your local lender. Happy home hunting!If you have any questions for us about loan limits, please don’t hesitate to reach out by phone or email. We would love to help you!",

        "content": "Your monthly mortgage payment includes a few different costs. Here&rsquo;s how they break down. Today we’re going to talk to you about what exactly is included in your monthly mortgage payment.When you pay rent, you’re essentially paying all interest every single month because you don’t own the property. When you do own a property, your monthly mortgage payment can be thought of in four categories that make up an acronym: PITI.The “P” stands for principal. It’s like an investment made to yourself every month. The first “I” stands for interest, because the bank has to make something on the money they loaned to you. The “T” and the last “I” stand for taxes and insurance, which cover the home in case of disaster. All of this is lumped into one monthly payment.“If you put less than 20% down, you’ll also have to pay mortgage insurance.”In addition to PITI, you’ll also have MI, or mortgage insurance. If you put less than 20% down on your home, you have to pay this because you’re at a higher risk of going to default, unless you have a VA loan.If you have any questions about PITI, buying a home, or anything else, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email today.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today we have a special guest with us&mdash;Jennifer from Bill&rsquo;s Plumbing and Drain Service&mdash;to help give you three tips that homeowners should know about their plumbing. 1. What is the best solution for tackling smelly drains?Sometimes when I go into a home, I register a smell coming out of the drains. My first instinct is to pour some Drano in them to try to get rid of whatever is causing the odor. Jennifer , our expert from Bill’s Plumbing and Drain Service, says that Drano is a pretty harsh chemical; if you pour it down the drain, it will eat away at whatever is clogging the pipes, but it will also eat away at the pipes themselves.A better solution is actually just water, Jennifer says. You can fill a big pitcher with warm water and throw a little bit of lemon juice or vinegar in there, then pour the solution down your drains—especially unused drains like your floor, guest bathroom, and laundry drains. Sometimes those don’t get wet, causing the P-trap to dry out and create an odor. Sealing the drain with a bucket of warm water will help take care of the smells.2. Why is it important to have a sewer scope when you purchase a home?Jennifer says its importance is for checking the integrity of the sewer line to make sure there aren’t any issues with it. Spending around $150 dollars for peace of mind is well worth it when the alternative is an $8,000 to $10,000 repair.Is it necessary for newly constructed homes?Jennifer says there’s a common misconception that, for new homes, everything is new, so why check it? But actually, it’s always a good idea to check for potential issues, even in new homes.  A sewer scope can help you discern if debris from the construction process is causing problems in your system. You’d be surprised what can get in your sewer lines; you don’t want to buy a home and move in only to discover a costly issue. Make sure to check it out before signing those papers.“Drano is a pretty harsh chemical; if you pour it down the drain, it will eat away at whatever is clogging the pipes, but it will also eat away at the pipes themselves”3. What’s the difference between a sewer scope and an actual clean-out of a sewer line?Sewer clean-outs are done when you have such problems as root intrusions or other blockages in your sewer lines. Though many people think that a sewer scope is the only thing they need to do, you do need to make sure that the lines down to the sewer main are clear. It’s important to do an annual maintenance check, especially if you live in an area with lots of trees, to be sure you won’t have any backups. Staying on top of your drain maintenance with these tips should help make your life as a homeowner easier, safer, and cheaper, as well.If you have any questions for Jennifer at Bill’s Plumbing and Drain Service, be sure visit their website.For other questions about real estate, feel free to reach out to the Homebound Team.

Inspectors, appraisers, Realtors, and a number of other professionals all play a role in making sure things go smoothly.With that in mind, it’s no wonder why trying to take on all of the work alone is a poor choice. When you forgo the help of a professional agent, you’re doing more work and earning less money.“Listing alone is no replacement for selling under the guidance of a professional agent.”When you work with our team, we’ll have your home cleaned, staged, and professionally photographed—all to make sure you see the best results possible for your listing.

        "content": "What three things must buyers know before purchasing property with a VA loan? Today we&rsquo;ll explain. If you plan on buying a home using a VA loan, there are three things you must know.Before we elaborate on these points, though, we would like to extend our sincerest thanks to all of our nation’s service members and their families. Without each of you, we wouldn’t have the opportunities in life we do today.With that said, let’s take a look at the three things you should know when purchasing property with a VA loan:1. VA loans do not require a down payment. However, you will need to provide funds for closing costs, and the property must be purchased as a primary residence.2. VA loans do require a funding fee. You will have to pay 2.15% of the loan amount to the VA program. If you use a VA loan a second time, this funding fee will be 3.3%. Keep in mind, though, that this fee will be waived for veterans with disabilities recognized by the VA.3. VA loans are assumable. This is awesome, because, with interest rates and home values on the rise, your home may be more appealing to buyers if you choose to sell in the future.“While it is true that VA loans must be used to purchase a primary residence, you can still make a second purchase using the VA loan again later on.”Now that you understand these three facts, we’ve also got a bonus point to share with you all. Did you know that you can purchase more than one home using the VA loan? While it is true that VA loans must be used to purchase a primary residence, you can still make a second purchase down the line on another primary residence. Best of all, you may keep the first home you purchased using VA financing.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

As agents, we take note of the condition of the home, looking at things such as peeling paint, torn carpets, broken handrails, and window problems, while walking through a home with a buyer using a VA or FHA loan.When you’re using an FHA or VA loan instead of a conventional loan, you’ll have limitations on how much you can actually spend. For example, FHA loans have different limitations in El Paso County that are different from Denver County, Arapahoe County, or Pueblo County. Be sure that the type of loan that you want is going to be in alignment with how much you want to spend. Confer with a real estate and mortgage professional for clarity about whether the loan you want is going to work in your favor.“It is very important to speak with your agent and lender about this before applying for a loan—to make sure that your loan type and home type mesh well together.”As far as home types, you’re probably aware of the most common: single-family homes, condos, and townhomes. Each of these types differ in a few ways. For single-family homes, you need to make sure that the condition is good.

While the Ring™ doorbells are great for some applications, the video footage is not court admissible in the State of Colorado. This means that if someone steals something from your front porch, you cannot use the footage in court.Why?According to Ryan, Ring™ doorbells do not meet two requirements of Colorado state law to be used in court. The first is a time and date stamp. And the second is a watermark. The watermark proves that the video has not been tampered with.“Ring doorbells do not meet two requirements of Colorado state law to be used in court.”Which would you rather have? Brian thinks that the court admissible option is better.Also, the Ring™ system is a monthly service and therefore requires a monthly fee for storage.Meanwhile, Ryan tells us that an actual security system will not require a monthly fee and will record high-quality, HD images which can be viewed through an app.If you are considering which security system you want, you should contact Ryan at WatchPoint Security by calling (719) 579-6540 or online at watchpointdata.com.If you have any questions or comments for us, please contact us by phone or email.

Also, this particular camera is small and unobtrusive, making it easy to hide under the eaves of your home.In terms of data, footage can be stored on an SD card or the camera can be hooked up to an NVR cable.“Do you have a plan for keeping your family safe in 2018?”Cameras like this tend to cost between $90 to $100, but Ryan advises having more than one camera when setting up a surveillance system for your home.

However, things slowly begin to ramp up as time goes on. What most people imagine when they think about building a home only really makes up the last couple months of a six- or seven-month process.Often when people walk into a model, or “prop”, home, they ask themselves, “Is this when I get when I want to build a home?”“If you want the home you’re building to look exactly like the model you saw, you should plan on paying a little extra.”Actually, this is one of the myths of home building. If you want the home you’re building to look exactly like the model you saw, you should plan on paying a little extra. Model homes can be upgraded from anywhere between $30,000 to $100,000.

        "content": "2017 was a fantastic year. Today, let’s take a look at the projections for the 2018 real estate market.It’s going to be a strong seller’s market again in 2018. Inventory is still pretty low compared to where it needs to be. Actually, our housing inventory across the United States is consistent with the housing supply of 1994. However, there are 63 million more people living in this country, so we cannot build homes fast enough.In other words, if you’re a seller and you’ve been on the fence, make it happen.If you’re a buyer, not all hope is lost. Interest rates are fantastic. These are some of the lowest rates we’ve ever seen. In addition to that, loan limits have increased. Going into 2018, FHA loan limits are at $304,750. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and VA loans are up to $453,000. These new loan limits are fantastic.“2018 is projected to be one of the top three years for real estate in the last 100 years.”Another thing to consider is that the average homeowner’s net worth is 49% higher than the average renter’s net worth. So, jump into the 2018 real estate market!Finally, new construction is the highest it’s ever been—up 10% across the nation Like we said earlier, they just can’t build them fast enough.2018 is projected to be one of the top three years for real estate in the last 100 years. We want to be part of that and we want to help you reach your 2018 real estate goals. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would be happy to help you!",

They might not even want carpeting—they might prefer hardwood instead.Besides offering a carpet allowance, you can also offer to reduce your home’s price by however much it would cost to replace the carpet.“A different tactic you can use is to provide a flooring allowance.”Before you do anything, consult with your real estate agent to find out the best approach for you.If you have any more real estate questions for us or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in our Colorado Springs market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "To winterize your home’s sprinkler system and avoid costly damage, there are three steps you need to take. You can follow along in the video above as landscaping expert, Aaron Strong demonstrates these steps on a typical home sprinkler system.First, go inside your home’s utility room and find the sprinkler feed that runs from the inside to the outside of the house. Shut off the feed by flipping the lever 90 degrees so it runs parallel to the pipe. Next, open up the drain beneath the lever by unscrewing the cap. Put a bucket underneath the drain to catch any excess water that trickles out of the pipe during steps two and three.Second, move to the outside of the home and turn off the valves on your backflow preventer and sprinkler manifold. You can shot off the valves on your backflow preventer by turning them to a 45-degree angle. This will prevent any water that could be behind the ball valves from freezing by allowing it to escape. Turn the screws on the backflow preventer to a 45-degree angle as well. Some systems have a valve at the bottom of the pipe leading back into the house and some don’t, but if yours does, unscrew the cap and let the excess water drain out.“Not winterizing your sprinkler system can cause potential catastrophic damage to your foundation.”Some valves for the sprinkler manifold have automatic drains and some don’t. If yours has a manual drain, open it up so it drains all of the water out of the pipes in the manifold and there’s nothing left that could potentially freeze and bust the pipes.Lastly, go back inside the utility room and make sure the valve is open and draining properly. That will allow the water that’s in the line to drain so there’s is no water outside in your backflow preventer. When that’s done draining, your system will be winterized and ready to go.If you have any questions for us, please don’t hesitate to call or email us. We’d be happy to help you.",

There will be a down payment, earnest money deposit, and closing costs.

Keep the money in the same account for at least 60 days if you can. During that time, the money seasons so the lender doesn’t have to source where all the money is coming from during the transaction.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today we’re here with Tim Chase from 719 Lending to explain everything you need to know about earnest money. First of all, what exactly is earnest money? Earnest money is the equivalent of a security deposit. It’s the money you put down in order to proceed with the contract. In Colorado, there are many points throughout the contract that protect you as the buyer, so you can get your earnest money back if you were to exit the transaction. The best part about earnest money is that if you get all the way to closing, that earnest money is yours! It can go toward your down payment or your closing costs, whatever it may be.A lot of buyers want to know if they can use a credit card to pay earnest money. Earnest money can only be provided through secured funds. This means that the funds you provide as earnest money must come from a bank account. Earnest money cannot be provided via cash, money order, or credit card.“If you get all the way to closing, that earnest money is yours!”Other buyers may have gift money that they want to use for the earnest money deposit. Luckily, you can use gift money as earnest money! It’s acceptable to have someone else provide you with earnest money, so long as they provide secured funds.Why are secured funds so important? Your lender is required to track where your earnest money comes from. Anti-money laundering laws require your lender to verify that the money you provide was in your bank account and came from your account. So once that earnest money check is cashed, plan on providing your lender with a new, updated bank statement.Don’t forget that once you close, that earnest money is all yours!If you have any other questions about earnest money or would like to learn more about real estate in our area, just give us a call or send us an email.

In multiple offer situations, sellers are always going to choose an offer where the buyer is working with a local lender.A lot of buyers are in the market right now. However, inventory is low, which means demand is very high. This has led to over-bidding and several multiple offer situations.A recent statistic reports that every listing at $250,000 has more than 79 buyers.“A listing at $250,000 will have more than 79 buyers.”Therefore, buyers should be prepared to bid above asking price. Thankfully, we’ve got some tricks up our sleeve to help you compete.Outside of having a local lender, the next best tip is to not be defeated. We often tell people to plan on missing out on three homes. Be prepared to miss out for a while, but eventually things will work out.The market is tough but great professionals can help you navigate this hot seller’s market.If you have any questions, just give us a call or send us an email.

The seller’s actually pay us to bring them qualified buyers to sell their home. So, most of the time, you can work with a buyer’s agent for free!Now, in Colorado you can be represented by a buyer’s agent, a seller’s agent, or a transaction broker.  When you work with a buyer’s agent, you have an advocate in your corner who is looking out for your best interests and has fiduciary duties to you, not the seller.“A buyer’s agent will work with your best interests in mind.”Another benefit of working with a buyer’s agent is that when you go to a lender without any representation, that can make things more difficult. Lenders like to work with agents who have been through the process a number of times. If you go in without representation, you won’t have someone to guide you through the lending and buying process.If you have any other questions about working with an agent or buying a home, just give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "Any real estate transaction will come with three upfront costs:  Earnest money: This is like a security deposit you pay as if you were renting. Usually, it’s 1% of the purchase price and acts as a safety net for the home sale so you can move forward with the transaction.  Home inspection: This is a huge part of the process and the cost usually depends on the size and age of the home. It’s usually around $300 to $500, but it’s the best money you’ll spend throughout the process. Your due diligence is an important part of buying a home, and during inspection periods you can also do sewer and radon tests.  Appraisals: You’ll have to pay for this requirement if you’re getting a home loan. The appraiser will go to the home and opine what it’s actually worth, and the cool part is that it will keep you from overpaying for the house. This typically costs between $550 and $800.“Home inspection costs are the best money you’ll spend during the whole process.”If you have any other questions about the costs of buying or home or you’re looking to sell your house, give us a call or send us an email.
