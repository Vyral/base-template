        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "As a condo owner, certain factors can make or break your home saleâfactors unrelated to your actual unit.Today I have a question for condo and townhome owners: Is your building helping or hurting you?Â When youâre selling one of these properties, youâre inextricably connected to the entire building, and certain factors can affect your prospect of finding a buyer. Take a moment to look around. What kind of first impression does the building give off from the sidewalk, lobby, etc.? Does the building contain elevators? Put another way, what do you see as you make your way to your unit?Â To buyers, the building your condo is situated in is a direct reflection of the unit itself. Theyâll pass judgment on the buildingâs overall maintenance and whether it looks like a high level of care goes into the property. Before the buyer ever sets foot in your actual home, thereâs a chance that theyâve already decided whether theyâll give it serious consideration just based on their perception of your building. Needless to say, itâs very important that the building you choose to move into doesnât work against your future sale.Â âMy advice is to be involved and do your due diligence along the way to ensure some easy wins when you go to sell your property.âIn addition to the buildingâs appearance, buyers will want to know how much your condo association has in cash reserves and the propertyâs history concerning its maintenance schedule.Â Answering these questions will only help you as a future seller. Too often, condo sellers have to overcome buyersâ objections to the buildingâs mismanagement or its poor conditionâthe effects of which put you at a disadvantage right out of the gate.Â My advice is to be involved and do your due diligence along the way to ensure some easy wins when you go to sell your property. Â If you have any questions or if you plan to sell your condo sometime in the future and youâd like some help determining what you should be spending your time and money on, please reach out to the Carter Property Group. Weâd be happy to counsel you in that effort, and we look forward to hearing from you!Â ",

        "content": "Preparing your home properly is essential in having a successful home sale. Hereâs why.When weâre consulting with home sellers, one of the most common questions we hear is, âIs staging worth it? Does it really work?âThere are two things that we can do to most effectively sell properties. The first is pricing competitively. The second is preparing the property for sale. Typically, staging is directly tied to both of these components.Â If a property has too much furniture, not enough furniture, or not the right size of furniture, staging can make a significant difference. If you have oddly shaped rooms, staging can really help there, too.Â âStaging helps with small or oddly shaped rooms.âIn an ideal world, your property should be cleaned, painted, and staged. The staging is the icing on the cake of the final presentation that buyers are looking for. Itâs a major factor in the home-selling process.If you have any questions about selling a home or real estate in general, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.Â ",

        "content": "Are homebuyers still eyeing fixer-uppers these days?Â The short answer is no. We live in an increasingly fast-paced world where people want what they want on demand, and real estate is no exception. Homebuyers are seeking move-in ready, hassle-free properties that they can swiftly close on.Â For years, the running joke has been that buyers are looking to have the moving truck show up at 10 a.m. sharp, so they can welcome guests to the cookout at their new home by 5 p.m. that evening.Â âBuyers of today donât want to have to tackle a long list of upgrades after closing on a home.âObviously, this is meant to be hyperbole, but the fact remains: Buyers of today donât want to have to tackle a long list of upgrades after closing on a home. Â I canât emphasize enough how important it is for you, as a seller, to get your home in prime condition. Otherwise, buyers wonât even give it a second glance because they know theyâll have the ability to borrow more money for a home in better condition and at an exceptionally low interest rate.Â Â Simply put, as a seller, you want to extract the most value out of your home sale, so we need to make a concerted effort to ensure your home is in turnkey shape. For any questions related to real estate or if you or someone you know would like to make a move, please let us know today. Weâd be happy to help!Â  Â  Â  Â ",

Unless your goals specifically line up with that time of year, hereâs something to consider: Buyers populate our Chicago market and are looking to make a purchase every week and month of the year.âWhy wait a whole year when youâre unsure of what the future will bring?âTherefore, youâre probably not doing yourself any favors by trying to sync up your home sale with a seasonal market. Thereâs no telling what market conditions will be like a year from now. Home prices could very well flatten out or even go down and, given that the market is always shifting, thatâs a real possibility.Shortening your time frame to a comfortable point gives us a chance to predict what the market will be doing and will lead to greater certainty in your sale. **Why wait a whole year when youâre unsure of what the future will bring? **If you or someone you know would like an evaluation of a property or youâre thinking about making a real estate move, donât hesitate to let us know.

        "content": "Iâd like to take the opportunity today to give you the full rundown of how our 2018 market fared.There are five central data points that drive real estate: home sales, home price, monthsâ supply of inventory, mortgage rates, and affordability. Iâll take a deep dive into these stats on the national scale. Â National home sales for 2018  5.3 million total homes sold  Down from 2016 and 2017  Matched the number for 2015  Projected to fall slightly to 5.2 million in 2019National home prices for 2018  Finished with a year-over-year appreciation of 5%  Anticipated to increase in 2019  Increase is projected to be in the 1% to 5% rangeNational months&rsquo; supply of inventory for 2018  Finished with four monthsâ worth of inventory  Dating back to 2013, our sellerâs market has persisted due to: Â           Number of new construction homes remaining low      Ever-increasing interest rates      Homeowners staying put for longer      National mortgage rates for 2018  Increased almost a full percentage point from early 2018 to yearâs end  Currently hovering at 4.5%  Rates are still at historical lowsNational affordability for 2018   Finished slightly up, as compared to 2017âs market  Since 1970, we still sit below average affordability indexWhat do these numbers bear out for the future of our real estate market?All in all, the national housing market is relatively healthy and will remain stable in 2019âhomes are selling well and interest rates have stayed fairly moderate.As for those looking to buy in 2019, we arenât going to see homes flying off the market nor will they appreciate to an astronomical extent. If your real estate goals for this year include making a home purchase, a golden opportunity awaits you.If youâre interested in a conversation around what your options might be in any aspect of residential real estate, please give us a call.

You should always say yes. The buyer and the buyerâs agent have carved out time in their schedules to come and see your home. If we ask them to schedule for another day, ask to move the time, or decline altogether, we may never hear from them again. Even if we follow up and ask them to please reschedule, they will probably go out and find another home.2. They donât rise to the occasion and prepare the property to show in the best light possible. Itâs so important that your property looks great. Make sure that you declutter, clean, and make repairs and updates. With wide-angle lenses and enhanced photographs, our first sale is online.

That might not seem like a significant jump, and, historically speaking, a 4.625% interest rate is still very low.Hereâs the thingâthat increase has an impact on a buyerâs ability to borrow money to buy real estate.âAn increase in interest rates means a decrease in buying power.âIf you are a homebuyer and you want a specific monthly mortgage payment based on your income, youâve lost 7.2% in purchasing power. That means you have the ability to buy 7.2% less home for the same monthly payment.As a seller, since people who are interested in buying your home have lost some purchasing power, there will be a downward effect on prices and the offers that they might be able to make.That said, the real estate market in Chicago is still very strong. This is a fairly recent development but it is significant, so I wanted to make sure that everyone was aware of it.It looks like rates will continue to increase over the course of 2018.

        "content": "Today I wanted to introduce you to Laura Jones, the buyerâs agent for our team here at Carter Property Group, so that you can get to know her and have some of your questions answered by her.Whatâs a buyerâs agent?I focus solely on the purchase of our clientsâ homes. First-time homebuyers, investors, upsizing, downsizingâI only work on the buy side of the transaction. Â Any client we have has to sit down with me for a consultation. Iâm able to get an idea of their needs in about 30 to 40 minutes. Â Once we do that, we begin searching and going out into the field to look at homes. After that, when weâre ready, I write the contract and negotiate the terms.So essentially, I do needs-assessment through a consultation, preview homes on the MLS, set up searches for people, take people out into the field to view homes (sometimes as many as 40 properties a week), write offers and negotiate terms once a property is selected, and eventually get it under contract. Iâm able to service clients at a very high level.What does a typical day look like for you?I wake up in the morning, shake my son awake and take him to school, and then I get to the office. I generally block off my morning for business calls and finding properties that arenât yet on the market for our clients. Iâll take lunch and maybe make time for a workout, and then for the rest of the afternoon and evening Iâll block out that time period to be able to go out into the field with clients.So the MLS is only one source that you use to find properties for clients?Absolutely. Sometimes Iâll send out mailers and follow it up with a call. Sometimes the property for our clients isnât always on the market at the time. That allows me to block a whole morning to find properties and preview them.Whatâs your favorite part of your job?As a buyerâs agent, my favorite part of my job is the fact that I do get to know my clients in a really intimate way. I spend a lot of time with them and their families, I get to know personal things about them, and after the transaction, we donât really fall off. I love checking in with them. They send me photos of remodels, updates, babies, and more. Itâs just really rewarding. I donât take it lightly that buying a home is probably the most money youâre ever going to spend.âHelping someone get into their new home is pretty powerful.

Going in with a 203(k) loan, Paul is borrowing a little bit more money than the purchase price of the property in order to put some money back into that property.ââWe train really hard on stuff like thatâhow to listen, how to find out where people are, and how to ask a question to dig deeper about emotions.ââKnowing that extra money was there to handle problems created a sense of calmness, but the homeâs inspection revealed three relatively big ones: asbestos, residual termite damage, and some fascia on some of the gutters, which is a complicated fix. Moving forward, weâve uncovered a layering of information and still have some unknowns to decide on in order to proceed.Paul jokes that heâs almost fired two people so far, but having the experience of feeling like heâs not being heard was invaluable to him because he always wants our clients to feel like theyâre being heard, as do I.What weâve seen for a long time, and what partially explains this feeling if youâre a homebuyer, is that the further away a person involved in the transaction is from the actual transaction and the core facilitators of that transaction (i.e., the agent), the more youâre just a file to them. They donât have the first-hand connection to your goals, your situation, and your timeline. We always keep these factors in mind when working with our clients.âWe train really hard on stuff like thatâhow to listen, how to find out where people are, and how to ask a question to dig deeper about emotions.âWeâll keep you posted on the next steps of this transaction and relay some more first-hand knowledge on the subject.

Joining me again is Rees , a client of ours who has recently used short-term rentals in her investing strategy.To watch the first part in this series, click here.In the first part of this series, Rees explained the return she received on this investment.Â Initially, returns were in the single digits. From a percentage standpoint, though, short-term rentals produced a 50% higher return than long-term rentals. Her family also decided to outsource the management of these properties, so they hired a company who handles the management of similar internal units, and that 50% was after that management companyâs fees.When it comes to managing the property itself, her workload has decreased because their management company, like most management companies, has a handyman on call for maintenance issues within short-term properties. Many people wonder how much time theyâll have to devote to managing residential rental property, and the answer is usually less than you think.âAlways have a good team in place when investing in short-term rentalsâRees has two main points of advice for anyone thinking about buying an investment property. The first is to leave a little bit of a buffer from a dollar standpoint, especially with short-term rentals. This is because there is a little bit of upfront capital investment required, and issues can arise that youâll need money set aside for.Itâs also critical to have a good team in place. Rees had a great real estate attorney and a home inspector working for her, and they advised her against buying a different property that wouldâve caused her a lot of headaches.We want to thank Rees for joining us today to help us explore the topic of short-term rentals.

Though she wasnât initially thrilled about the idea, after a few conversations with us, it became clear to her that it was a great option to add to the current investments she has from a diversification standpoint. She also considered it important to gain some passive income in addition to her job. On a more personal note, it was important for her to have an investment dedicated to the medical needs of her son.âFrom a percentage standpoint, though,Â short-term rentals produced a 50% higher return than long-term rentals.âTo clarify, whereas âactive incomeâ is whatever comes from your primary occupation, âpassive incomeâ is typically the category where real estate investing falls, and thatâs the way the IRS categorizes it as well.Rees was initially looking for multi-unit properties (specifically three-unit) with long-term renters, and she was identifying them specifically based on whether they would be a good investment numbers-wise and make sense from their return perspective.One property in particular came up that was significantly higher in return. That property had one of its three units as a short-term rental. She then realized that short-term rentals could be applied to other three-unit properties with long-term renters. Once she was able to take that idea and apply it to other properties, several more options became available.Initially, returns were in the single digits. From a percentage standpoint, though, short-term rentals produced a 50% higher return than long-term rentals. Her family also decided to outsource the management of these properties, so they hired a company who handles the management of similar internal units, and that 50% was after that management companyâs fees.We want to thank Rees for joining us today to help us explore the topic of short-term rentals!

One home, in particular, belonged to a couple in their 90s, who needed help getting the drywall cut out, the carpet removed, and baseboards replaced.Overall, this experience has been incredibly rewarding. We got to help a lot of families, but there are many more people who still need help. Because of this, our Keller Williams Chicago-Lincoln Park office has pledged to contribute $100,000 back to hurricane relief. We want to work together to make the biggest impact possible, so weâll be hosting a telethon that gives us the opportunity to give back to our communities on a local and national level.For more information on how you can give back, visit https://www.reliefnow.info/In the meantime, if you have any questions, donât hesitate to give us a call or shoot us an email. Weâd be happy to speak with you.",

        "content": "The residential rental market is being revolutionized.Airbnb, if you havenât heard of it, is a short-term rental service that allows landlords and tenants to connect on properties currently for rent.The amount of money that can be generated in this way is actually much higher than what the landlord could earn from renting out a property on an eight to 12-month basis.This is largely due to the fact that the rent can be made higher for these properties since they are short-term and are often utilized similarly to a hotel.âThe residential rental market is being revolutionizedâThe nightly rental rates of a hotel over a 12-month payment would be much more expensive than a typical 12-month rent.But not only are short-term rental landlords earning more income, they are also cutting certain costs typically associated with renting out property.However, there are some added expectations and requirements for a short-term rental property. From a management perspective, you as the landlord must offer the property furnished. Managing bookings and turnover is also different than it would be in a month-to-month rental property.There are now companies that specialize in the turnover process. Theyâll change sheets and help turn properties around for the next resident. So, there are absolutely resources out there that can help.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Shannon lines up a professional photographer, gets all the keys necessary to access the property, and gathers background information on the home or condo.She also puts together our online and print marketing materials and keeps everyone updated on the process until the seller gets a contract on their home.âOne of my favorite parts of the job is getting to go through the house with the photographer and making sure everything looks its best,â she says. âItâs really fun to get the look and feel of the property.

There are cool things going on with Facebook marketing, and online marketing changes every day, which I get excited about.ââShannon keeps everyone updated on the process until you get a contract on your home.âA typical day for Shannon starts with making sure that everyone on the team has what they need.

She also puts together brochures and marketing materials, and sometimes she gets to go to a photo appointment or make keys for a property.As for a few fun facts about Shannon: âI like to bike a lot. Iâve really gotten into biking recently; itâs my primary way of getting to work.

        "content": "In many cases in our market, you can actually buy a property for less money on a monthly basis than it costs to rent. It seems too good to be true, but the math checks out. Hereâs why.Even though prices have gone up steadily over the last five years, the key question is how much it costs to borrow money from a mortgage lender to buy a home. At 4% interestâthe prevailing rate we see right nowâthe principal and interest payment for a $100,000 loan is only $477 a month. It would be just under $1,200 a month for a $250,000 loan, before taking into consideration any association fees or âassessmentsâ if you buy a condominium, as well as a county property tax bill.âIn many cases, your monthly payments to buy a house are cheaper than your rent.âRental rates here in the Chicagoland market have been high and increasing over the last five years. If you rent now and youâre getting sick of paying your landlordâs mortgage, you really should consider buying a home. Those low interest rates are what make buying a home so affordable right now.If you or anyone you know wants to talk about the costs of buying a home and how it compares to renting, give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "There are four main statistical numbers that we track to understand what the market is doing. Today weâre looking at those numbers from March 2016 to March 2017.Â âThe median days on market has gone down 16% compared to this time last year.â1.) The first is the median increase in sales price. In the last 12 months weâve seen a 7.6% median increase in sales price across all property types in the entire metro area.2.) The second number, the median days on market, is decreasing. In fact, weâve seen the median days on market go down by 16% compared to last year.3.) The next number is the monthâs supply of inventory, which is a measurement of how many months it would take to sell all the inventory currently on the market if no new properties were added, is very helpful in determining if we are in a sellerâs, buyerâs, or balanced market. Weâve actually seen a decrease in the months supply of inventory of 16% in the last year and have been hovering in a firm sellerâs market. Â 4.) That brings me to the final number to look at, the number of properties for sale. There are more than 6,000 fewer properties for sale than this time last year, which means competition is increasing. So what does that mean for you? More competition is great news for sellers because houses are selling faster and for more money. On the buyerâs side, interest rates are still low, so you still have a good amount of purchasing power.Â If you or anyone you know is looking to buy, sell, or invest in real estate, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

In our last video, we covered improvements you can make to your surface areas to spruce up your home. Today weâre back with a few more upgrades that will make your home really stand out.First and foremost, you want to be strategic and economical about the updates you undertake, but keep in mind that upgrades are crucial as buyers are very critical.The areas youâll want to focus on are the kitchen and bathrooms.For the kitchen, youâll want new countertops, a new sink and faucet, new hardware for the cabinets and drawers, and new appliances. You should also consider adding a backsplash or at the very least, painting. Those things will get you the most bang for your buck in your kitchen.âThe areas youâll want to focus on are the kitchen and bathrooms.âAs far as the bathroom goes, the first thing youâll want to look at is the condition of the flooring. Also, make sure you take a look at the area surrounding the tub and/or the shower, as well as the condition of the vanity.Â The good news is that vanities and sinks are generally inexpensive upgrades. Another inexpensive update to consider is adding a new light fixture as that will really make the bathroom pop.Updates can bring some pretty significant returns and there are ways to update your home on a budget. On the other hand, if you really believe you donât have the money to upgrade those rooms, youâll need to be prepared to sell at a lower price.One of the things my team and I have successfully done over the years is help navigate sellers to the best upgrades for their homes that will have the best returns. If youâre thinking about selling, we can definitely help you key in on the things that will be the most important to buyers.If anyone you know is looking to buy, sell, or invest in real estate or you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to me.

The Federal Reserve has just increased their interest rates by 0.25%.The media may lead you to believe that it will have a direct relationship to the interest rates on the open market, but thatâs not the case. We saw rates creeping up toward the end of last week and throughout this week in anticipation of the announcement.âWeâre still in a strong sellerâs market.âIf youâre buying or selling a home in todayâs market, what does this mean for you? In Chicagoland, we have a very strong sellerâs market for the most part. Weâre in the heart of our spring selling season and homeowners are able to sell quickly and at or above list price. Because there are fewer properties available, buyers are competing for limited inventory. Thatâs driving prices up.If youâre looking to make a move later this year or early next year, you should take a look at the market now and see if you would have a better advantage with rates where they are now. If rates continue to go up, it makes sense for you to buy now. As they increase, your buying power will decrease. We wouldnât be shocked to see them go up two more times this year alone, so now is a good time to consider making a move.If you have any questions for us or you are interested in buying, selling, or investing in real estate, give us a call or send us an email.

It really comes down to the big surface areas.That being said, the first thing you want to spend money on is paint. By the time you are ready to sell your home, your walls probably have accumulated some scratches. A clean coat of paint will make your property shine and youâll see a great return on that investment.Next, you want to focus on your floors.If you have carpet and there are signs of wear and tear, replacing it is your best option. Otherwise, make sure to give it a thorough cleaning if the carpet is still in good shape. Hardwood flooring is a favorite among buyers, so if there is damage to the hardwood floors, it might wise to have them professionally buffed and refinished.It is very important to buyers that a home is move-in ready and all the major surface areas are taken care of, so spending the extra money to make sure the hardwood floors are in great shape will pay off.Finally, consider investing in some new lighting fixtures. If a room or space is dark and doesnât produce a lot of light, it will be a huge turnoff for buyers. LED lights have become a new standard in the real estate industry, both for their cost effectiveness and their ability to really brighten up a room.âIt is very important to buyers that a home is move-in ready and all the major surface areas are taken care of.âInvesting in those three things will not only give your home a fantastic, fresh feeling, but will almost always guarantee a great return.
