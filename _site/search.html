        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "How does the new tax bill affect you as a homeowner? There is a lot of good news surrounding what changes took place, and there are five specific changes you need to know about.The first involves the capital gains tax. If you sell your home and have lived in it for two out of the last five years, you donât have to pay capital gains tax. There was talk about changing this rule from two out of the last five years to five out of the last eight years, which wouldâve made it more difficult to take advantage of this exemption, but they didnât.The second change involves the mortgage interest deduction, which was capped at $750,000. Previously, you could deduct interest on mortgages for up to $1 million. So, if your mortgage is above $750,000, you wonât be able to deduct any interest.âYou should see your taxes go down in 2018.âThird, the standard deduction was raised from $6,000 to $12,000 for single filers and from $12,000 to $24,000 for married couples. This change takes away some of the advantages you have when you itemize your property taxes and mortgage interest. It also creates more of a level playing field for owners and renters.Fourth, the personal exemption, which was $4,150, was repealed. This repeal is kind of a wash, though, considering the increase in the standard deduction. If you have children under the age of 16, this deduction was raised from $1,000 to $2,000 per child.Lastly, you can no longer deduct your moving expenses unless youâre a member of the U.S. armed forces.With these changes, you should see your taxes go down in 2018. If you have any questions about these changes or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home in our market, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd be glad to help you.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "How did the Nashville real estate market do in 2017?Overall, the Nashville market is pretty solid. The number of homes sold went up over 4% year over year, and the average sale price also went up. Itâs been a great year for real estate here in Nashville as people continue to move here. We are still in a sellerâs market, as there are more buyers out there than sellers.What can you expect from the market in 2018?Interest rates are still at historic lows, but buyers need to keep an eye on them because they will go up at some point this year. Now may be a good time to lock in a low rate before they go up. I donât expect them to go up too much, but they will go up in 2018.If you are thinking of selling your home, then we are still in need of more houses to come onto the market. There are more and more people coming to Nashville looking for homes, so you can definitely get a good price for your home right now.âThere is still a shortage of inventory, so we need more houses on the market in 2018.âYou should also look out for new construction. Will the new housing inventory help us catch up to the number of buyers in the market?There are a few pockets, like in East Nashville, where we are seeing an increase in new construction and houses are sitting on the market a little longer than other areas with less inventory.Of course, the new tax reforms will impact the real estate market. Iâll go over the tax reform bill in more detail in my next video.Overall, 2018 will be a strong year in real estate. The job market looks great, and new businesses are arriving all the time in Nashville.If you plan on buying or selling a home in 2018 or you have any questions about the market in your specific neighborhood, just give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "As many of you probably know, the credit reporting agency Equifax was recently hacked. 145 million Americans were affected, and data such as names, addresses, social security numbers, birth dates, and driverâs license information were leaked.The reason why this is such a big problem is mainly that people with access to this information could apply for fake tax returns and rob you of what is rightfully yours. They could also rack up credit card debt.If youâre trying to buy a home, taking out a loan will become much more difficult if someone else is causing these kinds of problems for your credit.So, how can you figure out if you have been hacked? What can you do to protect yourself?The first step is to go to www.Equifax.com and type in your name. From there, youâll be able to find out if you may have been one of the people who was hacked.â145 million Americans were affected by the recent Equifax hack.âOf course, the catch is that Equifax will try to get you to enroll in their premier ID. This would monitor your credit, but I personally recommend that you sign up for at www.CreditKarma.com instead. With Credit Karma, youâll receive free credit score monitoring and will be alerted if anything suspicious occurs.The second step you can take is to freeze your credit. I used to make fun of my parents for doing this, but now I believe this is absolutely warranted. This service is free through Equifax, but other credit reporting agencies will actually charge you between $3 and $10 to freeze or unfreeze your credit.Also, donât forget to freeze your childrenâs credit. Since they have a social security number, then they are still vulnerable.However, you should still talk to your lender before freezing your credit. Also remember that you can sign up for 90-day fraud alert, which might be easier than freezing your credit.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Investing in real estate is no longer restricted to the super wealthy. According to a recent survey, real estate investors now make up 15% of the population. That translates to almost 50 million individuals who invest in at least one property other than their primary residence.In fact, 89% of U.S. investors are interested in putting their money in real estate because of benefits such as cash flow, tax incentives, leverage, and value appreciation that come with investing in multiple properties.Are you curious about investing in real estate? If so, here are five different ways you can get started:1. Buy and rentThis is probably the most traditional way to invest in real estate. It simply involves buying a property and renting it out. Now is a good time for this kind of investing because rental rates are on the rise (8% since last year) but the downside of this investing approach is the time and effort needed to manage and maintain your investment.2. Buy and sellAlso known as home flipping, this involves buying a property and reselling it soon after for a profit. Home flipping has offered a record-breaking 49% return in 2016.3. Real estate investment groupsReal estate investment groups are organizations that buy a set of properties and then sell them to individual investors. The main benefit of this approach is that you typically do not need to act as the landlord because the investment group handles property management for you (for a fee of course).âHome flipping offered a record-breaking 49% return in 2016.â4. Crowdfunding sitesRecently, thereâs been an explosion of sites such as Prosper and Lending Club, which allow individuals to invest in various real estate development projects. Through crowdfunding sites, you can be a part of a large-scale property investment while investing only a moderate amount of money. On the other hand, crowdfunding sites act as a middleman and charge fees which can eat into your profits.5. REITsReal estate investment trusts (REITs) are like mutual funds for real estate.They typically pay high dividends. However, they also do not offer all of the typical benefits of investing in real estate, such as increased leverage and tax benefits.Each of these investing approaches offers a tradeoff between possible profits, risks, and costs.The one constant is that you can minimize your risks with due diligence and by consulting with an experienced real estate professional.If you have any questions for us or youâre interested in investing in real estate yourself, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "I just wanted to stop by quickly today and offer you a few tips to help you save on your energy bills this summer. Sometimes all it takes is a little fix to bring that bill way down. Here are seven things for you to consider:1. Plug and fill any holes. Seal those window or door gaps with caulk or foam. If you have an external A/C unit, make sure thatâs sealed tight as well. Fewer leaks will allow your HVAC system to run a lot more efficiently.2. Close your shades. Sunlight heats your home when it doesnât need to be, especially while youâre gone during the day.3. Make sure your air filters are cleaned every 30 days. This will ensure that your air flow isnât restricted in any way.4. Program your thermostat. Getting a smart or programmable thermostat can save you a ton. Whenever you arenât home, you can keep the home at more energy-efficient temps.âA smart thermostat is a wise investment.â5. Unplug unused appliances. They still use energy even if you arenât technically using them. Turn them off to save a bit of coin.6. Switch out old light bulbs for new, energy-efficient ones. They donât use as much energy or put off as much heat.7. Look at the Energy Star ratings of your new appliances before you buy them. This can save you a lot of money over time.These are just a few of our tips for lowering those bills and making the summer a bit more affordable for you. If you have any questions in the meantime, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Home flipping is usually defined as buying a home and then reselling it soon after for a higher price. 10 years ago, it was a mainstay of the real estate boom that led to the financial crash.After some years of lower activity, itâs back in full force, thanks in part to popular TV shows such as âFlip or Flopâ and âFlipping the Block.â If youâre curious about home flipping, here are three facts you should know right now:1. Home flipping is more profitable than ever. A recent Waco home that appeared on HGTVâs show âFixer Upperâ was originally bought for $28,000. It was thoroughly renovated and is now being listed for $950,000âover 30 times its original price. In 2016, the median flipped home sold for $189,900, which is $62,624 over the median purchase price of $127,276. Thatâs a 49.2% return, the most profitable return since 2000âthe first year for which such data is available.2. Home flipping is caused by different factors than 10 years ago.Back then, many flipped homes were speculations. In other words, investors would buy a home and then just wait, hoping that the price would go up so they could sell. The current flipping trend appears to be a positive response to current market conditions, such as the overall shortage of homes for sale, a lack of new construction, and a steady rise in home prices.âDemand still outstrips supply, for now.â3. Home flipping affects all home buyers and sellers. If youâre a buyer, you can clearly benefit from the home-flipping craze. Flipped homes are available at all price ranges, from entry-level to luxury homes.If you are a seller, then the boom in home flipping means you might face tougher competition when the time comes to sell your home.The good news is that demand still strongly outstrips supply for now. These conditions wonât last forever.If you have any questions or youâre even considering investing in a home you can flip yourself, get in touch with me by giving me a call or sending me a quick email.

It will cost you $50 and youâll want to download the QLESS app, which will allow you to get in line at the office.You also want to be sure you have insurance for it. Airbnb offers you a $1 million per occurrence once you put your house on their site, which youâll need to apply for a permit.

Thereâs a vote coming up to get rid of all non-owner-occupied permits by the end of 2019, so you canât even apply for one at this time.âYou can only seek an owner-occupied property permit.âKeep the taxes in mindtoo, as youâll have to pay hotel occupancy taxes and some others; there are monthly and quarterly taxes to pay. Itâs a lot of paperwork, so it can be helpful to hire someone to help you stay on top of it all.Finally, you need to consider the logistics of how it will actually work with your home. As an owner-occupied short-term rental property will you rent out a room, or leave when you have guests? Will you rent it out for CMA Fest or the Stanley Cup next year when the Predators make it back again? Will you rent it only when youâre on vacation yourself? The best case scenario is having a house with basically a basement apartment and a second entrance.This kind of rental can really help bring in some extra income to help pay for things like your mortgage or vacations.

        "author": "",

        "content": "Our market is crazy right now, and multiple offer situations are becoming more and more common. Sellers are really in the driverâs seat, so you have a great chance to get the price and terms that you want in this market.However, if you receive multiple offers on your home, there are a few things to consider in order to pick the best one:1. Is the highest offer always best? Price is obviously an important factor to consider, but you need to look at how much money the buyer is bringing to the table. Is the buyer using 100% financing with no money down? Are they an FHA buyer who can offer 3.5% down? Or is the buyer using a conventional loan with 5% or 20% down? Look at those down payments because that will tell you how much buying power the buyers actually have.2. Will your home appraise for the price being offered?Look at the market around you to see what similar houses have sold for in the last six months. If you choose an offer that is too high and the appraisal comes in low, then the buyer will likely ask you to reduce the sales price to the appraised value. Thatâs just another reason why itâs not always best to take the higher offer.Â âHigher offers may not appraise.â3. What type of contingencies are in the contract? You want to find a clean offer. Are they asking for a 30-day closing or 60-day attraction? Do they need to sell their home in order to purchase yours? If so, make sure their home is already on the market and find out what the average days on market is for their neighborhood. We just had one prospective buyer who offered a high sales price but since their offer was contingent on the sale of their home, our seller went with a lower offer in order to avoid dealing with that.Once you review all of the offers, you can decide whether you want to go into a multiple offer situation. You can tell all of your prospective buyers to send in their best and final offers by a certain time of day. However, keep in mind that not all buyers will want to be in a bidding war, so you may lose a few offers. If you donât want to go this route, you can pick one offer and counter. Either way, we can still help you get the highest and best offer for your home.If you have any other questions about selling your home in this crazy market, just give us a call or send us an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "If youâre trying to buy a home here in Nashville, how do you compete against multiple offers on the same home?The homeâs listing agent will usually tell you that there are multiple offers and ask everyone for the best and final offer. Youâll have no idea what the other buyers have offered.The first thing I recommend is to keep your offer clean with as few contingencies as possible. For example, donât ask the seller to cover closing costs if youâre able to cover them. Donât ask for a home warranty either, as you can always pay for one of your own. You could also refrain from asking the seller to pay title fees, which can cost up to $2,500 depending on the price of the home.Obviously the purchase price is a big deal too, so you want to go in with the strongest price you can.Secondly, I recommend putting down as much money on your home loan as possible. Putting down 5% instead of 3.5% or 20% instead of 10% makes your offer stronger, especially if youâre competing against any cash offers. You can also put down more trust money, which would go toward closing in the end anyway. This shows the seller that you have a lot of buying power.âPrice is always a big part, so come in with your strongest offer price.âYou could also use an escalation clause, which is becoming so popular in the Nashville market that Iâd say about half the offers in multiple offer situations have them. Itâs a stipulation in an offer that says youâre willing to pay a certain amount more (say a $500 increment) than the next highest offer up to a certain amount. That way you donât have to bid all the way up to the absolute highest amount youâre willing to pay right away, but $500 over the next highest bidder, up to a maximum point.Finally, you can write a personal letter to the seller about how much you love the house and how you and your family would use it. You can really pull at their heartstrings with a personal letter.If you have any other questions about winning a home in a multiple offer situation, you can always give me a call or send me an email.

Public tax records show things like the number of bedrooms and bathrooms and the square footage. If you own a home, you can also log into Zillow and manually update information about it. You can enter if you have granite countertops or new hardwood floors and theyâll increase your Zestimate.Zillow combines this into a general value of your home in your neighborhood. However, people donât always go on Zillow and enter what theyâve done to their home. If not, Zillow has no way of knowing if you added 500 square feet, for example. They canât keep up with the exact data. They canât account for your neighborâs home, either.The Zestimate can be a good general starting point to get an idea of what your home is worth, but itâs not an appraisal or an exact price. You donât want to use it to price your house.âThe Zestimate can be a good general starting point, but itâs not an appraisal.âSo how far off are they really? The median error is 5%, so half of the homes on Zillow will be under 5% off the sales price. The other half are off by more than 5%. It may not seem like much, but for a $350,000 house, the sales price could be off by $17,500.To get a true market value of your home, you need to consult a real estate professional who does it every day. We look at all the specific data, not just general tax records. We consider the age, size, condition, updates, materials, and other similar homes in the area, to name a few details.

Itâs a tough situation that can happen to almost anyone since most people need to sell their current house in order to buy the next one.In a sellerâs market like weâre currently seeing in Nashville, the problem is that if your offer on a home has a sale contingency and youâre competing against three or four other offers, the others might have an advantage.There are a few ways we help buyers avoid this issue.The first is to go out and start looking at properties so you can be sure there are a few things out there that you like. That way, you wonât have to hesitate when the time comes to write an offer. From there, my next recommendation is to put your house on the market and try to get a contract. The good thing about a sellerâs market is that you as the seller have a little bit more control over the contract. That means you can dictate those terms better.âYouâll have extra leverage as a seller in our market, which helps you get the terms you want.âSince you have extra leverage, I recommend that my clients push closing out 45 or 60 days rather than the usual 30. Thatâll give you more time and less stress when finding your next home.Another option to bridge this gap would be a short-term rental, like Airbnb or VRBO. These are great options if you need to stay somewhere for a month or two while you find your next house, and theyâre furnished. This will help you avoid having to move twice.My least favorite option is to ask the buyer of your home for a temporary occupancy agreement. You would close on the house but then stay in it for a specified amount of time. Youâll want to get renterâs insurance for your belongings since your homeownerâs insurance wonât cover your personal items once you close on the home. It can get messy, but it can work if you truly need that extra time to get into your new place.Each case is different, so donât hesitate to give me a call if you have any questions.

Weâre seeing rising prices, multiple offer situations, and homes selling the second they hit the market. Sometimes, multiple offers can cause a home to sell for well above asking price.We saw a rise in interest rates around the election and my lender tells me we are right around the 4% to 4.5% range, which is still very low.So, what does this mean for buyers and sellers?âAs a buyer, be smart, be quick, and be aggressive.âAs a buyer, youâll want to be knowledgeable about the market. Youâre going to want to keep a close eye on whatâs hitting the market so you can get there quickly to see it and make an offer if you like it.You also have to be very aggressive as a buyer in this market. If there are not multiple offers on a property right away, there probably will be, so you want to make your first offer your best. You donât want to spend time trying to negotiate as that would give other people time to send an offer in.If youâre a seller, right now is a great time to list your home. In fact, there are fewer than 2,000 homes for sale in Davidson County. You can price it in a great range and it will more than likely sell quickly with multiple offers on the table.
