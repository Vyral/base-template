        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "For our a look ahead at our spring market, weâll focus separately on the Prior Lake Savage and Shakopee areas and talk about how inventory levels are shaking out in three distinct price ranges.The first of those price ranges is the first-time buyer market, which typically represents homes priced up to $250,000. In both Prior Lake Savage and Shakopee, there is no new construction in this level of inventory. Whatâs really interesting, though, is that the number of active listings and the number of pending listings in both communities are identical. This tells us that though first-time Â buyers may not be able to build a new home, the inventory that is coming on the market is moving at a nice clip.The second price range is the move-up buyer market, which is roughly between $250,000 and $400,000. This market is slightly different in both Prior Lake Savage and Shakopee in that there is some new construction inventory. However, existing inventory tends to pend or sell faster in this range because move-up buyers look for value, and you can often find better value in the existing market where home features like decks, patios, gutters, and window treatments are already done for you.North of $400,000, itâs an entirely different ball game. There is a lot more pending inventory and an extensive amount of active inventory because there are fewer buyers.âPay attention to prices as more inventory comes on the market.âWhat does this mean moving forward in 2018? It means first-time buyers will predominantly stick to existing inventory.Â Above the $400,000 mark, there will be a lot of new construction inventory and existing inventory because weâre already in a low-inventory market in general.Considering inventory levels are so low, make sure you make a smart buying decision if you are a homebuyer. By that we mean pay attention to prices as more inventory comes on the market during spring and summer because they may get inflated. Also, remember that interest rates are still low and very competitive.As always, whatever you do, make sure you have an experienced agent on your side. If you have any questions about our market or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home, donât hesitate to reach out to us. Weâd be glad to help you.",

As a buyer looking to buy a home, particularly a first home, it can be intimidating to buy a home in the spring. It may even feel hopeless at times.The benefit of trying the market in an off-peak season is that the buyer is able to explore whatâs out there without all of the competition.Â Shopping for a home in off-peak seasons like fall and winter also increases the likelihood that you will find a home.âYou will be able to explore your options without all of the competition.âIf you are searching for a home this winter, we recommend that you get written verification from sellers regarding certain winterization projects.After all, the AC unit should be shut off and the sprinkler system should be winterized, which means the inspector wonât be able to test them in the winter.

The second is when you have a home to sell in order to purchase a new construction home.When you buy a new build site, itâs important to know that the agent at the model home represents the seller. In this case, the seller is the builder. Itâs important that the consumer realizes that the agent represents the builderâs best interests.As a buyer, if you want to make an offer on a new build property, working with a buyerâs agent can be very important. Weâve seen a lot of people fall in love with all of the beautiful, shiny things that new construction has to offer. In terms of resale, itâs important to work with an agent who works in the existing resale market to figure out what you can do to make the home of value to others in the future should you ever decide to sell it.For example, we often see people put stainless steel appliances and granite countertops above a third garage stall in terms of importance. If youâre building a $500,000 house, the third stall is just an expectation at that point.âAn independent agent will represent your best interests over the builderâs.âThe second component of representation is when you are building a new home but have an existing home that you need to sell first.Oftentimes, the builder wonât begin digging on your new home until you have your existing home under contract. Something to consider when evaluating which agent to sell your home is whether they are independent or work with the builder.An independent agent may have more of a voice for you in terms of your unique situation. They will work to get the best price possible for your home, as well as the best possible terms. An agent who works with the builder is focused on selling your existing home so that you can get into your new house.Ultimately, whether you work with an independent agent or an agent attached to the builder depends on your unique situation.If you have any questions about buying a new construction property, just give us a call or send us an email.

This includes any inspections, repair requests, and bids for the work that needs to be done on those repairs.âThere is no automatic cancellation specified in the purchase agreement anymore.âThe other big change is that if the buyer lets the inspection contingency ride out all the way through without any agreement on repairs from the seller, they can move forward with the houseâthere is no automatic cancellation specified in the purchase agreement.What kind of tests does the inspection contingency cover? Basically, any tests the buyer needs to conduct to satisfy themselves that the home meets their standards.The new inspection contingency also provides access to the buyer to the attic or crawl space of the house. In the past, this was an issue because buyers wanted to get into this area for their inspection but sellers didnât want to break the seal on their attic.

Thereâs a common misconception that in order to get a house, you have to put 20% down.These days, this simply isnât the case. In todayâs market, you have several options available to you.âIn todayâs market, you have several loan options.âThe VA loan, for example, allows veterans to go in with zero down.

Gift funds, too, can apply.To work with Shane and his team, the first thing youâll need to do is fill out an application.

        "content": "What is the Zillow Zestimate?Zillow has an algorithm called the Zestimate that comes up with a homeâs value. There are a few things to watch out for when finding your Zestimate.Although Zillowâs exact formula is unknown, we do know that the Zestimate pulls data from tax records, past sales, and past appreciation rates. Unfortunately, Zestimates often tend to be inaccurate.Recently, Zillow said that the Zestimate is off 6.9% on average from the actual sales price of a home. In our market, Zestimates can be off anywhere from 7% to 10%. Most of the time, Zestimates are off by even more than that. In fact, I looked at our house today and the Zestimate is 20% higher than our homeâs true market value.The Zestimate is not the only valuation model out there. In addition to online, automated home valuation services (which also tend to be inaccurate), there is the tax assessed value, which is what your county or municipality does. They consider your building versus the value of the land.âThe market value used by Realtors is the most accurate value of your home.âThere is also the appraised value. While most people tend to look at the appraised value as an accurate, reliable source, itâs important to keep in mind that the appraised value is based on one personâs opinion on one particular day.Realtors rely on the market value, which is the most accurate value of your property. We use current data, previous data, and future projections to figure out what your home is worth. We also consider things like the location of your lot, your view, the neighborhood, how busy the road is, and what updates you have made to the home. Online valuation tools donât know about the condition of your home, and appraisers donât always examine all of those factors, either.If youâre curious to learn more about Zestimates, hereâs a fun project: Go to Zillow and type in your address. Even if your home is not on the market and youâre not even thinking about selling, Zillow will give you a Zestimate. Then, give us a call or send us an email. Weâll run some numbers and figure out just how accurate your Zestimate really is.Even if youâre not looking to sell your home, it can be fun to know where you stand in the market.So, reach out to us with your Zestimate or any other real estate questions that you may have.

        "content": "Whatâs happening in our local real estate market?If you compare pricing from 2016 to 2017, home prices have gone up 5% in the metro area and across Scott County.Inventory in the metro area is down 16%, while inventory in Scott County is down almost 17.5%. So, what does the absorption rate look like?The absorption rate is how long it would take to sell all of the homes currently on the market if no other homes came on the market. An absorption rate of five to seven months is considered a balanced market, while anything under five months is a sellerâs market. In the metro and Scott County, the absorption rate is in the upper twos, which is even lower than the three months of inventory we had last year.However, the absorption rate is different in each price point. Homes under $350,000 have an absorption rate of 1.7 months. Homes over $350,000 have an absorption rate of five to six months, so there is a more balanced market in those higher price points.âInventory is extremely low under $350,000.âWhat does that mean for our market?If you are trying to buy a home under $250,000, there are a lot of multiple offer situations. Homes priced between $300,000 and $350,000 will move quickly and may also draw multiple offers.For example, last week our buyers made an offer on a home that was priced at $209,000. Even though our offer was $30,000 over the listing price, there were many other offers on the table, and ours was not the highest one.This is a good market for move-up buyers though. You can sell your $300,000 home in a sellerâs market and find a $400,000 home in a balanced market. If you are trying to downsize, though, and you need to sell your current home first, that can be a lot more difficult. There is extremely low inventory in the rambler/townhome demographic.Another important note on inventory is that there are a lot of new construction developments out there offering homes over $450,000. Those new construction homes arenât on the MLS, so those homes do skew the market stats just a bit.Finally, keep in mind that different neighborhoods are in different markets.
