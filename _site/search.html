Before you go and spend any time and money working on things around the house to get it fixed up and ready for sale, talk to an experienced real estate professional who knows about the buyers in your market. They can help you determine the best ways to spend your time and money when updating your home for sale.Clients often invest money in their house before listing, which is nice for them, but theyâre the seller - not the buyer. Whatever they invest in might not be what buyers are looking for in todayâs market. This is why we want our sellers to be laser-focused on the best way to spend the least amount of money to get the top dollar in todayâs market.If you have more questions how to spend money wisely when improving your home, give me a call or send me an email.

So how do you handle multiple offers as a buyer or seller?As a seller, it is very important to get multiple offers in order to drive up the price. With our pricing strategies, we can get you a great offer and promote it to other agents so they have the opportunity to bring other bids in. Drawing multiple offers is a great way to get top dollar for your home.As a buyer, consider writing a personal letter to the seller. Warm, fuzzy letters about your family, kids, pets, and how you connected with the house or neighborhood can really appeal to sellers. It also helps if you introduce yourself to the seller and talk about how much you love the house.Recently, one of my buyerâs agents created a fantastic letter that really won the sellerâs heart. The property had 10 offers on it, but we were able to help them get their dream home!If you have any questions about how to navigate a multiple offer situation, just give us a call or send us an email.

You wonât have to deal with as many multiple offer situations and bidding wars like you did a couple months ago. A lot of buyers who experienced this in the summer have come back to the market and have been able to get the home they want.In addition to the number of options out there, interest rates remain historically low.

        "content": "Thereâs some exciting news for the Los Angeles real estate this January. For starters, interest rates have fallen to right around 3.7%.This will result in buyers coming out sooner than usual. With affordability on the rise, you can expect to see a busy Los Angeles marketplace.Sellers are also making their way onto the market and listing homes in response to the increase in buying power. There usually is not a lot of demand from buyers in January, but 2015 is different, and the market is off to an extremely hot start.Whether youâre a buyer or a seller, itâs a good time to get in the market. Interest rates are as low as theyâve been in 20 months,  causing a flurry of activity in Los Angeles and in the rest of the nation.If you need any assistance, whether youâre buying or selling in LA, please be sure to call or email me. My team of professionals are waiting to hear from you!",

I wanted to talk about home inspections.Home inspections are important for both buyers and sellers, but today I wanted to focus especially on why itâs important for sellers to get an inspection prior to listing their home.Why?A lot of sellers arenât aware of the true health of their home. When was the last time you checked the foundation of your home? What shape is your roof in?Once a seller gets the report on their home, they can make the necessary changes. That way when a buyer makes an offer, you can hand them the report. There also wonât be any surprises when a buyer has their inspector come through.If you have any questions about how to prepare your home for the market, give me a call 818.958.5300Thanks for watching!",
