        "content": "Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, buyers are still buying and sellers are still selling in our market.How have the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent stay-at-home ordinances (which have been extended until the end of May) affected the real estate market?Real estate has been deemed an essential service, and obviously, the health and safety of our clients is our top priority. We can still show homes by appointment only and list them, and while showing homes, we do our utmost to practice social distancing. We canât, however, host open houses or have more than five people inside a house at the same time.Â Donât buy into the myth that homes arenât selling. From April 1 to April 17, 727 new listings hit the market in the Greater Milwaukee area, and 594 homes went under contract. Buyers are still buying, tooâespecially with interest rates this low. Home sales last March increased by 8% to 10% in most areas compared to March 2019. This makes now a good time to sell.Â âWe can still show homes by appointment only and list them, and while showing homes, we do our utmost to practice social distancing.âPrices havenât dropped, either. If anything, weâre seeing multiple offers for homes over their asking price. We just sold a home in the Sussex/Lisbon area that generated four offers, all of which were over asking price.Â Will they eventually go down? Considering everything thatâs happening with the economy. If I were a gambling man, Iâd say, yes, eventually they will go down, given everything thatâs happening with the economy. Everything is based on supply and demand. Right now, supply is low and demand is high, but after the stay-at-home ordinances are lifted, there will be a lot more people listing their homes. When supply rises faster than the demand, thatâs when prices drop, and I predict this drop to happen in three to six months. How far prices will drop is anyoneâs guess.Â If youâre ready to sell or have questions about our market, donât hesitate to reach out to me. My team and I would love to help you.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Hereâs what you should know about how Zillow determines the value of your home and why itâs flawed.With the growing popularity of Zillow and other instant offer sites like it comes one important question: Can you trust Zillowâs estimate of your homeâs value?Â For perspective, Zillow has only been around since 2007; Iâve been in real estate since 1981, so I think I have a leg up on Zillow. In most cases, when Zillow comes up with its valuation (known as a Zestimate), they donât even step foot into your home, they just crunch marketplace data.Â âTo be honest, I donât even think Zillow knows why it changes its figures.âZillow uses an algorithm to estimate home value, and thereâs no way for that algorithm to factor in any improvements youâve made to the property. Iâve had several people ask me, âWell, why did Zillow raise my price,â or, âWhy did Zillow lower my price?â To be honest, I donât even think Zillow knows why it changes its figures.Â The bottom line is this: Donât trust Zillow. What you need to do is get an experienced agent to look at the inherent benefits of and improvements to your home. Here at the Roth Team, we compare what homes like yours have recently sold for with whatâs currently on the market. Then, based on your competition, we position your home so you get the highest price possible.Â Again, donât fret if Zillow gives you an estimate that seems leagues lower than what you feel is right. It almost certainly is too low, so seek out a professional opinion. If youâre thinking of selling a home soon, donât hesitate to reach out to me or someone else on the Roth Team. Weâd be happy to sit down with you and figure out how to get you the most money for your home.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today Iâm sharing my predictions regarding prices, inventory, interest rates and average days on market.To bring you up to speed on our current real estate market, interest rates are still low, and weâre looking at fixed-rate mortgages as low as 3% to 3.5%. Here are my predictions on what the market will do in this new year:Â 1. Interest rates will stay low. The government said it wants to hold interest rates, so I think for at least the next six months you can expect them to stay low, but after thatâyou never know.Â 2. Inventory will increase. As of the beginning of January, weâre seeing the lowest level of single-family homes for sale in the Milwaukee area, less than 4,000. For reference, compare this number to roughly 9,000 homes in January 2015. However, as we head into the spring and summer months, I do expect that we will see an increase.Â âI predict that in 2020 we will see a 3% to 5% increase in prices.â3. Median sale prices will continue to go up. The rise likely wonât be as high as what we saw recently in the Milwaukee area, where prices in some cases increased by 8% to 10%. I predict that in 2020 we will see a 3% to 5% increase in prices. If inventory levels get higher, prices may even level out.Â 4. The average days on market will increase. In most market places, the average days on market is about 30 days. The higher price-range homes (anything from $500,000 to $1 million-plus) are still taking longer to sell and arenât going up in value as much. The average days on market in 2020 will be lengthened by an increase in inventory.Â Itâs a great time to buy a home when you consider how low the interest rates are; if you need pre-approval, contact us and we can get you set up with a lender. Sellers: take advantage of what will be the seventh year of a strong sellerâs market.Â If you would like to get a valuation on your home, give me a call or reach out to anyone at the Roth Team. Weâd be happy to help you.",

        "content": "All sellers want to get the most they can out of their home sale. However, there are some issues associated with listing your home for too high of a price. Today, Iâll be discussing the five dangers of overpricing your property.  An overpriced home will lead to fewer showings. The fewer showings you have, the fewer chances you have to get an offer on your home.  An overpriced home will attract the wrong buyers. Buyers seek out homes based on their price brackets. If your home is missing the features and amenities of other homes within the price range youâve placed it in, buyers are going to notice. Buyers who are looking in a given price range know what they want and expect from homes. You must price your home according to its true value so that you can capture buyers who will be legitimately interested.âOverpricing your home when you put it on the market can be a huge mistake. Today, Iâll explain why.â  An overpriced home helps your competitors.If a buyer looks at your home and then visits another that is priced the same but comes with more features, your competitorâs home will look like a much better deal.  An overpriced home takes longer to sell. In some cases, overpriced homes may not sell at all.  An overpriced home that is later reduced wonât have the same impact. If you lower your homeâs price after it has already been sitting on the market, it will lack the impact of a new home coming onto the market that was priced correctly from the start.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Before saying, âYouâre hired,â when interviewing a real estate agent to represent you, youâll want to be sure they possess the hallmarks of a worthy candidate. To that end, today Iâm sharing three questions you should ask any potential hire:  What is your list-to-sales-price ratio? In our local market, this figure varies considerablyâit could be anywhere from 93% to 95%. On average, our teamâs ratio is at about 97%, which means weâre helping sellers net 2% to 4% more on their sale.  What are you going to do differently to get my home sold? Get an idea of the kind of unique touch theyâll give to marketing your home. Itâs not enough for them to simply put your home on the MLS, stick a sign in your front yard, and hold an open house. You need to know, in no uncertain terms, what theyâll do to sell your home with a high degree of competency.  How many homes have you sold so far this year? Believe or not, the average agent has sold a paltry total of three homes on the year. Unlike the average agent, we at the Roth Team have sold 200 homes and counting in 2019.âYou need to know, in no uncertain terms, what the agent will do to sell your home with a high degree of competency.âGiven that this is the largest financial transaction of your life, itâs infinitely important for you to be happy with the agent you choose to go with.

        "content": "Sellers often ask me, âWhat should I do if a buyer finds a defect in my home? Should I fix the defect, give the buyer a credit, or can I sell the home as-is?âWell, the answer to that question is best determined by you and the buyer. When the buyer hires a professional inspector, that inspector must cite everything they see; if they do find a defect, that must be disclosed on their report to not only that buyer, but also to any other buyer youâre selling to.In most instances as a seller, youâll likely have to fix that defect because most buyers arenât willing to assume that problem, unless you inform them upfront and they have the ability to fix it before they close. Cash buyers may be able to do it after closing, but most lenders will require the defect to be fixed before they actually close.âIn most instances as a seller, youâll likely have to fix that defect because most buyers arenât willing to assume that problem.âBut what happens if sellers donât have the funds to fix the problem before closing? We have contractors we can work with who will figure out where the repair would be done, and then the cost would be taken out of your closing proceeds.Your other option, besides fixing the defect, would be to offer a credit to the buyer. That way, you could proceed with the sale and the buyer could make the repair after closing, assuming their lender will accept them taking that credit.If you have questions about inspections and the defects that are likely to come up on the inspection reports, feel free to reach out to us anytime.

However, when the seller is present at a showing, it can and does make the buyer a little uncomfortable. If youâre not there, theyâll be more comfortable, honest, and open. If youâre there, the buyer might be afraid to give that honest feedback because they donât want to offend you.âLet the agent handle the selling of your home.âYou donât have to be gone when they get there, but leave during the showing for a half hour or hour. You also want to make sure all the lights are on and all the blinds are open so you get as much natural daylight as possible in the house.In the end, let the agent handle the selling of your home.

        "content": "The homebuying process can be complicated, but itâs compounded when the buyer acts without the proper knowledge of what theyâre doing. They may seem like common sense to avoid, but believe it or not, the following 10 mistakes to avoid have actually happened in transactions:  Financing new purchases after applying for a mortgage. You absolutely do not want to make any other major purchases while youâre in the process of getting a mortgage for a home, including a car, furniture, or the like. This will affect your credit, possibly damaging your chances of getting a mortgage altogether.  Applying for new credit. Â Do not apply for any other type of credit during the process, be it for a different loan or a new credit card.  Racking up credit card debt. Avoid increasing your current debt on your credit card(s) or risk sending up red flags in your mortgage lenderâs eyes.  Changing jobs or reducing your hours. Keep your current job and hours, if at all possible.  Switching banks or making large transfers. Your down payments will need to be verified at the bank you had when you applied for your home loan; switching banks will derail the process. Large transfers can also be suspicious to lenders.  Making late credit card, installment, or utility payments. The key to great credit is consistent, timely payments; late payments bring your score on your report down.  Co-signing on a loan for anyone. Even if that other person is a family member or a loved one, co-signing on a loan while youâre in the mortgage process will affect your ability to get a loan yourself.  Neglecting to list your debt on your loan application. It will show up on your credit report regardless, so be upfront when you apply for your loan.  Making large deposits into your bank account. Your lender will need to verify where those funds came from.  Spending your closing moneyâ¦before closing. Believe it or not, this happened to a buyer during a transaction. That money needs to be set aside for the purchase of the home and spending it early defeats the purpose and only hurts your ability to buy that home.If you can avoid these 10 home buying mistakes once your offer is accepted and you begin applying for financing, the entire process should go over smoothly for you.âAvoid increasing your current debt on your credit card(s) or risk sending up red flags in your mortgage lenderâs eyes.âFor any questions about these mistakes or about home financing in general, please feel free to reach out to us.

You only have to get your house ready to show when you leave. You donât have to constantly clean and get out of the home for showings at the drop of a hat.âThe more eyes we can get on your home, the better.â2. Your home is more accessible.

        "content": "A lot of our clients have been asking us if they should wait until spring to sell their home. Truthfully, there are quite a few things they can take advantage of in the market by selling now. Here are five reasons to sell now instead of waiting until spring:1. Homes are still selling every day. In the next 90 days, we expect to sell over 3,000 single-family homes in the greater metro area. In November and December of last year and January of this year, there were over 3,3000 single-family homes sold.2. Interest rates. Iâm sure youâve heard that the Fed is raising rates. Theyâve gone up this year, but are still around 4.25% to 5%. However, we will likely see rates increase by 0.75% to 1% in the next year, making homes significantly less affordable.3. Buyers are more serious now. The buyers who are out in this kind of market arenât looky-loos. They are looking to capture a low interest rate and get a deal done now.âYouâre going to have less competition around this time of year than you will in the spring.â4. Itâs the time to sell your relocation-type property. This is the time of year when many corporations are offering jobs to relocation buyers and they have to buy now in order to move at the beginning of next year. Theyâre going to want to get a deal done quickly.5. Common sense. I call it supply and demand. Youâre going to have less competition around this time of year than you will in the spring. In the spring, the market will be flooded with 20% to 30% more inventory. When buyers have more choices, the process of selling a home becomes more difficult.If youâre considering selling your home at all in the next year, I urge you to give us a call or send us an email today so we can assess your personal situation and determine what the best course of action is.

I was looking at some statistics from our MLS recently and discovered five things I think you should all be aware of:1. The number of listings is down. This is true for all the various counties in our local market. Milwaukee County is down about 8%, Waukesha County is down about 7%, Ozaukee County is down 8.6%, Washington County is down 11.1%, Walworth County is down 11.5%, and Racine County is down 8.3%. So, as you can see, there are fewer options available these days for buyers.2. Sales are still up. Despite the lack of listings, sales are up across our market with the exception of Waukesha and Walworth County.âWhether youâre thinking of buying or selling, now is a great time to do so.â3. The average days on market are down. The average days on market is approximately 39 for the entire area. A year ago, the average days on market was around 10 to 15 days higher than this.4. Median sale prices are up. In Milwaukee County, prices have risen about 5%, for a median sales price of $162,500. In Waukesha County, prices are up over 5%. There, the median sales price is $295,000. Ozaukee Countyâs median sales price is up to $300,000, having risen 7% over last year. In Washington County, the median sales price is nearly $249,500, which represents a whopping 17% increase over last year. Walworth Countyâs median sales price rose 12% to $213,000, and Racine County is up an astounding 26%, for a current median sales price of $178,000.5. Interest rates are on the rise. This is something youâve probably already heard. Yet, you should note that itâs still affordable to purchase a home. Right now, you can still get a 30-year fixed mortgage for about 4.5% or 4.75%. With that in mind, though, the Feds are set to raise rates a few more times by the end of the year.

Only 1% of all buyers come from open houses. Iâve been in this business 37 years. Iâve done hundreds of open houses and I can count on my two hands the number of buyers that actually purchased a house they walked into during the open house.Â 2. You tend to get buyers who are just lookers, or looky-loos. You also get nosy neighbors who want to know what your house looks like, people looking for decorating ideas, or other neighbors who want to sell their home and want an idea of how to price it.Â 3. We canât pre-qualify the buyers.Â Even if buyers go to the open house, they may not be able to afford it. They may not be ready to buy because their house isnât on the market. You simply donât get qualified buyers.Â âYou donât get qualified buyers at an open house.â4. Most buyers are working with a professional Realtor. As a result, they will see your home by appointment. Showings are key.Â 5. Your home shows better online. We have our photographer take some great listing photos so buyers can see your home online without having to go to an open house. Your house often looks better in those pictures than in person.Â 6.

Here are seven tips that will help you get your home sold:1. Have buyers and agents come through your front door. Your home always presents itself better this way because youâre entering through the largest room in your house.2. Get the most use out of your natural light. During daytime showings, have all your blinds pulled up or at least open. Your home shows best with natural daylight.Â 3. Have lights on in rooms that donât have enough natural light. Maybe you have a basement or attic room with a small window. Have all the lights on in these rooms during showings.âBe conscious of any odors that may be unpleasant.â4. Leave the home during showings. When the homeowner isnât present at the showing, we find that buyers ask more questions, show more emotion, and are more likely to buy when you arenât there.5. Make sure your pets are gone as well. Get any evidence of any pet out of your house while youâre at it. Donât get rid of them for good, just during the showings.6. Be careful of odors. Be conscious of any odors that might come from pets, smoke, or food. We donât recommend trying to cover up any of these odors. Some buyers will think youâre covering things up.Â 7. Always say yes to an appointment showing. This is the most important tip. You never know when the right buyer for your home will come across. A buyer who makes an appointment showing is a motivated buyer who is ready to buy.Â If you want to sell your home quickly, these are some great tips to get it ready for a showing.

United van lines can move people all around the world. Here in town, we can move people locally as well as all around the United States.2. âWhat does a typical move cost?â For something like a 2,500 square foot home, a local move could cost anywhere from $500 to $3,000, depending on the services you request and how far youâre moving. For a farther move, like from Greater Milwaukee to Atlanta, costs could range from $1,500 to $10,000.3. âWhat are the variables for those costs?âÂ The type of service and the amount of stuff moved will affect the cost. Whether youâre only bringing personal possessions or youâre bringing all of your furniture will vary the expense, as well as if you need temporary storage space. Thatâs why we try to get our sales representatives out of the house and take a look at the situation. Then we can give them a price estimate right then and there. Another factor is that our company is insured, so any potential damages will be covered.âThe type of service and the amount of stuff moved will affect the cost.â4. âWhat types of storage options do you have?â We have different sizes of moving containers that we ship on our trucks, which are especially useful if people donât have that much.5. âWhen are you the busiest? How far in advance should someone contact you?âThe busiest moving times are between April and September. In that period, we probably would need three or four weeksâ notice. As we get into the fall and winter, weâre pretty flexible.6. âIf someone wanted an estimate, how could they reach you?â Our phone number is(262) 446-4709, so call me and I can provide you with whatever information you may need.If you have any questions about moving or selling your home, feel free to reach out to us at the Roth Team.

It has to be straightened and braced instead. If a wall has moved more than one inch off of the foundation, excavation repairs are going to be necessary.âIf you have foundation problems, these are the guys to call.âIf youâre having problems with your basement or know somebody who is, you canât do better than these guys.

        "content": "What can you expect from the 2018 real estate market? Based on my 37 years of experience in the real estate industry, I believe these four things are going to happen:1. Interest rates will rise. Interest rates already went up in December of 2017, but the government announced that they will raise rates two or three more times. These will not be substantial increases, but we could see fixed rate mortgages go from 4% to 5% or 5.5%.2. Inventory levels will increase as a result of the rate increase. Although inventory usually increases by 20% to 25% each spring, we will see even higher inventory levels this summer and fall.3. Home prices will start to level off as inventory increases. Prices have been going up since 2012. In some marketplaces, prices increased above the peak we saw in 2006. As a result, I believe that we will see these prices level off in the next six to 12 months.âHome prices will start to level off as inventory levels increase.â4. The average days on market will go up. Some areas have an average days on market of less than 30 or 45 days. By the end of 2018, we will see the average days on market get back to the normal range, which is somewhere between 90 to 120.If you are thinking of buying or selling in 2018, these are important things that youâll want to plan for. If you are thinking of selling, now is the time. If you are thinking of buying, youâll want to buy before interest rates go up.If you have any other questions about real estate, just give me a call or send me an email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "If youâre selling your home, why should you hire a full-service brokerage like the Roth Team instead of a limited-service, discount broker? There are four points you need to remember.1. Exposure and resources. At Shorewest, we have 900 agents who each get paid a 25% bonus if they sell your home versus one that just got listed on the MLS. We have the resources for relocation buyers moving in and out of town through corporations and our contacts with other national real estate companies. Discount brokers donât have these same resources.We also offer active marketing. Thereâs a difference between listing your home and passively waiting for a buyer to show up and actively finding a buyer. Speaking for myself and the Roth Team, we actively and aggressively market your home to the buying public every day.2. Professionalism. When youâre selling your home, you want someone who will answer the phone at their office and return your calls. Many discount brokerages will leave you talking to an answering machine most of the time. Follow-through like that is the biggest reason why we sell more homes.3. Negotiation skills.Â Think of it this wayâif a discount agent is so quick to give up their commission for you, how quick will they be to give up your price to the buyer? On average, we net our homeowners 2% more on their sale price than limited-service brokers because they donât have the skill and knowledge to negotiate a good price on your behalf.âOur service nets home sellers more money than limited-service, discount brokers.â4. Results.Â In 2016, 16 of our limited service brokerage competitors sold 2,500 homes combined. Our company sold over 12,000. We outsold them five-to-one.There is a reason people use our serviceâit works, and it gets them more money.If you have any more questions about how we can net you more money in your home sale than a limited-service, discount broker, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

        "content": "Iâm joined by Chris Mancuso, the owner of Accurate Basement Repair. Chris has been in the basement repair business for over a decade and helped hundreds of customers all throughout eastern Wisconsin.Today, weâll go over a few common questions buyers and homeowners alike have about their basements.As a buyer, what concerns should you look for in the basement?Itâs important to look at the walls and the floor. You should also go outside the home to check on the grading, gutters, and downspouts.When you enter the basement, Chris recommends using a flashlight so that you can focus on each area of the basement.In the video above, the basement weâre in already has reinforcements installed. The previous owner must have put these in to deal with a structural issue. These steel columns were installed to hold the walls in place.You should look for any cracks, structural issues, and water intrusion.What kind of cracks should you be concerned about?Not all cracks are bad cracks. Almost every basement has some kind of crack in the wall.For example, there is a vertical crack in the wall in this basement. Chris says that this is a settlement crack from years ago, and that he didnât see any recent movement that would affect the structure upstairs.As a homeowner, you should always have a professional come out to determine which cracks you should be concerned about. Common concerns would be any cracks that come off the window ledges and long, horizontal cracks. The cracks by the window could indicate that the wall is tilting inward, while long, horizontal cracks indicate bowing in the wall. Both of these issues have to be fixed, but they are each addressed a little differently.âYou should always have a professional come out to assess a crack in the basement.âWhat is the acceptable standard for movement of a wall? What do you do to fix the wall if it is bowing beyond that standard?This year, the state of Wisconsin did issue a code for wall instructions. That is good news for buyers, as inspectors now have a code to look at.If there is cracking in the wall with less than an inch of displacement, you will need to install the vertical steel bars we mentioned earlier. If there is more than an inch of displacement, youâre also looking at excavation, wall strengthening, and reinforcements to repair the issue. Accurate Basement Repair can give you estimates and help you with all of these repairs.Why should you be concerned about water intrusion if youâve never had water in the basement?There are a lot of preventative measures you can take to make sure that you never get water in your basement. You might not have noticed any water pooling anywhere, but if you are suffering from wet sock syndrome, there is some water in your basement.You should also look for efflorescence (or discoloration) on your basement walls. This could indicate a drain tile issue or a grading and downspout problem, as is the case with this property.Thanks to Chris for stopping by today. If you have any questions for him or if you would like him to inspect your basement, you can give him a call at 414-744-6900 or check out Accurate Basement Repairâs website.As always, if you have any real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Zillowâs Zestimates can be deeply flawed when it comes to determining your homeâs value. Hereâs what you should do instead.I get a lot of questions from people asking me if they should trust the value that Zillow gave their home.To answer that, let me share a few facts with you about Zillow. As a company, they started in 2006. Prior to that, they werenât involved in the real estate market. Last time I checked, they havenât sold any homes, either.Zillow is basically a company that collects whatever data they can find and then puts it into their website to determine home values. The one thing Zillow canât account for is the upgrades or special features of your home. Think of it this way: has Zillow been in your home? Of course not.Zillowâs estimates, called Zestimates, are determined by an algorithm based on comparable homes sales. In the greater Milwaukee metro area, Zestimates can be off by as much as 10% or more. Zillow even admitted that 46% of the time their Zestimates were off by at least 5% or more.ZILLOWâS ZESTIMATES CAN BE OFF BY AS MUCH AS 10% OR MORE.As you mightâve heard by now, a homeowner in Illinois actually filed a lawsuit against Zillow because they claimed their Zestimate harmed their home sale. This may yet turn into a class action lawsuit. Zillow knows they have a problem, and theyâve gone as far as offering a $1 million prize to anyone who can fix their algorithm.In the 11 years since Zillow has been around, whenever I get calls from prospective buyers about homes theyâve found on Zillow, Iâve found that 35% of the time their information is inaccurate. Our websiteâs information, on the other hand, is 98% accurate.Taking all of this into account, I wouldnât put much credo into Zillowâs Zestimate. If you really want to know the value of your home, call a professional Realtor. We can physically look at your home and all of its upgrades and features to provide an accurate valuation.If you have any questions about Zillow or you want to know the real value of your home, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "category": "",
        "content": "To win a multiple offer situation as a buyer in our Greater Milwaukee market, I have seven tips for you to follow.In our current market, if you see a home you like thatâs a hot property in a favorable price range, there could be multiple offers for it.If you find yourself in this situation and have to compete with other buyers, here are seven things you can do to make your offer the best of the bunch:1. Make sure the seller knows youâre qualified. The best way to do this is to get a pre-approval letter (not a pre-qualification letter) from your lender and submit it along with your offer for at least the mortgage amount or higher.2. Submit a large earnest money deposit. A normal deposit in todayâs market is 1% of the purchase price, so make yours 2%, 3%, or even 5% of the purchase price. If your offer doesnât get accepted, youâll get that money back anyway.3. Find out from your agent whatâs important to the seller. Do they prefer an earlier or later closing date? Do they want certain items excluded from the sale? Your agent can find these things out by talking to the listing agent prior to you making your offer.4. Give the seller time to move. I understand you want to move in as fast as possible, but normal closings take about 45 days, so if youâre expecting them to be out in 20 to 30 days, thatâs unrealistic unless itâs a vacant property.5. Consider shortening or waiving some of the contingencies you have. For example, instead of waiting two or three weeks to do a home inspection, do it within seven days. If you think the property is good enough as it is, consider waiving the inspection altogether. The fewer contingencies you bring, the better chance your offer has of being accepted.6. Let the seller know you love their house. I suggest writing a brief letter to the seller outlining why you love their house and why they should pick you to be its buyer. And rememberâbe sincere.âMAKE YOUR FIRST OFFER YOUR HIGHEST AND BEST ONE.â7. Make a good offer. Make your highest and best offer now because you may not get countered. Excuse the listing price and have your agent do a comparative market analysisâsometimes properties are priced below market value, and you may have to offer thousands of dollars more to get that property.If you have any questions about getting your next home in todayâs competitive market, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

Eric Clark from Lifetime Radon Solutions is here with us to talk a little bit about radon gas, what it is, and how you can treat it if the levels of radon in your home get too high.Radon is an invisible, odorless, colorless gas. We know itâs there, but we donât know itâs there. Itâs a naturally occurring radioactive gas that comes from uranium in the soil and is concentrated in the home. The midwest is notorious for high levels of radon. Wisconsin is right up there.Radon canât be seen or smelled, but it can be measured and it can have consequences. Behind smoking, radon gas is the 2nd leading cause of lung cancer in the U.S. Every house has radon, itâs just a matter of how much. The EPA recommends action for any radon levels above 4 pCi/L.âA SOLUTION TO A DANGEROUS PROBLEM.âLifestyle Radon Solutions offers radon mitigation systems and they can install them in a number of ways. They draw the radon gas out from the home by creating a negative pressure that gets the gas out before it even enters the home. They guarantee that your radon levels will be below 4 pCi/L with one of their systems.The price range for one of these systems is anywhere from $845 to $1305.So even if you have high radon levels in your home, it is fixable.

Getting a home warranty offers many advantages to a home seller.For example, we work with a company out of Madison called Home Security of America. They provide warranties on the sale of used or existing homes just like a builder would on a new construction home. Typically, a builder would cover you for one year after closing, and the same thing applies with Home Security of Americaâs warranty.âGETTING A HOME WARRANTY HELPS SELL YOUR HOUSE.âTheir warranty covers any major problem with the plumbing, the electrical, the heating, the air conditioning, the appliances in the house, etc. The seller also gets free coverage while the home is listed for plumbing, electrical, and the water heater. On a single-family home, the cost for full coverage is typically $564.The most obvious benefit of getting a home warranty is that it helps sell your home. If your home has a warranty and one of the other properties your prospective buyer is looking at doesnât, that may sway them to buy yours. Secondly, getting a home warranty provides is peace of mindânot just for the buyer, but for you too.

Overpricing the home: Thereâs a fine line between getting the best price and asking too much and selling too cheaply in the end. Get a professionalâs opinion on the value of your house and listen to them!3. Not making simple repairs to their home like cleaning and new paint: Some sellers donât even want to replace minor things like missing fixtures or handrails. A good agent can advise you on what to repair.4. Too much clutter: We all have too much stuff, so get rid of all that clutter when selling.âGIVE BUYERS AN ENVIRONMENT THAT LETS THEM OPEN UP TO THEIR AGENT ABOUT YOUR HOME.â5. Not allowing adequate access: Most buyers will want to see your home by appointment, and sometimes they might want to see it on shorter than a dayâs notice. Let them in; theyâre ready, willing, and able buyers.6. Staying during a showing: You want to leave while a buyer looks at your home so they have an environment where they can open up to their agent and ask questions without feeling like theyâre intruding on your privacy.7.

Rates can be as high as 4.25% and as low as 3.5%.In real terms, this rise in rates means that if you took out a 30-year mortgage on a $250,000 home, you would pay as much as $100 more each month and pay an additional $35,000 over the life of the mortgage.

Get the pet(s) out of the home before showings. Whether buyers love or hate your pet, they are going to be a distraction during the showing. The best thing to do is have a doggy daycare, a family member, friend, or neighbor watch the pet while there is a showing going on. If you have no other option but to keep them in the house, make sure they are put in a kennel.2. Hide evidence of pets. This includes food and water bowls, leashes, and toys. Eliminate any pictures of your pets and other signs that suggest you have them.3. Clean up any pet mess. Be conscious of their hair, stains, and any other damage they may have caused in your house.4. Remove any odors. Ask your agent or someone who doesnât come to your house regularly if they notice any pet odors. If they do, fix it. Odors can linger in places like the carpet, a bed, or furniture. Clear those odors out with fresh air as opposed to air freshener.âODORS CAN LINGER IN CARPET OR FURNITURE.â5. Prepare your yard.

Are all CPAs the same? Are all doctors the same? Of course not.So, how can you make sure that you hire the right real estate agent? I recommend asking them these five questions:1. How many homes have you sold so far this year? You should also ask how many homes they sold the previous year. Why? The average agent sells fewer than three homes in a calendar year, which means that they probably donât know much about real estate. At the Roth Team, weâve sold 175 homes so far this year; last year, we sold 236 homes.2. What is your average list to sales price ratio? In other words, how close is the purchase price to the asking price? Some agents offer a lower commission because they will give your house away. They let the buyer negotiate the price down. Our average list to sales price ratio is 98.4%, which is very close to asking price.âYOU NEED AN EXPERIENCED AGENT WHO WORKS FULL-TIME.â3. What is the average days on market for the homes you list and sell? Of course, if it takes an agent six months to a year to sell homes, they are wasting time and money. This year, our homes spent an average of 48 days on the market.4. How many years of experience do you have? Do they have another job? Quite honestly, many agents do not make enough money to support their income in real estate. Many agents have less than three to five years of experience in the market. Iâve been doing this full-time for 35 years. Experience counts; it can really make a difference when it comes to selling your home.5. How many people will you talk to every day to sell my home? Every agent puts your home on the MLS, throws it on a few websites, and takes out an ad in the paper. Some agents may even hold open houses. However, those methods are not good enough. They need to personally contact potential buyers every day. We call that active marketing. Our team contacts as many as 100 people a day to get your home sold.If you have any other questions about real estate, please donât hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. My team and I would be happy to help you!",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "There are four major mistakes that buyers make during the process of buying a home. These are general mistakes that buyers make whether theyâre buying their first, second, or third home:1. Not getting pre-approved for financing before looking at homes. This process is very simple: contact a local lender and, within 48 hours, you can get pre-approved over the phone or Internet. There is no cost or obligation, so I highly recommend you do this first. Youâll also know what you can afford and what the costs are. Smart sellers will require you to have a pre-approval letter anyway.2. Getting pre-approved by on out-of-state or online lender. With these lenders, you canât talk to them in person. Your lender is someone youâll want to have face-to-face contact with. I see a lot of people using these online services because they offer a cheaper rate, and itâs a big mistake. Iâve heard too many horror stories about these lenders not being able to process a loan in time. Call your real estate agent for a recommendation for a local bank or mortgage company.3. Not having a full-time agent. You want someone who does this as their full-time job actively looking for homes with you. There are all kinds of online searches you can use, like Zillow and Trulia, that are not very accurate and are not rated well by the Better Business Bureau. You want to have a full-time agent looking with you because many times that agent knows about listings before even going online.4. Not having an experienced agent writing the offer and negotiating on your behalf. Many buyers just pick any agent or work with the listing agent of the home theyâre buying. You want someone who is working on your behalf to write the offer with your best interests in mind, and then negotiate the best price for you.If you have any questions about the home buying process or youâre interested in buying a home, give us a call or send us an email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Fall is here and a lot of people are asking, &ldquo;Should I sell my home now or wait until the spring?&rdquo; I believe there are four reasons why it would be better to sell your home now rather than waiting for spring. In my opinion, the number one reason to sell now is to take advantage of low interest rates. Rates are hovering in the 2.9% to 3.5% range, which is practically free money. I don&rsquo;t anticipate those rates staying low much longer. Why not? It&rsquo;s an election year. I have been through eight elections already and, after each one, rates typically go up. The government holds rates down to make their party more favorable; once the election is over, rates will go up. It is highly likely that rates will be higher next spring. That&rsquo;s the second reason you should sell now because higher rates do affect your home sale.Interest rates are low, but they will go back up soon. Another reason you should sell now is the low inventory. In some of our marketplaces, we&rsquo;re seeing as little as 30 to 90 days of inventory available on the market. A couple of years ago, those inventory levels were significantly higher, with six months of inventory available. There will be more homes on the market in spring, which means you will wind up competing with more sellers. Since inventory levels are low now, you&rsquo;ll have a better chance of selling your home.  Finally, in my opinion, the seller&rsquo;s market is coming to an end. I have been doing this for 35 years and I&rsquo;ve talked to brokers all over the United States and they agree. In fact, certain markets like California and Florida are already seeing the seller&rsquo;s market change. Inventory levels have gone up to 180 days and prices are not going up any higer. If you are thinking of selling your home, you should sell now before the seller&rsquo;s market ends. In short, selling your home this fall is actually more advantageous than waiting for spring. If you have any questions about preparing your home for the fall market or about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. My team and I would be happy to help you!",

        "content": "Many homeowners want to know what their home is worth before they put it on the market. How do buyers determine the value of your home? In other words, how is market value determined?First, though, there are a few misconceptions about home value that I would like to clear up:      Home value is not based on what you want or need to pay off your loan amount.&nbsp;        Home value is not based on what your neighbors think you should get for your home. After all, neighbors are biased.&nbsp;        Your tax assessed value does not reflect market value. Tax assessed values can be off by as much as 20%.&nbsp;        The appraised value is not the same as market value. If you have an appraisal that is a year old, it is based on outdated information.&nbsp;        Home value is different from your insurance value. Insurance companies insure the house for the rebuilding or replacement cost, which is much higher than market value.&nbsp;        Sites like Zillow cannot determine home value with just a computer algorithm.&nbsp;  Home buyers determine the market value of your property by looking at the features and benefits of your home (how many bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, etc.) and compare your property to other homes on the market. They look at recently sold properties similar to yours to see what your home is worth.What have similar homes in your area sold for?

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "What are the benefits of using a home warranty to sell your home? Our company and team actually use another company called Home Security of America (HSA), and they provide warranties on the sale of existing or used homes. This coverage actually covers all the mechanical systems in a home, such as plumbing, electrical, heating, air conditioning, water heater, and even the appliances that are included in the sale of the home. It covers the buyer for up to one year after closing. On a single-family home, the cost of the coverage would be $564. If it was a condominium, the cost would be $535. The buyer is then able to extend that beyond a year after they buy it.&ldquo;A home warranty makes a buyer feel more comfortable.&rdquo;Many of our sellers are using this as a marketing tool to sell their home. If they do provide it up front, the seller actually gets free coverage on items while the home is listed for sale. For example, we just had a client who had a water heater replaced while the home was listed and got a brand new one for a nominal deductible of $100. There are two main benefits:      First, it&rsquo;s a great marketing tool. If your home has a warranty and another competing property doesn&rsquo;t, that may make the buyer feel more comfortable in buying the one with a warranty. Plus, all new construction has a builder&rsquo;s warranty for one year.         Secondly, it adds peace of mind. This is especially true in cases where a seller may have older components in their property, such as an older furnace, air conditioning, plumbing, or electrical. All of that is covered for the buyer for up to one year after closing. They also don&rsquo;t have to actually replace these components. If you have a 20-year-old furnace that still works, you can keep the furnace and offer a home warranty!   If you have any questions about the home warranty or how the process works, please give us a call at the Roth Team and hopefully we can answer them. Thanks, and have a great day. ",

Well, I have a list of five reasons why NOW is the time to buy.      Â Â  Prices are increasing. Median prices in the greater Milwaukee have gone up in some areas as much as 10 percent and they are continuing to increase.        Â Â  Interest rates are still historically low. Although, rates have increased by about a point, they are still lower than we could hope for! When my wife and I bought our first house, we had an option of 18.5 percent fixed rate mortgage!        Â Â  Itâs easier to get a mortgage. Banks and lenders are soliciting money for buyers to purchase a home. If you have a job, good credit score and a good down payment, you can buy a home!        Â Â  Itâs still cheaper than renting. Renting has gone sky high. That means you would be paying the same amount to rent as to buy! And if you rent you donât get all the tax benefits as a homeowner would!        Â Â  You arenât competing with as many investors. When foreclosures and short sales were occurring more often, a lot of investors were involved in the market. Now, you donât have as much of that competition.  These are five reasons you shouldnât wait to buy a home! Please call me if you have any questions or if you are thinking about buying and selling!",

        "content": "In our current market, where prices are increasing a little bit each year, sellers want to get as much as they possibly can for their home. However, in order to get top dollar, you need to be strategic when putting a value on your property. Letâs take a look at the 6 dangers of putting too high a price on your home:1. Fewer showings: Buyers look in price brackets - if you price your home well above what itâs worth, you are losing a lot of potential buyers who will simply pass it up. Â 2. Help out your competitors: When buyers pass up your home, they look at other homes on the market. If homes similar to yours are priced much lower, buyers will have no problem making an offer on your competitorâs home.Â 3. Generate most interest within first 30 days: Starting high and coming down later may sound like a foolproof plan, but you are losing out on a lot of buyers by waiting to price your home fairly. The first 30 days are crucial for generating interest in your home - you donât want to miss that opportunity.Â 4. Attract the wrong buyers:Because buyers search for homes according to their price bracket, your home will be compared to homes with more features and benefits. The people that will appreciate your home wonât be looking at it.Â 5. Your home takes longer to sell:When your home sits on the market for a long time, buyers and agents alike start to wonder if there is something wrong with it. Â 6. Buyers negotiate a lower price: Since your home sat on the market for so long, buyers think they can submit a low offer and buy your home at a low price.Consider these 6 points when putting a price on your home. Itâs a matter of balancing the desire to get a high price and the need to attract buyers to your home. If you have any questions about the pricing process, feel free to give us a call.

The same works in reverse: if youâre a buyer who doesnât like the sellerâs offer, you can rework the offer to fit your needs and resubmit it to the seller. Counter offers are a nice tool to use when buying or selling real estate.

Many of our clients use these to help sell their home. They are attractive to buyers because they cover heating, air conditioning, plumbing, electrical, and appliances. Essentially, warranties cover the guts of your home, not the structural items like roofs, basements, and windows.Â Home warranties cover the buyer for one year from the day of closing. Plus, the seller gets free coverage while they are listing. Homeowners use warranties as a selling feature. For instance, if you have a home warranty on your home, but the three other homes that buyers are looking at do not have a warranty, your home will be viewed in a much more favorable light.Warranties provide buyers and sellers with peace of mind. If something happens after closing, the buyer isnât going going to call the person who sold them the home, theyâre going to call the home warranty company, who will then come out and fix the problem. The basic single-family home warranty, which covers all the entities in your home, is about $564. Deductibles range from $75-$100, depending on the plan you go with.If you have any questions about home warranties, or if you need real estate assistance of any kind, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

One question is âWill relisting my home affect its overall value?âI donât think it does, and hereâs why. When we relist your home, the âdays on marketâ that shows how long your home has been listed, is reset to 0. So if you had listed your home previously for 100 days and it didnât sell, when we relist itâs going to show up like a new listing. Therefore, most buyers will have no idea that your home previously failed to sell.Â Another question Iâve been getting a lot is, âWould my previous list price affect my homeâs value today?â It depends. Many sellers improve the condition of their home and that could affect the value positively. The other thing that affects your value is marketing, and if your agent isnât taking the right approach, you wonât get as many eyes on the property as you should.So just because youâve listed your home before, it doesnât mean you are doomed to suffer the consequences.

        "content": "Hey everyone, thanks for joining us once again. Today we want to discuss a question we get a lot from clients: Why should I sell my house now vs. waiting for the spring or summer to make a move?Â Â There are a lot of reasons you should consider selling now instead of in a few months. Today we are going to give you our top 5, so you can make a decision before your grass gets green and the spring is in full swing.Â 1. The transfer market is extremely activeThis is the time of year that people who were offered jobs at the end of 2014 are looking for homes to move into, and they wonât want to wait until summer to buy your home. They are in the market for a home right now, and are desperate to get a good home.Â 2. You can change the closing dateWhen you sell your home in the early months of the year, you can delay your closing date until the summer. By the time your home goes through the entire closing process, it will be late spring or early summer, so you wonât be rushed to find a new home right away.3. Homes are selling every dayIn the last 60 days alone, over 1,300 single-family homes have sold in the Metro Area. The Roth Team has sold over 55 of those homes by ourselves.Â 4. Buyers have fewer optionsInventory is very low right now, and buyers are gobbling up the best homes almost as soon as they come on the market. Right now, there is a 25% deficit in inventory from where we usually are at, and the demand has only increased so far.Â 5. Interest rates will rise soonRight now is the perfect time to take advantage of our low interest rates. Instead of waiting until later in the year and having to deal with 5-6% interest rates, you can secure an interest rate right now between 3% and 4%, saving you tens of thousands in interest over the life of your loan.If you are thinking about making a move and have any questions, we are always here to answer them. Give us a call or send us an email, and we will get back to you soon! We canât wait to hear from you!",

        "content": "Today I thought I would speak about multiple offer situations. With the market improving here in Milwaukee these types of situations are becoming more and more common. To help you combat this competitive market, I thought I would provide you with some tips on how to make the best offer to a seller.&nbsp;Get Pre-Approved from a Lender: There is a difference between being approved and being qualified. Make sure you're pre-approved because this will make you much more attractive in the eyes of sellers. In a competitive market, you need to prove that you will be able to pay for a home. Write Your Best Offer: A seller will likely not counter your offer in a crowded market, so write your highest and best offer. They will only be looking for the highest offer. We've seen buyers in Milwaukee offer above the asking price, and they are still being rejected by the sellers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accommodate the Seller: You are in a captive market here in Milwaukee. You must always aim to please the seller. One way to do this would be to agree to the seller's moving date. This will make the seller pleased and will improve your chances of getting the property that you want. If you need to, allow the seller to continue living in the home after closing and offer them post-occupancy.&nbsp;Exclude Contingencies: If you can buy a home without selling your own, or remove any other contingencies from your offer, it would make for a much stronger, more attractive offer to the seller. Waive inspections and appraisals on newer properties if you feel comfortable in doing so.&nbsp; Write a Personalized Letter: We call this a 'love letter' where you simply let the seller know how much you love their home and how you plan to keep it in great condition. This would include why you would be the best buyer for the property. Also tell them why your offer is a good offer. &nbsp;Hopefully these tips can help your offer get accepted if you're struggling to find a home in the Milwaukee market. Competition is tough right now, so if you need any assistance whatsoever please don't hesitate to contact me. I would love to arrange a time where we can sit down and discuss all of your needs.Thanks for tuning in!",

        "category": "",
        "content": "As we head into the beginning of 2014, a question I usually get this time of year from clients who have either bought homes or are selling homes is, âHow to I change or fight my real estate tax assessment?â They may think the assessment is either too high or too low. Unfortunately, itâs not as easy as just calling the assessor in your city and town telling them your taxes are too high. They have specific scripts theyâre going to give you on why they canât change your taxes, and theyâre pretty good at it!What you actually have to do is make a formal adjustment and this is allowed in the beginning of the year. Most municipalities require you to do this before April and in some cases, March or May. What you want to do is call them and tell them you want to make a formal adjustment to your tax assessment. You will need to bring an independent appraisal that shows your tax assessment is too high or too low or some comparable sales of similar homes in your neighborhood. As a client watching this video, this is something we can help you with here at the Roth Team.Speaking with personal experience, when you go into the formal meeting you have to show the city assessor the comparable sales. Another good basis for you is that if you have recently purchased the home within the last year or two, you can use the purchase price that you paid for the home as the basis. However you will still need comparable sales or an independent bank appraisal.By doing that, you will get your tax assessment adjusted to todayâs value which could decrease your taxes if the assessment goes down or raise your taxes if your assessment goes up (which I wouldnât recommend). Again, to do this you want to make a formal adjustment with the local municipality.If you have any questions about this, please give us a call at (262) 797-6453. Thanks and have a great day!",

        "content": "10 Reasons Why You Should Sell During the Winter Months!Today I wanted to speak with you about a big topic this time of year which is whether or not you should sell your home during the holiday season. To answer this, I have ten great reasons why now is the time to list and sell your home! There are a lot of myths out there that homes donât sell during the winter months, but the reality tells us something different. According to our MLS statistics in the Greater Milwaukee Metro Area from December 2012-February 2013, there were almost 2,500 single family homes that went under contract.The ten great reasons to sell now are outlined below:      Â Â  People who are looking for homes this time of year are more serious buyers.        Â Â  The serious buyers have fewer homes to choose from. Our inventory level right now is the lowest itâs been in seven years. This is a great time to be a seller!        Â Â  Since the supply of homes has dramatically dropped and will increase in the spring by 25-30%, there will be less demand for your home when there is a larger supply (less demand = less money for you).        Â Â  Buyers have more money to spend this time of year. Where does this money come from? Tax returns, bonuses and also pay increases come this time of year.        Â Â  Buyers have more time to shop during the holidays/winter then they do during the summer.        Â Â  Some people must buy a home before the end of the year for tax reasons.        Â Â  December and January are prime job relocation months.        Â Â  You can still be on the market during the holidays and restrict showings on specific days.        Â Â  You can sell your home now for money and move in the spring. This can be worked out during negotiations.        Â Â  If you sell now, you have the option to be a non-contingent buyer in the spring when the supply of homes increases. This allows you to sell high and buyer low.  If youâre considering selling now or before spring, give me a call to take advantage of any of the reasons above. Thanks and happy holidays!",

        "content": "Today, I wanted to talk about home inspections. Sellers ask me a lot about what to do when the inspector finds a defect in the home: should I fix it? Can I sell it as is?The answer to that question lies between you and the buyer. Essentially, a home inspector has to report what they see; if what they see is a defect, they have to disclose it on the report.Now, if it is truly a defect it has to be disclosed to not only that buyer, but any other buyer you sell your home too. So, in most instances in order to sell you will probably need to fix that defect; most buyers wonât assume that problem.The other option besides you fixing it, is offering a credit to the buyer so they can fix it after closing. This is only an option if the buyerâs lender allows it.What if you as a seller canât afford to fix the defect? The Roth Team has contractors we work with; the repair would be done and we would take the money out of your closing proceeds.Again if you have questions on inspections or anything else, feel free to give us a call.

Because the market is heating up, we are seeing sellers getting more than one offer for their property. Itâs important for both the buyer and the seller to know what to do.As a buyer itâs important to ask the agent if there is another offer on the table or if they expect another offer to come in, because that could make a difference in the price you offer. If there is a current offer, itâs best to make your best offer. Put your best foot forward. Â You also want to ask your agent if they think it is a fair price.As a seller, if you receive multiple offers and none of them are the price you want. You are allowed to counter both offers. There is a multiple counter offer clause in the state of Wisconsin. Once the buyers respond and both buyers accept, you can then acknowledge which one you will take.So if you have any other questions about multiple offer situations please call at 262.797.6453!Thanks for joining!",

The buyer will take longer to walk through, theyâll ask more questions and theyâll give honest feedback.Another tip for showings is to make sure all the lights are on and the blinds open.

        "content": "Everyone wants to know whatâs going on in the real estate market. Hereâs a recap and insight on what how buyers and sellers can take advantage of it. Â In 2012 sales were up 20 to 25% from 2011. They are up again in the first quarter in the greater metro Milwaukee area by 11.5%, which is good news. The number of listings over the last five years has been larger than ever with times when the inventory was as high as 14 to 16 months. (This means that if another home did not come on the market, it would take 14 to 16 months to sell the available inventory.) Now listings are down in the greater metro area by 18.3%, so there are fewer homes on the market. The average list-to-sales price ratio on average is now 96% of the asking price.What does this mean for sellers? If youâve thought of selling your home, the time is now. Since there are fewer homes on the market, thereâs more competition for available homes. Low inventory often translates into multiple bids, high list-to-sale price ratios and being able to negotiate better terms. Itâs a great time for sellers.If youâre in the market to buy a home, be aggressive. When a home that youâre interested in hits the market, plan to see it as soon as possible and make the best possible offer thatâs at an appropriate price point for the seller. Remember, inventory is low. If you hesitate, the property could be gone because others will be making offers.Keep in mind that mortgage loan rates are still fantastic, which makes buying a home more affordable than ever. A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hovered at record-low rates during 2012 and is still low into 2013, but the rates wonât last forever. Interest rates are still below 4% with some as low as 3% with a 15- or 20-year fixed-rate mortgage. If you wait and interest rates rise, you could get locked into spending a few hundred extra dollars a month on your payment.

The ONLY way to get results is to have high expectations of yourself and your organization, which in turn almost always ends up in great results.High Energy = High SuccessRight up there with attitude, is high energy. When you operate on a strong level with enthusiasm, drive and ambition â itâs no wonder that you will successfully sell real estate and foster strong long-standing relationships in the process.Focus On Clientsâ Needs is KeyClientsâ needs are all encompassing and they are what ought to drive every single real estate agentâs business.

        "content": "When youâre moving from one place to another there are a LOT of details to keep track of and of course much to do. Thatâs why sometimes it helps to have a system in place and a good team on your side. We spoke with Jim Finch of Barrett Moving &amp; Storage today to find out what his company suggests are some good tips for a smooth move.Be Flexible and Plan AheadKeep in mind that no two moves are exactly the same. Depending on the number of items, amount of stuff that needs to be packed on moving day versus pre-packed, distance to be traveled and other factors â your move can take anywhere from one day to several weeks or more. The initial visit is a crucial component of understanding what to expect from your move and should be sought as soon as possible.Donât Waste Time, Call Way Ahead of TimeA common mistake is not to call soon enough after the decision to move has been made. The advantage by calling ahead of time is the ability to make plans accordingly. This could mean anything from selecting only some things to be packed by the movers eventually (just furniture or fragile items, for instance) or making sure the best services are chosen according to your needs. If you are listing your home, as soon as it is on the market contact your mover to get an idea of what to expect.Always Get an Estimate in PersonThough you can select online estimates from some large national chains, Finch advises against using that method if you want an accurate estimate of how much your move will cost. The expense will largely depend on the amount of items, extent of packing or other services needed as well as the size of move and distance traveled.Donât Move at the End of the MonthMost movers are very busy during the last week of the month, particularly during the spring and summer seasons. Though they will accommodate your needs, itâs still a good idea to schedule your move during the first three weeks if possible so that you can enjoy the least amount of scheduling hassles.~If you would like to have Jim or one of his colleagues from Barrett Moving &amp; Storage come out to visit â contact him directly at 262-446-4709.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "As you embark upon what will be one of the most important transactions of your life â whether buying or selling a home â you should be absolutely certain that you are happy with the real estate agent you have hired to help you manage it.Â To help you with this all-important hiring process, here are ten important questions to ask an agent before you decide on whether or not to hire them:Question #1How Close Do You Get in Sale Price Related to Asking Price?It is important to ask for this information as it relates to the past 60 days. Â Given that many agents are not that active in the market, you would be best served to obtain the most recent information possible. Â As a seller, your agentâs ability to come close to the asking price is a strong attribute and can mean a difference of thousands of dollars in your transaction.Question #2How Many Days on Average Does It Take You To Sell a Home?Whatâs the average number of days on the market for properties listed by your prospective agent? Since this statistic can reach as high as six to nine months and in some cases and as much as a year, it is important to ask how your prospective agent ranks on the scale.Question #3What is the Rate of Homes Sold on a Monthly Basis?Knowing the absorption rate of homes similar to yours that are on the market allows valuable insight as to how the market is performing for your particular needs. Â Not only does it give sellers a glimpse into the system and how it would translate to their own sale but it also presents a broader view of the entire market in general.Question #4What Do You Do Differently To Get Homes Sold?Especially with the current trying economic times, many agents have been faced with adversities trying to sell the homes on their list. Â One of the best ways to learn whether your agent is a self-starter is to find out what they have done in the past when they were unable to successfully sell homes. Â Ask why the agent feels the home(s) did not sell and then find out what they are doing differently to get them sold.Question #5What Percentage of Deals Do You Represent the Buyer Versus Seller?Â Some agents work primarily with sellers while others work mostly with buyers and still others are experienced with dual-agency deals. Â Depending on your needs, you will benefit from an agent that specializes in one of the two. Â It is important to ask which side of the fence your prospective agent tends to represent.Â Questions #6How Many Homes Did You Sell This Year?Nothing speaks louder than numbers. Â A very important statistic, ask what the total number of homes sold last year was and if possible try to get a more long-term picture of the agentâs performance in this regard. You can also ask for a month-to-month breakdown to see if there are certain stronger months.Questions #7Can You Provide a List of the Current Clients You Have Worked With?Itâs a good idea to obtain a list of clients that are currently working with this Realtor. Â It will provide a much-needed glimpse into the agentâs performance on various stages of real estate transactions.Question #8How Much of Your Work Day Do You Dedicate to the Real Estate Industry?You want an agent that is 100% committed to their Â job and if they are focusing more on a day job with real estate being a secondary thing, you run the risk of inaccessibility, lack of knowledge and experience plus lackluster motivation. Â Find out how they feel about the real estate industry and whether they are passionate about their work.Question #9What is Your Style of Marketing â Proactive or Reactive?What is your potential agentâs style of working? Â Does he or she speak to a large number of people each day? Are they proactive or reactive in nature when it comes to marketing? See how this lines up with your real estate needs. Â Are you in a hurry to buy or sell? Â Does a laid back agent hinder your efforts? Or does slow and steady work better for you?Question #10What Does Your Daily Schedule Look Like?The typical schedule of a real estate professional can be very telling. Â By asking for a copy or general idea of how they conduct their day in terms of their work, you can get a good idea of how much time is devoted to the profession and what kind of business they are running.",

        "content": "The first point we want to make is that we are now experiencing record low interest rates, and with the election and everything else going on we donât know if they will last until spring.A question that I get asked a lot by homeowners considering selling their home is âWhen is the best time to sell a home?â and the answer almost always surprises them. Though there is a common misconception that the best time to sell a home is in the spring and summer months of the year, the truth is that selling during the fall and winter can be just as strong.There are several reasons for this â and depending on your motivation to sell the property, you may not have to wait until the following year to list your home to get results.Fewer Homes on the Market Results in Less Selling CompetitionAs the year goes on, more and more sellers remove their home from the market. They either buy into the notion that with less buyers out there in the winter months their home wonât sell. Another reason is they feel the holidays should be without interruptions for showings throughout.Â Buyers Try to Avail Tax Advantages of Homeownership Prior to Year-EndA major benefit of homeownership is the many tax advantages that come with owning a home. And as the end of the year approaches, more and more prospective buyers seek to find their dream home so they can include the purchase in the upcoming tax filing.Serious Buyers Buy Regardless of Season; They Are Seeking the Perfect HomeWhen it comes time to buying a home, as buyers are looking â the time is already right for them. Add to that the factor the Internet plays in with buyersâ readiness by the time they begin actively looking and you will find far more serious buyers interested in your property. This is particularly relevant if they have been shortlisting homes and yours is among the few available ones that fit their criteria.~At the end of the day, it is important to keep in mind that the market never sleeps. Sure there are more buyers in the springtime but there are also far more homes competing against your listing. When deciding whether this is the right time for you, consult with your real estate agent and discuss all the issues at hand. Just know that you will likely not experience much difference in your selling success if you choose to list during the fall and winter months.",

We are now experiencing the best real estate market that we have had in the past seven years â and here are seven reasons why.Interest rates are below 3% â a once in a lifetime rate.Super low interest rates have increased buyersâ buying power by a large amount, allowing them to afford more house than ever before and paving the way for more buyers to be able to purchase their own home. With rates this low, purchasing is the better option as opposed to leasing a home.Banks are lending money after a long period of slowed-down lending.After years of tight lending practices, lenders are finally easing up on strict guidelines and have relaxed the minimum requirements needed to apply and be approved for a loan. Where just a few years ago FICO scores below 680 became a challenge, lenders now are willing to approve most borrowers with steady income and a FICO score of at least 640.Prices in most areas are the lowest they have ever been as a result of our recession.Â After a long time, homeowners in many areas are finally seeing their home values begin to trend upward. Some markets are seeing an increasing trend faster than others but overall the real estate market has improved and prices are continuing to stabilize.Inventory levels are beginning to shrink with the total number of listings down from a year ago.With sales, sales and more sales on the record, inventory levels have steadily declined during the past year or so. Across the board in almost all marketplaces in the US, there has been a significant decline in the number of available homes on the market. Not only does this cause a spike in demand but it also allows sellers a chance to attain higher list-to-sale ratios.First-time homebuyers are active in the marketplace, fueling the entire real estate market.What happens here is that when first-time buyers buy homes, the homeowners that end up buying up move into larger homes. The homeowners of those properties need a place to move to and they end up purchasing more expensive properties. In essence, this results in a positive cycle of activity in the marketplace.Appraisers are estimating homes at more favorable values.For a long time appraisers were very reluctant to assign generous values to homes. This was in part due to the gross over-valuation as a result of the pre-2007 housing boom but also appraisers were comparing sold properties from the immediately preceding six months, a time of distress for many homeowners. Today, appraisers are finally being more liberal.The economy is experiencing a boost, as is typical during an election year.One aspect of a Presidential election year is that the economy is temporarily given a boost. And this year is no exception. With the Fed actively working to keep interest rates down, jobs reports improving across the country and overall consumer confidence on the rise â these positives are reflected in the housing market.",

One such program provides loans to borrowers looking to buy single-family homes in rural areas.The&nbsp;USDA program in Wisconsin&nbsp;is available to rural customers in southeastern Wisconsin and the single biggest benefit is that the amount needed to secure the purchase can be as little as no money down. We met with mortgage professional Dennis Prosser of&nbsp;A+ Mortgage Services, Inc.&nbsp;and asked him about some more of the frequently asked questions about the USDA program.How Do You Qualify for a USDA Loan?A qualified borrower must be seeking a single-family residence and meet program income requirements. For a family of four, the income level starts at $84,000. For families with more than four&nbsp;persons&nbsp;the annual income requirement is $111,000.Are Only Some Properties Eligible?There are two rules as to which properties are eligible under this program. First, they must be single-family residences, meeting income requirements as listed above. Second, the homes must be located in rural areas.What Areas Are Considered for This Program?With the exception of Milwaukee County, all of the following counties plus additional surrounding counties are considered valid locations whenever rural areas within each are being sought:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;Kenosha&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; - Ozaukee&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;Racine&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; - Walworth&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; - Washington&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; - WaukeshaWhat Kind of Down Payment and Interest Rate Should I Expect To Pay?Depending on the parameters of the application, little or no down payment is required to secure the USDA loan. Interest rates are currently at their&nbsp;record setting&nbsp;low with the average rate right now in our area being about 3.75% on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage.~If you would like to find out whether you qualify for a USDA loan and can pay little to no money down on the purchase of your home, contact the Roth Team at&nbsp;rothteam@shorewest.com&nbsp;or by calling 262.797.6453.

        "content": "As many of us are receiving our tax assessments in the mail in anticipation for the next property tax installment, we are seeing assessed values that may not make sense. The truth is that the tax value of a property is not always accurate. It can sometimes be too high and it can sometimes be too low. In many areas, county tax assessors reassess tax values every certain number of years. The value is also reassessed upon the conveyance of the property.If homeowners feel their homeâs assessed value seems too high and they want to challenge the amount of taxes they pay based on the seemingly inaccurate tax value, they can appeal to the county board of review for a re-evaluation. The appeals process involves submitting an application explaining the reasons for requesting a review â along with sufficient documentation demonstrating a closer depiction of the perceived value.How is Actual Value of a Home Determined?Since in many cases the assessed value of a property appears to be less than the purchase price when a home is sold, some people are misinformed in thinking that an assessed value is exactly half of the purchase price.The actual value of a home is not based at all on the assessed value. Neither is a propertyâs worth valued based on a recent appraisal. Though it may seem ideal, actual property values (in other words, what buyers would likely be willing to pay) are not determined by the sellerâs needs or wants. Equally, a property cannot be valued simply based on someoneâs opinion of what it should be valued.A homeâs value will largely be based on the sold prices of other like kind properties in the same neighborhood or vicinity â and those that were sold in the same (current) market. Most tax appeals require documentation showing sales figures from recently sold properties of only in the past 6 months or so. Anything further out than that is construed as being in different market conditions.~If you want to find out exactly what your homeâs value is and how much a buyer would be willing to pay for it today â contact us today. We will put our over 30 years of experience to use and conduct an analysis of comparable sales. Looking at other homes that have sold in your area, we should be able to pretty closely determine your homeâs worth today.",

        "content": "Unless you live in a very volatile area, chances are your homeownerâs insurance premiums are fairly standard. But one thing that many people do not realize is that they can actually have an impact on the amount they are charged for insurance.There are several factors involved in a homeownerâs insurance premium calculation and if you play your cards right you may be able to end up with sizable savings. Homes that are located in areas that exhibit frequent and volatile storms or acts of nature on a regular basis â such as earthquake zones, hurricane prone areas and tornado belts will obviously see larger premiums. And seasonal weather changes like hail or windstorms will also have an impact on the rate you will pay for insurance on your property. But for the most part, there are ways to save on insurance. Â Here are four factors that you can control that will help you to save money.Cut Down Those ClaimsThe single biggest impact you can have on your insurance premium rates is the number of claims you file. This is largely applicable to those claims you have control over. Acts of nature will impact your rates less than deliberate or reckless occurrences such as a fire that occurs during a cookout. Be mindful of the number of claims you file and it will keep your insurance premiums down.Spruce Up Your CreditLike with everything else, insurance companies also want to know that you are responsible in handling your finances â in fact they rate homeowners (and others) with an insurance score that is similar to a credit score. An insurance score takes into consideration your credit, claims history, property location and value. It is essential to get and keep good credit. Paying bills on time, avoiding late payments and demonstrating solid financial responsibility translates to lower premiums because insurance companies know they can count on you.Choose Location WiselyOne factor that many people do not realize is how close the property is to the local fire department. The further away from a fire department the home is located the higher your insurance premium will be. In fact, your insurance premium can go as high as 50% to 60% higher than if you lived closer. The reason is the added risk of total loss since it would take them that much longer to get to your location.Go For Higher DeductiblesAt one point, deductibles for homeownerâs insurance were lower than they typically are today. Where they were once only $250 or $500 per claim, deductibles for most policies are now $1,000 with some people opting for even higher amounts â as much as $5,000. There are two reasons for the higher deductibles; not only do they serve as a deterrent from smaller claims but also homeowners receive a break on their premium.~If you would like more information about how you can positively impact the cost of your homeownerâs insurance â or for any other property and real estate related inquiries, please contact us today!",

        "content": "One of the most frequently asked questions when it comes to home values is âwhy does the insurance value on my home show higher than the fair market value?â and to answer it, we spoke with an expert in property and casualty insurance.Home Values Are Independent of One AnotherThe first thing that many homeowners do not realize is that each of the three areas where property values are determined is independent of the other. Â Though they can be mixed together in some scenarios they each serve a different purpose, are determined based on varying parameters and largely do not impact each other.Appraised /Fair Market ValueThis value is based on a professional appraisal. Lenders will use this figure to determine the amount of financing to approve and one supplement to the appraiserâs assessment is area comparable sales of like-kind properties that sold in the preceding six month time period. Â This value is somewhat impacted by market conditions and will fluctuate accordingly. Market conditions, whether the market is buyer-controlled or seller-centric will impact the fair market value, for example an area with fewer homes and more buyers for instance would reduce the market value.Insurance ValueAt one time, particularly prior to the 2007 housing market crash, insurance values fell right in the middle of appraised and assessed values but today that has changed dramatically given the subsequent economic conditions affecting the housing market. Â Since insurance value refers to the amount it would cost to replace the entire home, the assessment is heavily impacted by the cost of materials and labor to replace or repair areas of the home. Â Though market values have gone down since the market crash, insurance values are still seeing the inflationary increase as a result of increasing rebuilding costs. Â One thing to keep in mind is that many insurance claims are partial â again affecting the costs to repair or rebuild and consequently impacting the insurance values on properties.Assessed ValueEach local municipality has its own system and formula to determine the value of your home as per the amount of taxes you will owe on it. Â The assessed value of a home will be used for the purpose of a tax base and it is typically reassessed every six to seven years in most locales with an increase as much as forty to fifty percent. Â Homeowners that feel the assessed value is too high for their property may submit a tax appeal to their county board of review once or twice per year, depending on the county. Â A tax appeal demonstrates to the board through comparable sales (obtained through Realtors) and other supporting documentation that the assessed value is too high and should therefore be reduced.~Prior to the market crash of 2007, appraised values were the highest, insurance values next and assessed values were at the bottom of the scale. Â Today, due to changing market trends and conditions there has been a shift to insurance values at the top in order to keep up with increasing costs, followed by market value and then finally assessed value.If you would like to learn what your homeâs market value is or want to explore options to sell your home â contact us today and weâll share with you what we think you would get for your home today if you were to sell in todayâs market.",

        "content": "In most cases, yes! Itâs essentially a process by which you make extra payments on your mortgage. That way, you save interest costs and pay off the loan faster.How Does It Work?You make a payment to your lender every two weeks instead of once a month. This means that each payment is equal to half of the monthly amount due. The result â youâre paying the equivalent of 13 full payments rather than the usual 12.It gets even better! The full amount of the extra payment is applied toward the principal. And because the principal balance is the amount on which interest is calculated, paying down principal results in a reduction in accrued interest!Letâs look a traditional payment monthly schedule vs. a bi-weekly schedule so you can see exactly how it works.Example 1: Traditional monthly paymentsLetâs assume you have a loan balance of $250,000 with a 6 percent interest rate and a 30-year loan term. In this example, your monthly payments are $1,498.88. So, over the life of the loan, youâd pay a total interest of about $289,595.Example 2: Bi-weekly paymentsUsing the same loan balance and terms described above, the difference would be the following:â¢ $749.44 paid every two weeksâ¢ About $225,490 paid in total interestâ¢ This results in a savings of more than $64,000 in interest!â¢ In addition, the loan is paid off in 24 rather than 30 yearsBi-monthly payments are still a good strategy if youâre an individual who doesnât plan to keep your house for 24 or 30 years. Why? Because bi-weekly payments still reduce principle, even over a short period of time.For example, in the first year, the principle is reduced by nearly $1,600. And, at the end of the fifth year, the principle amount has been reduced by about $9,000!How Do I Arrange Bi-Weekly Payments?The first task is to contact lenders to find out if they do offer a bi-weekly payment schedule.If they offer one, ask what the participation requirements are. In typical situations, lenders require you to have payments automatically withdrawn from your bank account since they dislike processing checks every two weeks.Often, itâs the case that a one-time fee is charged for this service. The fee can be minimal or be in the several-hundred-dollar range, depending on the lender.So, after all these benefits, how can there possibly be disadvantages to bi-weekly mortgage payments?Well, the first disadvantage relates to a situation I mentioned above - the lenderâs fee is very expensive for the service provided. In such a case, the costs may outweigh or cut down your overall savings.A second disadvantage occurs when paying bi-weekly is too hard on your budget. Upfront, you need to make sure that you have the money available for the increased payments.The final potential disadvantage relates to the length of time you plan to stay in your home. That can affect your overall savings on interest.I recommend that you weigh the pros and cons of bi-weekly mortgage payments by using one of the many online calculators. Just enter your numbers and the calculator will give you a comparison.If youâd like the assistance of an expert on the subject, contact us immediately!",

        "title": "New Changes to the HARP Loan Program Means More People Getting Much-Needed Help",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "The announcement made recently by the Federal Housing Finance Agency about proposed changes to the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) could mean that many more homeowners will get much-needed assistance during this difficult economic time. Â Homeowners that are underwater have traditionally turned to HARP loans to help them refinance their homes, being able to keep them rather than losing them to foreclosure. Â Here are the main differences between the old and the new programs and how they will potentially affect homeowners going through times of strife.No More Glass Ceiling for HARPWith the old program there was a limit to how much borrowers could borrow with respect to thehomeâs loan to value. Â This posed a problem for many people that owed far more on the home than it was valued â given the steep decline in housing values during the past two or more years.Â New changes to the program will allow homeowners to refinance no matter how foregone the situation is with respect to more money owed on a property than its market value. Â The elimination of the 125 LTV ceiling for fixed-rate Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac backed mortgages is by far the most impactful proposed change to the program. Â This change will quite possibly help millions of people avoid undergoing foreclosure.Â Fewer Fees or Better Yet, No Fees For SomeAs per the current HARP loan process, risk-based fees are assessed and applied to loans to protect the lender. Â Considering borrowersâ credit profile, the lower the credit scores, the higher loan to value and that translates to greater risk to the lender. Â Fees that are traditionally associated with this risk are a huge burden for buyers.With the expected new HARP guidelines there will be no more risk-based fees for homeowners that refinance their home into short-term mortgages and fewer fees for others.No Longer A Need For a Property AppraisalThe cost of getting an appraisal done on a home can get quite expensive and adds up when you factor in all the other costs of getting into a new home. Â Most home purchases entail having an appraisal done on the home â at the buyerâs expense.Â The changes that are looking to be implemented soon for people seeking assistance through HARP will include eliminating the requirement of a new property appraisal. Â The only thing that buyers need to be wary of is that there must be a reputable AVM estimate in lieu of the appraisal.The Absence of Warranties That Put Lenders In a StrongholdLenders are at a huge risk when borrowers default on their loans and as a protective measure Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantee those loans but not without a long list of warranties that protect the creditor. Â At present, refinance loans that have these warranties or stipulations on them cause lenders to comb through each application very carefully before considering an approval.With the proposed changes taking place, the warranties will be waived, reducing secondary exposure to lenders of buying back the loan in case of default or even indication of default. Â The change will make it far easier for homeowners to obtain the refinance loan they seek to help get them out from underwater.Â More Time For Homeowners to Get AfloatThe HARP loan program began in April of 2009 and after an extension in March of this year (2011) the deadline was extended to June 30, 2012.According to the list of projected enhancements to the program, the programâs deadline will be extended to December 31, 2013 â giving more homeowners more time to avail this opportunity.~There are a few important things to mention regarding the upcoming announcement expected on Tuesday November 15th. Â First, not only does the HARP loan apply only to homeowners that have a mortgage owned by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, the mortgage being refinanced must have been obtained on or before May 31, 2009. Â Second, this applies only to homeowners who have not previously refinanced their home.It is also important to note that these are projected changes â and they can change at any time contingent upon policy at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.",

        "content": "Have you ever stopped to think about just how passive some salespeople can be? Â Consider all the automobile dealerships that have cars parked out on the lot, expecting the next prospective buyer to just drive right onto the lot. Â Well, with real estate itâs a completely different ballgame. Â Unless your idea of selling your home is to sit back and wait until the right buyer comes along at the right time, with the right price â a far better approach would be to get in touch with an agent that likes to move mountains on his or her own accord.Here are just a few of the passive marketing techniques employed by an overwhelmingly large percentage of Realtors across the country:â¢ Putting a sign outside the home, hoping that a buyer will drive by.â¢ Listing the property on major national websites or the local MLS with the expectation that all the search criteria will be fulfilled with your home and an agent will be calling soon to make an offer.â¢ Hoping that other agents will notice the new listing and introduce it to their buyer clients looking for something similar.â¢ Advertising the property in publications, again with the expectation that the perfect potential buyer will notice the listing and respond.â¢ Holding one or more open houses with the intent to share the home in the buyer community hoping to generate interest.In todayâs market when almost everyone holds a smart phone or other tech device (read: tablet, notebook, laptop, book reader, who knows what next) allowing instant access to information â the last thing you can afford to do is to sit around and wait. Â In fact, in many markets the only way to succeed in the endeavor of selling your home is to reach far out and grab the business. Â In other words â you will have to make it happen yourself because it simply wonât happen on its own.So the next time you find yourself asking an agent, your agent â or even one that you are thinking of hiring â what they will be doing to get your home sold, be sure that their answer shows they have drive, ambition and energy.Strong Marketing Is The Cornerstone Of Successful SellingSome would say that âmarketingâ is a just another word for sales â but that is hardly true. Sure marketing entails some sales within the larger scheme of things, but it covers a bigger picture that includes promotion, awareness, publicity and, very importantly, sales.In real estate particularly, there are two basic brands of marketing engaged by agents across the nation and throughout the globe â and the difference can be measured in their levels of success. Â Both passive and active marketing are techniques used by agents of every caliber but most top-producing agents utilize a far more active marketing stance. Â In fact, when you consider the modern technological advances available today as opposed to years ago, itâs surprising that all Realtors donât use the tools at hand to assist their clients.Here are some of the ways that savvy real estate agents get their clientsâ home sold faster, more efficiently and at a better price:â¢ Making regular contact with people in the buying circuit actively seeking homes in the current market.â¢ Utilizing all the latest tools available to measure the latest and most accurate market data and remain current with area comparables.â¢ Staying in constant contact with clients, via web chat, instant message, text message, real time email or daily phone communication.â¢ Providing useful tips, tricks and information through informational blogs and electronic communications.â¢ Personally contacting buyer prospects, sellers, other agents, buyers from out of town, major corporations with significant employee relocations, past clients and others.â¢ Tapping into extensive databases with client and contact information that includes word-of-mouth contacts and extended client databases of preferred lenders, vendors, suppliers and contractors.Professionals who utilize this extra dimension of marketing are more likely to accomplish the success they set out to achieve. Â Active marketing in terms of real estate is when Realtors go out and actively seek out potential buyers for the homes they have listed, using the tools that are âoutside the boxâ. Â They work to fill gaps and literally match properties to prospective buyers by calling their agents directly. Â These are the people you should be working with to get your home sold. Â These are top-producing agents.To find out how we can help you get your home sold, call us today for a customized consultation so we can determine your needs and start working on it right away!",

        "content": "So youâve saved your down payment, picked the perfect home and you have a closing date. Â Youâve probably received a statement from your lender in advance outlining the closing costs and fees youâll need to bring along with you to the closing.Many times buyers have no idea what is included in this expense â seemingly the second largest chunk of change they need to fork over, next to the down payment. Â To help clarify what all is entailed in the fees charged by your lender and paid toward the purchase of your home we spoke to an industry professional to get the details.What Fees Are Included in Closing Costs?Mainly lenders charge underwriting fees and processing â which together are considered âlending feesâ. Â In addition to those charges there are a few more routine but necessary steps adding to the closing costs. Â These include the cost of having an appraisal done on the new home, pulling a credit report on the borrower, obtaining a flood certification as well as closing title fees on the closing date. Â Additionally, prepaid interest and post-paid property tax are also items we see incorporated in closing costs.Do These Fees Vary From Lender To Lender?This is one of the main areas, in addition to minor fluctuations in current interest rates that lenders compete with each other for new loans. Â We caution against paying any origination fees and discount points, which add to a percentage of your loan amount. Â Each lender will charge varying underwriting processing fees but appraisals usually cost within the typical range of $325 and up.How Much Can a Seller Contribute to Closing Costs?The maximum amount a seller can pay in closing costs is about 6% and with the market being controlled largely by buyers, many sellers offer concessions in the way of paying all or a portion of closing costs. Â In fact, savvy buyers know this going in to the deal and put this condition as part of their offer. Saving as much as several thousand dollars or more, this is a huge plus-point for buyers in todayâs market and one that is regularly being utilized. Â Since closing costs can be incorporated into the loan this can also affect the interest rate buyers end up getting by a nominal amount.~It is a good idea to check with your lender or potential lenders if you are still shopping around to find out exactly what is included in their closing costs. Â Be sure to consult with your Realtor to compare the numbers and confirm whether you are getting the best deal. Â Also, it might be more beneficial to work with lenders in your Realtorâs preferred network of vendors.",

        "content": "Just a couple years ago, most people usually thought they had to give up their home in a foreclosure when they faced a financial stonewall. Â However, since then the phenomenon of short sales has been on the rise, leaving homeowners a bigger, better and brighter option for the present and future. Â In this article, we explore the comparative differences between the two so you can gain an edge when deciding which is better for you.Purchasing PowerAfter walking away from your mortgage through a foreclosure, you can expect to feel the negative impact of it for five years, in terms of being able to purchase another home. Â Even then, like a bankruptcy, a foreclosure is something you will perpetually have to report no matter how long it has been since the home went into foreclosure. Â Though these days you see a lot of talk about the financial and credit impact foreclosures have on homeowners, the unseen part of it is something to be dealt with. Â Going through this process can leave a lasting emotional hole in people who otherwise were law-abiding citizens, going about their normal lives when all of a sudden they are faced with severe financial hardship and must resort to extreme measures. Â That, or if the value of their home has dropped well below the amount they paid for it and they see very little hope for the future.Short sales are much simpler. Â They will affect your purchasing power for a mere two years, often just the amount of time it takes to get back on oneâs financial feet. Â Not only that, there is no requirement to report a short sale transaction.Credit OutlookThere are two main areas that are of concern when it comes to your credit â your credit score and your credit history. Â In case of a foreclosure, credit scores drop a whopping 200 to 300 points. Â This can have a significantly negative impact on your ability to purchase big-ticket items or secure loans in the future. Â  Not to mention it takes years to rebuild a credit score that has dropped that low. Â  In terms of credit history, a foreclosure remains visible on your credit report for anywhere from ten years or more, rendering each future potential lending transaction either useless or very hard-pressed at getting approved. Â The overall impact you will see on your credit will be for about three years.Short sales are far easier on your credit outlook, in that the point drop is only about 50 on average and the transaction itself will impact your credit profile for as relatively little as 12 to 15 months. Â The one thing to keep in mind is that if you have defaulted on any payments or if you already have a weak credit profile, the post-short sale point drop on your credit report can be more than just 50. Â Also, there is no formal reporting or declaration of a short sale on your credit report like a foreclosure although the transaction will show up as either settled or not paid in full.Amount Still OwedUsually there is a gap in the amount owed after owners walk away from a property and the bank assumes responsibility. Â In case of a foreclosure, given the amount of processing time and resultant vulnerability and exposure of the property, the value can and often does drop greatly after vandalism and from sitting there unused. Â The Deficiency Amount (also called Judgment Amount) is the difference that remains after the bank calculates what was owed on the property at the time of foreclosure and when they sold the home. Because of this vandalism and vulnerability, the amount of value drop is far more than with a short sale, when the homeowners are still residing in the property during processing. Â The bank has the legal right to pursue homeowners for the amount difference. Â Short sales differ in that not only is the deficiency amount much less but also, your Realtor can negotiate a waiver of that amount so you donât have to pay for it.",

        "content": "One of the most common questions that we get each and every year is whether a home seller should try to sell their home during the cold, winter months or wait for spring to put it on the market? There are pros and cons to every situation, but I want to give you a few things to think about that you may not have considered.Many people believe that it is always best to list and sell a home during spring. After all, isnât that when everyone else does it? Plus, there are some negatives to selling during the winter.For one thing, winter is the holiday season. You have Thanksgiving and Christmas, among other holidays. Many people donât want the showings during the holidays. They donât like the idea of people walking through their home with snow on their shoes. They have their holiday decorations up and donât really want anyone messing with their festive home.Many sellers think that there are less buyers during the winter, and that is probably true. However, consider this: buyers who are looking around the holidays are serious. Why else would they be looking for a home at that time of the year? Many relocation companies move employees during the winter because they want to get things done before the end of the year. Relocation buyers are often some of the strongest purchasers you can find.Some sellers are also under the assumption that prices go up in the spring. Unfortunately, the current real estate market does not point to the idea that prices will rise in the spring. Experts hope that they do not fall further, in fact. Waiting for prices to go up so quickly may be a dangerous game for a seller to play.There are some absolute positives to putting your home on the market during winter. First, the interest rates are very low right now. Buyers are getting into homes for 3.75% to 4% right now. No one can predict the future, so you want to strike while the iron is hot.Also, there are less homes on the market in winter which means way less competition for a home seller. The greater metro area had 20% less listings going into the winter months than will be true during spring.On a good note, homes are still selling. I checked the records, and last winter through February, our team sold 60 homes! I also checked the MLS records and saw that 2,363 homes sold last year in our area. Your home only has to be ONE of them.In short, if you donât mind the little inconveniences of selling during winter, you can reap big rewards. Call on us today to find out more about putting your home on the market the right way.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "The Federal Housing Agency (FHA) doesnât directly offer loans. Instead, its purpose is to provide mortgage insurance for Americans to purchase or refinance a principal residence.To put it another way, the mortgage loans are funded by private lending institutions (mortgage companies, banks, savings and loan associations, etc.), and those mortgages are then insured by FHA/HUD.The Benefits of FHA LoansIf you qualify as a prospective homeowner, these loans have three great benefits. First of all, your down payments are lower. Second, closing costs are also lower. And, finally, itâs easier to qualify for credit.Who Qualifies?FHA has programs for:â¢ First-home buyersâ¢ Seniorsâ¢ Fixer uppersâ¢ Manufactured housing and mobile homesâ¢ Energy efficiency, etc.If youâre a first-time home buyer, a FHA loan can be a good deal for you. See the eligibility requirements below. Later, Iâll cover the fixer-upper category requirements. Check with the FHA on other programs.First-Home Buyer ProgramsThese programs have the following eligibility requirements:â¢ You must meet standard FHA credit qualifications (judged by the individualâs credit record).â¢ Youâre eligible for approximately 97% financing.â¢ Youâre able to finance the upfront mortgage insurance premium into the mortgage.â¢ Youâre also responsible for paying an annual premium.â¢ Within this category, the eligible properties are one-to-four unit structures. As of this writing, the highest maximum FHA mortgage is $362,790 while the lowest maximum amount is $200,160.The 203(k) Program for Fixer-UppersThe 203(k) program issues loans to allow you to buy or refinance a property. In the loan, you can also include the cost of making the repairs and improvements.The loans are provided through approved mortgage lenders nationwide, and theyâre available to buyers wanting to occupy the home.The down payment requirement for an owner-occupant (or a nonprofit organization or government agency) equals about 3% of the acquisition and repair costs of the property.There are several steps to obtaining such a loan:â¢ You find a fixer-upper and sign a sales contract after doing a feasibility analysis of the property with a realtor.â¢ The contract should state that youâre seeking a 203(k) loan. It should also state the contract is contingent on loan approval based on additional required repairs by the FHA or the lender.â¢ You then select an FHA-approved 203(k) lender and arrange for a detailed proposal showing the scope of work to be done. The proposal should include a detailed cost estimate on each repair or improvement of the project.â¢ The appraisal determines the value of the property after renovation.â¢ If you pass the lenderâs credit-worthiness test, the loan closes for an amount that will cover the purchase or refinance cost of the property, the remodeling costs and the allowable closing costs.â¢ The amount of the loan also includes a contingency reserve of 10% to 20% of the total remodeling costs. Itâs used to cover any extra work not included in the original proposal.â¢ At closing, the seller of the property is paid off and the remaining funds are put in an escrow account to pay for the repairs and improvements during the rehabilitation period.â¢ The mortgage payments and remodeling begin after the loan closes.You can decide to have up to six mortgage payments (PITI) put into the cost of rehabilitation if the property is not going to be occupied during construction, but it cannot exceed the length of time itâs estimated to take to complete the rehab.â¢ Escrowed funds are released to the contractor during construction through a series of draw requests for completed work.â¢ To ensure completion of the job, 10% of each draw is held back; this money is paid after the lender determines there will be no liens on the property.Whew, somewhat complicated, isnât it? Well, weâre dealing with a government program! But, FHA loans can be a good deal for you, and Iâm available to guide you throughout the entire process. Just give me a call today!",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "You Better Give Sherlock Holmes a Ring!No, you donât need the fictional detective inspector. However, you do need a home inspector! Think of this as a âpre-emptive strikeâ to maintain or increase your homeâs value before you put it on the market. Here are the benefits an inspector provides you:Benefit 1: The inspector can uncover any problems that need fixing, and you can correct them before any potential buyers enter your home. Such an inspection can prevent your sale from falling through!Benefit 2: With an inspection, you can show prospective buyers receipts to prove the work has been done. Buyers love proof! In reality and in their eyes, it underpins the value of your home and the asking price.Benefit 3: You may be able to factor the cost of the inspection into the asking price for your home!Benefit 4: When you have a pre-sale home inspection completed, youâre able to estimate if the discount the prospective buyer is asking is reasonable. In other words, you can refuse unreasonably low offers if you know the value of your house, including the degree of its defects.So, How Do I Find a Qualified Home Inspector?I can recommend a certified home inspector who will do a great job for you. However, if you decide you want to do it on your own, make sure he or she is qualified!Con artists sometimes pose as home inspectors, taking your money and giving you nothing but grief in return. Hereâs how to know if an inspector is the real deal:Ask your friends for referrals. If theyâve had a good experience, go with that home inspector. Iâd recommend you interview a minimum of two or three inspectors before choosing one. Make sure theyâre full-time professionals conducting several inspections a year.If possible, select a home inspector whoâs a member of The American Society of Home Inspectors or the National Association of Home Inspectors.These association members follow a stated code of ethics. In addition, theyâre prohibited from having a professional interest in the sale, repair or maintenance of a property they inspect. Theyâre also forbidden from using their inspection business as a way to find customers for a handyman service that they âhappenâ to own. You may want to go on the Internet and use ASHIâs âFind a Home Inspectorâ link to identify potential candidates in our locality.As part of the interview process, ask for samples of comprehensive reports (about 20-50 pages in length). The samples should be painstakingly done and backed up with complete details, including photos and diagrams. If an âinspectorâ refuses to give you a report or provides only a sloppily written 2-to-5 page sample, run the other way!What Does a Home Inspector Cost?Frankly, the rates vary. On a national level, the rates fall in the range of $200 to $400. As part of the interview process, I recommend you ask several inspectors for their rates so you can get an idea of the price range. In the end, keep in mind that while the cost of an inspection may seem high, it can actually add several thousand dollars to the value of your home! So, donât think of it as a cost; think of it as an investment!What Exactly Does a Home Inspector Evaluate?In general, he or she will look at the following areas:- Electrical System Wiring, Service Panel and Service Capacity      Energy Conservation/Safety Items        Exterior Walls, Siding, Trim        Floor, Wall, Ceiling, Roof Structures        Foundation, Footings, Crawl Space, Basements, Sub-flooring, Decks        Gutters, Downspouts        Heating &amp; Cooling Systems        Insulation &amp; Ventilation        Interior Floors, Walls, Ceilings        Moisture Intrusion/Mold        Overall Structural Integrity        Plumbing Systems        Property Drainage/Landscaping        Roof &amp; Shingles, Chimneys, Attic        Walks and Drives  Â - Windows, Doors, Cabinets, Counters, etc.Â Should I Be Present During a Home Inspection?You bet! A typical inspection takes three hours or more, so I recommend that you be present for at least the first 30 minutes to make sure the job is being done thoroughly. At the end of the inspection, the home inspector should give you a point-by-point summary of what needs to be corrected in order to add value to your home!Hope you enjoyed this very useful information about home inspection! If you have more questions, please donât hesitate to contact me!",

			<p>Over the last twelve months, we have closed over 210 transactions â compare this to the average real estate agent that sold less than four homes in the same period of time. More importantly, we are bringing our sellers an average of 96% or more of the asking price. This is all done on a timetable of 35 days that the home being on the market.  Iâve been in the real estate business for over 37 years and have closed over 6,000 deals. There hasnât been a problem weâve come across that we canât solve in todayâs market â especially in the challenging market we have today. We will also determine the best price that you can receive in this market. One of the biggest problems in this industry is the lack of communication between the seller and their agent. We have a dedicated team that will be available to you seven days a week. You can rest assured knowing that all of your questions will be answered and you will be updated through every step of the transaction. You also can expect Weekly Activity Reports that include how many hits your listing has gained from the internet, TV advertising, and feedback weâve received from the buyers. When youâre ready to sell your home, give the Roth Team a call or send us an email.â</p>
