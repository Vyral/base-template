A significant number of these people have homes that are much larger than they need.To help people determine whether itâs time to downsize or not, I like to ask the question, âWhat is the right size for the next 10 years of your life?âThere is a lot to think about and discuss on the subject of rightsizing, which is why Iâd like for you to join us for our next seminar.This upcoming event will take place on November 15th at the Arrowhead Country Club, and I hope to see you there.âIS ALL THAT EXTRA SPACE TRULY NECESSARY?âOne thing to think about when youâre considering downsizing is the size of your current home and how that size affects its maintenance.

Whether you choose to live in an active adult community or simply wish to move into a smaller home, you can learn more about your options at our seminar.An attorney, title person, stager, professional photographer, and myself will all be present and ready to help.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

With 14,904 home sales on average each day, there are plenty of opportunities out there.Over my 31 years of experience, Iâve realized that whether your home sells or not isnât because of a bad location or in poor condition. Itâs the price. It always comes down to the price. Marketing will help a home sell faster, but the best marketing in the world wonât sell an overpriced listing.âIF YOUR HOME ISNâT SELLING, CHECK THE PRICE FIRST.âLast year in Maricopa County, there were 88,000 home sales. With over 35,000 Realtors in the Valley, that means each of them only sold two on average. Our team doesnât settle for average. Our agents average 24 home sales per year, ranking us #1 in Arizona and in the top 50 nationwide.We have many great ideas about how to sell your home but if your home isnât selling, the first thing you should look at and the first thing we will look at is its price.If you have any questions for us or need help properly pricing your home, donât hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email.

Some of them are easy; some are very challenging. Between each Realtor, there are also differences in their education level and commitment to the job. Iâve been a full-time agent for all of my 31 years in the business, and Iâve helped more than 5,000 families buy or sell a house in the Valley.When youâre searching for a Realtor, make sure youâre looking for the best in your area.

What are all the benefits of having a home warranty?It guarantees youâll be free and clear of any additional out-of-pocket costs for the next 12 months after you buy the house. Many things can go wrong inside a house with all the plumbing, heating, cooling, air conditioning, and electrical systems. If something does go wrong, your warranty is there to protect you.

Search All HomesLooking to sell a home? Get a FREE Home Value ReportWhen listing your house, there are a few reasons I recommend you get a home warranty.One of the primary reasons I recommend this is because when you list your house with us, you get free coverage for the first six months of warranty.We do this so that if anything happens, you wonât have to worry. Having a home warranty isnât just a good preventative measure, thoughâ it also helps with the inspection process.When you have a home inspection company come in to examine the items on your property prior to a buyer seeing the home, youâll be able to fix any issues on your own terms. If you catch problems before a buyer is able to find them themselves, the process becomes much easier and can often be less costly.âIF YOU HAVE A WARRANTY AND ANYTHING BREAKS IN YOUR HOME, YOUâLL ONLY PAY A SMALL DEDUCTIBLE.âAnother good reason to have a warranty is because we advertise to the buyer that there will be a year of warranty in place at close of escrow. This offer gives buyers a sense of assuredness. It lets them feel confident that they will be able to enter your property without fear of problems.Also, if you have a warranty and anything does break in your home, youâre only going to pay a small $59 deductible to have it repaired.For example, letâs say the compressor on your air conditioning suddenly stopped working. With as hot as our summers are, that sort of issue would be a pain both physically and financially. Without a home warranty, that kind of repair could cost thousands.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

When this happens, the sellers are going to have the luxury of choosing the offer that meets their needs. Thatâs an important thing to remember when making an offer yourself. Here are three ways to make sure your next offer meets the sellerâs needs:1. Get pre-approved. This shows the sellers that you are serious about buying. It also allows you to quickly make an offer once you find a home because you are already approved.âA PRE-APPROVAL SHOWS YOU ARE SERIOUS.â2. Write a good offer. Expect to pay full price or better to win in this market. Limit that inspection time, increase your earnest money deposit, and be confident that itâs the strongest offer possible.3. Write a letter to the seller. If you write a compelling letter to the seller that tells them why you love the house so much, it can create an emotional connection. If youâre neck and neck against another buyer, this could be enough to put you over the edge.

There are many reasons why, but the most important is to look for any deal killers.Your inspector will focus on things like mold, a leaky roof, or plumbing problems. You donât want to waste your time negotiating for cosmetic issues like dings on the wall. The home inspection is done to unveil any issues that would cost you tens of thousands of dollars in repairs after closing on the home.When you hire a home inspector, make sure that they have a lot of experience. Ideally, your inspector will carry some type of liability insurance, as well as omission insurance.âTHE HOME INSPECTION REVEALS ANY MAJOR ISSUES WITH THE HOME BEFORE YOU BECOME THE OWNER.âHome inspections are a big part of the real estate transaction. In Arizona, you have 10 days from the time your contract is accepted to complete the inspection. Once the inspection is complete, the seller has five days to respond to any of your repair requests.If your home inspection reveals too many deal killers or the seller is not willing to negotiate, you also have the option to walk away from the deal.Whether you are buying a resale property or a new construction property, I absolutely recommend that you hire a home inspector.

Get a FREE Home Value ReportIf youâre in the market to buy a new construction home, you may think that a home inspection will be unnecessary because you are the first person to live in the home. While it is true that youâll be the first person to live in that home, home inspections are still necessary for any kind of home purchase.I bought a new home a few years ago and ended up finding many things wrong with the home while it was being built. I had to call some things to the attention of the contractor. In Phoenix, contractors usually hire subcontractors for all phases of the construction, including the foundation, framing, electrical, plumbing, and roof.The biggest problem with subcontractors is that many of them are unskilled. In the past we had professional carpenters building these homes; today you may have someone building it who has only been on the job for a few months.âLUMBER QUALITY HAS BEEN CAUSING PROBLEMS AS WELL.âLumber quality is another thing that can cause problems when buying a new home. In my home, they had to replace 52 pieces of lumber after constructing the frame because the wood was split, cracked, or warped.Hiring a home inspector during the process will give you great peace of mind. They will come out to the build site several times during the process to ensure that everything is being constructed properly. Right before closing, they will do a final inspection and catch anything else that might be wrong. One year after closing escrow, itâs a good idea to have them come out again to make sure everything is holding up correctly.If you have any questions for me about home inspections or anything else about real estate, give me a call or send me an email.

Search All HomesLooking to sell a home? Get a FREE Home Value ReportIf youâve been thinking about selling your house, I have four reasons why you should absolutely do it in 2017.The first reason you should sell your home right now is that mortgage rates are still low. Today, rates are at around 4%, but the NAR, Zillow, and other publications have stated that interest rates will probably climb to about 5% by the end of the year. With interest rates currently low, buyers can afford more house, which puts you in a better position to sell your home.Second, inventory is low and buyer demand is high. This combination of supply and demand provokes multiple offers on homes, which is great news for the seller as multiple offers result in top dollar for their home.âWITH INTEREST RATES CURRENTLY LOW, BUYERS CAN AFFORD MORE HOUSE, WHICH PUTS YOU IN A BETTER POSITION TO SELL YOUR HOME.âThird, home prices have gone up. Over the last year, the NAR stated that homes prices rose by 6.8%. High home prices combined with low inventory creates a perfect storm for sellers.Lastly, the job market is improving nationwide, which means the economy is improving. This in turn is causing people to feel more comfortable making bigger purchases such as cars and homes.If you have any questions about the four reasons you should sell your home in 2017 or have any other real estate-related questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Get a FREE Home Value ReportWhatâs happening with rising interest rates in our current market?In November, they were holding steady at 3.8%. That means if you borrowed $200,000 at that time, your monthly payment would have been roughly $931.As we move into the first quarter of 2017, prices have gone up. Interest rates have gone up as well. Hypothetically speaking, if the price goes up $10,000 on that $200,000 house and interest rates rise from 3.8% to 4.8%, your monthly payment would increase to $1,105. Thatâs $175 more you would have to pay each month.The Federal Reserve tells us that we will probably see additional increases in rates this year, so the sooner you can jump into the market and buy a house, the better off you will be. This is because your purchasing power as a buyer diminishes as rates rise.âTHE SOONER YOU CAN BUY A HOUSE, THE BETTER.âFor example, at a 3.75% interest rate, your monthly payment for a $300,000 house would be $1,389. If that rate rises a quarter of a point, the amount you could qualify for drops by 2.5% to $292,500, and your monthly payment would increase to $1,396. If the rate rises a full percentage point, the amount you could qualify for drops by 10% to $270,000, and your monthly payment would increase to $1,408.After a certain point, we should see a leveling off of the increase in home prices weâve been experiencing here in the Phoenix area.If youâre in the market to buy or sell a home, please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email.
