They do open houses, knock on doors, make cold calls, and call expired listings and for sale by owner properties. They go out and find the business. ## Most top agents focus on marketing. Typically 80% or more of a top agentâs business comes from marketing. They get past clients, repeat business, and referrals. What do they do to market? I have the answer here. â Top agents focus on marketing.â In our Business By the Book class, we teach the top marketing and prospecting techniques to help you grow your business. [You can download the list here. ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/Jerimiah+Taylor/Email+Assets/San+Diego+Recruiting/Taylor+PDF-rotated.pdf)  If you have any other questions or youâre interested in our class, just give me a call or send me an email.

Even though we talk a lot about the database, it can be hard to truly grasp the significance of what it does for you and your real estate career.

We have many agents who want to build teams and leverage behavioral assessments in their screening process to determine whether the people theyâre hiring will be a fit. The most common of these behavioral assessments is one called the DiSC profile, and the big mistake a lot of people make is going to Tony Robbinsâ free website and using the free DiSC profile offered there. The problem is, that particular behavioral assessment is geared towards a person who is in their personal and home life, so the results you get from it can vary wildly from something youâd get from a paid Abelson DiSC that costs anywhere from $10 to $20 per report. Dr. Abelson has a great DiSC report thatâs entirely based on a personâs job world, and it provides much more clarity for the hiring process. Beyond that, we see people also use things like activity vector assessments from corporate consulting that cost $250 each. â This the only assessment that analyzes cognitive abilities as well as behavior. â At Keller Williams, **weâve built our own proprietary tool that our agents have access to called the Keller Personality Assessment.** This is the only one that actually gauges not only what a personâs natural behavioral style is, but it also talks a little bit about their cognitive abilities by checking things like IQ and how quickly they pick up on new things.

Weâre down about 9% in the number of new listings from last year. Weâve only brought about 12,000 homes on the market this year compared to 14,000 last year. The pace of sales is slowing down a bit too. We saw 7,400 home sales by this time last year, but right now weâre sitting at around 7,300. Combined, those two factors are really knocking down inventory in the market just as the busy season is starting. Thatâs going to make prices shoot up. Who knew that San Diego County could get more expensive to live in, right? Our median sale price is up by another 5.5% from last year and sits at $510,000, which is absolutely incredible. Half of the home sales are below $510,000, but the other half are above that number. Thatâs a higher figure than we saw in 2006. â There are only 1.6 months of available inventory right now. â  **The big question looming for Southern California is what will happen with our active inventory. **Weâre down by 30% year-over-year. As of April 1st, we had 4,864 properties listed for sale in the entire county, a 1.6 month supply. We typically sell about 3,700 homes each month and that number can rise as high as 5,000 in the summer. Buyers face a scary proposition in this market. When you consider that half of buyers are also sellers, the inventory problem makes sense. Sellers are hesitant because itâs hard for them to answer the question of where they are moving next in this kind of market. **Thatâs where the best agents are turning this market into an opportunity.** Next time, Iâll talk about how you can turn these market conditions into a big opportunity for your business.

The best time to set the stage for this is during the listing consultation with the seller. This way, they can clearly understand the dynamics of todayâs market. If we are on the market for more than two weeks and have had fewer than 10 showings and no offers in that time frame, we need to start entertaining the idea of a price reduction. â The best time to set the stage for this is during the listing consultation. â  **The key to getting the highest price when reducing your price will be to cut fast and cut hard so you get the property under contract quickly. ** The longer a home sits on the market, the lower the sellerâs net is. Sometimes getting the highest possible price for a property requires being brutally honest. If a home has been on the market and is not receiving offers, we call our sellers and let them know the situation. ##  If the market has spoken and the price is too high, we have two options for a reduction. One is a big 10% price reduction to sell quickly or a 5% reduction to test the waters further. At this point, itâs not even an opinion that the home is overpriced, itâs a fact.

How do you help your sellers do this?* *Thinking about a career in San Diego real estate sales? * ***[ Email me today for a private San Diego real estate career consultation.](http://sandiegorealestatecareers.blogspot.com/p/contact-us.html)*** I wanted to give you some advice on helping your sellers choose the right price for their homes. ## As we go into this shifting market, pricing a home is going to be a more in-demand skill than it has been in the last 10 years. As we come into the fourth quarter of 2016, weâre starting to see that the homes that aren't priced exactly right are sitting on the market. In fact, a lot of them end up having multiple price reductions and selling for less than they probably should have right out of the gate. When you're helping your seller choose the right price, here's the simple formula for me: I want to get real about the condition of the property I'm about to bring to market. Is it a two or is it a 10? From there, I want to get real about the condition of the other properties on the market. Are they nicer, or is your seller's property nicer? Once I've identified that, then I'm going to look at the competition and the way they are priced. I intend to be the best, highest quality home on the market for the price.** What I'm saying is that if you're the best value on the market, you'll always be the first to sell. ** As somebody who has sold dozens of properties of my own and thousands for other people, I can tell you unequivocally that the market does not let properties sell too cheaply. Here's what I mean by thatâif you think a property is worth somewhere between $450,000 and $500,000, I'm listing it at $450,000 every time. If I list at that price and it was supposed to be $500,000, I'm going to get multiple offers in a short time and it's going to sell for $500,000 or maybe even more. â The free market will always help you find the right price. â That's the beauty of the free market system; the market always helps you get the pricing right. It also punishes you when you get greedy on the front end. If the property is worth $500,000 and you price it at $510,000, the property begins to stagnate on the market, you have a low number of showings, and buyers start to wonder what's wrong with the property. Other agents may not show it, and it eventually sells for far less than it should. Do the right thing by helping your sellers pick the right price out of the gate and get the home sold quickly. If you have any more questions about pricing homes or I can help you in any way with your real estate career, give me a call or send me an email. I'd love to help you out!  ",

As a listing agent, it is your job to help your sellers choose the best offer. Is the best offer always the highest price? Or is a cash offer the best offer? Should you go with a buyer with conventional financing or a buyer with a VA loan? The best offer can actually be any of the above. **Ultimately, the best offer is the one that makes the most sense for your seller and is the most likely to close in the time frame your seller wants.** Let me give you an example. One of our agents recently sold a great house. An offer came in over asking price â in fact, it was so far over asking that we knew there would be an issue with the appraisal. The agent asked the buyer to add a clause that stated if the appraisal came in up to $25,000 under the offer price, the buyer would write a check for the difference. â As a listing agent, it is your job to help your sellers choose the best offer in a multiple offer situation. â The buyer agreed to the clause up front and we went to get the okay from the lender. We needed to verify that the buyer had the funds to cover the difference and that the loan program would allow them to do so. In this instance, the buyer didnât have the funds, so we took an offer that was a little bit less money but more able to close. As the listing agent, our job is to fully educate the seller and help them see the upcoming bumps in the road that they might otherwise miss.

Their argument is that since a client clicked on the DocuSign and signed the 10-to-20 page contract a few seconds later, they wouldnât have time to read the whole thing before signing.

Then give them some time, maybe an hour or two, to review the contracts. After that, you will get the DocuSign back and send them an email thanking them for signing it, and asking them to confirm that they read and fully understood everything they signed. ## Those are the best practices, and they defend your business.

The process is probably not always the exact same, but **because they have a uniform plan, they can measure their performance back against their expectations.** The lesson is, what do you expect out of your business? **Is your service standing up to your expectations?** If you have questions about this content, please reach out to me.

Whatâs the difference between a $100 million producing agent and a $1 million producing agent? **The answer is simple: itâs the way they think.** The $1 million agent gets to the office and **focuses on whatever is in front of them, not what is most important.** As the $1 million producer sees new ideas, strategies, and opportunities, they start to think, âWill this work? Can I do this?â They question their ability to perform at the next level. â Top agents turn possibilities into reality. âThe $100 million producer asks fewer questions, however, the questions they do ask are better. Instead of asking if something can work for them or their market, they ask, **âHow can I make that work for me?â** Then they find a way to implement the new idea quickly. Top agents automatically know that things are possible for them. **They just commit to turning possibilities into reality.** They hear a great idea and they take action fast. When you hear a great idea, you have 24 hours to take that next action step and implement the idea into your business. If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email.

This is then used as a sort of measuring stick to ensure that the sale price is close to what it should be. Real estate agents go a little further when they price homes because they look at comparables, but they also look at homes in competition with the one they are selling. **Their goal is to set an appealing price for your home so that buyers will fight each other to purchase your home, and this slowly raises the sale price.** If your agent managed to sell your home above the listed price, then they did a good job pricing it.

However, **if you spend 10 hours finding a rock-solid addition to your team, you can probably sell 20 homes by hiring that individual.** So, when they sell 20 homes and they make $100,000, you also receive $100K if you have a 50/50 split.

Here at Keller Williams, itâs becoming part of our language, and itâs the next level of opportunity for our top agents.  &lt;/b&gt;We all know how an agentâs team is set up. At the top, youâve got the rainmaker. As they grow their business, they hire an executive assistant and the remainder of their administrative team who manage all the non dollar-producing activities. &lt;/b&gt;Once they continue to grow their team to about 40-60 transactions per year, they hire that lead buyerâs agent. Then, when they are ready to go to the 6th level, they hire that lead listing specialist. At this point, the agent is running a business where they are able to buy and sell a lot without having to go on a ton of appointments while creating leverage.  &lt;/b&gt;At some point, they will hit a ceiling in their market, where it will cost them more to do business in that market than it would net them in a return. Thatâs where agent expansion comes in. Gary Keller has taught us that agents can take their brand and franchise it into other business locations around the country. The key to doing that lies in slightly reorganizing your team structure.  [](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PVT8vjPU61c/VilWQ57kjlI/AAAAAAAAAz0/cJOTSpDYNFw/s1600/Oct1.jpg) &lt;/b&gt;This is how the expansion agent sets up their team. Itâs like a tripod. On one leg, they bring leveraged lead generation in-house so all those leads are being generated and converted on the team level. The administrative leg of the team still does all the contract to close work. Then, the sales leg represents the traditional team, the agents on the ground.  &lt;/b&gt;The beauty of this system is that you can run your business from any market and expand to any market. Matt Fetick just opened an expansion team in London, for example. Expansion takes the lid off of what we know is possible for agents. So, if the millionaire real estate agent toolkit was the key to a million dollars in net income as an agent, this is the key to a $100 million net income.

Let me tell you why. The reason that the year starts on October 1st instead of January 1st for agents is due to the amount of time it takes to navigate a transaction. What happens if we hold an open house on October 1st, talk to a potential buyer about buying a home, set up a buyer consultation with them, get them pre-approved, go out looking for homes, find the perfect home, make an offer, get it accepted, open escrow, and have a 45 day closing? **Well, by now we are at, you guessed it, January 1st.** What most agents don't realize is that October is the perfect month to plan your business for the rest of the year. Now that it is November, it's time to get to work on that business plan. **If you'd like a free copy of our Millionaire Agent Business Plan, send us an email or give us a call.** Here's to your business, and a successful 2015!

But when you look deeper, there are many benefits to being a part of a team. Think of it like this: When you're working a transaction you have a job - but **when you have an agent helping you with a transaction, you have a business.** We all know **it takes about 50 hours to complete a real estate transaction;** 10 hours are spent generating the lead and 40 hours are spent servicing the lead and dealing with administrative work after close. Let's say you make $15,000 commission on a deal as a solo agent doing your own lead generation and paying your own costs - your hourly rate would come to $300. If you're on a team, you might pay a great assistant $800 to do the administrative stuff (40 hours) while you focus on lead generation (10 hours). At this point,you are making $1,420 an hour and working only 10 hours on a transaction. If you add a buyer's agent to the mix and split the commission, you'll still keep $7,100 of the original commission.** Here's where the magic of leverage comes in: **the buyer's agent will go out and look at properties, show properties, and write contracts (8 hours), while all you have to do is generate leads (2 hours). The buyer's agent makes a healthy $750 an hours, while **you make $3,500 an hour because** **you spend only 2 hours generating leads!** So, **by dividing labor and using leverage to get deals done, you are making more money per hour and working fewer hours.** But you don't stop there - since you now only focus on generating leads, you focus in on that and dedicate more and more hours to it. **It's all about finding out how much your time is worth and maximizing it.** An added bonus to all of this is that each member of the team gets better at their job because that's all they do. They become specialists! As you can see, joining a team is a whole lot more profitable than it would seem on the surface. It's all about using the magic of leverage to maximize your results and grow your business. Want to know more about building teams?

Our market is currently appreciating, though it is soft in terms of units. Because of this, **sellers are under the impression that we don't bring much value in these conditions.** This is **simply not true.** What we've seen is sellers listing with agents for a set price, then refusing to cooperate with the agent that brings the buyer's broker. They do this because **if they guarantee the cooperating commission, that broker would be on the hook for it. **How can we connect buyers with these homes and still get paid? ## First, you need to use a buyer representation agreement. This way, you can show your client every single home, pay the fiduciary duty to them that they're hiring you to do, and **you can still get paid.** The great news is the seller is usually willing to pay your commission, which you can add in as part of your RPA or purchase contract as a buyer nonrecurring closing cost. Remember, you can not make your commissions a part of the contract, it must be called a buyer non-recurring cost. By doing so, **you get your commission and the buyer gets the home they want. **  If you have any questions about this topic, we're always available to chat. We look forward to talking with you soon!

Today I wanted to present to you the** 'Low Inventory Challenge'.** If we stretch back to about ten years ago, you might remember Shift, which was written by** Gary Keller **when we went from a high inventory to a low-inventory market and vice versa. **His goal was for agents like you and me to find the best tactics to capture the most listings. In our case, we will be trying to capture a For Sale by Owner listing.** If you're like me in this market you're probably talking to sellers, and some of those people may not see as much value in our services as they used to. **The internet has helped consumers sell their homes themselves**, and because of this, you need to truly sell yourself to them and articulate your value proposition. I'm going to give you a quick example of this today. *\"So you see, Mr. Seller, when you list yourself as a For Sale by Owner (FSBO), we call that the veritable 'Garage Sale' of real estate. You see, if you went to a watch store and bought a brand new, shiny watch for $1,000 dollars and then brought it home and set it on a table at your garage sale, you would never get $1,000 dollars for it, even with a receipt sitting right next to it. This is because whenever salespeople are not involved, people are always trying to save money. So right off the bat when a buyer comes to look at your home, they're going to knock off the top 5-7% of your home's asking price because they realize that there is no agent to pay commission to.\"* *\"This is why you hire me. Because I can show you my flexible listing strategy. You know, if you do sell it yourself, I'll even waive the commission fee and complete the transaction for you.\"*  ## Don't Forget About a Free Webinar Opportunity Did you know there was over $11.5 Billion in international real estate transactions that took place in California in 2013? In fact, California ranks 2nd in the nation for most international real estate transactions. Our regional leadership has arranged for a special webinar on **Monday, May 5th at 11:00 am PST.** On this webinar, we will be presenting research on the international transactions going on in California, and how agents across the country are leveraging KWâs Global Property Specialist (GPS) network to win more business every day. [**Click here to register for the webinar**.](https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/345689489) There is no cost or obligation, just opportunity. Contact me today for the full strategy that we use with FSBO's and I will give you the Flexible Listing Commission Program that we have used to sell and list hundreds of FSBO properties. If you would like to contact me to talk about these strategies or about San Diego real estate, then please do not hesitate to call (858) 255-1652 or email me at [JTaylor@kw.com](mailto:JTaylor@kw.com) ",

Today I just wanted to talk about the success that the agents in our office have seen so far. **The proof is in our numbers, and numbers never lie. ** Even though the number of listings in the **MLS is down by 12%,** our agents here in the Carmel Valley Office have managed to sell **26% more real estate than they did at this time last year.**  **Also, the average agent here in our office is outpacing the market by 32% with the number of listings that they're selling.**  What's even more exciting is that you'll see** according to this graph here that they are actually outpacing the market by 69% in listing sold volume,** and we know that volume is how they get paid, so this is a great indication of what our agents are doing here.
