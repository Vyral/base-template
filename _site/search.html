        "content": "Need ideas for something to do with a small space in your home? Try these three great, easy tips:Â 1. Choosing the right paint. Using colors like neutrals, whites, creams, and grays can make a room feel larger than it really is. Pairing the right lighting and paint color is also very important; be sure to choose lighting that will enhance your colors, and avoid those bulbs and colors that cause glares.âBe sure to choose lighting that will enhance your colors, and avoid those bulbs and colors that cause glares.â2. Use high shelving in closets for those rarely used items. Also utilize high ceilings and walls for guitars, surfboards, or any item that can double as decoration.3. Use furniture for storage. Donât have a lot of floor space? Use tables and benches with hidden storage compartments. Crates, boxes, and containers that are low in depth but wide are great for under-bed storage.If youâre looking for a new home, check out our inventory on www.JeffCookRealEstate.com, and feel free to reach out to us for any questions you have.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "To have a successful holiday home sale, you need to make sure you show your home in its best possible light. Here are a few tips to help you do just that:1. Create appealing aromas. Scents like apple pie, cookies, and cinnamon are popular, but avoid using artificial fragrances like perfumes or candles that may affect a buyerâs allergies.2. Offer warm treats. Follow up your delightful aroma with tasty treats like freshly baked cookies. This will allow the buyer more time in the home to feel welcomed and visualize how living there could be.âComfort is truly the key to making a buyer feel as though they belong in your home.â3. Make the home bright. A bright home is a sold home. Turn on the lights, open the curtains, and allow in as much natural light as possible. Amber-colored bulbs in your fixtures will also give a warm glow thatâs perfect for fall and winter.4. Play uplifting music. Silence during the winter months can come across eerily to buyers and make your home seem empty. Play soft instrumental music in the background to make the buyer feel invited, and it may even trigger a âwhere do I signâ mood in them.5. Emphasize comfort. Luxurious blankets, tablecloths, and even soft pillows make a home seem a bit more inviting. Comfort is truly the key to making a buyer feel as though they belong in your home.If you follow these tips, youâre setting yourself up for a successful sale this holiday season.

In his words, âcoffee equals contracts.âOf course, even the most motivated individual still needs the right environment to thrive. Before coming to Jeff Cook Real Estate, Brad was working on his own. He was doing a few deals a year, sure, but he wasnât seeing the level of success he knew he was capable of.When he came to us in 2016, everything changed. He began producing at a much higher level almost right away. In fact, he sold over $12 million in sales volume and was named âAgent of the Yearâ within his first full year on our team.Better yet, Brad was able to do all of this without having to shell out any business expenses. Not having to pay money upfront for marketing is one of the things he loves most about working with us. We offer our agents the resources, support, and financial freedom they need to succeed.âIf youâre ready to take control of your future and steer your life and career toward the success you deserve, donât hesitate to reach out.âAnd this is just a small glimpse into what sets us apart from the industry standard. Our agents are also highly knowledgeable about recent trends and statistics, meaning theyâre able to help our clients earn the best possible deals as they navigate the market.At the end of the day, Brad is living proof of whatâs possible for real estate professionals who join our team. He went from selling just a handful of homes to nearly 50 a year, and his career isnât the only area of his life thatâs been transformed. Heâs also now a successful real estate investor, as well.Joining us has allowed him to have the life heâs always dreamed ofâliving on a beautiful island, visiting Mt. Pleasant in his free time, and working at a great brokerage that makes it all possible.With all of that said, weâve got some great news: Weâre hiring. If youâre ready to take control of your future and steer your life and career toward the success you deserve, donât hesitate to reach out.After all, in Bradâs words, âJoining Jeff Cook Real Estate has opened a lot of doors for me, and it can for you too.âYou can learn more about our team and the opportunity to join us by visiting www.joinjcre.com.If you have any other questions or would like more information, please give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "Sometimes, homeowners may fail to notice the parts of their property that are outdated or in need of repair. Itâs easy to overlook issues in oneâs own home. However, when it comes time to list, homeowners should realize that the buyers theyâre bringing in will certainly notice these flaws.Thankfully, there are a few ways you can boost your homeâs value before you sell, and today Iâll be sharing four of the most effective:1. Update the bathroom. Changing out hardware like towel racks or the knobs on cabinets can be an inexpensive way to give your bathroom a facelift. Or, if money permits, upgrading your tile can be even more beneficial.âEven before stepping foot in your home, buyers will judge what they expect to find inside by how your property looks on the outside.â2. Update your homeâs lighting. Good lighting can instantly make rooms appear larger and more welcoming. So before you list, take some time to assess the lighting fixtures throughout your home. Replace any burnt out bulbs, and, if necessary, swap out a few fixtures for newer, more luminous ones. Speaking of lighting, mounted lighting strips beneath cabinets can be a great addition. Buyers love this simple feature.3. Repaint as needed. Giving the home a fresh coat of paint will make it appear bright and clean. Even just the smell of fresh paint can help leave buyers with a positive impression of your home. However, make sure you stick to light, neutral colors, and that you also update your trim.4. Fix up the homeâs landscaping and curb appeal. Even before stepping foot in your home, buyers will judge what they expect to find inside by how your property looks on the outside. A freshly mowed yard, well-trimmed landscaping, and the addition of darkly colored mulch will all go a long way in boosting your homeâs curb appeal.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.",

        "content": "Today we are going to talk about the three reasons staging your home is one of the keys to getting it sold quickly and for top dollar.1. A staged home helps you have better listing photos. The very first showing is not whenever potential buyers come into your home to look around, but instead when they look online. By having your home staged with furniture, it allows us to showcase your home better online so that buyers are more likely to come and look at it.2. A staged home helps buyers know how they would live in the space. Buyers want to see how they would live in your home. However, they sometimes have a very tough time trying to imagine where to put their own TV and bed. By having your home staged, it allows buyers to easily see where they may be able to put their own things, which helps sell your home faster.âBuyers want to see how they would live in your home.â3. A staged home helps you stand out from the competition. When a home is photographed while vacant, small issues like worn carpet and nicks in the wall will be more apparent. A well-staged listing is far more likely to earn top dollar than one that has been left bare.I encourage you to get your home staged. We have a wonderful vendor list for this that includes Miss Shannon Hawkins of Refresh Your Nest. You can visit her website here to learn more.If you have any additional questions about staging or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to contact me by phone or email.

If your kids have moved out and you are tired of cleaning a big house, now may be the time for you to downsize. Size may be an issue for new families or families with kids who require more space. In this case, it may be time to upgrade. We have a specialized trade program that gives our upsizing and downsizing clients the ability to transition out of their existing home and move into a new one.Â 2. Commuting.

School district. You may want your kids in a different school district and you now have the ability to put them into a better school district to get a better education.Â 4. Financial situation.

Either way, we have an immediate buyout program where we have the ability to purchase your existing home from you no matter what your circumstance.Â Knowing if and when you should move is confusing.

Therefore, weâve prepared a comprehensive strategy on how to help you navigate the twists and turns of selling a property.1. Take time to choose the right agent. Youâll want to make sure that you choose an agent who you feel comfortable with, one who has a proven track record of selling lots of homes. We market for buyers all over the country who are relocating to our area. When you put your home on the market, we take those buyers and bring them to your house, marrying them into the perfect real estate transaction. That sounds simple, but most real estate agents will put your home on a whole bunch of websites to market it, meaning that they list your home before they find buyers. Before you even call us, we already have our buyer list put together so that when you do list, weâll have buyers in mind already, allowing you to sell your home fast and for top dollar.âA pre-inspection is a way of showing your buyers that your home has a clean bill of health.â2. Get a pre-inspection. A pre-inspection is a way of showing your buyers that your home has a clean bill of health. Since a buyer will request an inspection anyway, getting one done before you list means you can preemptively make any repairs or upgrades. When they see your home in such good condition, theyâll feel more comfortable moving forward with the purchase of your home without having to do extra research and time-wasting activities.Â 3. Keep in constant communication with your agent. With us, weâll have a conversation with you every Friday to update you on how the process is going, how weâre marketing your home, what activity is upcoming, and whatâs happened so far. That way, youâre in the loop and you can enjoy the process of selling your home.If youâre interested in selling your home, we would love to talk with you and interview for the job, explaining our comprehensive process. Please donât hesitate to reach out to usâit is our goal to eliminate your stress during your real estate transition.",

You need to figure out what youâre looking for in a home. Things like price range and amenities are important, but the top factor you must determine is location, location, location. Our team would be happy to help you determine what kind of home you can afford, and then locate relevant properties based on the list of your top 10 wants and needs.2. Find an experienced agent. Itâs critically important for you to have professionals working on your behalf throughout the process. Jeff Cook Real Estate is more than qualified to meet this need.3. Have a travel budget. Sure, we can Facetime or Skype you to bring you on virtual tours of homes, but chances are that youâll want to check out your dream home in person.

Itâs been completely life-changing for me.âIn her first full year, she sold 25 homes and ended up being named our Rookie of the Year.âI just did what Jeff told me to do, and it worked for me.ââI just did what Jeff told me to do, and it worked for me.

        "content": "Moving can be a stressful process for you and your family, so here are some things to keep in mind and tips to follow to make your move as seamless as possible.First, whoâs going to help you move? Will you call in a few favors from some family and friends or call a professional moving company? If youâd rather use a professional moving company, we recommend Move Buddies. They do a wonderful job, and I even used them for my own move. You can get in touch with them by visiting www.movebuddies.com or calling them directly at (843) 972-9039.Second, you need to prepare for the big day. Oftentimes, moving companies can come by and estimate how many boxes it will take to haul your stuff, and they can also bring their own boxes ahead of time so you can start packing. Sometimes, theyâll even help you pack those boxes, depending on what level of service you request from them. In any case, make sure you have plenty of boxes.Keep in mind that what you have in a guest bedroom in your old house might not necessarily go in a guest bedroom in your new house. Floor plans vary and can change how you may organize that new room. The best thing you can do in this case is label everything ahead of time and specify where itâs going in the new house. This way, you wonât have people constantly asking you âWhere does this go?â on moving day.Organizing the move on the day of the move is another important task. Consider where the moving truck is going to goâare there parking spaces available or a driveway that will be cleared for it? What needs to happen to get that moving truck as close to the front door as possible?Once the moving starts, it goes fast, but unloading the truck takes a lot longer than loading it. Make sure you have plenty of drinks and snacks on hand so when your moving crew comes over, they can focus on the task at hand.If you have any more questions about how to make your move seamless or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home in our market, donât hesitate to reach out to us. Weâd love to help you.âSave yourself some time by labeling everything ahead of time and specifying where it will go in the new house.â",

        "content": "Today I want to let you in on how to maximize what you earn for your home sale while minimizing your expenses. There are three key ways to sell your home quickly and for top dollar.Use online marketing.Â With the power of the internet, your first showing is actually what buyers see online. Times have changed a little bit in this regard. My team and I can help you navigate through this marketing process. We feature your home across over a thousand websites to gain the maximum exposure for your home.Look at comparable homes. Examining home listings that are similar to yours can help you determine your own sale price. However, be careful with the figures you look at. Home values have been rapidly increasing lately. A $300,000 home is worth around $10,000 to $20,000 more now than it was a year ago. When you look at comparable homes that sold in the past six to 12 months, you have to factor in the 5% or 6% appreciation rate weâve seen over that time. My team can help you with this. Not only can we look at whatâs sold in the past, we can also predict how quickly inventory will move in various neighborhoods.âA little bit of money will go a long way in improving your home.âMake key home improvements. There are a few very simple, relatively inexpensive home improvements you can make to help maximize your sale. Did you know that, during showings, 80% of buyers make up their mind about whether they want to go into a home before they even exit their vehicle? This decision comes from the quality of your curb appeal, but also from the opinion they formed based on your online listing. A little bit of money will go a long way in improving your home. Make sure your home is clean and free of clutter both inside and out.If you have any other questions or would like more information feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "We have an amazing real estate team. Weâve been in business for 15 years. Whether you already have a license or not, Iâd like to talk to you. We help our real estate agents be successful by providing the marketing, leads, systems, processes, presentation, and operation staff you need.Instead of just listening to me, hereâs what Whitney Muncey has to say:I started working with Jeff Cook Real Estate at the end of February in 2016. I had no real estate experience prior to working here. I did a few different things. I worked at a domestic violence and sexual assault shelter, coached JV basketball, and ultimately ended up teaching second grade.Working at Jeff Cook Real Estate has changed my life in so many ways. My financial freedom has certainly changed from being a teacher and doing the things I used to do. I have a little bit more room there that ultimately makes me happier and makes everyone happier.The other thing that working at Jeff Cook Real Estate has done is made me realize my why. If you donât know what your why is, stop whatever you are doing and figure that out. Until you do that, youâre not living. So many of us go through life and itâs the one thing we really only get one shot at. We find our comfort zone and sail along. If you do that, you cut yourself short from so many things, so many experiences, and education.With Jeff Cook Real Estate, I was able to figure out what my why was. Once I dug that up, it was my motivation to push forward to financial freedom and it gave me the ability to push myself to find out what I can do. Jeff Cook Real Estate changed my life in many ways.It can certainly change yours as well.If youâre looking to get into real estate, there are a few things I would suggest before you start that venture.The first and most important is that you want to be happy with where you are. Culture is a huge thing. In real estate, you deal with a ton of different people with different personalities. You have to work with people who have fun, and you need a support system. Thatâs what I got here at Jeff Cook Real Estate.Equally important to culture is that during the process of our 60-hour or 30-hour class for real estate, people from different agencies and brokerages are going to tell you, âCome work with me, weâre amazing. Weâll make you $1 million right out of the gate.â However, there is no commitment from them to you. They all say, âShow me what youâve got. Youâll spend a lot of money and a lot of time away from your family. Six months from now, if that doesnât work out, Iâm sorry.â And thatâs all there is to it.When Jeff came in, he had an entirely different story. He talked about the systems we have here at Jeff Cook Real Estate and confirmed that he is investing in me prior to my having to prove myself. To have someone who doesnât know you invest a lot of time, money, and effort in you before you prove yourself means a lot and it really stood out to me.** That was my decision-maker.** If this man is willing to take something that heâs worked so hard to achieve and invest in me, then I canât go wrong.I would like to thank Whitney for taking the time to share her experience today. If you have any questions about joining our real estate team, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!âJeff Cook Real Estate changed my life in many ways.â",

        "content": "Are you ready to buy a home but donât know exactly where to start? We can help. Here are the top five steps you need to know in order to buy your forever dream home:1. Check your credit score. Itâs not so much that you need to have a score over 650 in order to get approved. If you have a credit score closer to 650 or 700, you can get a better interest rate than you would with a 600 score. Knowing your credit score can help you determine exactly what your down payment situation looks like.2. Donât open new lines of credit. You donât want to let anyone else pull your credit while youâre going through this process. We worked with a family once that got pre-approved, had an amazing home search, and found the perfect house. Then they went out and bought new furniture and a new car on credit. Opening those new lines of credit dropped their credit score significantly, which meant they couldnât get financing on the house. They had a truck full of new furniture and no home to put it in.Luckily, we were able to work our magic and get it done. Iâm just telling you that you donât want to open new lines of credit or have other people pull your credit score. Donât make any large purchases while you go through the process because it could count against your debt-to-income ratio.3. Find a really good mortgage lender. Donât worry, we have one for you: Tabor Mortgage Group. You can call them at 843-408-0856 or Google them. You can find everything you want to know about them online. We would be happy to pair you up with someone over there to help you with step four.4. Get pre-approved before you start your home search. Getting pre-approved will help you find out exactly how much the bank will lend you based on your specific financial information. They will look at your income, expenses, and credit score. They can help you figure out how much of a down payment youâll need, what your monthly mortgage payment will be, and what kind of interest rate you will have. Getting pre-approved ahead of time is important so that you donât waste your times looking at homes above or below your price range.5. Start your home search with us. We will help you find your forever dream home. We have a free program where we will walk you through each of the steps of finding your perfect home. We will make sure that the title is clear and that the home is everything you thought and hoped it would be.If you are ready to start your home search or have any other real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!âDonât make large purchases during the home buying process.â",

Have a consultation with one of our listing specialists.

They can also help you determine what the next steps are. We provide this to you for free.2. Begin preparing the home for sale. You donât have to do it all now or all in one weekend, but start putting away things that you donât need. Start decluttering, cleaning, and double checking your light bulbs, your yard, and every other detail of your home.âOur professional photographer is one of the most important members on our team.â3. Have a professional photographer. Thatâs one of the most important members on our team. We give all of our clients a free certificate for a free photography shoot whenever they are ready.

You bring the house, weâll bring the marketing and photography, and weâll marry it for an absolutely perfect real estate transaction.I would love and be honored to help you with the sale of your home.

Finding the right home takes a lot of time, energy, and money, so itâs important to know what youâre really getting into before you make the decision to buy.Today, Iâd like to talk about some things you should consider when buying a home.âItâs important to know what youâre really getting into before you make the decision to buy.â  The neighborhood. Considering where youâll be living and who youâll be living near should be a big factor in whether you decide to buy a certain home. When youâre looking at a property, ask yourself if the neighborhood is a good fit for you and your family. Also, consider any upcoming life changes. You should also keep in mind whether a neighborhood will continue to be a good fit for you as you move into the future.  The commute. How long will it take you to get to work, school, or other important places you frequent from the new home youâre considering? You may think you want to live super close to the beach or the downtown area, but you need to be careful with such a big decision. Think about this: You likely commute to work far more often than you do to the beach. So, is it better to live closer to the beach or to your place of work? Living 10 minutes away from the beach might not be everything you dreamed of if it means youâre 40 minutes away from work each morning.  Do your research. Before settling on a home, there are a number of questions you should ask. Is the property within a homeowners association? If it is, whatâs covered? Will you be required to get flood insurance? What additional costs will be associated with the property? My team and I can help you answer these questions and others. The important thing is that you know exactly what youâre getting into.Â   The equity swing. Is this going to be the best investment possible for the amount of money youâre putting in?

Coming out of the holidays, it will take on average between two and three months to find the perfect buyer, relocate them, and get them into your home.Â Hereâs the interesting part: weâve already started working with a lot of relocation buyers that have already started the process, so if you need to get out in, say, 30 days or so, we have the ability to help you with that too. If time is of the essence, weâre the people to call.Last but not least, how much have homes appreciated in the last year? Average sales prices went from about $188,000 to $191,000, so homes have increased by about $3,000 on average. We expect that to continue to increase this year as well, and for real estate to continue to be a sound investment.If you have any questions, please feel free to reply to this email or give us a call. Weâd love to chat with you.",

        "content": "Today, I just wanted to share some interesting statistics hot off the press. I just got the year-to-date stats for up until the end of November.What an absolutely phenomenal year in real estate it has been. The biggest challenge that we have is the amount of inventory for sale in the market. On that note, if youâre thinking of selling your home, please reach out to us because we do have buyers in all price ranges available and interested in purchasing homes.Year to date, we had over 22,000 homes enter the market, which is a bump of about 5% over last year. During that same time, weâve had a bump of over 1,000 properties, up to about 17,000 properties come on the market and sell. This means over 5,000 properties still didnât sell. That said, itâs important to know that you have an agent whoâs on your side helping you price it properlyâone who has the buyers and will help you market and negotiate it properly.âWhat an absolutely phenomenal year in real estate it has been.âHow long does it take for an average home to sell? The average home takes about 60 days to sell. Something Iâm very proud of is that my team and I are able to sell a home, on average, in about 32 days. Youâll sell a little bit faster with us because we spend extra money on marketing and really trying to put your home out there. Not to mention weâre already hunting buyers before you ever call us. We have a database of buyers available before you pick up the phone and call us.Last but not least, how much have prices gone up? It depends on whether youâre in the first-time homebuyer range or you own a luxury home. On average, prices this year have gone up about 4% to 5%. If you have a $250,000 or $300,000 home, your house values increased somewhere around $10,000 or $15,000 this past year, which is great news.If you want to know what your home specifically is worth, feel free to reach out to us for no cost and no obligation.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today Iâm going to share the top four features that buyers are really searching for in their new dream homes. If youâre thinking of selling your home, you may want to take special note of this so that you can see how your home stacks up in regard to what buyers are looking for in the home.First, did you know that buyers make up 90% of their mind about whether or not they like your home before they ever get out of the car? This means that they already know about the price and about the size of the home, but when they pull up and see your home for the first time, they want to know if they can envision themselves pulling up to this home on a daily basis and hanging outside with their families.Â Since thatâs the case, you need to make sure that the outside is awesome; make sure the pressure washing is done (including the driveway), the landscaping is neatly pruned, and that there is straw or mulch in the plant beds across the board. Do whatever it takes to make the curb appeal look amazing.Second, is the home family-friendly? How is the floor plan arrangedâdo you have an extra, unused bedroom that you could envision being used as a bedroom by another family? Is the backyard neat and clean? The backyard should show as wonderfully as the inside of the home.âBuyers base 90% of their decision to buy your home based on curb appeal before they ever step foot inside.âThird, does your home need any updates? Are the air conditioner filters clean? Do all your light fixtures work properly? Are there odors present? Essentially, ask yourself if thereâs anything you can do to give the interior a little facelift to make it look and feel neat and clean. Weâd be happy to come over and give you a free evaluation to determine if thereâs something that you need to do in order to get it show-ready.Last but not least, consider your asking price. Set the price to maximize the return on your investment, but not at such a range that buyers wonât even come look at the home. We see that when sellers price outside of the acceptable range, they eventually have to lower their price over time, ultimately causing them to end up at the bottom of that range.Â Pricing is one of our areas of expertise. Weâll come over and discuss exactly what your home could sell for in todayâs market so that you can maximize the value of your home and avoid lowball offers.If youâre thinking of selling your home, weâll be happy to give you a free evaluation. Simply call or email us and weâll help you with any questions you have. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Everyone knows how stressful moving can be, but I have a few quick tidbits to share with you that will help your move go off without a hitch. I just moved myself, so I speak from experience.First, separate all of your stuff into three piles: things you will keep and move with you, things you will give away or sell, and things youâll throw away.Â I know itâs hard to put any stuff into that last pile, but if youâve moved multiple times, it might be a good idea to consider what really has to come with you.Â âDeclutter your home before you put your house on the market.âSecond, declutter your home before you put your house on the market. Whenever we show a house, it looks amazing if itâs decluttered. Clear anything that can be packed up into boxes and store it in the garage, in a closet, or somewhere else.Â Third, use clear storage bins. This will save you the time of having to look through each box for whatâs inside after the move is over.Â Fourth, label everything with blue painterâs tape. This is a tip my wife and I used. We labeled everything with blue painterâs tape and wrote down where it was supposed to go in the new house. This will keep you from having to double-move all your boxes after your movers or helpers have already left.Â If youâd like a free estimate of what your move will cost, reply to this email and Iâll put you in touch with Move Buddies, a local moving company that we partner with. They can also provide boxes and a moving truck and take care of everything in just one day if you decide to use them.Â If you need any more moving tips or youâre thinking about buying or selling a home in the Charleston market, please donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

There are actually three really compelling reasons why fall may be the best time to sell your property.Â Maybe youâre thinking, âThanksgiving and Christmas are coming up. I just donât want to think about putting my house on the market.âÂ If thatâs the case, I can tell you that all of your neighbors who plan on selling their homes are thinking the exact same thing. They will wait until spring and summer to do so.Â If you put your home on the market in the fall or winter, there will be fewer homes on the market for yours to compete against.Â Buyers also tend to be more motivated during the fall and winter. Some life circumstance has caused them to have to buy a home now, so those are two important things to consider: less competition and more motivated buyers.Â âThere is a lot of pent-up buyer demand this fall.âFinally, there is no better time to take listing photos of your home than the fall. Your home will look amazing. Weâll put those photos online and do what we do bestâmarket your home, bring buyers to you, and get top dollar for your property. Â This year, there is another reason to list your home on the market during fall or winter.Â Weâve had several storms coming up the east coast which, combined with a number of other factors, have caused the real estate market to be a little slower the second half of the year. Â People have been waiting for the storms to pass or for school to start up again before entering the market.Â As a result, there is a lot of pent-up demand.Â These buyers are working with us in real time to find the perfect home, which is just another reason to put your home on the market, sell quickly, and get your asking price this fall or winter.If you have any other questions about selling your home, just give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Whatâs the latest outlook on our fall market here in Charleston?There have been a lot of discussions out there about the real estate market stalling, and itâs true that there are some factors that have caused the market to temporarily slow down here in our area.First off, any time a storm hits any part of the southeast, it causes an economic slowdown all across the area. This year, for the first time in a long time (maybe ever), there were two large-named Category 4 storms that hit the southeast. That, the current political uncertainty, kids going back to school, and the fourth quarter in general have all contributed to this temporary slowdown.Now, letâs look at the raw statistics and how theyâve changed since this time last year.The number of new listings decreased by 11.2%, and the number of pending sales were also down. Inventory shrank by 17%, so not only did we have over 11% fewer homes come on the market, but an additional 6% of sellers took their homes off the market during this time.âEven though the media says the real estate market is stalling, you can still get top dollar for your property.âThe problem with these numbers is new buyers that are coming into the market are having a hard time finding that perfect home.Continuing with the statistics, home prices rose 5% year over year, and the median sales price is $256,000. The average days on market shrank to 53 days, and the supply of homes also shrank 20%.Because home prices are up, the average days on market is down, and the supply of homes is low, even though the market has slowed down slightly, now may be an amazing opportunity to put your house on the market.Â If you put your home on the market, itâs priced effectively, and we put a world-class marketing system behind it, it will sell at a record pace and youâll be able to get top dollar for it.All real estate markets are different, but because of the job growth and industry growth in our area, our market is still on fire.If youâre interested in putting your home on the market, you want to buy a home, or you have any other questions, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

        "content": "Whether you are buying a home, selling a home, or happy where you are, here are a few clever things you can do to make sure that your home is protected and secure:First, go around and inspect the locks on your doors. Over time, locks can deteriorate, especially if itâs a door that you donât use very often. Make sure that they are all functioning properly.Â You can also install safety lighting around the exterior of the house. Motion-activated floodlights are sure to scare off any bad people lingering outside.Â Be aware of what you showcase in your home. If you are selling your home, make sure that you donât have any valuables or personal items out in the frame of the pictures. Even when you have guests over to your home, you donât want to leave anything out that would entice someone to break into your home.Â I also recommend that you take account of all your spare keys. If youâve gone out of town and given a friend or neighbor the spare key, make sure you get it back so itâs not just laying around their house. It may also be helpful to change your locks every once in awhile.âBe very careful about posting to social media when youâre out of town.âWhen you go out of town on vacation, do you post on Facebook that youâre going away? If someone is interested in getting into your home and they know that youâre going to be out of town for a week, thatâs when theyâll break in. You have to be very careful about your social media posts. Whenever I go out of town, I wait until Iâm home to post any photos or anything about my vacation on social media.Â Finally, our partner CPI Security offers free alarms to all of our clients, family, and friends. If you are interested, simply reach out to alarm@jeffcookrealestate.com. Doug will reach out to you to discuss the different programs that are available to you. You can even monitor your home on your phone. There is a monthly monitoring fee, but the alarm and the system itself is completely free.Â If you have any other questions about protecting your home or if you are curious about whatâs happening in our local real estate market, just give us a call or send us an email.

Before the buyer gets out of the car, theyâre already 80% sure about whether or not they are seriously interested in your home.Â In order to attract more buyers to your home, there are a few things you can do to enhance your curb appeal:Â 1. Maintain your lawn. Make sure the grass is neatly manicured.Â 2. Donât overlook pressure washing the exterior of your home. Pressure washing only costs a few hundred dollars and it makes all the difference in the world. Whenever a buyer comes to a home that hasnât been pressure washed on the outside, they automatically judge what the inside will look like. Donât let those buyers get a bad impression of your home.Â 3. Donât overlook the driveway. When you do the pressure washing, you can also have them do the entire driveway for a few extra dollars.Â âPut yourself in the buyerâs shoes and look at your home.â4. Invest in outdoor lighting. Serious buyers will drive by your home after dark to check things out, so install some landscape lighting in the flowerbeds to make your home more presentable.Â 5. Add more color to your flowerbeds. Vibrant flowerbeds will catch a buyerâs eye. Shrubs, annuals, and perennials will help your home show in its best light.Â 6. Make sure everything is clean. Put yourself in the buyerâs shoes. Would you enjoy hanging out in the backyard? Clean up the interior of your home too so that you are always ready for showings.Â If you follow these tips, you will attract more buyers to your home.

What we do in this case is provide a fair written offer to you to analyze and determine whether or not youâre interested in selling your home. We have the ability to work with your existing mortgage or pay cash so you can transition to your next point in life.âWith this program, time is on your side.âFor example, a client of ours named Cynthia recently came to us needing to sell her home in Summerville because her father is elderly and sick and she needs to move in with him in order to take care of him. Instead of facing the prospect of commuting back and forth between the two properties and needing to maintain two separate homes, she called Titan and said she needed to sell her property as quickly as possible. Within 10 days, we were able to pay cash for her house. She was then able to take that money and move in with her father.Another client of oursâMiss Montefordâcame to us as a single mom who worked in the military and had orders to move to Florida by August. She previously listed her house in the traditional manner and even had it under contract, but her buyer had a financing issue that caused the deal to fall through. Despite this, we were able to work with her existing mortgage and help her start the next chapter of her life.The interesting thing about this program is that time is on your side. We have the ability to close within a few months or a few daysâit all depends on you and your situation, and you can stay in the home as long as you desire. Weâd be happy to map out a timeline to fit your scheduleIf youâre interested in a confidential analysis detailing how weâd be able to make a fair written offer on your home, just reply back to this email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Everybodyâs saying our real estate market is hot right now, but is it really that hot? How easy is it to buy or sell a home?We can get a good idea by comparing year-over-year statistics, so letâs compare the year-to-date statistics from 2017 to where we were at this point in 2016.Right now, there are about 5,000 available homes for sale, which is about 600 more properties that have been put on the market than last year. This is a decent number, and it means there are more available options to choose from. Itâs true that homes are selling fast, but there is still a healthy number of homes for sale.So far this year, 9,300 homes have sold. Last year, that number stood at 8,700. The fact that weâre listing more homes at about the same rate that weâre selling more homes means our market is balanced. If the number of homes being listed was declining and the number of homes selling was increasing, then weâd have a major problem.âNow is a tremendous time to buy and sell in Charleston.âIn total, 13,400 homes have come on the market in 2017âwhich means almost 4,000 homes failed to sell. Part of this represents the marketâs level of excess inventory. If this proves anything, itâs that you still need the help of a professional to price your home properly and create good marketing so you can create demand for buyers relocating outside the area.The average days on market currently sits at 58 days, though the total market time from listing to closing is about 90 to 120 days.From 2016 to 2017, the average home price increased 4.8%. For example, a $238,000 house last year would now be worth $250,000. We anticipate prices to continue to grow over the next several years, so if youâre interested in buying a home, now is a tremendous time to do it.Now is also a good time to sell because there are so many buyers relocating to Charleston in droves. Last month, we generated more than 3,800 inquiries about the homes we have listed for sale. The majority of those came from outside our local area.This relates to the prospect of creating demand that I spoke of above. Once those relocation buyers arrive in our area, what our team does is show those buyers the homes our clients have hired us to sell and get top dollar for. We show each home to several buyers and determine whoâs most interested in it by creating a demand for it so it drives the price up.If you have any questions about these latest trends from our market or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home, donât hesitate to reach out to us. We have many options tailored specifically to your home, your family situation, and what you may have going in in the next chapter of your life. We look forward to speaking with you.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Whether you are buying a home, selling, or have simply lived on a property for a long period of time, itâs a good idea to have an inspection done.Â Recently I was joined by Bill Whitmire from On The Square Home Inspections.Bill and I agree that getting a home inspection is the best way to make sure any property is in proper condition. On The Square performs inspections on structural, electrical, plumbing, and other major components of a home to make sure they are functioning safely and correctly.Â Moreover, home inspections also ensure that the property is a good investment. Realtors will structure your contract in such a way that you are able to view the full report prior to any obligation you have to move forward in the process.These reports are usually 20 to 30 pages in length and include pictures of all the items commented on. The comments within can be good or bad.Â âHome inspections ensure that the property is a good investment.âBut, in either case, the report is designed to give you an overview of the homeâs condition.It also may surprise some to find out that itâs actually recommended for sellers themselves to get the inspection prior to listing their home rather than expecting it to be the responsibility of the buyer.As Bill points out, this will allow sellers to repair components of the home at their leisure. Itâs also a much cheaper option than waiting to have it performed later in the process.This is especially true because sellers will often times not realize that certain smaller issues have damaged their home over time. Accumulated issues can lead to the buyer demanding a decrease in price or other stipulations.Â By having an inspection done ahead of time, the seller is able to make sure the home has a âclean bill of healthâ before proceeding.Â However, Bill and I both personally recommend that you get an inspection on your home whether youâre selling or not. If you have lived in a property for a long time, itâs good to uncover potential repairs before they become an issue.If youâd like to reach out to Bill with any questions or for more information, you can give him a call at (843) 203-9418 or visit his website: OTSInspections.com.And if you have any other questions for me or would like help with your real estate needs, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Itâs also important to know that before they even make their way to those rooms, 75% of buyers have already made up their mind about a home by the time they get out of the car. Observe your home as a potential buyer, and pay close attention to its curb appeal. Note how it feels to walk up the driveway to your house to get an idea of what buyers see. Is there fresh paint? Does it smell nice?âWE ARE THE NO. 1 TEAM IN CHARLESTON.âHereâs the good news: Our market is on fire. Inventory is down a whopping 17%, which means buyers have fewer homes to choose from.

        "content": "Which improvements and renovations can you do to your home to maximize its value?First, keep your renovations moderate. When youâre attempting to do a renovation or an upgrade, ask yourself one question: Will the majority of buyers coming through this home appreciate this renovation, or will I have to do it again if I decide to sell this home at a later date?Second, pay attention to curb appeal. Your curb appeal creates the first impression of your home. In our office, we abide by something we call the three second rule. This means whenever we bring a buyer to a property, they will determine whether they want to seriously consider purchasing that property or not within the first three seconds of pulling in the driveway. Spend some money on landscaping and other areas out front to make your home more inviting for any prospective buyers.âSPEND THE MAJORITY OF YOUR MONEY IN KITCHENS AND BATHROOMS.âThird, have as much hardwood flooring in your home as you can. Buyers love neutral, hardwood floors. If you canât afford to install hardwood floors, make your current flooring as clean and neat as possible.Lastly, spend the majority of your money in kitchens and bathrooms. These are the places in the home where youâll get your best return on investment. You can typically achieve a two-to-one return on investment, meaning youâll get $2 in return on the sale of your home for every $1 you spend.If you have any questions about how to maximize your homeâs value or youâre thinking about buying or selling a house, feel free to reach out to us.

A cat or dog following a buyer around the house might make it difficult for them see all of the features that your home has to offer.        Take a long look at the backyard. Make sure holes are filled in and pet toys are put away. I want a buyer to be able to envision having picnics or their kids playing in the backyard, so making sure itâs manicured is essential.  âASK A FRIEND OR NEIGHBOR TO COME OVER TO SEE IF THEY NOTICE A SMELL.â      Eliminate any pet odors inside the home. I own a dog, so I understand that you might not always pick up on scents. Ask a friend or neighbor to come over to see if they notice a smell. If they do, we can install Glade plug-ins or have the carpets cleaned.        Get rid of any potential pet hair. Our goal is to have multiple showings with multiple buyers, so you need to vacuum before every showing. This makes sure a buyer with allergies doesnât get a bad impression of your home.

Almost 23,000 new homes have come on the market in the last 12 months.        Home sales. How many homes were sold during the same time frame? Some of you may be under the impression that every home that comes on the market is selling. However, thatâs not whatâs happening in reality. Out of those 23,000 listings, only 17,700 sold. That means there are between 5,000 and 6,000 properties that failed to sell.

Thatâs really the only way to guarantee a sale in this market.  âIT IS TAKING AN AVERAGE OF 11 SHOWINGS TO SELL A HOME.â      Median sale price. This is intriguing.

That is exactly what I wanted to discuss today.The entity that sets interest rates, the Federal Reserve, meets on a quarterly basis. In 2016, they increased interest rates in two of their four meetings, including the one in December. They have predicted that this year they will raise rates in three out of the four meetings.Letâs just say they go up 1% from 4.5% to 5.5%, which is what many experts are predicting. Logic says that is still an amazingly low rate, and based on 20- and 30-year trends, it is. However, here is what that increase means for you specifically if youâre trying to buy a home.âTHIS IS THE TIME TO BUY OR SELL BEFORE THEY GO UP.âIf you get approved today for up to $300,000 at 4.5%, just a 1% increase will greatly affect your buying power. With a 5.5% rate, you would only be able to afford a $270,000 home and your mortgage payment will end up about the same as it would have been with a $300,000 home at 4.5%.If youâre trying to get the maximum amount of money possible out of your home sale, now might be a good time to consider putting your home on the market. There are a lot of buyers out there looking right now and the more potential eyeballs looking at your home, the better. On the flip side, if you plan on purchasing a new home in the near future, it is a good idea to take advantage of the money while itâs cheap and before rates go up.If you have any questions for me or if you are looking to buy or sell a home in Charleston, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Many times we see buyers who are ready to own a home but just donât have the money for a down payment. Did you know you can buy a home with very little or even zero money down? Today I wanted to share the top four ways you can do this in the Charleston market.Since interest rates are low, itâs still a fantastic time to buy a house. These are the ways you can take advantage with little or no money down:      VA (veterans) loan: You can buy a home if youâre a veteran for 100% financing.        State Housing: This is a grant for your down payment. Depending on your income and the county youâre buying in, it could be repaid or it could be completely forgivable.  âSTATE HOUSING IS A DOWN PAYMENT GRANT THAT CAN BE TOTALLY FORGIVABLE.â      USDA: This lets you buy a home in whatâs considered a rural area. Many areas around Monkâs Quarter, Goose Creek, and Summerville are still considered rural because of lines that were drawn many, many years ago. This loan also lets you finance 100% of the price.        A gift fund from a relative or family member: This lets you buy a home with a conventional down payment, but you utilize it as a gift from a family member or relative thatâs applied directly to the home purchase.At the end of the day, if you have about $1,200, we can get the seller of the home you want to buy to pay the majority of the closing costs. The $1,200 will allow you to get the property inspected and put down your earnest money so you can buy the home.  With a 620 or better credit score and gainful employment, we may be able to help you get into a home with little or no money down. If you have any questions about qualifying or youâre interested in buying a home in the Charleston area, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. Iâd love to help you out!",

        "title": "Why It's Better to Own a Home than Rent One",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "The first reason is that you build equity with each mortgage payment. Say you take out a mortgage for $200,000. Every time you make a payment, that $200,000 balance continues to drop and your equity increases. The second reason is that you enjoy many tax benefits by being a homeowner. At the end of the year when itâs time to file your taxes, the interest and other things youâve paid can be deducted to release your tax burden.The third reason is that buying a home is actually cheaper than renting in the long term. Say that $200,000 mortgage we talked about has a $1,200 a month payment, and you have a friend who rents a $1,200 a month home. The following year, your mortgage payment will still be $1,200, but your friendâs rent is probably going to go up by $50 or $100 per month, and will continue to increase at that rate every single year. In 30 years, youâll still be paying $1,200 a month, and your friend could be paying up to $4,000 in rent!âBUYING A HOME IS ACTUALLY CHEAPER THAN RENTING.âThe fourth reason to own a home rather than rent one is that you will establish a solid credit history. Every single time you make a mortgage payment on time, your credit score continues to rise, which helps you in other aspects of life like getting better rates on insurance, cell phone payments, and anything else that requires credit.Finally, homeownership is healthy for families and the community. Just think about what happens in a home â the word âhomemakerâ comes to mind. Family comes over for holidays, friends come over for a cookout, neighbors become closer, kids are raised in the home, and relationships get stronger. Itâs truly a wonderful thing.If you have any questions about homeownership or youâre interested in buying a home in the Charleston area, give me a call or send me an email.

So far in 2016, 19,000 homes have been listed on the market and 14,000 of those have sold. A large percentage have sold, but there will always be homes that donât sell for a variety of reasons. Whether itâs because they are priced too high, theyâre unable to accommodate showings, or they simply go too long without an offer, not every home will sell.This year, the median price in Charleston is $239,000, a 5.7% jump from last yearâs median price. Our average sale price is also up by around 4.5% to $320,000.Last year, we had about a five-month supply of inventory at this time. Right now, our supply is at 3.6 months. What we mean by this is that if no more new homes came on the market after now, it would take 3.6 months to sell all the homes on the market at the current rate homes are selling. Anything below five to six months is considered a sellerâs market, so thatâs what we are in right now in Charleston.âBUYERS ARE MORE RELUCTANT TO PAY FULL PRICE.âI do want to caution you that in this fourth quarter, we have seen a growing trend of buyers becoming a little reluctant to pay full price. However, a lot of people are taking their homes off the market right now before the holidays, so you have a window of opportunity to sell high now.If your home is eligible to be shown during the holidays, I recommend you get it on the market right now. You can get ahead of the January rush that will come and get your home under contract while there is less competition and more serious buyers.We are in a tremendous market for home sellers. If you have any questions for us or youâre thinking or buying or selling, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to come out to your home and give you a complimentary home valuation to show you what you could really sell for this holiday season. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "I just wanted to thank our Realtor community for everything that theyâve done this year to help us achieve our goals. With the help of the community, we were able to make all of our transactions a win-win for all parties involved.With the new year approaching, I just wanted to ask you one question: based on what youâve done this year, have you achieved all of the goals that you set for yourself? Were you able to meet or exceed the number of home sales that you set out to sell? Were you able to service the number of families that you wanted to? Did you bring in the income that you desired?My team and I were able to service over 800 families this year, which is absolutely tremendous. We hope to push this number toward 1,000 or 1,100 this coming year.âDID YOU ACHIEVE ALL OF YOUR GOALS FOR THIS YEAR?âIf you have any interest in chatting a little bit more about a potential new real estate career with our team, Iâd love to talk with you.With the support of the Realtor community this year, we were also able to open our Johnnie Dodds office this year, located at 311 Johnnie Dodds Blvd. in Mount Pleasant. This is in addition to our offices on 821 Orleans Rd. in West Ashley, in the Oakbrook/North Charleston area, and in downtown Summerville. We have three or four positions available at each of these offices, and the agents in our office are rewarded with leads, a steady stream of contacts, as well as a business plan that allows them to reach the income level that they desire.If you have any interest in joining our team, simply give me a call or send me an email and Iâll keep your response 100% confidential. I would love to chat with you to see if we can get your real estate career to take off in the coming year. I look forward to hearing from you!",

Hurricane Matthew just rolled through here a couple of days ago, and the majority of the houses along the street Iâm currently standing at have flooded. We decided to come down here and lend a hand to the people in this community because thatâs what we do in Charleston.A lot of people have been asking me what all this stormâs impact means for the real estate market. Overall, this wonât hurt Charlestonâs real estate prices. Just because this is a hurricane-prone area doesnât mean that the market suffers after one hits.âGET IN TOUCH WITH US IF YOUâRE INTERESTED IN ASSISTING THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED.âIf youâre interested in assisting us with rebuilding this neighborhood, you can get in touch with us on Twitter at @rebuildparkhill or visit our website weâll soon be launching called rebuildparkhill.com.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Thereâs a really simple and effective trick for paying off your 30-year mortgage in just 22 years that I wanted to share with you. In fact, there are two ways.Say itâs tax refund time or Christmas, and youâve come across a little extra money. **Did you know that if you make a 13th mortgage payment each year, youâll knock eight years off of the life of your 30-year mortgage? **The second strategy is especially helpful for those who get paid on a bi-weekly basis. Instead of making a monthly mortgage payment, talk to your mortgage company about setting up bi-weekly payments on your mortgage. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, making half of your mortgage payment every two weeks rather than a full payment every month equates to making 26 half payments over the course of the year. Of course, that equates to 13 full payments a year instead of 12, which you would get by making one full payment per month.âBOTH OPTIONS WILL SAVE YOU THOUSANDS IN INTEREST!âJust like in the first scenario, you would knock eight years off of your 30-year mortgage. Think of the savings in interest!If you have any more questions about this topic or youâre thinking about buying or selling a home, give me a call or send me an email. Iâd love to hear from you!",

The three contributing factors to this are strong job growth, low vacancy rates, and high affordability.For us in Charleston, this means a few things. For one, more people are moving to the area. Thatâs obvious. We have 43 newcomers each day on average. Jobs will also continue to grow, as the Charleston region is ranked in the top-10 in the U.S. for job seekers.âOUR MEDIAN SALE PRICE HAS RISEN BY 11.4%!âIf you own a Charleston home, its value has likely risen. The median sales price is 11.4% higher right now than it was at the same time last year.If youâre interested in finding out what your home is worth or want to see what is out there for purchase, check out the links above.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Are you sitting on the fence trying to figure out whether now is the time to sell your Charleston home? I have four compelling reasons why you should:      Low inventory, high demand. Not only do we have the people living in Charleston looking to purchase a home, but 70% of the people inquiring on our websites right now are folks living outside the area intending to move here soon. A lot of people want to be a part of our long-kept secret!        An influx of millennials purchasing. We refer to this as âpent-up demand.â These are people who are now old enough to purchase a home after living with their parents or renting for longer than they wanted due to the previous recession. Their collective need to buy homes has caused the market to continue to boom.  âA lot of people want to be a part of our long-kept secret!â      Home values are up. Did you know that weâre in a 9% higher price point than we were a year ago? If you couldnât previously sell your home, you may now be able to.        Interest rates are at an all-time low. If interest rates go up 1%, that cuts a buyerâs purchasing power by 10%. This means that if you own a home thatâs worth $300,000 and interest rates rise by 1%, a potential buyer for that house that couldâve gotten approved at $300,000 can now only get approved for $270,000.  If youâre interested in finding out exactly what your home will sell for for in todayâs market, click on the links above or reply to this email specifically. If all else fails, just give me a call. I look forward to talking to you soon.",

        "content": "Should you have an open house or not? We are huge fans of open houses. The open house is an integral part of our marketing system in order to help you get top dollar for your home. Having an open house creates energy and gives buyers the opportunity to see your home.Think about it: letâs say someone is shopping online for a three-bedroom, two-bath home with a two-car garage, but you only have a one-car garage. The online buyer wouldnât see your home. Open houses only increase your chances for selling your home at top dollar. Three reasons:  People may miss your home if it doesnât have every detail you think you want. Again, if theyâre thinking they want a two-car garage, they may change their mind when they see your house in person.âGive buyers a chance to see your home in person.â      Consider general foot traffic. Someone who walks into your open house is probably someone who didnât know about your home previously.        **More buyers coming in increases the overall interest in your home. **  If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Today Iâm happy to be joined by Tommy Welch of 1st Class Painting &amp; Restoration to talk about the top three things you can do to get the most value for your home.Itâs a great question, Tommy said, and provided a contractorâs perspective. First and foremost, (and yes, Tommy says heâs a bit biased) youâve got to make sure your paint is solid and neutral. He loves a good hot pink or your daughterâs bright blue bathroom, but not when youâre selling your home. Itâs not just important to be neutral, itâs important that the quality of the work is good, so hire a professional.Secondly, Tommy said, know that buyers go straight to kitchens and bathrooms when they view a house. You want the kitchen to be functional, clean, and open. If your flooring is up to date, youâre probably ahead of the curve. Take a few minutes and take a non-biased look at your kitchen and bathrooms to look for what stands out as needing to be fixed or updated.âThese are game-changers when it comes to listing your house.âLastly, donât forget the outdoors. We live here in Charleston so we can spend 365 days a year outside, so spruce up your yard. Keep the lawn cut, get rid of overgrowth, and make sure fences and decks are properly sealed, clean, and safe. You want people viewing your home to walk outside and think âWow! I can hang out here!âAll these things arenât just cost-effective, theyâre game-changers when it comes to listing your house and making a move. Tommy would love to come out and give you a totally free estimate on any of these things. You can call him at 843-324-6006 or you can email him at Tommy@1stClassCharleston.com.",

        "content": "Today, Iâm discussing the advantages and disadvantages of new construction and resale properties when buying in Charleston. Whenever we sit down with buyers for initial consultations, they often know whether they want an older or newer home.If youâre interested in an older home, typically itâll be in a mature neighborhood with developed trees and larger yard sizes on average. Oftentimes, youâll notice smaller kitchens and bathrooms compared to new construction developments.âYou have the opportunity to choose your add-ons with new construction properties.âNew construction includes full warranties, but sometimes the yard sizes are smaller and the neighborhoods arenât fully matured. The surrounding community might still be in construction mode, even though your home has already been built. You have the opportunity to personally choose your add-ons, such as flooring, colors, and other features. Additionally, you have built-in equity to a recently built home; the value increased during construction, even though youâre not making payments.If youâre thinking about buying or selling a home in the surrounding area, reach out by phone or email.
