It’s a property that is exclusive to members and can be seen by water. If you’re thinking it’s downtown, Kiawah, or Daniel Island, you couldn’t be more wrong—we’ll be looking at Yeamans Hall Country Club.This members-only golf course runs along a branch of the Cooper River known as Goose Creek, which is a brackish waterway that’s home to a ton of wildlife and serves as a great spot for fishing. Animals ranging from alligators and dolphins to catfish can be seen here. The golf course was built on a plantation that was originally owned by Lady Margaret and Sir John Yeamans in the 1700s.In 1924, the owners transformed the plantation into an unbelievable golf course. The club was designed to attract wealthy financiers from the north, offering two to 300 home sites with stunning colonial architecture. The beautiful Southern style architecture became so popular, you had to be invited to become a member.If you get a chance, check out Yeamans Hall Country Club.

        "category": "",
        "content": "There are three options to choose from if the appraisal came in low.You’re under contract, but there’s an issue—the appraisal came in lower than the contract price. In this situation, what do you do? There are some options you can take if this happens to you, and today I’m sharing them with you.So the first option is: You are going to talk to the other parties, and find out if you can buy the home for the lower appraised value. All buyers want to buy homes for less money. This is a good opportunity to get in there and get the home for a reduced price.If the seller refuses, the second thing you can do is negotiate with the seller. You’re at the low end, and they’re at the high end; try to meet somewhere in the middle. Keep in mind that anything over and above the appraised price is going to require you to bring cash to closing. So if you are around $2,000 off the appraisal, you would have to bring $2,000 to closing.“This is a good opportunity to get the home for a reduced price.”The third item is that you can be released from the contract if you’re not comfortable, and you cannot reach a happy medium ground with the seller about a new price. You are in no way responsible for moving forward if there is an appraisal issue, and you don’t feel comfortable with the new price terms.If you have any questions about appraisals or anything real estate related, please reach out to me and my team. We’d love to help.",

One of my favorite things about Old Village is the architecture. At 0:15 in the video, you can see that there are newly designed homes right next to some old brick ranches. There’s a gorgeous new custom house right next to this brick ranch that was just purchased for $850,000, and is currently being remodeled. One of the coolest parts of Old Village is the Pit Street Bridge. It has beautiful views of Charleston Harbor, and people love to take walks and enjoy this great space. Downtown Old Village is also home to the renowned Post House restaurant, which has amazing food.Lastly, Old Village has Alhambra Hall, where great events are held. It’s right across the street from Alhambra Park, where I used to bring my kids to play when they were little. This is a gorgeous area.

Here are four things you’ll want to investigate:1. What caused the issue? Is it water intrusion? Are there structural issues? Just figure out what’s going on. We have properties all throughout Charleston that have been through this. It just means there’s some issue with the exterior, usually where there’s been water intrusion or a structural issue. If that’s the situation, just learn more.2. Is there ongoing litigation? Is there a current lawsuit? Or maybe everything is resolved. Just look into it to find out more.3.

Today we’re going over the Q1 numbers to give you an idea of where we are in Q2 right now. In the first quarter of the year, we had fewer new listings, a strong increase in the average sale price, and more. Here are the numbers you need to know:  New listings dropped from 2,163 in 2021 to 1,942 in 2022.   Closed sales were down from 1,908 to 1,639.   The average sale price at the end of Q1 2021 was $646,000. This year, that number has jumped to $773,000 for single-family detached homes in Charleston County.“This continues to be a fantastic market for home sellers.”Fewer homes for sale and fewer sales usually mean an increase in the average sale price, which is exactly what we saw. Days on market is a measure of how long it takes the average home to sell. It’s essentially halved from 40 to 22 days in the last year. Many home sellers who have properties in great condition are seeing their homes sell for top dollar within just a few days.This continues to be a fantastic market for home sellers. There’s never been a better time to list. Buying is a bit more difficult, but working with the right agent who knows what you need to make a strong offer is essential. If you have any questions about buying, selling, or want to know the specific numbers for your subsection of Charleston County, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email.

Homes have been selling quickly and often over list price. The best time to list in 2022 is probably right now since you’ll see a high number of showings and offers.However, you can’t just throw your house on the market and sell for top dollar without any preparation. Preparing your home is still key to getting it sold for the highest price possible. There’s an emotional component to home buying as well, and when the weather gets nice in the spring, it helps attract buyers from an emotional perspective.If you have any questions about listing your home this spring, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email.

I’m sharing the answer to that question today.Many of our buyers are concerned about making a purchase one day only to watch prices finally drop the next. I have a little good news to share in that respect: I don’t think we’re quite at the peak of the market yet, but we will be before long.If you do find yourself buying at the top of the market, I have a story to share that shows why that might not be as big of a deal as you think it is. After the market crashed, I was working with a homebuyer who bought in 2007 and needed to sell in 2009. At that point, he could only sell that home for a $30,000 loss.“Real estate is a great long-term investment in any market.”He didn’t want to take the loss, so he decided to rent the property out instead. He rented it out for just enough to cover his monthly mortgage payment, and he created more cash flow over the years. It took him 11 years, but he finally called me and was ready to sell while the market was up. He bought at the peak but ended up selling for a new peak. He broke even at first, then started to bring in positive cash flow. Finally, he sold the property for a profit just last year.It may seem like a long time to wait to realize profits, but real estate is a long-term investment at heart. There are strategies to keep you from taking a loss even if you’re at the top of the market.If you have any questions for me about buying, selling, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email.

The market “bubble” won’t burst in 2022. This is a topic I’m asked about constantly. We are driven by inventory and demand. There are still very few homes for sale and plenty of buyers actively looking for properties in this location. This creates a seller’s market and no likelihood for a bubble burst this year.“Home prices may go up another 10% this year alone.”2. Housing prices are going to increase. This is another function of a strong seller’s market. Until the inventory situation corrects, prices are only going to go up. They may go up another 10% this year alone.3. Increased interest in second homes and investment properties. As people are traveling overseas less, we’re seeing beach homes really take off here in Charleston. That short-term rental market will continue to increase, and investors are out buying properties in droves because of the expected appreciation.Those are my three predictions for the Charleston real estate market in 2022.

In other recent news, about 7,000 homes were sold by Zillow to an investor for $2.8 billion. This is a huge move and has led many to wonder if something is happening in the real estate market that Zillow is trying to get ahead of.In my opinion, there is certainly a transition going on in the market when it comes to iBuyers. These are investors that come in and buy homes, often for less than fair market value. The real estate economy is strong right now, and sellers can receive top dollar by listing traditionally with a Realtor instead of selling to an iBuyer. That creates an issue for these platforms. In addition, many local real estate companies like ourselves offer both a traditional listing program and iBuyer options.If you have any questions about what’s going on in the market or how we can help you accomplish your real estate goals, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email.

        "content": "Here are five tips for winning as a buyer in a seller’s market.In a competitive market like this one, multiple-offer situations are common. To win as a buyer, here are five things you’ll need to do:1. Get pre-approved. If you’re getting a loan, make sure you contact a loan officer before you set foot in a house. Properties are going quickly, so you need that pre-approval in order to make an offer right away when a home gets listed.2. Cash is king. If you have the cash resources available, it’s smart to make an offer. If you don’t have cash, several companies will charge a 1% or 2% fee to buy a property in cash on your behalf, then they’ll sell it back to you for the fee.3. Appraisal. If you’re a conservative buyer, you may not want to waive the appraisal. However, think about being willing to pay over a low appraised value.“If you have the cash resources available, it’s smart to make an offer.”4. Inspection. You can get the home inspected, but you can also tell the seller you don’t want repairs made. I recommend doing this so you can make sure nothing is seriously wrong and become a stronger buyer in their eyes.5. Use an escalation clause. If you’re in a competitive situation, you can write into the contract that you’re willing to pay a certain amount over any other competing offer up until a certain amount. This gives you another leg up on the competition.If you have any questions about buying in a seller’s market or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email.

        "content": "Here’s why I decided to invest in beachfront real estate early on.A lot of you know me as a Realtor, but I’m also a real estate investor. I started my investment journey by buying a two-bedroom condo in Wild Dunes. Starting your investment journey on the beach is great because it allows you the opportunity to do short-term vacation rentals. They certainly have their benefits but have some drawbacks too. Let’s start with the positives. These short-term rentals bring much more income on a nightly basis. You also have the opportunity to enjoy the property with your family when you want. That was really important to me in my decision to invest.“Short-term vacation rentals make much more on a per-night basis.”At the same time, there are some disadvantages. It does take considerably more time in terms of cleaning and maintaining the property on a nightly basis, and you do have to attend to issues when they arise. One way to avoid this is by hiring a great property management company. They charge anywhere from 18% to 40% but take care of everything that comes with maintaining the property and its value. If you have any questions for me about investing in real estate on a short-term or long-term basis, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email.

It can be challenging to find the right home with such few options. However, our present market has low interest rates, which means buyers can buy more house for the money.

Historically low inventory. For the first time in my 13-year career, our local MLS shows just under 4,000 homes for sale. In a typical, steady market we usually have about 5,000 houses for sale. This low inventory has had a large impact on our real estate market.2. Historically low interest rates. Buyers currently have a wonderful opportunity to buy more house for their money, and homeowners can get a great rate when refinancing. 3. Buyers are looking for larger homes. Now, buyers are searching for homes that are larger, offer more private backyards, and home office space. Some are even looking for space for two people to work from home or a schoolroom. If you have any questions about what’s impacting our local market or buying or selling a house, please contact us via phone or email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are a few tips and tricks to consider if you’re thinking of remodeling.Should you remodel your home or not?To answer that question, I’ll show you three properties in the video above that are in various stages of the remodeling process. This will give you an idea of what buyers are looking for and what you should focus on. Property No. 1 (0:30) is in definite need of a facelift. It’s a 2-bedroom, 1-bath, 700-square-foot home in downtown Charleston. The good news is, this remodel will be relatively inexpensive. We plan on scraping the popcorn ceilings, repainting the walls with a white or light gray color, replacing the countertops with quartz surfacing, installing new appliances, and consolidating the flooring type to make the inside look bigger. This can all be done for about $10,000, and we’ll be able to increase the home’s value by about $15,000 when all is said and done.“The best place to start remodeling is the kitchen.”Property No. 2 (1:18) highlights another useful remodeling strategy: creating a shell out of your property. As you can see, the seller for this listing, also located in downtown Charleston, decided to gut the entire home. Everything’s been ripped out down to the studs, and we’re ready for a massive renovation. After this is done, you can sell the home and let the new owner take over the renovation. Property No. 3 (1:54), a 2-bedroom townhome on James Island, just underwent a full kitchen renovation. The best place to start remodeling is the kitchen, and in this case, we installed quartz countertops, repainted the cabinets white, and added new pulls. We also kept the white appliances because we like the light, bright look. For the rest of the home, we replaced the laminate flooring in the sunroom and added luxury vinyl plank upstairs. Most importantly, we made sure the rest of the home was white just like the kitchen. There is contrast in some places, but the entire interior retains the same light, bright aesthetic. We’ve already scheduled four showings for this property, and it’s officially received an offer. The bottom line is, remodeling is definitely worth it if it’s done right. If you have questions about this topic or would like to talk specifically about your home’s renovation potential, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m here to help.",

The pandemic has changed everything in our world, and real estate is no exception. Today I’m discussing the top five effects the health crisis has had on our Charleston real estate market:1. Virtual showings. If you want to see homes, you’ll be on your phone or computer with your real estate agent doing a Facetime tour of the house. This is currently the most widespread change in the real estate process.“Buyers and sellers might not be present at closings anymore.”2. Sanitary showings. Agents are wearing masks and gloves and removing their shoes when it’s necessary to enter a home.3. Power of attorney closings. Buyers and sellers might not be present at closings anymore. At the closing, the attorney will typically sign for you. Your new keys may be mailed to you, or you’ll pick them up at a safe location.4. Limited inventory. Many people aren’t listing their houses right now because they don’t want people in their homes due to coronavirus. 5. Out of town buyers. We have many buyers coming into our area from larger cities such as New York, Jersey City, Boston, Charlotte, and even Houston. Charleston is a medium-sized city and therefore less densely populated. If you have any questions about buying a house or real estate in general, call or email us. We would love to help you.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "To list, or not to list? Here’s the market data you need to know.The coronavirus pandemic is still out there, but South Carolina is slowly starting to reopen, so is now a good time to list your property? Well, the numbers absolutely indicate yes, now’s a great time to list! In Charleston County, listings for April are down by 31% year over year, and the number of closed sales is down by 13%; this trend, though not ideal, is sustainable because the drop in supply does outpace the decrease in closings. However, when looking at the year-to-date data and comparing it to the first four months of 2019, we’re down 16% in listings but up 3% in closings. All of this means that our inventory has been drastically reduced, so sellers are still able to leverage the lack of options available for active buyers (yes, there are still plenty of buyers out there), and get close to their list price. That, of course, applies only to properly priced properties that are in good condition. For Isle of Palms, new listings were down 33% and closings dipped by 19%, but again the decrease in supply outpaces the decrease in demand. On the other hand, the numbers for Daniel Island reveal quite a different story; new listings there are down 14%, but closings are up by 22%—demand is increasing amidst a decrease in supply, which makes for an even stronger market.“Our inventory has been drastically reduced.”On the Upper Peninsula, listings are actually up 3% from last year, but inventory is down 27%, making the downtown Charleston market a little more tilted in favor of buyers. So, in short, South Carolina’s submarkets haven’t been affected equally; some persist as strong seller’s markets, and others may require sellers to revise their strategy around a market that’s begun favoring buyers. That’s why I encourage you to reach out by phone or email so we can discuss your specific neighborhood and situation if you’re interested in selling. Generally speaking, the data supports a decision to list now, but I’m always happy to have a more in-depth discussion with you. Tell me what area of the low country you’re in and I’d love to send you the most up-to-date market data for you! In the meantime, stay safe and have a great week!",

Looking at the history of home sales, we’ve found that homes are still consistently selling within 5% of their listing price. Sellers are negotiating a little bit, but not all that much, given the situation.With everyone self-quarantining, home showings have decreased across the nation. However, there is some good news: the buyers who are looking at homes virtually or in-person are very serious, motivated buyers.“Thank you to all the doctors and nurses out there on the frontlines who are fighting to keep us all safe and healthy.”Homes that are under contract tend to be in lower price ranges. Inventory is still very low in Charleston, which is good, but higher-end homes aren’t selling as well—this might change once people can start going out and about once the pandemic has settled.As a final note, we just wanted to give a huge thank-you to all the doctors and nurses out there on the frontlines who are fighting to keep us all safe and healthy.

        "title": "The Different Types of Real Estate Investing",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "There are multiple kinds of real estate investing. Today we’ll discuss how three types can benefit you.Let’s first cover short-term rentals. In our area, there are only certain places where you can buy property and do a short-term rental, meaning a property that can be rented for 30 days or fewer. The beaches allow short-term rentals, as well as some areas downtown. You can also do a short-term rental on a property you live in, such as for a carriage house on the lot or a bedroom in the house. Short-term rentals for vacationers are a great form of real estate investment. Bear in mind, though, if you manage the property yourself, it’ll take a time commitment of two to three hours per week, or longer if there are items to repair.“Long-term rentals are an excellent way to gain some equity and financial stability over the long term.”On the other hand, long-term rentals are more like buy-and-hold investments where you buy a property, hold on to it for several years, and hope that you have some great tenants for that period. Unfortunately, in my experience, it’s hard to get people to stay on for longer than a one-year lease, which involves more work. But if you can get a great property and a tenant willing to stay for a couple years, it’s an excellent way to gain some equity and financial stability over the long term.The next investment type is flipping. If you’re looking to get into the flipping market, the key is to find the right house at the right time so you can buy it, do minimal improvements, and profit when you sell it again. Though flipping is the most popular type of investment, it’s not always easy to do in our market because it’s pretty solid; properties aren’t selling for much more than their list prices. It’ll be to your advantage if you can find a unique property in our market to flip.If you haven’t already, I highly encourage you to read the book “Rich Dad Poor Dad”  by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It’ll teach you all you need to know about buying assets, not liabilities, and provide you tips on making wise investment decisions in general.For any further questions you have about real estate investing, please reach out to the Healthy Realty team.

February is already proving to be a busy real estate month this year. The spring real estate market is upon us a little earlier than usual. Homes in excellent condition that are priced well are selling quickly, sometimes with multiple offers. That means it’s a great time to consider selling your house in this early spring market. We would love to speak with you about pricing and staging your home.

The properties that have been taken care of, priced correctly, and staged are selling quickly in this market.“The spring real estate market is upon us a little earlier than usual.”If you’re a buyer right now, this affects you as well. Make sure to get pre-approved for a loan or have proof of funds. Also, when looking at homes, it helps to narrow your search down to a few neighborhoods where you want to be. That way you can watch that specific area, and when you see a house you love, you can go see it immediately and be ready to make a quick offer.

        "content": "We’re seeing a bit of a slowdown in our market as 2019 nears its end.What’s the latest news from our Charleston market as we near the end of 2019?Charleston’s market has been strong throughout the year, but we’re seeing signs of a slowdown. However, there are still many detached homes going under contract. As of the recording of this video, there are 4,012 active listings and 2,319 listings under contract. In other words, 36% of all listings are under contract. In the condo market, things are a bit slower: There are 1,097 active listings and 419 listings under contract (or 27% of all listings). Basically, homes are selling very quickly in the lower end of the market. Similarly, homes in the lower end of our rental market are being rented out quicker. To clarify, anything below $300,000 is what we generally consider to be the “lower end.” The “higher end,” meanwhile, is anything above $500,000, and that’s where homes are selling slower. However, this can vary depending on your area. If your home is $500,000 and it’s the least expensive in your area, it will probably sell quickly. “Homes are selling very quickly in the lower end of the market.”Between now and the end of 2019, there are plenty of excellent buys you can make. Specifically, I’m advising buyers to look at new construction. If a new home builder has a lot of inventory they need to sell and get off their books before 2020, odds are you’ll be able to negotiate a good deal for those homes. All-cash deals close quickly, but I know plenty of loan officers who can help you close before the end of the year if you buy soon. If you have any more questions about our Charleston market or you’re thinking of selling your home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

We’re going to explore that today.If you’re buying a home that you know you’ll only have for two to three years, you need to consult our “buyer funnel” which is pictured at 1:10 in the video above. For a short-term buyer, you’re going to want to zero in on a home that appeals to the most buyers possible.The No. 1 resale factor is a one-story home. The least desirable resale factor is a split-level home.Another thing to look at is the price of the home. Homes that are less expensive, or the least expensive in a particular neighborhood, are going to appeal to the most number of buyers as well. The most expensive home certainly won’t.“Older homes are appealing here in Charleston, just not to short-term buyers.”The next thing we’re going to look at is upgrades. Most buyers will want a completely upgraded home, while the fewest number of buyers want homes with only a few upgrades. Finally, homes that are new construction or newer always tend to resell better. Older homes are appealing to some, especially here in Charleston, but they’re not as appealing to short-term buyers.If you want to make your home re-sale proof, you want to buy something that is one-story, inexpensive, completely upgraded, and new. That will get you the most buyers when it comes time to sell.If you have any other questions for me about buying a short-term home or about anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "There are plenty of great educational opportunities here in Charleston.Since the 2019 school year is underway, I thought I’d take a moment to review all the great schooling options for families in our area. Charleston is a wonderful place to educate your children. There are plenty of opportunities for different types of education—we have schools that focus on academics, schools that focus on art, schools that focus on sports, etc. I used to be a Charleston County teacher in both the public and private sector, so take it from me when I say we have a wide variety of great schools that allow our students to learn in the best way for them. For example, we have schools designed for primary and older elementary children which allow them to be in small groups that split into three separate grades. Three of my younger children attend Daniel Island School, which is a K-8 school, and one of the benefits of attending there is that the 8th graders can read to the kindergarteners.“Charleston is a wonderful place to educate your children.”Academic Magnet High School and the Charleston School of the Arts are two more prestigious schools you can consider sending your kids to. Academic Magnet High School is consistently rated as one of the top high schools in the nation, while the Charleston School of the Arts offers plenty of opportunities for kids with artistic talent. My oldest son is a student at Oceanside Collegiate Academy, which allows him to focus on a single sport and earn college credit at the same time. Not everyone there is a student-athlete, but this is a great opportunity for student-athletes to gain college credit.There are opportunities for online education as well. One year, my children mixed home-schooling with online correspondence and were still able to focus on sports. As a mom and a teacher, I’ve dealt with many different types of schooling, and one type of education doesn’t apply to all students. You have to find out what works for your particular student. In my family, we change schools from year to year to make sure my kids have the right fit. This is one of my favorite topics, and I know that trying to find the right school for your children as you move to a new area is hard, so if you have any more questions about all the schooling options here in Charleston, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to speak with you.",

        "content": "What are the latest trends in our Charleston market? I’ll tell you in today’s update.The market environment here in Charleston has been pretty diverse. Given the fact that buyer affordability is a major issue, conditions still heavily favor sellers in our lower price ranges, meaning homes priced below $300,000 are going fast. Whether you’re a buyer or seller, it’s important to pay close attention to the market and price point the home is in. Homes on the lower end of the pricing spectrum are receiving multiple offers, but it’s another story for those in the middle and upper price ranges. There, the market leans toward buyers. Median-range homes in areas like James Island, Mount Pleasant, Isle of Palms, Johns Island haven’t been seeing a lot of buyer activity, and that segment of the market has remained static.At the higher end, it’s taking even longer for homes to sell, and sellers in this price point are having to adapt by coming off their desired price a bit. There are exceptions: Homes with beautiful remodeling work or that are in pristine condition can still command a high price across all price points.“Whether you’re a buyer or seller, it’s important to pay close attention to the market and price point the home in.”To recap everything, the lower end of the Charleston market is a seller’s market, while the higher end is in favor of buyers. If you have any specific questions about the price ranges for your local area or neighborhood or about real estate in general, please contact me and my team.

We learned so much and had many wonderful experiences.We visited villages around Tola, Nicaragua and stayed at the Surf Sanctuary in Playa Santana. Our goals on this trip were to surf and serve: Monday through Friday, we would wake up at 5 a.m. and go to local beaches to surf, and then after breakfast, we would head to five different villages to give the community free medical care, including treatment from medical doctors, occupational therapists, a pharmacist, and a chiropractor. We ran the clinics from about 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and then returned to our hotel, totally exhausted. My husband is a physician, so he and three other doctors provided most of the medical care, along with several nurses, a pharmacist, and the physical therapy team. There were also several laypeople, like myself, other doctors’ spouses, and our children, but there were plenty of jobs for those without medical training.“No matter your age or abilities, these trips provide an opportunity to give to those in need if you have a heart willing to serve.”We registered patients checking into the clinic, worked in the pharmacy, fitted patients with glasses, and entertained the kids who were being seen as patients. It was an amazing experience! This was my third medical mission trip, my husband’s (John) sixth, my two sons’ second (J.T., 17 and Will,13), and my daughter’s (Kaitlin, 11) first. Whether you are a medical provider or not, One World Health and Christian Surfers offer great opportunities like this throughout the year. No matter your age or abilities, these trips provide an opportunity to give to those in need if you have a heart willing to serve.To see some of the adventures we had, the projects we took part in, and the people we met and helped, see the video above.If you have any questions for us about these mission trips or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

Rent a few beach chairs and an umbrella and sit on the sand. “The days may be hot, but they’re always cooler if you can take a dip in the ocean.”3. Play tennis. The Wild Dunes has world-class tennis courts that have been nationally ranked by Tennis Magazine. Next to the tennis courts, you can also rent bikes, and there are plenty of scenic trails around the island that the whole family can enjoy. 2. Golf. There are two renowned courses you can pick from: the Harbor course and the Links course. After you’re done, you can head over to the deli and grab a sandwich!1. Visit the amphitheater.

Insurance is also sometimes considered a closing cost, but is also sometimes counted as a prepaid expense.In South Carolina, buyers are generally expected to pay one year’s worth of home insurance and flood insurance upon closing.

Most come in the form of closing costs.When you buy or sell a home, there are closing costs involved. I’m here today to talk a little bit more about them, specifically where home sellers are concerned.One of the largest costs involved for a seller is hiring a real estate agent, so we always try to prove our value. We know that commissions are earned by the marketing that we do to sell your home. As a homeowner, you’re going to pay a listing Realtor to market your property and bring you a buyer, and you’ll often pay a fee to the buyer’s agent out of the total commission. They’re negotiable in our area, and different agents charge different commissions.Next, you’ll also have to take care of any attorney fees. In South Carolina, you’re required to close with a real estate attorney. These fees range anywhere from $350 to $600 per transaction.You’ll also be paying taxes on the deed to the great state of South Carolina. Your Realtor can do the math for you to find out what the cost is for your specific property.“In South Carolina, you’re required to close with a real estate attorney.”Another item that’s often paid for by the seller is the CL100, or wood infestation report. This is a specific inspection that will check the home for termites, high moisture levels, and other wood-destroying organisms. This will set you back anywhere from $75 to $130. Finally, you’ll have to pay for property taxes for the time you’ve owned the home.If you have any questions about what the costs would look like for you if you sold your home in this current market, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "What’s the key to buying or selling a vacant home? Allow us to share a few key points.If you’re looking to buy or sell a vacant property, there are a few things you must do to succeed. Let’s start with the steps sellers should take.First and foremost: paint. This advice holds true for most home sales, but it’s especially crucial when you’re selling a vacant home. Unless your home is staged, buyers won’t have anything to look at but bare walls, so make sure that they are fresh, clean, and neutral. The next step anyone selling a vacant home should take is to spruce up their landscaping. Going the extra mile with your yard is fine if you choose to do so, but, really, all you need is to do is add fresh pine straw (or mulch), place a potted plant by your entryway, and pressure wash the exterior of your home. “If no one has been taking care of the home while it’s been empty, deferred maintenance may become an issue.”If you want to make your vacant home look anything but, then consider taking the third step on this list, which is to stage your home. Professional staging can make your empty house feel like any buyer’s next home. Now, let’s move on to the things buyers should look for when purchasing a vacant home.The No. 1 factor homebuyers should examine in a vacant home is its condition. If no one has been taking care of the home while it’s been empty, deferred maintenance may become an issue. To avoid undue stress and expenses down the line, check to make sure the furnace filters have been changed, that there’s no wood rot on the exterior, and that, in general, the home is safe and structurally sound. To ensure that this is the case, you’ll need to hire a home inspector. Home inspectors will be able to identify any and all issues that might otherwise go unnoticed. This will allow you to make an informed decision as you consider whether to purchase the home. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

Staying on top of the latest design trends can make a big difference in your home’s value, which is why, today, we’re going to offer a breakdown of what’s “in” in 2019. There are three main areas you need to focus on if you want your home to be on trend right now:1. The color of your kitchen cabinets. Dark cabinets may be beautiful, but they just aren’t trendy. If your cabinets happen to be sporting a heavy hue, you may want to hire a professional painter before you sell. Having your cabinets repainted to white or gray will have a huge impact on how buyers see your home.“Staying on top of the latest design trends can make a big difference in your home’s value.”2. The color of your walls. White, cream, light blue, and light gray are all popular color choices right now. According to Zillow, homes with “on-trend” wall colors sell for $1,809 more on average. 3. The shiplap effect. “Shiplap” is a particular type of wooden board commonly used in coastal design trends. If you’re a fan of Chip and Joanna Gaines, you’ve almost certainly seen them implement this feature into homes they’ve worked on.

They’ll also introduce a new email-forwarding service where we can notify clients of listings they’d be interested in.Spencer explained that we, as Zillow Premier Agents, have invested digitally in the future. It’s a badge that demonstrates we’re forward thinking, we understand and utilize technology, and we seek to meet our clients’ needs. Being Zillow Premier Agents is one way we can set ourselves apart from our contemporaries. In his podcast, Spencer has had the chance to interview leaders of other high-profile companies.

        "content": "There’s a fantastic website out there for medical professionals and their spouses that will make the process of buying a home much easier. Here’s where you can find it.Usually I talk about the real estate market, but today I have a special guest to talk about something a little different. Joining me is my husband, Dr. John Ramey, and we’re going to talk about our website, drmoves.com, and how it can help medical professionals around the country and in our community. After John graduated from medical school, we settled here in Charleston and started Healthy Realty, a company that focuses on helping medical professionals find real estate. Over the years, we found that medical professionals are different than the average consumer when it comes to buying houses. They need houses close to hospitals, they tend to have a lot of debt, and have a lot of other special needs that the average buyer doesn’t.Drmoves.com is the manifestation of our dream to help other families with medical professionals with their real estate needs. The website has several different search functions, including one that helps medical professionals find real estate agents who are experts in dealing with clients like them. We find great Realtors across the country and get them on our site. It’s a completely free service that we want to provide to the medical community.Another big thing that the website does is help medical professionals find doctor loans. These loans can give you up to 100% financing so that you can buy a home without having your debt from medical school factored in. Another great thing about doctor loans is that they don’t require you to pay mortgage insurance, which saves you even more money. Most young doctors don’t have a lot saved up, so this type of loan provides them an opportunity to buy a home. The doctor loan is something our family has used in the past and it has helped us immensely.“These are just a few of the things you can find on drmoves.com.”A new feature on drmoves.com is a service where we can help doctors find additional income. There are a lot of opportunities out there for doctors to make additional income, and we’ve compiled a list of these on the website. They include doctor surveys, medical review companies, and chances to serve as medical experts for attorneys in malpractice cases, just to name a few.These are just a few of the things that you can find on drmoves.com. If you have any questions about the website or if you’re a medical professional yourself and just need some advice from people who have been through it all before, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email today. We will be back with part two of this discussion soon, where we’ll show you even more features of this wonderful site. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

Let’s take a look at how our area’s real estate market is doing.Charleston County as a whole has seen average sale prices rise to $514,000. I consider $500,000+ as a luxury market, so we can often see our average pricing in that luxury range. In this same county, a home’s average number of days on the market is 60 days. When you look at Daniel Island, a comparable high-end market, the average price is $941,000 with the average days on market at 78. Downtown sees an average price of $3 million with 90 days on market.“We may see the market begin to slow”If we look at more affordable areas, such as Johns Island, the average price is $375,000 with 54 days on market. West Ashley has an average price of $348,000 with 37 days on market.We’ve seen a hike in interest rates recently, and combined with sales prices creeping up, we may see the market begin to slow. As a buyer, this means you’ll have more opportunities. On top of this, homes are being sold at 4% below list price on average. Sellers are able to stick somewhat close to original pricing, but it’s still important to price wisely according to the surrounding market.If you need guidance in buying or selling a home, have questions, or would like some more information, feel free to contact me.

        "content": "The three key aspects you need to focus on in order to get your listing sold are marketing, condition, and price.There are three key aspects of the home selling process you must focus on in order to sell your home quickly and for top dollar. The first is marketing. You should hire a real estate professional who’s media-savvy, does a lot of internet advertising, follows up with buyers who look at your home, and is aggressive in making your property known. This part of the process is in their control, so make sure you hire someone reputable. The second part is 100% in your control, and that’s the home’s condition. I recently listed a home that was priced higher than fair market value but still secured an offer quickly because it was in excellent condition. This is the most important thing you’re in control of, so make sure your landscaping looks nice and your home is painted and decluttered.“Your home’s condition is the most important thing you’re in control of.”The third aspect is price. A lot of people assume that Realtors are in charge of pricing the home, but that’s not true. In reality, the homeowner is. When it comes to pricing, you have three options. First, you can price it over fair market value and hope the right buyer comes along. Second, you can list it at fair market value and find a few people in your price range who are interested. Third, you can price it below fair market value. Oftentimes, this can create a multiple offer situation, so that’s something to consider. Your Realtor will advise you on which strategy is best. If you have any more questions about how to get your home sold or you have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

However, when it comes to the end of the fiscal year for builders, they’re highly motivated to sell their new properties. Many builders end their fiscal year at the end of September and some end it in December. If you were thinking of buying an investment property, now is the time.Looking at a spec home—a home that has already been built and is very close to being finished— is a great opportunity for a good buy this September or December.“If you were thinking of buying an investment property, now is the time.”If you can close within those time frames, the builders will often be very negotiable on the prices. You can get a new house with a one-year home warranty, so if anything goes wrong, you have 12 months to get anything fixed. There is also oftentimes an option for a two-year warranty and a 10-year structural warranty.To find out more about how to find a great new construction deal in Charleston, reach out to me and my team.

So, which new rules are being imposed on short-term vacation rentals?There was a great article in The Post and Courier from April 11 about the new rule that’s being imposed. Here’s an excerpt:“Four years ago, as short-term rentals were just sprouting up throughout Charleston, one of the city’s only options to enforce its ban on them was to set up online sting operations.A handful of livability officers would pose as visitors on booking platforms, such as Airbnb and HomeAway, to find listings where short-term rentals weren’t allowed.”Basically, short-term rentals got out of hand. Everybody was Airbnb-ing, and there just wasn’t enough manpower to crack down on people using Airbnb illegally in our city. So, the city decided to go ahead and enforce some rules.The new rule states that full-home rental is not allowed except for in certain areas. To rent out a space otherwise, you have to inhabit the property while the tenants are there, except for the areas of Elliotborough and Cannonborough, where the property also has to be commercially zoned.If you are looking to buy a property that has these rules in place, keep in mind there are some taxes that are going to be imposed. You also will have to get a city business license and pay accommodation taxes.“If you are looking to buy a property that has these rules in place, keep in mind there are some taxes that are going to be imposed.”Many of our clients look outside of the City of Charleston to Isle of Palms, Folly Beach, Kiawah Island, and Seabrook Island, which do allow short-term rentals.If you have any further questions about this, you can contact the City of Charleston directly, or you can just contact my team. As always, if you have any further real estate questions, don’t hesitate to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you.",

What does that mean for buyers?If you plan on buying a home in Charleston, you need to be prepared.First, you need to talk to a lender. You might find yourself in a competitive situation where there are multiple offers on a home. In that case, you have to be pre-approved by a lender. Sellers are not going to look at your offer unless you have been pre-approved by a lender, so make sure you talk to a lender first.If you are buying a home with cash, then you need to have proof of funds to show that you have sufficient funds to purchase the property.“It’s very helpful to work on the seller’s emotions in a competitive market situation.”In the residential real estate market, things tend to be very emotional. Writing a letter to the seller about you and your family can really help. Even if you are single and buying a home on your own, you should write a letter—sellers often find that very admirable. Whether you are single, engaged, or buying a home for your family, it’s very helpful to work on the seller’s emotions in a competitive market situation.If you have any specific questions about lenders, improving your credit, or where to buy a home in this market, please give us a call or send us an email.

Here are some tips.Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value reportWant to buy a home? Search all homes for saleToday we’re here with Holly Wagner from Fairway Mortgage, one of the best lenders in Charleston. She’s here to offer up some great tips on navigating the loan process and answer some common questions we’ve been getting.What documents do I need to bring in order to get pre-approved?You’ll need income documentation, including tax returns and pay stubs, among many other things. A good lender like Holly will make sure that you know exactly what to provide for the pre-approval process.What do closing costs include and how much are they?Closing costs include your appraisal fee, credit report, attorney fees, lender title insurance, owner title insurance, and any inspection costs. On a $200,0000 home, closing costs would run about 1.5%, around $3,000 to $3,5000.“Closing costs include a bunch of different fees.”What are prepaids?Prepaids are additional costs in addition to the closing costs. This includes your homeowners insurance and your taxes. Depending on the time of year you close, it could be a higher or lower bill. Also, the prepaid interest on the new mortgage.What is a lender credit?That’s where a lender increases your rate slightly in order to give you a credit at closing. If you don’t have quite enough to bring to the closing table in cash, we can solve the problem this way.Why is my loan officer asking for the same documentation again?This is probably one of the more common questions we hear. A lot of times when you submit your documentation, the underwriter will go through everything with a fine-toothed comb to see if there are any potential problems. It happens a lot with large deposits or sums of money. It’s just the lender doing their due diligence to make sure they give you the best loan possible.Thanks to Holly for joining me today. If you have any questions for her about the loan process, give her a call at (704) 541-1172.If you have any other real estate related questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

We specifically market to health care professionals moving to our area who might be interested in our listings.

Yes, you read that sentence right.Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value reportWant to buy a home? Search all homes for saleToday I’d like to share an inspirational story with you about real estate. It’s about a successful investor who comes from humble roots.I recently got a call from a buyer who was looking for a home in Downtown Charleston. He was looking for a home in the $2.5 million range. After talking for a while, I asked him a little bit about what he does. He told me that he was a teacher, which was a little bit confusing to me. I wasn’t sure I heard him right.I had to hear more about his story. I came to find out that he’s a retired teacher who has been investing in real estate since he was very young. Over the years, he has owned almost a dozen properties. The way he started was simple. Every time he could get approved for a home loan, he would buy that home. Once he kept the property for awhile, he would then sell it for a profit and buy a new one. He repeated the process so many times that now he’s living in a beautiful oceanfront home in New York looking for a multi-million dollar home in Downtown Charleston.“He has been investing in real estate since he was young.”I just wanted to share that story with you today to show you that anything is possible through real estate and investing is the best way to make the most out of your money. Even if you don’t have the biggest paycheck, you can create something huge if you consistently invest over time.If you have any questions for me about real estate investing or anything else, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

Here’s what you need to know.Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value reportWant to buy a home? Search all homes for saleI’m back with another real estate healthy habit for you. Today, I’m advising you to consider buying beach investment property in 2018.Why do I think it’s such a good idea? Most of it is based on 2017. At the beginning of 2017, I thought we’d see a great year for home sales. That turned out to be the case in the end. In Isle of Palms alone, there were 169 closed home sales in 2017. That’s a 15% jump from the 147 sales they had in 2016. That number jumps to 31% when you’re looking at condo sales.The average home price is down in our market, but the reason for the drop isn’t because prices are going down. The average is going down because there are so many homes selling in the lower price ranges.“This is going to be an excellent year for beachfront property.”I think this is going to be an excellent year to invest in Isle of Palms real estate. This area is seeing some big jumps and I believe that growth is going to continue for the foreseeable future.With the economy doing so well, a lot of investors are going to turn to real estate as an investment vehicle.

If you’re a professional, listen up.Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value reportWant to buy a home? Search all homes for saleI recently spoke with Josh Feldman and Jules Day, two fantastic mortgage lenders who have been nationally recognized for the products they are able to offer to medical professionals and more. I asked them a few important questions and their answers were fantastic.Sometimes the mortgage process can be daunting and potential borrowers hear about a lot of red tape that’s involved. With the regulations the way they are now, do all banks have the same loan options or are there unique programs out there with certain lenders?While it’s true that a lot of the available products are based on standard regulations, including conventional loans backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mae and government loans like FHA and VA, there are a few unique programs out there. There are a number of profession-driven loans for people such as doctors, dentists, lawyers, teachers, police officers, and more.There is a large medical community here in the Southeast. How might those programs differ from the standard programs?“It’s important to do your homework beforehand.”No matter what type of loan you’re talking about, the importance of being able to show creditworthiness to your lender is always going to be there. Credit scores, credit history, documentable income, and assets will all need to be taken into account. However, some of these loans offer some great perks. Doctors might be able to get a home for no down payment at all, and they might be able to factor in their student loan debt to their income in order to have more flexibility. Deferred loans may also be considered.Anybody who is thinking of buying or selling a home needs to do their homework and talk to their lender about all of the different options they have. There is some great information online, but that can become outdated quickly. Each situation is different, which is why having a great lender like Josh or Jules really helps.If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Real estate can be a great investment tool. Here are four tips to make sure you’re making a wise investment.Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value reportWant to buy a home? Search all homes for saleToday we’re continuing our discussion about healthy habits in real estate. The healthy habit that we’re going to explore today is how to create a bigger cash flow for an investment property. When you buy an investment property, you want to find something that’s going to produce a nice, steady cash flow. Here are four things you absolutely must do to make that happen:1. Buy the property correctly. This means keeping a close eye on distressed properties, like foreclosures and short sales. You should also pay attention to those properties that have been on the market for a long time. Often, those sellers are desperate to sell the home and will come down in price to get a deal done.2. Make sure your operating costs are low. The best way to do this is by ensuring that the major systems and components of your home are up to date. This includes your roof, your HVAC, and anything else that can be replaced to make the home more efficient. Having low or no homeowner association fees is important to investors, too.3. Charge fair market rent. I’ve made this mistake the hard way. If you charge near the high end of the market, there’s a chance the property will sit vacantly and you won’t get any cash. Charging fair market rent will ensure that the property is rented out quickly, which will increase your cash flow.“Not charging fair market rent could cause your property to sit vacantly.”4. Make sure you have a budget and plan for paying down your mortgage. The more quickly you are able to pay down your mortgage, the wider your cash flow will be. Making an extra payment every now and then is a good idea.If you’re looking to become a real estate investor in 2018 and you have any questions at all, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "If you are planning to buy a home, these three steps will help you present as an excellent buyer.Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value reportWant to buy a home? Search all homes for saleIf you’re in the market for a new home in this challenging market, it’s important to present yourself as an excellent buyer. Here are three easy tips that will help you present yourself as a serious, responsible buyer.1. Be financially prepared. To buy a home, you will need funds for a down payment, closing costs, and cash-reserves that the lender may look at if you’re trying to secure a loan. Make sure you’ve spoken with a lender and come to any seller with a pre-approval letter. If you’re intending to pay cash for a property, make sure you’ve contacted a financial manager or other bank official and can produce a letter proving you have sufficient funds to purchase the property.2. Look for houses that appeal to you. At Healthy Realty, we tell our buyers not to fall in love with just one house, but to look for several properties that appeal to them. If you have two or three properties in mind before you approach any sellers, you will be in a stronger position to negotiate the price you’re after for the home you want.“Instead of falling in love with one house, look for two or three properties that you’re satisfied with.”3. Write an emotional letter of appeal to the seller. Especially if you are in a multiple-offer scenario, a letter describing you, your family, your plans for life in the property, and the financial preparations you’ve made is going to be a great advantage for you in getting a great price and beating out multiple offers.Along with being a great buyer, it’s important to have a great agent. We have a great team at Healthy Reality, with professional, enthusiastic agents ready to help you buy a home.If you have any questions about buying a home, please don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "So far, 2017 has been a great year for sales in our Charleston market. This means different things for buyers and sellers moving forward.Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value reportWant to buy a home? Search all homes for saleWhat’s been happening in the Charleston market in 2017?We’ve had a great year for sales. The median sale price is $316,119. Keep in mind, that’s just for Charleston County. If we added in other counties, it might bring that number down. Our average days on market—or how long it takes for the average home to sell—has held steady since last year and is currently 58 days, which is unbelievable considering that number was closer to 90 and even 120 days a few years back.What does our steady market mean for buyers? It means there is currently less inventory available for winter sales. Though there aren’t as many homes to choose from, the homes that are available have very incentivized sellers. You should be able to find a few homes you like and try to negotiate with the seller to reduce their price.For sellers, does this mean you shouldn’t put your home on the market? No! What it does mean, though, is you absolutely cannot defer any maintenance on your house. To get your home ready for sale, get it painted, declutter the interior, get it looking in excellent condition, and add one “wow!” factor to it. This can mean something as big as upgrading your kitchen or as simple as updating your countertops. On the exterior, the three P’s apply—you need to pressure wash, put out some pine straw, and add a nice, colorful potted plant.There aren’t a ton of things you must do, but you must get your entire home in excellent condition if you want to get it sold during the fall and winter.If you have any more questions about our market or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.
