        "category": "",
        "content": "By signing an MLS Waiver form, you give your Realtor the chance to market your home before it gets listed and give yourself a chance to properly prepare your home for the market.If you are ready to put your home on the market, do not sign a listing contract with a Realtor without also signing an MLS Waiver form. Doing this will help your home sale tremendously, and there are a couple reasons why.First, it allows your Realtor to market your home before it hits the market. If this waiver is signed, that means your home does not have to go into the MLS right away. If you sign a listing contract without this waiver, your home is automatically listed in three days. I can tell you that 100% of the seller clients I work with never have homes that are ready to go onto the market in three days.This form also gives you the freedom to prepare your home for the market without worrying about it going on the market right away. I have a website for “coming soon” listings called www.comingsoonlistings.com that is specifically designed for this situation and notifies the public of homes that will be listed in the near future. This creates demand and excitement among your target market, and that’s exactly what you need when starting the listing process.“When you sign a listing contract, make sure the MLS Waiver form gets signed along with it.”This month, I have taken pictures of seven different houses so far because they looked so beautiful on the outside. Each of these homes’ sellers signed the MLS Waiver, so now I can start marketing their homes online and building anticipation among buyers. Most buyers start their home search six months to a year before actually buying because they have a home they need to sell first, and they are not going to put their current home on the market unless they know there is another home out there that they like that is coming onto the market soon.So again, when you sign a listing contract, always make sure you also sign the MLS Waiver form.In other news, we have another home selling seminar coming up on June 12 that you will not want to miss. If you attend, you will learn more about our “coming soon” listing program and earn a free professional photo shoot for your home. As always, you can find out more at www.homesharkseminar.com.If you have any other questions about today’s topic or you are thinking of buying or selling a home soon, give me a call or send me an email anytime. I would love to speak with you.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "The numbers are in, so let&rsquo;s take a look at how the market has been doing and where we can expect it to go.&nbsp;I am back with your hot-off-the-press market report! Summer is around the corner and buyers are out shopping for their next home. Let’s take a look at the real estate market in your area to see where it is going this year.Everyone said that the tax reform was going to kill people’s desires to purchase homes. But according to the numbers, the first few months of the year were overall equal to where they were last year. There is been no major dip, and the only reason they are not well above last year’s mark has nothing to do with the tax situation. It has to do with the fact that there is not enough inventory.Looking at buyer traffic from January, February, and March of 2018, we can see that it increased in each month compared to 2017. Interestingly enough, Gallup just released a poll showing that the American people see real estate as the best long-term investment, better even than stocks, bonds, gold, and savings accounts.For the first time in eight years, home ownership went up. People want to buy houses. Arch Mortgage Insurance indicated that even recent interest rate increases and higher taxes on some upper-income earners did not shift the market like they had feared.We can see that the market is still very strong, notwithstanding the lack of inventory. It is a matter of supply and demand; if you are in a market where supply is decreasing at the same time that demand is increasing, the price of that item is going to go up. That is what we have noticed over the past 12 months: home prices continue to rise across the country, with expectations of continued economic growth and future employment gains. The current run of rising prices is likely to continue.In terms of the year-over-year change in price (according to price range), homes in the low to middle price ranges are up 8.5%; middle to moderately priced homes are up 7%; and higher-priced homes are up 5.4%.According to the NAR’s Housing Affordability index, affordability today is higher than it was between 1985 and 2007. The only reason affordability is down in relation to the last eight years is the bust and recovery periods; we were selling distressed and short sale homes that were selling 50% to 80% on the dollar. Overall, the country’s affordability is still in really great shape.“We can see that the market is still very strong, notwithstanding the lack of inventory.”Even though rates and prices are increasing, so are our incomes. Rental prices are also going up. According to Zillow, the median rent countrywide rose 2.8% over the past year, the fastest pace of appreciation in two years. Many families in the U.S. are spending more than 50% of their income on their rent. Rising rent is a trigger for renters to transition to homeownership—overall, two out of three renters under the age of 50 say that they want to own a home.This month’s price index comes with great news for homeowners who are thinking about selling their homes and providing much-needed inventory for buyers, including those who are looking to make their first-ever home purchase.If you have any questions or would like to sell your home, please feel free to reach out to me. You can also attend one of my next free home seller seminars on June 12 at the Hilton Garden Inn, where I will give you great strategic information on how to make more money while selling your home stress-free.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Having good exterior photos of your home stored away can help you sell it quickly and for top dollar any time of the year.&nbsp;Spring is here, and that means if you’re selling your home soon or in the near future, it’s important that you get outside and take pictures of it.You need to have good pictures of your home no matter when you put it on the market, and the only way to guarantee that you always have good photos is to have some stored away. Exterior photos of your home are the first thing buyers see when searching online, and good photos will encourage your target market to see your home in person.Remember, your home’s first showing happens online—not at the house, itself. If you can’t keep a buyer’s interest past four or five pictures, you’ll never get them to come visit and look inside. AndiIf you can’t get a buyer inside your house, I can’t sell it for you.In the video above, I’ve provided a photo showcase to show you exactly what I mean.Starting at 0:58, you’ll see a slide of an exterior photo of a home that was taken last June. I sold this same home in January 2018 in just three days because it was the only listing that showcased beautiful outdoor pictures.In the next slide at 1:23, you’ll see an exterior photo of another home. This time, we included the property’s backyard and all its foliage in the photo. We took that photo a full two years before we put that home on the market, and when we did, we sold it in three days for $10,000 over asking price.  “Having good exterior photos of your home stored away can help you sell it quickly and for top dollar any time of the year.”In the next slide at 2:04, you’ll see an outside photo of a home taken three years before we listed it. This home sold after just two days on the market, and it did so during a snowstorm for $23,000 over asking price. This particular seller attended one of my seminars first to learn about the importance of a photo showcase, and it paid off for them. In fact, my sellers who attend my seminars sell their homes four times faster than my sellers who don’t.In the next slide at 2:43, you’ll see a home whose exterior photo captured a tree in full bloom in its front yard. This picture was taken a year before the home was listed, and we sold it in nine days to a relocation buyer. That buyer was from Minnesota, and I doubt they would’ve been interested in seeing that house without that specific picture.In the next slide at 3:23, you’ll see some examples of how we incorporate drone photography into our listings. You’ll also see a couple of our drone videos. I only see drone photography used for about 1% of all the homes on the market, and usually only for high-priced listings. My team and I use it for all of our listings, no matter what price, and we do it because it captures everything. Most importantly, it gets buyers to click on those photos four times. After four clicks, you’ve got their attention.Those two drone videos were able to interest two relocation buyers for homes listed in very high-priced neighborhoods. One of those homes sold in just two weeks. The other sold before it even hit the market.You can learn more about taking good photos and other tips to sell your home at my next Home Selling Sharks Seminar on June 12 at the Hilton Garden Inn in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania.

        "content": "The latest numbers from our real estate market are in. Today I&rsquo;d like to go over what trends we&rsquo;re seeing and how they might impact your real estate goals this year.&nbsp;Spring has finally sprung. Let’s celebrate the end of winter by taking a look at the April edition of our hot-off-the-press market report. Many people right now are wondering, “What’s going to happen to home prices?” They want to know whether this ongoing rise in prices is truly sustainable. They’re also wondering whether we’re headed toward another bubble. Let’s take a look at some recent market statistics. You can follow along in the video to see charts and additional information pertaining to today’s topic. Housing inventory is very low right now. As of February, inventory has decreased just over 8% year over year. This low level of supply has been driving buyer demand up so significantly that we currently have more buyer traffic than what we saw in May of last year.“Whether you’ve been thinking of buying or listing, now is a great time to make your move.”In the words of Rick Palacios Jr. (the director of research from John Burns Real Estate Consulting): “Buyers thought they could wait forever because rates were going to stay low forever. They’re starting to realize that if they’re going to buy, they should probably buy now.” With all of this in mind, it’s important to realize that market statistics will vary by location. While average home prices have risen 6.6% year over year on a national level, the year-over-year change in price does vary between individual states. As the numbers show, the reason behind the upward pressure on prices is as simple as supply and demand. Demand goes up as supply goes down. But does this mean we’re on the verge of a bubble? This is unlikely as rates are slowing. Currently, most experts predict that we will see an appreciation rate between 4.5% and 5.9% in 2018.Not all market trends this year have been this consistent, though. After rising steadily for the first few weeks of 2018, interest rates have been bouncing around lately. Therefore, I don’t recommend waiting around for a better time to buy. Whether you’ve been thinking of buying or listing, now is a great time to make your move. If you would like to learn more about the listing process, you cansign up today for our next Home Selling Sharks Seminar. This seminar will take place on June 12, 2018, at the Hilton Garden Inn in Fort Washington.

        "content": "Changes are coming to our market. Today, I&rsquo;d like to review a few expert predictions on what we can expect.&nbsp;It’s time for the April edition of our hot-off-the-press market report.Spring is here and the market is on fire! If you’ve been thinking recently about the value of your home, I’ve got some great news to report. CoreLogic’s chief economist Dr. Frank Nothaft recently said that “[…] the net result of rising demand and limited for-sale inventory is a continued appreciation in home prices.”Also, according to the most recent Case Shiller report, appreciation was steady between June and November of last year. While there was a small slowdown in December, this doesn’t mean prices went down. All it means is that we went from an appreciation rate of 6.4% in November to 6.3% in December.This slowdown is very normal for the last month of the year. Sellers whose properties didn’t move off the market sooner are simply ready at that point to have their transaction over and done with. This translates to lower prices.Next, I’d like to give you a look at the average annual appreciation rates we saw in the past, including rates from during the housing bubble between 2000 and 2007. To give you some historical context, we can see that the pre-bubble appreciation rate for the 12 years between 1987 and 1999 was 3.6% per year.During the bubble, the appreciation rate was at more than 7% per year. Then during the bust period between May 2007 and December 2011, values depreciated by 5.5% per year. Since then, appreciation rates during the recovery period to date have been at 5.3% per year.“If recent predictions are true, we will soon be back to normal appreciation rates.”Now that we know what has led us to where we are today, let’s look at what is being projected as we move forward into the next five years. A survey conducted by a panel of over 100  economists, real estate experts, and market strategists found that most experts believe we will finish 2018 with an appreciation rate around 5%.In 2019, the rate is projected to slow down to around 4%. Then, appreciation is expected to level off at 3% per year from 2020 until 2022.Personally, I believe that anything past 2019 is too far off to accurately predict. However, if these predictions are true, we will soon be back to normal appreciation rates.So, what about cumulative house appreciation by 2022. The Bulls are at 27.4% and the Bears are at 8.3%, with the average projection being 18.2%.With all of that being said, is it a good time to sell? Well, according to Daren Blomquist, senior VP at ATTOM Data Solutions, “It is the most profitable time to sell a home in more than 10 years.” However, he also said that homeowners are staying put much longer than we’ve ever seen.So, if you are thinking of putting your home on the market, I’d like to invite you to join us for our next Home Selling Sharks Seminar on April 7. The event will be at Hilton Garden Inn in Fort Washington, beginning with a breakfast at 8:15 a.m. with the seminar starting at 9:15 a.m. To sign up, visit http://www.homesharkseminar.com.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "If you&rsquo;re selling your home, don&rsquo;t hire a traditional Realtor just because they have signs on the lawn. Hire a team with an expert negotiator and marketer on staff.&nbsp;When hiring a Realtor to sell your home, you need to understand what you’re looking for and you need to know what goes on behind the scenes in a real estate office.If you want to sell your home for top dollar, you need a marketing and negotiating expert instead of just a Realtor with a license. An expert will have a team of specialists around them to take care of the different parts of a real estate transaction. Big money gets put into your pocket as a result of marketing and negotiating, so you need to hire a company that does that day in, day out for their clients.You don’t want to look for a traditional real estate company. What does a traditional Realtor know about marketing? Do they have a marketing degree or any negotiating skills? There are hundreds of traditional companies out there, and traditional franchises are being bought out by real estate tycoons. They spend thousands of dollars marketing their company to get as many signs in the lawn as possible in the hope that some of them sell so they can get paid.A traditional company pays anywhere from 70% to 100% of the commission to the agent, which is paid by you—the seller. They’re not making money selling your house, so they’re not going to spend money either. They make money by charging the Realtor’s fees—monthly fees, copy fees, internet fees, etc. It’s a profitable gambit, but it’s one that ignores the customer experience.When I sell houses, as an expert negotiator with an MBA in marketing, I come out every day fighting the home selling sharks. Traditional companies, on the other hand, try to get as many people working at their companies as possible so they can pay them their good commissions and make money off the other side.So, would you rather work with a Realtor who has a lot of signs on the lawn or one who actually does something to earn their fee?Buyers aren’t calling on signs anymore. They see properties on the internet and then email or text. Signs don’t bring buyers. As I discussed in a previous video, there are three majors mistakes people make when hiring a Realtor: they hire them because they have lots of signs in the lawn, they hire them because they’re local, or they hire them because they’re someone they know.“Big money gets put into your pocket as a result of marketing and negotiating.”If you want to hire the right Realtor, your first step is to start earlier than you think. If you start earlier than you think, you’ll have more time to make a plan and dot your i’s and cross your t’s. One mistake can cost you thousands, so you don’t want to start today if you plan on going on the market a week from now. You want to start closer to a year in advance. Once you go on the market, you want to crush the competition by differentiating yourself, and that’s what a marketing expert does. Traditional companies don’t do that.In the video above at the 3:58 mark, you’ll see a slide I’ve provided that shows a cartoon explaining how a traditional, single Realtor at a traditional office works. Basically, they’re trying to juggle too many different balls at once, and they don’t know how to market to buyers online. As a result, their customer service drops.The next slide after that illustrates how a team approach works. In this picture, everyone is working to their expertise as a team under one roof, thereby providing a solid foundation from which to sell your home. There is no “I” in team, and when you hire a team, you want to hire a good one.So, the next time you hire a Realtor, get started early and do your homework. Don’t hire a traditional company or a traditional Realtor just because they have signs on the lawn. Hire a team with an expert negotiator and marketer on staff.If you’d like to learn more about this topic, you’re invited to attend our next home selling seminar on April 7.

In the meantime, stay tuned for my next market report.If you have any other questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.",

        "content": "I&rsquo;m back with a hot-off-the-press market. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.&nbsp;Our old friend Punxsutawney Phil has predicted six more weeks of winter. Phil doesn’t exactly have the best track record for predictions, and recently, we’ve experienced unusually warm weather. Just in case our four-legged, state-appointed meteorologist is wrong, you might want to consider getting started on spring cleaning early.Spring is fast approaching. We know this is the time of year that people want to start the home selling and buying process.“The pool of interested buyers at the end of the year significantly outweighed what was available for sale,” said Lawrence Yun about inventory last year. The biggest challenge we have is a lack of inventory at a time when we’ve had tremendous demand.There has been talk over the last couple of years that maybe Americans don’t believe in homeownership the way that they used to. New stats suggest that this isn’t true. As a matter of fact, The Wall Street Journal published an article this past week that said:  “The US homeownership rate rose in 2017 for the first time in 13 years….The annual increase marks a crucial turning point because it comes after the federal government reined in bubble-era policies that encouraged banks to ease lending standards to boost homeownership. This time, what’s driving the market is a shift in favor of owning rather than renting.”“The number of homes for sale nationwide has declined on an annual basis for the past 35 months straight.”Homeownership was dropping, and, from what we’ve seen, there were economic reasons behind that. Last year, we can see that in each quarter, homeownership was on the increase. It seems that owning a home is still a part of the American Dream.Again, the biggest challenge we have is the low inventory. We don’t expect that much will relieve this current shortage. The number of homes for sale nationwide has declined on an annual basis for the past 35 months straight.If you’re thinking about selling or buying a home, according to Bill Banfield, vice president of capital markets at Quicken Loans:  “Homeowners received the gift of added equity this holiday season. With several years of growth, owners may have more equity than they realize. Many consumers use the tax season at the beginning of the year to reevaluate their entire financial life. It also provides a good opportunity for them to consider how best to take advantage of their equity while mortgage interest rates and borrowing costs are still near record lows.”There you have it. If you’re selling this year, get on my “coming soon” listings website and have buyers waiting to pay you listing price or more.If you’re planning to sell, but just not this year, you’re invited to our next home seller seminar on April 17 at the Hilton Garden Inn. Here, I’ll give you great and strategic information on how to make more money and sell your home fast.

You don’t want to hire someone who isn’t going to work on your behalf to competitively price your home. Before you hire anyone, give them a call and ask them if they’re going to put a price on your home when they get there.

In order to design a custom home selling strategy for you, we’ll start by asking why you’re selling. Then we’ll ask: What past experiences have you had with real estate? What are you expecting from the process? What are your financial goals? The answers to these questions will help us set expectations for you and start working to accomplish your selling goals.There are a lot of factors that go into correctly pricing a home, and a good Realtor will let you in on how they come to a certain number. If they don’t, you may be working with an agent who will fail to get your home sold. Be sure to ask them what the absorption rate in the area is, and what comparable homes are selling for: these are just a few of the many important factors that should be looked at in the pricing process!If you want more selling tips, or if you want to work with a team that has mastered the art of real estate, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

        "content": "How can you avoid putting your home sale in jeopardy? Start by hiring the right Realtor for the right reasons.&nbsp;I’m back once again with the February edition of the Hot off the Press Market Report. Today I will reveal the three major mistakes that end up costing home sellers thousands.  Hiring a Realtor whose company has lots of signs on the lawn. The traditional real estate company markets itself on TV and radio to attract consumers. This also attracts Realtors to work at their company by luring them in with large commission splits so the consumer thinks the company sells lots of home because they see all the signs on the lawns. They think signs bring buyers. However, buyers are not calling into the office from a sign—they see the property online, hit a button and it calls the Realtor. Signs do not bring buyers to your home and the consumer does not know the difference. These big real estate corporations are buying out the smaller offices to get as many realtors in the office to sell, sell, sell, and they are not making money on the commission so they do not spend money marketing your home. They make money by charging the Realtors a monthly management fee, per sale admin fee, copy fee, internet fee, etc. They also capitalize on the title mortgages and other components. With every transaction, they are making an additional $5,000 to $10,000 or more off of a gambit that completely ignores the consumer’s experience and the money left in your pocket at the end. The consumer can see the prices drop on the internet—that is the last sign you want on your lawn, and that is what you see on all these traditional signs.  Hiring the “Neighborhood Realtor.” Do you really think the neighborhood Realtor will net home sellers more money and have a more stress-free sale? What does locality or neighborhood have to do with how qualified the person is to sell a home? Since having a marketing and negotiating expert on your side when selling your home nets you the most money, does this local Realtor have an MBA in marketing and are they a certified negotiator? I can sell homes on the moon. Just because someone is local does not mean they have the unique ability to market and negotiate the sale of your home that leaves more money in your pocket.  Hiring a Realtor because of the price they give you. Realtors will do that to get you to sign with them and they hold you hostage for six months and have to keep putting reduced price signs on the lawn. It’s better to price the home at market value and let them fight over it. That keeps lots of money in your pocket.“Inventory is low and it’s a great time to figure out what you need to do to sell.”There you have it! The three deadliest mistakes when hiring your Realtor. If you have any questions, please call me or email me at dianecardano@cardanohomservices.com.Inventory is low, and now is a great time to figure out what you need to do to sell your home in just one day for over the listed price.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "There has been a lot of confusion recently about changes to our tax system. Today, I’d like to clarify how the new laws will actually impact our market.Winter is here! Our weather hasn’t been consistent, but the good news is that our housing market is still hot.That being said, I know many of you are likely wondering how the new tax code will impact residential real estate. Originally, there were three major proposed changes being examined by the House and the Senate.The first was the change of requirements for the exclusion of gain on the sale of a principal residence, the second was a reduction on the limit of the mortgage interest deduction (MID), and the third was the elimination of the state and local tax deduction (SALT)—which would include property taxes.However, the tax code has now evolved from this original proposal. Let’s take a look at what impact experts believe it will have on the housing market.Starting with the capital gains tax exclusion, the proposal stated that owners would have had to have lived in their primary residence for five of the last eight years to qualify. But this change did not come into being for the final version of the new tax code.In fact, this portion of the tax code is unchanged from its former framework. Homeowners still only need to have lived in their primary residence for two of the last five years to be exempt from capital gains tax.“People purchase homes for many reasons other than the tax advantages.”Moving on, many people were concerned that the MID would be eliminated. This did not happen, but the bill has made some changes. The new bill reduces the limit on deductible mortgage debt to $750,000 for new loans taken out after December 14, 2017. Current loans up to $1 million are grandfathered in, however.Additionally, homeowners may refinance debts of up to $1 million existing on December 14, 2017, and still deduct interest, so long as the new loan does not exceed the amount refinanced. The new tax law also repeals deductions for interest paid on home equity debt through December 31, 2025.When it comes to home equity loans, interest is still deductible if proceeds are used to make improvements to the residence. On second homes, interest remains deductible but is subject to limitations.The last changes we need to examine are those made to SALT deductions. Despite the concern of many, these deductions were not eliminated. The final bill allows an itemized deduction of up to $10,000. Higher-taxed regions and homeowners who now have a cap on these deductions are likely to be impacted by this change.As for the impact these changes will have on you, personally, I recommend that you sit down with an accountant or financial planner.Of course, it’s important to remember people purchase homes for many reasons other than the tax advantages. These personal reasons, such as needing room to raise a family, will never change.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Winter is coming and so is another tax season. The GOP tax plan looks promising, but we need to pay attention to this more as we go into 2018. As the legislation is passed, we’ll know exactly what the ramifications are. If it’s passed as it looks, some upper-end buyers and other people who use a lot of itemized deductions, they’re going to be hit pretty hard. The vast majority of the country is going to probably get a little bit more of a tax break, and that might mean that they’ll be more ready to go ahead and purchase.Now let’s take a look at our housing inventory. Inventory is very low right now and prices are rising. So, let’s take a look at the impact of monthly housing inventory on home prices.If we have less than six months’ inventory, that’s a seller’s market where home prices will appreciate. If we have between six and seven months’ inventory, historically, that’s a neutral market, home prices will only appreciate with inflation. If we have greater than seven months’ inventory, that’s a buyer’s market where home prices will depreciate.We only have to go back to 2010 and 2011 to know that we had nine months’ inventory overall and in some places more than nine months’ inventory. Prices were sliding then, but right now we’re below the six-month level of inventory.  As a matter of fact, Lawrence Yun, the Chief Economist at the NAR, said in the latest report: “Existing inventory has decreased every month on an annual basis for 29 consecutive months. Until new home construction climbs even higher and more investors and homeowners put their home on the market, sales will continue to severely trail underlying demand.”“Demand is getting stronger and stronger.”Demand is getting stronger and stronger as inventory is shrinking. As a matter of fact, if we take a look at inventory, and we take a look at October (which is the last month with available statistics for this year) I compared it to the Octobers of 2014, 2015 and 2016. The month’s supply of inventory each and every year has actually decreased, which you can see in the video above.As more and more buyers are coming to the market there are fewer and fewer houses ready for sale. That’s the reason prices are going up. But we have to also understand, according to Bill Banfield, Vice President of Capital Markets at Quicken Loans:“Compared to the previous year our economy continues to improve and attract homebuyers who may have been on the sidelines during the past few years. This will add additional demand to the equation.”Well, there it is, ladies and gentlemen, it’s pretty simple. Every single month we have more and more buyers, and less and less inventory to sell. Even with limited inventory, there are more and more buyers out there. We have more buyers looking at houses even though we have a lot less houses to look at. Just this month I sold six homes for an average of $10k over the listed price. These were homes that were not selling just 30 days ago.And if you are thinking of selling in the next three months to three years, come to our next Seller Seminar on January 20th at the Hilton Garden Inn in Fort Washington. Here I will give you great and strategic information on how to make more money and sell your home fast, stress-free, for top dollar. Imagine that. Make sure you come to it.

Click here to perform a full home searchSelling a home? Click here for a FREE Home Price EvaluationCall me at 215-576-8666 for a FREE home buying or selling consultationI am back with the September edition of the hot-off-the-press market report!Summer’s over and homes are still flying off the market. More and more people are jumping into homeownership. Market Watch quotes consumer confidence rose in July to the second-highest level in 16 years.Americans shrugged off all the drama of President Trump’s Washington, and took heart in the best labor market in a decade. Homeownership rates in the US actually went up 63.7%—the highest rate in three years.The bottom line is that the economy is strong and improving. Interest rates remain low, and employment is high. When combined with the coming demographic shift as more millennials enter the prime household creating years, this suggests that the housing market is on a steady course for the foreseeable future.As a matter of fact, people were surveyed with this question: “What would be the best way to invest your money—money that you wouldn’t need for 10 years or so?” Sure enough, real estate was the No. 1 answer.Another reason why more and more people are becoming homeowners is wealth. According to state representative Loretta Sanchez, homeownership is the first rung on the ladder of wealth creation in our nation. The average worth of a family that owns a home is $225,000, while that of one who is renting is only $5,000. This means that the net worth of a homeowner is 45 times more than a renter.“THIS MEANS THAT THE NET WORTH OF A HOMEOWNER IS 45 TIMES MORE THAN A RENTER.”Of course, because more people are becoming homeowners, the supply of homes continues to be very low. This makes the current market an even better time to sell. That’s why my coming-soon listing program is so vital in this new market.Check out these next stats:  Homeowners who sold in the second quarter realized an average price gain of $51,000 since the purchase—the highest average price gain for home sellers since 2007.  This represented an average return of 26% on the previous purchase price of the home.  Homeowners who sold in the second quarter of 2017 had owned an average of 8.05 years.Additionally, mortgage rates are projected to go up by next year, which could cause some buyers not to be interested in moving anymore. Waiting will cost more in price and interest rate for the buyer, making your home less affordable for buyers, and possibly lowering the value of your home.These next statistics always make me chuckle. The difference between what a homeowner believes their house is worth and what the appraiser thinks its worth is just short of a 2% difference. When selling, I run the home through my pinpoint pricing analysis to make sure that we get the price that the home will appraise for, and save thousands for my clients.If you’re thinking of selling in the next three months or three years, come to one of my home selling seminars—the next one is January 20th at the Hilton Garden Inn in Fort Washington.

Click here for a FREE Home Price EvaluationCall me at 215-576-8666 for a FREE home buying or selling consultationToday I want to go over the three things you need to do to get top dollar for your home. Low inventory means that homes are selling quickly and sellers have the advantage, but why not aim for getting even more money in your pocket?When you’re thinking of selling one, two, or even three years from now, there are three things you can do to ensure your success down the line.1. Start way earlier than you think. Consider Noah when he was building the arc. When he was building the boat and gathering the animals, he did so well in advance. This is exactly the mindset you need to apply to selling your home. Come to one of my home seller seminars, where we’ll teach you eight secret strategies to getting you top dollar. This will guarantee you a quick sale and more money in your pocket. People who come to our seminars are getting their homes off the market in just seven days and for at or above list price.2. Crush the competition. Imagine a sports game where the final score ended up being something like 101 to three. This would make for an amazing win and an amazing story, and that’s exactly what you should aim for in your transaction. Having a competitive mentality will help put you far ahead of the competition. There are other homes out there that want to sell too; you need to make sure that your home is better than the rest.3. Have buyers lined up outside of your door. This is something that happens at every one of our open houses. If you follow these first two steps, this is going to be the result. If you have this vision and follow through, it can come true for you too.“HAVING A COMPETITIVE MENTALITY WILL HELP PUT YOU FAR AHEAD OF THE COMPETITION.”You can learn all of these things at my upcoming Home Selling Sharks Seminar on October 7th at the Hilton Garden Inn. Free breakfast will begin at 8:30 a.m. and the seminar will start at 9:30 a.m. There will also be a meet and greet with various speakers during the breakfast.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Buyer demand is far outpacing our supply.“I’VE NEVER SEEN AN AUGUST WITH SUCH HIGH DEMAND.”Financing is still available, which is great news. Even though prices continue to rise, homes are actually becoming more affordable.Contrary to what many people tend to believe, renting can actually be much more expensive than buying. For example, the percentage of income needed to afford median rent is now 29.2%. The percentage of income needed to buy a median home is actually much lower—just 15.8%.As more and more renters become buyers, demand continues to rise. The share of home shoppers who are renters has gone up from 45% in the first quarter of 2015 to 55% in the first quarter of this year.Now is a great time to buy. This is especially the case since Freddie Mac is projecting that mortgage rates will increase.Additionally, high demand and rising home values mean that there are also a lot of opportunities for sellers in today’s market. Homes are selling very quickly. I’ve personally helped many sellers to obtain top dollar by using two of my websites: www.ComingSoonListings.com and www.PreHouseInspection.com.Many owners are finding that they are able to get more than they expected from their home. The more equity you have, the better position you’ll be in when it comes time for you to make your move.Whether you’re thinking of selling now or later, we hope you’ll join us at our Home Selling Sharks Seminar on October 7th, 2017 at the Hilton Garden Inn.

Click here to perform a full home searchSelling a home? Click here for a FREE Home Price EvaluationCall me at 215-576-8666 for a FREE home buying or selling consultationWhen it comes to selling a property, it is never too early to get a jump start on the process. Today, we want to let you in on a secret that can save you thousands: a pre-marketing home inspection.We teach future home sellers each month at our seminar how to sell for up to 18% more. One of the ways to do this is by fighting off the “staging shark.” Real estate is a new world these days, and it’s a world where differentiating your home from the others is essential.I’ve taught over 1,000 home sellers so far, and from doing so I’ve learned that most sellers want three key things. They want to sell for the most money, in the least amount of time, and they want to sell hassle free.Having a pre-marketing home inspection takes care of all three of these points. When you get your home inspection taken care of prior to listing, you’re saving yourself a lot of money. If you discover anything in your property that needs a repair, you can choose from Cardano’s List—a compilation of business contractors my team and I trust to meet your needs.When you have your inspection done in advance, you can have repairs done at your own pace and with your own preferred contractors instead of ones chosen by the buyer.Additionally, buyers love being able to read home inspection reports as well as any receipts from the repairs you’ve made. This makes buyers more comfortable and will let them make you a clean offer at top dollar. In fact, a recent statistic says that 100% of home buyers feel more comfortable buying a pre-inspected home.“100% OF HOME BUYERS FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE BUYING A PRE-INSPECTED HOME.”A pre-home inspection also saves you time, since most buyers won’t feel the need to perform another after seeing your report. This eliminates the 14 to 21-day contingency period, and offers tend to be submitted in just days.This strategy means home sellers don’t need to worry about a buyer backing out because of a home inspection. All cards are on the table. Sellers will be able to put their market on the home feeling confident that they’ve already taken care of all repairs.So make sure that when you’re listing your home, you choose an expert advisor who utilizes this strategy.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

However, they’re going to be talking more about the challenges of these rising prices.Right now, interest rates are said to be rising, so buyers are a little nervous. This is not just the first-time homebuyer that’s nervous, but the trade-up seller that’s also being affected. Prices are higher than they were during the housing boom in 2006.Some people are saying that this is evidence of the housing market heading for another crash. That is not the case. When you compare the current price increases with what normal appreciation would have looked like if there wasn’t a bust in 2008, then we’re right on track with current prices.Home values are where they should be, and now is the time to sell. In the last 12 months, prices have gone up 6% nationally and, in most markets, the level of appreciation is actually accelerating.“HOME VALUES ARE WHERE THEY SHOULD BE, AND NOW IS THE TIME TO SELL.”There will be a surge in prices in this fall market, so get me to your home right now so we can get your home ready to sell by the time fall comes.We offer a free room-by-room consultation online at FreeRoomByRoom.com, and if you’re thinking of selling in 2018, come to our next Home Selling Sharks Seminar.

Click here for a FREE Home Price EvaluationCall me at 215-576-8666 for a FREE home buying or selling consultationThank you for joining me for another Hot Off the Press market report. We had an incredible spring, where 90% of the metro areas are boasting year-over-year gains. Why is this happening?Buyers are starting to realize the tax advantages of homeownership right now. I looked at the four major tax advantages of home ownership, according to the Tax Policy Center’s Briefing Book.1. Mortgage Interest Deduction. “Homeowners who itemize deductions may reduce their taxable income by deducting any interest paid on a home mortgage.”2. Property Tax Deduction. “Homeowners who itemize deductions may also reduce their taxable income by deducting property taxes they pay on their homes.”3. Imputed Rent. “The return on homeownership is excluded from taxable income.”4. Profits from home sales. “Homeowners may exclude from taxable income up to $250,000 of capital gains on the sale of their home.”Americans still think that real estate is the American Dream. 34% believe that real estate is the best long-term investment.Why are prices going up? It is generally a result of supply and demand. As a nation, we are at 3.8 months of inventory. That’s nothing! That’s what’s driving prices up, but not in every price range.Right now, we have way less than six months inventory for first-time buyer homes, so we have a seller’s market. A little more inventory for move-up homes will bring it closer to a neutral market. In the premium market, we’re in a buyer’s market because we have more than seven months of inventory and in our area, more than nine months of inventory.“INVENTORY IS HISTORICALLY LOW COMPARED TO THE LAST SIX YEARS.”June is our “Celebrate National Homeownership Month.” Homebuyers want more privacy, a place for their family to grow, some stability, control over their future, and putting their hard-earned money to work for them.Homeowners: if you have any thoughts about moving, you need to get started now. There’s not a lot of inventory on the market.

Click here for a FREE Home Price EvaluationCall me at 215-576-8666 for a FREE home buying or selling consultationThe traditional real estate process is lengthy and confusing for sellers. The first step that agents usually take is the listing interview, where they may be afraid of giving staging suggestions to the owner of the property for fear of insulting the owner. They’ll suggest a starting price and put the house on the market immediately without taking the time to adequately stage the home.The seller will sign a long-term listing contract with no “easy out guarantee” in case they aren’t satisfied, and after a month on the market they’ll put the price reduced sign out on the front lawn. Does that sound like a successful process to you?The average traditional Realtor lists one to two homes a year. They might not own a digital camera. The photos on the MLS may not be updated as the seasons change. They don’t do premarketing or a pre-inspection on the home, and one broker monitors hundreds of agent’s listings in those large corporate real estate offices you think of. There are no systems for monthly marketing meetings, either.There are so many unstaged homes with ineffective pictures online that a well-staged home will stand out from the competition and be noticed. Something as simple as updating photos to match the current season will make a world of difference to potential buyers.“THERE ARE SO MANY UNSTAGED HOMES WITH INEFFECTIVE PICTURES ONLINE THAT A WELL-STAGED HOME WILL STAND OUT FROM THE COMPETITION AND BE NOTICED.”In my next video, I’ll take you through the four steps in what I like to call the new world of real estate.

Click here to perform a full home searchSelling a home? Click here for a FREE Home Price EvaluationCall me at 215-576-8666 for a FREE home buying or selling consultationHello raving fans and welcome to the latest edition of my Hot Off the Press Market Report.Spring is here and people are very confident about the economy right now. Prices are rising—they went up an average of 7.2% across the United States compared to last year. In the video above, I have a few slides to show you that reveal some interesting numbers about our current market and what the future holds for buyers and sellers.The first is a home price expectation survey of where experts project prices will be over the next five years. There are three different projections ranging from most optimistic to most pessimistic. Overall, they are all projecting prices to rise at least 6.3%, and the most optimistic predicts an increase of 26.7% over the next five years.These are important figures, and I mention them because as I take these projections and apply them to a house purchased in January 2017, you can see they have a considerable impact on that home’s equity just based on appreciation. Year over year, if you would’ve bought that house for $250,000, it would be worth $292,000 in five years. That means you and your family’s net worth would increase by almost $43,000 just by purchasing a home.The chief economist from Quicken Loans says “Tight inventory has been a key to contributing factor to the year over year growth in home value prices. This steady growth could very well lead to more availability, driving homeowners to consider cashing in on their growing equity by putting their home on the market.”He is 100% correct. With prices going up, there’s more equity in every single homeowner’s home. I want to make sure you are aware of that equity, and if you decide to make a move, I’ll help you understand that you have the ability to move because there is extra equity in the house. If you are looking to making a move, now might be a great time.“IF YOU’RE LOOKING TO MAKE A MOVE, NOW MIGHT BE A GREAT TIME.”Interest rates are projected to go up along with prices this year. If you’re looking to buy a house right now, you should be aware of the two things that will determine what you pay on a monthly basis: interest rates and the original price. Both of them are increasing, which is phenomenal.There is no reason to wait to buy right now; if you wait, you’ll only pay more. Do increases in prices and rates mean that people will stop buying homes? No! Since 1988, the median asking price for rents has steadily increased. Historically, the cost of renting is much higher than the cost of buying. The percentage of income needed to afford median rent is 29.2%, while the percentage of income needed to afford a median home is just 15.8%.As I keep saying, if you’ve had any thoughts about moving, now’s the time. There are not enough homes on market and there are lots of buyers who can’t find homes. If you’re thinking you can’t get a mortgage, don’t decide anything before you talk to one of our trusted lenders.

Click here to perform a full home searchSelling a home? Click here for a FREE Home Price EvaluationCall me at 215-576-8666 for a FREE home buying or selling consultationWelcome to my latest market report! Today I’m coming to you live from Hawaii, so let’s jump right into the news.Right now, research shows that people are very confident in the economy, the job market, and what’s taking place in real estate. In fact, a recent Gallup poll states that Americans view the economy more positively since the election in November than they did in the previous nine years.Now I have a question for you: When do you think most listings come on the market? The answer is the second quarter of each year, which is coming up.This means if you’re thinking about selling your home but waiting until April, May, or June to put it on market—don’t! That’s when everyone else puts their homes on the market. We know that buyers are out there right now and we can get your house sold quickly. Let’s put it on the market now before the rest of the competition—including some new construction in many markets—hits the market too.“IF YOU’RE THINKING ABOUT SELLING YOUR HOME, DON’T WAIT UNTIL SPRING.”I’m not the only one saying this. Jonathan Smoke, the chief economist at realtor.com, stated in his latest article that “In most markets most years, the optimal time to list is in the spring so that the maximum number of potential buyers view the home. This year, the conventional wisdom of buying and selling may need to change. Inventory levels at the beginning of 2017 are at multi-year lows. Sellers now face very little competition.”If you’re a move-up buyer or just want to buy another home, pay very close attention to interest rates. The 30-year fixed rate skyrocketed at the end of 2016 and then came down a little bit, but now it looks like it’s bouncing around. I don’t think this will have a major impact on how many people will buy houses.Also, in a recent survey of loan officers that asked them how they thought rising rates will impact demand for purchase mortgages, 16.7% said it would have no impact because there is not enough supply to fulfill current demand. Another 16.7% said rising rates will weaken demand. I agree with that assertion. The vast majority of people moving on—they’re just going to have to pay more.If you’re a first-time buyer or a seller who’s thinking about buying, you have to take into consideration that if you wait until later in the year, you will have to spend more money. The Mortgage Bankers Association, Fannie Mae, and the NAR are all projecting that interest rates will continue to rise throughout the year.As you can see in the slide in the video above, if we average out the mortgage rate projections of the next three quarters, interest rates are going to be almost a half a point higher this time next year than they are right now. Why would anybody wait until the end of the year when they know they’ll pay more on an interest rate?Some people assume that because interest rates are going up, prices will decrease. That’s not what the experts think. In the past month, home prices have risen 1.1%, and it’s likely going to rise even further. As the CoreLogic Chief Economist Frank Nothaft said, “Very low mortgage rates sparked demand, and with inventories low, the result has been a pickup in home-price growth.”If you want to sell your home fast in 26 days, we have two Home Selling Shark Seminars coming up this month. The first is a breakfast seminar on March 25th from 8:30 a.m and 9:30 a.m. The second is an evening seminar on March 28th. They will both be held at the Hilton Garden Inn in Ft Washington, PA. To sign up, just go to www.HomeSharkSeminar.com.We are also having Homebuyer Workshop on March 23rd at 6 p.m. at the Abington Township Library.

Click here for a FREE Home Price EvaluationCall me at 215-576-8666 for a FREE home buying or selling consultationToday I’m back with your latest market update! Let’s dive right into what’s been happening lately.Interest rates have jumped up the last two months, and most experts are projecting that they’ll settle somewhere in the 4.5% and 5% range later on. This might cause buyers to get apprehensive about purchasing homes, so if you want to sell your house, you should put it on the market right now. If you wait, not only will the value of your existing home diminish, but later on in the year, as a move-up or move-down buyer, you’ll have to pay a higher interest rate on your new home.In the video above, I’ve provided a slide depicting mortgage rate projections all the way into the first quarter of 2018.“IF YOU WANT TO SELL YOUR HOUSE, YOU NEED TO ACT FAST.”The annual average for the 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 3.65% in 2016, which is the lowest annual average ever recorded by Freddie Mac. Even though interest rates are creeping up, it’s still a great time to buy. If you have considered renting because interest rates are going up, just know that rent will always be going up too.As you can see in the next chart in the video, the median asking rent in our market has increased every year since 1988. Zillow just reported that renters paid an accumulated $475 billion in 2016, which is a 4% increase over 2015.If you’re still not convinced that buying is better than renting, here are five reasons homeownership is a great financial investment:  Mortgage payments can be fixed, while rents will only go up.  The equity in your home can be a financial resource later on.  You can build wealth without paying any capital gains.  A mortgage can act as a forced savings account.  Overall, homeowners can enjoy greater wealth and growth than any renter can ever can.Owning a home is one of the most common ways households build long-term wealth. Instead of paying your landlord, you can pay yourself in the long run through paying down your mortgage. If you buy a house, you’re also capping your expenses. The taxes and insurance will go up a little bit, but your housing expense will remain constant.If you or anyone you know is thinking about buying or selling a home, be sure to introduce them to me so I can help them. A great way to do this is by inviting them to our next Home Selling Shark Seminar. We’ll be holding two seminars in March—one on the 25th and one on the 28th. Both will be at the Hilton Garden Inn in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania.

        "content": "Many important developments are taking place in our market as we head into 2017. Today, I want to talk about how you can take advantage of them.Buying a home? Click here to perform a full home searchSelling a home? Click here for a FREE Home Price EvaluationCall me at 215-576-8666 for a FREE home buying or selling consultationWelcome back to the hot real estate market! What kind of news and updates are happening out there right now?As you know, I’ve been telling you to take advantage of the low mortgage rates we’ve seen the last few months because they would eventually rise again. Sure enough, in the last couple of weeks, they’ve risen above 4%. You shouldn’t worry too much about it, though, because that percentage is about where they began in 2016. Even if interest rates rise all the way up to 5% in 2017, that’s still nothing to fret over. I remember that during most of the 1990s they were regularly as high as 8%.Many experts such as myself predict that by 2020, homes will increase in value between 10% and 21%. That’s a nice return on your investment. As you can see from my home price expectation survey slide in the video above, if you bought a house right now and closed next month at $250,000, in five years, that house will appreciate in value by $43,201. By January of 2022, then, it will be worth $293,201. That’s what you can expect in terms of potential growth in your family’s wealth over the next several years.For my next slide—the state-by-state forecasted year-over-year percentage change in home price—we see that there is no state where prices are predicted to be negative. Here in Pennsylvania, we have a 4% appreciation rate, which is great.If you can’t wait until spring to sell your home, hold that train of thought. The number of listings will increase substantially as the new year begins, including new construction homes. This will lower the demand for your house. You’re much better off putting your home on the market now.“Don’t wait until spring to list your home.”My next slide detailing the inventory levels of the first five months of 2016 confirms this strategy. During January and February, the number of homes on the market was very low, which meant that competition was also low. Starting in March, inventory levels started to pick up because everyone thought of spring as the perfect buying season. By April and May, they had skyrocketed. Typically, as a year gets older, more and more homes will be built. Why wait for that?Don’t follow fake news headlines on social media or on television. Those outlets like to scare people, and they don’t understand the market as well as us experts. If you decide to list your home now, there are two points I want you to consider.The first is to never list it with an agent who tells you a price you want to hear. Experience shows that a common mistake that sellers make is overpricing their home with an agent who is the least competent person to actually get that price. Instead, hire an agent who’s going to consult with you with integrity, negotiate for you as though it was their own home, have systems in place to organize all the details, and, most importantly, have high-tech marketing that will attract buyers before the home even goes on the market.The second point is don’t get duped when selling your home. I get calls all the time from sellers who failed in their previous attempt at selling their house because they felt obligated to list with a friend or family member. Never do something like that with an asset as important as your house. Instead, hire and expert marketer and negotiator. Find someone who has sold hundreds of homes throughout their career rather than dozens.Keep in mind that my next home seller seminar is coming up on Saturday, January 21st at the Hilton Garden Inn. We’re starting at 9:30 a.m., and you’re also invited to breakfast at 8:30 a.m.For more details, visit homesharkseminar.comIf you have any questions about what’s happening in the market, please feel free to give me a call.Also, stay tuned for my next video where I will share some awesome staging techniques to help your home sell quickly and for top dollar.

Click here for a Home Price  EvaluationLooking to buy a home in Athens, Georgia? Click here to perform a full home searchAs we head into 2017, I wanted to take a moment to look back at the most important statistics from the Athens market in 2016. Now, a lot of agents can be procrastinators and haven’t yet entered all their year-end data into the MLS, so this data might not be perfect yet.As of early January, these numbers won’t change much even as agents add in late sales data from 2016.In Clarke County, the average sales price went up 9.8% to about $202,000. Almost 1,500 units sold in 2016, roughly 8% more homes sold than in 2015. In Oconee County, we didn’t see as many sales simply because the population is smaller. Prices rose about 6.8%, from an average of $312,000 to $333,000 in 2016.“IF YOU’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT MAKING A MOVE IN THE ATHENS AREA, THE TIME IS NOW.”When you look at the Athens area as a whole, it was a good year with the average sales price rising 8.4% to $225,000. Overall, we’re seeing prices rise, and that’s a great thing. We’ve certainly needed it after being in a slump for a bit.We’re also seeing good appreciation, so if you’re thinking about buying a house, you probably should have already done so. It’s time to stop waiting.If you’ve thought about selling, this time is the best time in nearly the last 10 years. We hope prices will continue to rise, but we really don’t know what 2017 and 2018 will bring. As of now, things are looking up with the economy improving.If you’ve been thinking about making a move in the Athens area, the time is now. Give us a call or send us an email today.

Click here for a FREE Home Price EvaluationCall me at 215-576-8666 for a FREE home buying or selling consultationI’m here with your latest real estate market update!As the weather gets colder and the holidays approach, most home sellers think, “It’s December and the market is going to slow down. I’m not even going to think about putting my home on the market.” However, that’s not a good idea.Why? Right now, the market is actually swarming with buyers. In fact, there are so many buyers that I just sold two homes that weren’t scheduled to hit the market until April! Inventory is incredibly low, so even if you’re not planning on selling til next year, pick up the phone right now to figure out what your next steps are. Now is still a great time to be on the market, as interest rates are still low and buyers are highly motivated.Now, first-time buyers probably think that they need to put 20% down in order to buy a home. However, the average down payment for first-time home buyers has dropped down to 6% in 2016, while repeat buyers are putting 14% down. In fact, some first-time buyers are able to get in a home for less than 4% down. You don’t need to get an FHA loan; there are other loan products out there that allow you to put 3% down.“OUR WINTER MARKET IS SWARMING WITH MOTIVATED BUYERS.”Right now, mortgage interest rates are at 3.5%, which is still incredibly low. Over the next 12 months, they’re expected to jump to 4.2%, which is quite a difference. Mortgage credit availability is also very good right now, so it’s easier for more people to get a mortgage.As for what FICO score you need to buy a home, in 2016, 53% of closed loans had FICO scores between 600 and 748. In fact, 30% got a loan with a credit score under 700. This combined with low mortgage rates and increased mortgage credit availability makes now a great time to be a first-time buyer.As for our sellers, you should know that inventory is extremely low right now. By putting your home on the market, you will be able to maximize the profits from your home sale.That’s it for our winter market update. Keep an eye out for our next Home Selling Shark Seminar on Saturday, January 21st, 2017. We will also have a buyer conference next January.

Click here to perform a full home searchSelling a home? Click here for a FREE Home Price EvaluationCall me at 215-576-8666 for a FREE home buying or selling consultationOne of my greatest passions as a Realtor is getting my home sellers the best possible price in the least amount of time with the least amount of hassle. In short, my biggest concern is making your real estate great again.Today’s home seller faces many challenges in our current market. For one thing, our market is complicated. You can’t just put a sign on your lawn and expect it to sell. Currently, the average days on market is 80 days, which isn’t great. In fact, it’s bad. Taxes are also high, and they’re only getting higher. This makes it difficult for buyers to afford homes, which is causing home values to go down every single year.Another problem is Realtors making false promises about selling your home and then using slipshod tactics like taking its listing photos with a cell phone. That’s not what a professional does! It only takes about $600 to get a license, so, unfortunately, not a lot of training goes into handling such a large asset.How can you avoid these problems when listing your home? I’ve put together a list of eight secret strategies to help guide you through the process. You can learn these strategies by visiting 8secretstrategies.com. Whether it’s through me or another agent, this list will tell you what you should do to sell your home. In short, there are two main things that can make your real estate great again: having both a marketing expert and a negotiating expert on your team.Why am I telling you this? Because houses today are selling quickly–for those whose house is priced right and staged properly. It’s now November, which means if you plan on selling in the spring, you need to make a plan now. Don’t make the mistake of waiting too long or not hiring an expert Realtor.“Only houses that are priced right and staged right sell quickly.”If you have any questions about how to make your real estate great again, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. Remember, we’re having our next Home Selling Sharks seminar on January 21st at the Hilton Garden Inn. To register, all you have to do is visit homesharksseminar.com.
