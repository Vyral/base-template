        "content": "Buying a home is not always an easy process, and there are many obstacles that a first-time homebuyer may encounter.The best thing you can do is be prepared for those obstacles. An experienced agent can help you find the right home, negotiate for you, and guide you every step of the way. However, that doesnât mean you wonât encounter any wicked witches or flying monkeys while youâre on the yellow brick road to homeownership.      Finding a down payment. Unless youâre independently wealthy or have just won the lottery, you will probably have to get a mortgage to buy a home. VA loans are the only loans that allow you to purchase a home with no money down, and you need to be active or retired military to qualify. Most loans require some kind of down payment. The most popular loans are FHA loans and conventional loans, which require anywhere from 3% to 20% down.        Obtaining a minimum FICO score. You need at least a 620 FICO score for an FHA loan, and you need a 720 score for a conventional loan with mortgage insurance. However, if your FICO score falls below that, you may still qualify for a mortgage; you will just have a higher interest rate or different requirements that you have to meet.  Itâs important to talk to your lender about your credit score, as online credit scores may vary. Get pre-qualified with a lender before you start looking at homes, even if you donât plan on doing so for another six to 12 months. That way, you can identify any issues with your credit that you may need to repair and you can get some guidance from your lender to make sure that youâre doing everything you can to get the house that you want.  Meeting lender ratios. Most lenders have a certain ratio that you have to meet. Your PITI (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) ratio for your mortgage payment cannot exceed 33% of your monthly gross income. Some lenders accept higher than that but again, that is something you need to check with your lender. For example, if you earn $5,000 a month, then the max PITI payment you could qualify for was $1,650.Your back-end ratio includes your PITI ratio with all of the debt that you pay on a monthly basis. That ratio should fall between 41% and 50%, depending on your lender and the type of loan you are looking for. If you donât want mortgage insurance, you typically cannot exceed 41%; to qualify for a higher back-end ratio, you can put 20% down.There are always exceptions to the rule, however, so make sure you work with a lender that you trust.âMake sure you speak with a trusted lender before you start looking at homes.â  Receiving an appraised value. The appraisal occurs after youâve gone under contract. Before May 1st, 2009, your lender could select their own trusted appraiser that was experienced and comfortable giving appraisals in the area. As a result, you would get a fair and balanced appraisal.However, a new home valuation code of conduct allows appraisal management companies to pluck an appraiser from a random pool. Your appraiser may be from another area and not know anything about the neighborhood that youâre buying in, which could result in a low appraisal. Thatâs tough for buyers and sellers alike, but that is the world we live in.If the appraisal does not come in and the seller does not adjust the price, you can walk away from the transaction, pay the difference in cash, or meet the seller in the middle. Homes often donât appraise in our current sellerâs market, as home prices continue to increase.  Satisfying your loan conditions. Underwriting can be frightening. An underwriter will review your file and make demands that you might not have even known about. At that point, youâve probably already gone through your home inspection and your appraisal. When the underwriters come back with conditions and requirements, donât get upset. They may need more documents or they may have rejected the loan for any number of reasons; they write the rules.For example, if youâve remarried but your former spouse went through a short sale or foreclosure with your name on the mortgage, you may be disqualified for your mortgage.Thatâs why itâs important to disclose everything about yourself and your finances to your lender so that the loan officer will be able to foresee any problems down the road. You can also get a full underwritten approval before you look at homes to make the whole process easier for you.These are just a few of the most common obstacles first-time homebuyers may encounter. If you have any other questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

        "title": "6 Tips for Buying in a Sellers Market",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "The real estate market often fluctuates, so planning for mistakes in advance is smart. Itâs tough to predict whether the market will favor buyers or sellers when itâs your turn to buy.If itâs a sellerâs market like the one we are seeing right now, buyers can get what they want. However, they need to bring their A-game and be decisive in order to do so. Here are six common mistakes we see in a sellerâs market like this and how you can avoid them:      Not making your best offer up front. The motivation to buy for as little money as possible is deeply ingrained in us. When buyers see a high list price, they naturally wonder if they can get a better deal. Offering less than asking price is a reasonable strategy in a buyerâs market, but it doesnât work quite as well when there is a shortage of inventory. In fact, it doesnât work at all. Competition is fierce, so come in with a strong opening offer if you really want to get the home.        Overanalyzing the purchase price. This is ill-advised because the longer you take to make an offer, the higher the risk of losing the home you want. Once youâve determined the type of home you want, the location you desire, and the right price range, donât wait to make an offer. Be prepared to move quickly by having your finances in order and being pre-approved.        Work with an experienced agent. A lot of people make the mistake of not doing this, and it costs them. If you have a seasoned agent on your side, they will give you a better chance of getting the home you want. In Texas, sellers pay the commissions for their agent as well as yours, so it costs you nothing out-of-pocket to have an experienced professional advising you on the best course of action to take.  âLow offers wonât do a thing for you in this market.â      Not being pre-approved. This is a common problem. With the market moving so fast, youâre going to lose out on a lot of great homes if youâre not pre-approved. Without that letter in hand, most agents and sellers wonât even entertain your offer.        Not being prepared for a bidding war. No buyers want to be involved in bidding wars, but they are inevitable in this kind of market. Start your search below your maximum budget so you have room to up your offer.        Not learning from your mistakes. Itâs easy to get frustrated by repeatedly declined offers. Learn from prior offers and transactions so you can move into your dream home.  If you have any questions for us or youâre interested in buying or selling a home in San Antonio, give us a call or send  us an email. We would love to hear from you.",

If they donât, you may need to find a new one.        Medical needs. If you can, have your doctor call in your prescriptions to a pharmacy in your new town. Keep your old doctorâs number handy in case you need to contact them to forward any paperwork in the future. If youâre keeping your health insurance plan, look for doctors in your new area that accept your insurance. If you need to switch providers or update your plan, try to do it before moving.        Things to transfer. Transfer memberships from local organizations, gyms, associations, and clubs. Be aware that you may have to pay an early termination fee on some of those. Factor that into your moving costs.        Raid the kitchen. About a month before moving day, start using up frozen or canned goods so you donât have to let anything go to waste. Donate any unopened, non-perishable food to a local food pantry.  âDonât let the food in the freezer go to waste!â  Check the car. Give it a tuneup to avoid a breakdown on the way to your new home. If you have a trusty mechanic, ask that they refer you to another one near your new home. Pack a first aid kit just to be safe.These are just a few of the things that you should do before you move. If you have any questions or want any more tips, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.",

        "content": "Over the past few months, there has been a lot of buzz about potential interest rate increases. First, they were predicted to go up last September. That didnât happen, but they did go up in December. Nobody knows if or by how much rates will go up next time, but we do know that they will still be historically low.It is widely expected that the Federal Reserve will increase rates in 2017. Even if they go up by 1% or 2%, it wonât affect our market much. There are three reasons why:  Mortgage rates often move independently of the Fed rate.âA small increase in rates wonât affect our market much.â      Any increase in rates will be small. Whether they go up by 0.25% or 0.5%, they will still be historically low.        A shortage of inventory. With a limited supply of homes out there, the Fed will keep the health of the real estate market in mind before taking any action.  In short, the market is doing great right now and itâs likely to stay that way for the rest of the year, regardless of what happens with interest rates.If you have any questions for me or want to take advantage of current market conditions, give me a call or send me an email.

Itâs important that people feel warm and welcome when they approach your home. You only have one chance to make a first impression, so make sure the exterior of your home is clean and fresh for the spring market. Declutter your entryway, trim trees and bushes, and add some fresh mulch to your yard. These are cheap, easy ways to spruce up your exterior.        Always be ready for home showings. You never know when a buyer is going to walk through that door, especially since so many schedule showings at the last minute. Before you leave for work each day, make sure that all of your beds are made and that the kitchen and bathrooms are picked up.        Kitchens and bathrooms really do sell homes. Small updates, like new paint or hardware, can make a dated kitchen look like new. Updating to stainless steel appliances or bronze fixtures can make a huge difference to buyers.  âDepersonalize and declutter your house.â      Take the home out of your house. That means you should remove any personal items, like personal photos. Invest in a storage unit and get rid of about a third of your stuff. Pull stuff out of your closets so that they appear half empty. The more open you can make your home, the better it will be for showings.        Conceal animal accessories. Not everyone likes animals in their home. If you have pets, the best rule of thumb is out of sight, out of mind. I also recommend that you get some air fresheners. You might not be able to smell your pets, but buyers will definitely detect the pet odor in your house.        Hire an informed real estate agent with an aggressive marketing plan who will price your home right. Pricing and marketing are key to selling your home, and if you follow the other five tips as well, you can sell for top dollar.

Donât just think about the house you buy, think of it as a house youâll have to sell in the future. Consider the neighborhood, the pricing, and the size. Buying the biggest and best house in the neighborhood could present major issues down the road when selling.        Make sure the house is structurally sound. It should have good windows, doors, floors, and roofing, and should not have water spots on the ceiling or cracks on the inside or outside walls. Look for the house that has the best âgutsâ rather than just looking at the design. Always have a home inspection to make sure youâre not overlooking something that could be a costly headache down the road.        Cost of repairs. Plumbing, heating and cooling, roofing, and water heaters are all very costly systems to repair or replace.

        "content": "While youâre relaxing on a tropical beach or strolling through a quaint European resort during your holiday vacation, thieves could be planning on invading your unoccupied home and ruining more than just the vacation. The good news is that there are five easy steps you can take to make sure that you donât come back to an empty house:      Get a Wi-Fi doorbell. Products like the SkyBell actually videotape any visitors that come to your front door and sync that video to your smartphone so you can keep a watchful eye. Not only are these devices cheap, but they are also easy to install. I would recommend buying one for your home at all timesânot just during vacations.        Utilize exterior lighting. A well-lit property is less likely to be an attractive target for potential intruders. Motion-activated lights that pop on whenever they detect movement are an excellent deterrent. A watchful spotlight will send any unwanted visitors scurrying.        Let your (trusted) neighbors know that youâll be gone. If those that live closest to you know that youâre away, theyâll likely monitor your home for any strange noises or unfamiliar faces skulking about and alert the police is they see any suspicious activity.  âCheck once, check twice, and after that, check one more time.â      Alter your mail and newspaper delivery service. You can either call your mail service provider and temporarily suspend your deliveries or ask one of your neighbors to pick them up for you as they arrive. An overflowing mailbox and a pile of newspapers are sure signs that no one is home.        Double-check that all doors and windows are locked before you leave. Statistics show that roughly 33% of all home invasions happen through an unforced entry, meaning they likely occur through an unlocked door or window. A good rule of thumb is to check once, check twice, and check one more time before you and your family depart. If you have kids, this step is especially important.  Following these steps will help you rest easier while youâre away and ensure that everything is safe and sound when you come back.

        "content": "There are several things you can do to prepare your home to sell in winter. Here are our top three selling tips for this time of year:  Pay close attention to your curb appeal. When it comes to styling your front porch, there is a slippery slope between a nicely decorated porch and a farmerâs market. The idea is to enhance your curb appeal, not obscure it. While too many fall decorations will take the focus off your home and its best features, a few tasteful accents will make your home feel inviting and fresh.You also want to make sure that all of the fallen leaves havenât taken a toll on your yard. Buyers may be understanding if your yard is unkempt because they are dealing with the same thing, but that doesnât mean your home will make a good first impression. Do your best to make sure your yard is neat and tidy before showings.  Go easy on the holiday displays. Tasteful displays will show the home in its best light. Outfitting your home to compete with the Griswolds will make your home a spectacle, but wonât necessarily make it sellable.âKeep the lights on during the short, dark winter days.âSo, let in the light. Always make sure that your blinds are open and the windows are sparkling when trying to sell your home. It is especially important to maximize the light in your home during the shorter days this time of year. Light will make your home look larger, fresher, and highlight your homeâs best features. Place plenty of lamps throughout the home for additional illumination.  Make your space inviting. As the weather cools down, a warm and cozy atmosphere will make the buyers feel at home. Use plush throws on the couch and beds and add fall-accented pillows to your chairs. You can even display fall foliage or seasonal fruit in vases or bowls throughout the home.These tips will definitely help your home appeal to buyers this fall and winter.

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I wanted to share with you the first nine of 17 things you can do to immediately reduce your homeâs energy and maintenance costs as the first installment of a two-part series.      Check the insulation in your attic. Most homes have between six and nine inches of attic insulation, but here in South Texas, you should have 12 to 14 inches for the temperatures we have.        Lower the water temperature to 120 degrees on your water heater. This will save energy and prevent anyone from getting scalded or burned accidentally.        Put a water heater blanket on the water heater to keep the heat in. These blankets are cheap but effective in keeping the heater two to three degrees warmer.        Install ceiling fans in most rooms. This is especially important during the summer to keep air circulating through your house. This will actually keep the house one to two degrees cooler without turning down the thermostat.        Wrap any water pipes with insulation. We find that a lot of water pipesâexterior pipes includedâare exposed since we donât have as many freezing issues like they do up north, but occasionally, it does freeze. This will prevent freezing issues and keep hot water insulated.  âThese things will save you maintenance and energy costs.â      Install a programmable thermostat and learn how to use it. People have reported average savings of 20% to 30% on heating and cooling costs. Nest and Honeywell both make good programmable thermostats.        Replace your air filters. This is especially important in Texas because we use our air conditioning so much. Look on the side of the filter for the dimension and go buy several at a time. Depending on the thickness, you can go 30 days to six months between replacements.        Make sure all vents are clean and clear of dust and obstructions. None of your vents should be covered, because if theyâre blocked, your A/C and heater will have to work overtime to heat and cool the rooms. Dust them off at least once every other month to get rid of allergens and increase airflow.        Check all toilets for constant running and check sinks and plumbing for leaks. A toilet running constantly will cost you money in the long term, and you should also look under the basin of all homes for leaks. Dripping sinks can cause mold and other issues.  All these measures will help save you time and money when it comes to maintenance and energy costs. If you have questions about this topic, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. Stay tuned for part two, where weâll discuss the rest of the items on this list.",

        "content": "There are three questions every buyer should ask themselves:  Why am I buying a home in the first place? This is truly the most important question to ask. Forget about the finances for a minute and focus on the reason youâre considering purchasing a home. For most, the reason has nothing to do with money. A recent survey revealed that 75% of parents said that they were looking for a home because their childâs education is important and they wanted to find a place that supported that primary need. What does owning a home mean to you? What non-financial benefits will you gain from owning a home? The answer to these questions should be the biggest reason that determines whether you should buy a home or not.âA buyer should be concerned with more than just price.â      Where are home values headed? According to the latest home price index, home values are projected to increase by about 5.3% over the next 12 months. Simply put, if youâre planning to purchase a home that costs around $250,000, that same home will cost an additional $13,250 if you wait until next year. Your down payment will have to be higher as well to account for that higher home price.        Where are mortgage interest rates headed? A buyer must be concerned about more than just price. The long-term cost of a home can be dramatically impacted by even the smallest increase in mortgage rates. With rates being historically low right now, itâs a great time to buy and lock in a low rate on a 30-year mortgage so that youâre protected by the lowest possible rate that you can get.

        "content": "If youâre currently renting a property and thinking about making the shift toward owning a home, there are a few things you should consider.When youâre looking to get out of your lease and take advantage of the market, itâs best to start early. Talk to a lender and get that pre-approval process started as soon as possible. You want to find out exactly what your budget is going to be so that you know what youâll be able to afford and what you will be comfortable spending. The key in any transaction is knowing your buying power.If your lease is up in 30 days, you certainly can buy a property, but that is going to be a very challenging transaction on short notice, unless youâre paying cash. Get pre-approved early so that if you have any problems with your credit, you can get them fixed before you buy.You may also need more time to save for a down payment. Itâs best to start looking for homes at least 90 days prior to the end of your lease in order to allow yourself time to find and close on a home. Remember, a lot of things can come up during the buying process. Inventory in San Antonio is very low right now, so finding that perfect place may take longer than expected. Starting everything ahead of time will never hurt your transaction; it can only help.âStarting ahead of time can only help your transaction.âYou may be wondering when you should talk to your landlord about your decision to end your lease. Some landlords may allow you to break your lease early, while others may not be so generous. With rental rates increasing in the San Antonio market, itâs okay to move out â especially if youâve been in the area a long time. We recommend talking with your landlord and checking your lease terms early. Youâll want to determine whether there is an early termination fee or if youâll have to give notice within a certain timeframe. An open conversation with your landlord will really help the transaction go smoothly.Finally, itâs never too early to talk to an agent about what the home buying process looks like. Your agent will help you figure out what your upfront costs, like your down payment, inspection and appraisal costs, are going to be. You should also discuss your timeframe. If youâre making this decision with someone else, it is important to have this discussion early on so that everybody involved in the transaction is on the same page.If you have any questions regarding this or anything else, please give us a call or send us an email.

If you spend more than this amount on the house, you risk becoming âhouse poor,â meaning that you barely have enough money to pay for your house and not enough for much else.âDonât spend more than one-third of your gross income on your house.âItâs also a good idea to keep six to nine months of mortgage payments in the bank, plus a little extra for any repairs that you might need to make. Most Americans donât even have one monthâs payment in savings, so if youâre able to do this, youâll be in very exclusive company.If youâre thinking of buying or selling a home, call or email us today for a free real estate consultation.

        "content": "Buying a home is not just about the money that you spend up front. Itâs also about the rest of the money that you have to spend beyond that.One of the biggest expenses that youâll have to incur on a monthly basis is your property taxes. Youâll want to find out, then, what your monthly property tax rate will be before you purchase the home. Additionally, itâs also a good idea to ask the seller before you purchase for copies of their utility bills from the previous 12 months so that you know what they will cost, you and you can budget accordingly.âWe always recommend that you get a home warranty.âAnother thing that might factor into extra ending costs is if there is a homeowners association fee. Whether itâs monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually, youâre going to want to know what that will cost as well.If youâre going to furnish the property, you need to make sure you have a budget for that. Finally, if youâre buying a home thatâs a little bit older, you need to budget for more than the normal amount of upkeep. This is why we always recommend that you get a home warranty on a home when you purchase it.If youâre thinking about buying or selling a home, call or email us today for a free real estate consultation.

The short answer is probably, but it really depends where your property is located.For example, a house outside city limits probably wonât need a permit for most of these additions if there is no Homeowners Association. However, if the house is in an HOA, there are likely building restrictions and application requirements you need to go through in order to get these projects approved.âIf you are in an HOA or inside city limits, you will most likely need to obtain permits.âIf you are inside the city limits, you will definitely need to obtain the necessary permits from the appropriate entities in order to make those additions to your home.If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Your kitchen is the heart of your home, and buyers will always gravitate towards it during a showing. Before you sell your home, you can squeeze out a little extra money by investing in some kitchen repairs. Here are a few things you can do that wonât require an entire remodel of your kitchen but will still net you a decent return.      Amp up your appliances. Buyers want to see upgraded stoves, ovens, microwaves, and refrigerators. Stainless steel is all the rage right now, and it looks great when all of the appliances match.        Refresh your cabinets with a new coat of paint. White is a nice touch and it can brighten up your kitchen for a welcoming feel.        New countertops are always great. This is especially true if you still have laminate or vinyl. There are many cost-effective alternatives to granite that have the same look and feel.  âSmall changes in the kitchen can bring big returns.â      New flooring is also something that can change the look and feel of your kitchen. Tile is preferable, and shoot for 18x18 instead of 12x12. Wood floors are also desirable.        An updated faucet is always a nice edition. Go for oil-rubbed bronze or brushed nickel.  An updated kitchen will certainly attract buyers. You know that people gravitate towards the kitchen in a home, so pay attention to yours. It might be as simple as replacing knobs on cabinets. You would be surprised what just a few small changes can do for the overall feel of your home.Please contact me or anyone on my team. Weâre willing to come see your home and suggest improvements that will bring you the maximum return on your investment.",
