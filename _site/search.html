        "content": "This past year has been recognized as one of Utahâs best real estate markets ever. Iâve got a quick update for you to let you know whatâs happening right now and what you can expect for the rest of the year. Weâll look at both national and local numbers to get the best picture possible.Realtor.com has recently placed Provo, Orem, and Salt Lake City among the top 25 markets to watch. A big reason for this is because last year we had 15,000 people move into the state of Utah. A lot of them had high-earning jobs. With a strong economy, low employment, and one of the highest demographics for millennials in the country, we are going to see prices increase.From the first quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of 2017, we have seen a 12% increase in home values. Thatâs a big jump, and theyâre expected to go up by another 5% this year. For those of you worried about the market going into the toilet anytime soon, itâs not going to happen.âHome values have increased by 12% since 2015.âIf you are a buyer this year, I would suggest coming in with your highest and best offer from the start. If youâre a seller, donât get too greedy. Make sure your home is priced right because those properties are going under contract in less than two weeks in most cases.The average days on market right now for active homes is between 30 and 40. This is telling me some sellers are pricing a little too high. Like I said before, those homes should be selling within a few weeks.If you have any questions about the market or what you can expect from it in the coming months, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "If youâre buying an older home, you may be shocked the first time you receive a water bill. Older homes donât always have the latest in water-saving devices. Some even have a few water-gobbling features!The good news? A lot of these problems can be fixed quickly and cheaply.Hereâs what to look out for:Little leaks.Â Always keep an eye for a leak! A dripping faucet can send up to 20 gallons of water down the drain every day. This is the first place to start when checking for waste. Change the washers on your sinks or keep the old ones but make sure that they are all well-maintained.Inefficient shower heads.Â Putting in new, water-saving shower heads can have a big impact on your bill. Look for low-flow shower heads that average 2.5 gallons or less per minute.Problem toilets.Â Do this food coloring test. In your toilet tank, put some drops of food coloring. If the color begins to appear in the bowl within 30 minutes without flushing, you have a leak that should be repaired immediately. Older toilets can use a lot more water than newer models, especially if an older one has a leak. Take a few minutes to inspect each toilet; you can typically hear and see evidence of leaks. Dual-flush and low-flush toilets can save a great deal of water and money.Check the water meter.If there is no water being used, the water meter should have the same reading after two hours. Â If the meter does not read exactly the same, there is a leak.Another good way to save?Talk to your water company. Many municipalities have water-saving programs and incentives that can save you money. In some cases, they may be able to determine if you need a water pressure regulator, which could help cut down on your water use.",

The two components of your monthly mortgage payment (home prices and interest rates) are both projected to increase as the year moves forward, and interest rates may increase rather dramatically. Here are some predictions on where rates will be by the end of the year:HSH.com:âWe think that conforming 30-year fixed rates probably make it into the 4.625 percent to 4.75 percent range at some point during 2017 as a peak.âSvenja Gudell, Zillowâs Chief Economist:âI wouldnât be surprised if the 30-year fixed mortgage rate hits 4.75 percent.âMark Fleming, the Chief Economist at First American:Â â[I see] mortgage rates getting much closer to 5 percent at the end of next year.âLawrence Yun, NAR Chief Economist:âBy this time next year, expect the 30-year fixed rate to likely be in the 4.5 percent to 5 percent range.âBottom LineIf you are feeling good about your familyâs economic future and are considering making a move to your dream home, doing it sooner rather than later makes the most sense!",

        "content": "Can low interest rates affect your purchasing power? How exactly?According to Freddie Macâs latest Primary Mortgage Market Survey, interest rates for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage are currently around 4%, which is still very low in comparison to recent history!The interest rate you secure when buying a home not only greatly impacts your monthly housing costs, but also impacts your purchasing power.Purchasing power, simply put, is the amount of home you can afford to buy for the budget you have available to spend. As rates increase, the price of the house you can afford will decrease if you plan to stay within a certain monthly housing budget.The chart below shows what impact rising interest rates would have if you planned to purchase a home within the national median price range, and planned to keep your principal and interest payments at or about $1,100 a month.With each quarter of a percent increase in interest rate, the value of the home you can afford decreases by 2.5%, (in this example, $6,250). Experts predict that mortgage rates will be closer to 5% by this time next year.It will be really wise to act NOW and get that dream house for your hard-earned money.",

According to the report, 76% of Americans either donât know (40%) or are misinformed (36%) about the minimum down payment required.Many believe that they need at least 20% down to buy their dream home, but many programs actually let buyers put down as little as 3%.On the right are the results of a Digital Risk survey of Millennials who recently purchased a home.

        "category": "",
        "content": "So you made an offer, it was accepted, andÂ  now your next task is to have the homeÂ  inspected prior to closing. More often thanÂ  not, your agent may have made your offerÂ  contingent on a clean home inspection.This contingency allows you to renegotiateÂ  the price paid for the home, ask the sellersÂ  to cover repairs, or even, in some cases, walkÂ  away. Your agent can advise you on the bestÂ  course of action once the report is filed.Now, what to expect when home inspecting?How to Choose an InspectorYour agent will most likely have a short list of inspectors that they have worked with in theÂ  past that they can recommend to you. Realtor.com suggests that you consider the following 5Â  areas when choosing the right home inspector for you:QualificationsÂ â Find out whatâs included in your inspection &amp; if the age or location of your home may warrant specific certifications or specialties.Sample ReportsÂ â Ask for a sample inspection report so you can review how thoroughlyÂ  they will be inspecting your dream home. The more detailed the report the better inÂ  most cases.ReferencesÂ â Do your homework. Ask for phone numbers and names of past clients thatÂ  you can call to ask about their experience.MembershipsÂ â Not all inspectors belong to a national or state association of homeÂ  inspectors, and membership in one of these groups should not be the only way toÂ  evaluate your choice. Often membership in one of these organizations means that there isÂ  continued training and education provided.Errors &amp; Omission InsuranceÂ â Find out what the liability of the inspector or inspection company is once the inspection is over. The inspector is only human after all, and it is possible that they might miss something they should have seen.Ask your inspector if itâs okay for you to tag along during the inspection. That way they can point out anything that should be addressed or fixed.Donât be surprised to see your inspector climbing on the roof, crawling around in the attic,Â  and on the floors. The job of the inspector is to protect your investment and find any issuesÂ  with the home, including but not limited to:  roof  plumbing  electrical components  appliances  heating &amp; air conditioning systems  ventilation  windows  fireplace &amp;Â  chimney  the foundation &amp; so much more!Bottom LineThey say âignorance is bliss,â but not when investing your hard-earned money in a home ofÂ  your own. Work with a professional you can trust to give you the most information possibleÂ  about your new home so that you can make the most educated decision about your purchase.",

        "content": "Have you put aside enough for closing costs?There are many potential homebuyers, and even sellers, who believe that you need at least aÂ  20% down payment in order to buy a home, or move on to their next home. Time after time,Â  we have dispelled this myth by showing that there are many loan programs that allow you toÂ  put down as little as 3% (or 0% with a VA loan).If you have saved up your down payment and are ready to start your home search, one otherÂ  piece of the puzzle is to make sure that you have saved enough for your closing costs.Freddie Mac defines closing costs as:âClosing costs, also called settlement fees, will need to be paid when you obtain aÂ  mortgage. These are fees charged by people representing your purchase, including Â your lender, real estate agent, and other third parties involved in the transaction.Closing costs are typically between 2 and 5% of your purchase price.Weâve recently heard from many first-time homebuyers that they wished that someone hadÂ  let them know that closing costs could be so high. If you think about it, with a low downÂ  payment program, your closing costs could equal the amount that you saved for your downÂ  payment.Here is a list of just some of the fees/costs that may be included in your closing costs,Â  depending on where the home you wish to purchase is located:  Government recording costs  Appraisal fees  Credit report fees  Lender origination fees  Title services (insurance, search fees)  Tax service fees  Survey fees  Attorney fees  Underwriting feesIs there any way to avoid paying closing costs?Work with your lender and real estate agent to see if there are any ways to decrease or deferÂ  your closing costs. There are no-closing mortgages available, but they end up costing youÂ  more in the end with a higher interest rate, or by wrapping the closing costs into the totalÂ  cost of the mortgage (meaning youâll end up paying interest on your closing costs).Home buyers can also negotiate with the seller over who pays these fees. Sometimes the seller will agree to assume the buyerâs closing fees in order to get the deal finalized.Bottom LineSpeak with your lender and agent early and often to determine how much youâll beÂ  responsible for at closing. Finding out youâll need to come up with thousands of dollars rightÂ  before closing is not a surprise anyone is ever looking forward to.",

        "content": "Weâre going to have a good year. The question is: will it be a great year?Consumer confidence is through the roof. That means people are feeling good about the economy. Theyâre feeling good about their own personal finances. And that means that people are going to be moving out of the house theyâre currently in, moving into a bigger home, maybe downsizing where they are and buying a vacation home, either in the mountains or on the water. Things are going toâ¦ People just feel good right now. Now, part of the reason, as weâll explain in some of these news clips, that people are feeling good, is that after the election, they see the country going in a very positive direction.Consumer confidence is at a good place. People feel good about their own finances. People feel good about making a move right now. People feel good about where they stand, better thanâ¦ better since 2004.American households are expecting a Donald Trump administration to deliver. Consumers are more upbeat about the prospects of the economy, labor market, and their incomes. Itâs a time right now that people are going to be making moves. Theyâre going to jump into their first house.The biggest challenge we have going into 2017 is a whole bunch of people that want to buy a home. And not enough homes to sell. Itâs crucialâ¦ Â It has been said now for eight months, that if, unless the housing inventory will be fixed, weâre not going to be able to take full advantage of the market weâre in right now.Prices are continuing to escalate. It means people have more equity. And the equity in their home is something they should be able to do something with.Thereâs equity in a house. That equity they could use. They can use that equity to move down to where they currently are living where they might still have family or finishing up the last couple of years of the job and take the additional equity and buy that vacation home that eventually will be their retirement home.A lot of people did refinance, some to a fifteen-year loan. Â That means theyâre building more equity every single month. And that equity is important for what reason? That means that they will sell their house and make a good financial decision.They can make the move now that they planned to make in retirement. And now is a better time than waiting until then. If we look at the percentage of homes with positive equity by state, we can see that 93.7% of all the homes in this country with a mortgage on itâ¦ Remember one third donât even have a mortgage on it. Weâre talking about the other close to 70%. Ninety-three-point seven percent of that other 70% have positive equity now.Thereâs enough equity in your home, that if you ever dreamt about moving. Instead of living around the corner from the water, Â but moving to the water. Instead of staying in the four-bedroom colonial now that the kids have moved out, you can downsize and use that additional equity, either to put it into the stock market or put it into another piece of real estate that youâre going to use later in your life.What people believe their house is worth and what theyâre getting appraised for are much, much closer now. So, we donât really have to worry about pricing. People have got the right price. The sellers got the right price in their head. Thereâs plenty of buyers out there. What we need to watch out for is the number of Â listings the market needs.Foot traffic is an indicator of how many houses people actually will go to see. The reason foot traffic is down is not because thereâs less people going out. And the challenge is the buyers donât have any houses to go see in some markets or very few. Thatâs why that number is down.SmartAsset.com, just this past month, had an article about housing. And this is what they said, whether youâre preparing to purchase a new home or sell an old house in the new year, itâs important to know how housing trends could affect you. Keeping your finger on the pulse of the market can prevent you from being left out of the cold by rising interest rates or a widening gap between supply and demand.You need to know! Whether you want to buy or sell, you need to know exactly whatâs happening. Thatâs why we do. You need someone you can trust for up-to-date information, and we are here to help you.",

        "content": "READY TO MAKE AN OFFER? 4 TIPS FOR SUCCESSSo youâve been searching for that perfect house to call a âhomeâ and you finally found one! The price is right, and in such a competitive market you want to make sure you make a good offer so that you can guarantee your dream of making this house yours comes true!Freddie Mac covered â4 Tips for Making an Offerâ in their latest Executive Perspective. Here are the 4 tips they covered along with some additional information for your consideration:1. Understand How Much You Can AffordâWhile itâs not nearly as fun as house hunting, fully understanding your finances is critical in making an offer.âThis âtipâ or âstepâ really should take place before you start your home search process.Getting pre-approved is one of many steps that will show home sellers that you are serious about buying, and will allow you to make your offer with the confidence of knowing that you have already been approved for a mortgage for that amount. You will also need to know if you are prepared to make any repairs that may need to be made to the house (ex: new roof, new furnace).2. Act FastâEven though there are fewer investors, the inventory of homes for sale is also low and competition for housing continues to heat up in many parts of the country.âThe inventory of homes listed for sale has remained well below the 6-month supply that is needed for a ânormalâ market. Buyer demand has continued to outpace the supply of homes for sale, causing buyers to compete with each other for their dream home.Make sure that as soon as you decide that you want to make an offer, you work with your agent to present it as soon as possible.3. Make a Solid OfferFreddie Mac offers this advice to help make your offer the strongest it can be:âYour strongest offer will be comparable with other sales and listings in the neighborhood. A licensed real estate agent active in the neighborhoods you are considering will be instrumental in helping you put in a solid offer based on their experience and other key considerations such as recent sales of similar homes, the condition of the house and what you can afford.âConsider ways of making your offer stand out! Many buyers write a personal letter to the seller letting them know how much they would love to be the new homeowners. Your agent will be able to help you figure out if there are any other ways your offer could stand above the rest.4. Be Prepared to NegotiateâItâs likely that youâll get at least one counteroffer from the sellers so be prepared. The two things most likely to be negotiated are the selling price and closing date. Given that, youâll be glad you did your homework first to understand how much you can afford.Your agent will also be key in the negotiation process, giving you guidance on the counteroffer and making sure that the agreed-to contract terms are met.âIf your offer is approved, Freddie Mac urges you to âalways get an independent home inspection, so you know the true condition of the home. If the inspection uncovers undisclosed problems or issues, you can typically re-negotiate the terms or cancel the contract.âBottom LineWhether buying your first home or your fifth, having a local real estate professional who is an expert in their market on your side is your best bet to make sure the process goes smoothly.

Your trees and bushes will lose their leaves, so you need to make the house look as good as you can from a curb appeal perspective since your home might not look as good in the winter as it will in the spring or summer.You can also help out your entrance by painting the front door and taking a look at the weather stripping. This is especially important in the winter when selling because you donât want a buyer walking in your home and feeling a big draft immediately after.Since itâs the holiday season, go easy on the displays. Some pumpkins and gourds are nice for Halloween and Thanksgiving, but you need to know the difference between decorating for the festivities and making your house look like a farmers market. As for Christmasâyou donât need to compete with the Griswolds, you just need to keep it tasteful. Buyers want to enter a home and feel like they could see themselves living there, so donât overdo it.âFocus on making your living space comfortable and inviting.âNext,Â focus on making your living space comfortable and inviting.Â After living in your house for so long, you forget what itâs like; itâs like sign-blindness in that you see things so often that you forget that they are there. Invite over a friend who can be candid with you and give you an opinion on the furniture and clutter situation in your house. You want your space to be open and bright. Keep the windows open and sparkling clean, and get some lamps to add light indoors if need be.If you have a fireplace, donât forget to clean the covering, especially if itâs glass. You want buyers to come in and feel a nice, cozy fire and not see a dingy screen. If you have a wood-burning fireplace, clean out all the ashes and paint the back if necessary, as well as stacking the logs nicely for an inviting situation. It just gives a warm feel.Finally, use the holiday scents to your advantage.

Are you prepared to make some compromises?Â Itâs important to know things like the areas you want to live in, the square footage youâre comfortable with, and how long you planning on living at the home in question. If itâs your first home, you have to figure out what you can live with.3. Are you emotionally ready?Â If you can manage those aforementioned compromises, youâll be in far better shape in answering this question.&lt;a href=âhttps://twitter.com/home/?status=âIf you own a home, youâre free to do what you want.â%20http://theutahhomesteam.com/5-questions-you-need-to-ask-yourself-before-buying-a-home.html%20via%40â target=â_blankâ class=âpullquoteâ&gt;ââIf you own a home, youâre free to do what you want.ââ&lt;/a&gt;4. Will owning a home pay off in the long run?Â If youâre going to live in the home for less than two years, thereâs a good chance itâs not worth buying. If youâre going to be there longer, not only will you build some equity in the home, but youâll also get a good tax deduction from the mortgage interest.5. Has your lifestyle outgrown your rental property?Â Maybe you want to get a dog but your landlord wonât allow it. Maybe you want to paint a wall a certain color or tear one out completely to make your kitchen bigger. If you live in a rental, you have to adjust your lifestyle accordingly. If you own a home, youâre free to do what you want.If you have any questions on this topic or have a topic in mind youâd like to see me discuss in a future video, feel free to reach out to me by phone or email.

        "content": "There are many Realtors out there for you to choose from. How do you know which Realtor you should work with?First of all, you need to work with someone who really cares.Â Look for a Realtor who has the heart of a teacher. They will come in prepared to discuss the current market and explain how your choices will impact you down the road.You need a Realtor who will be a strategic partner with you, someone who will map out a plan. Your Realtor should be your trusted advisor. A good real estate agent can give you advice and good news, but a great agent knows how to deliver the bad news whether you want to hear it or not.As you go through the home buying process, itâs important to work with someone that youâre comfortable with and confident in. Your Realtor should be someone that you want to have lunch with, but they should also pay attention to you and listen throughout the process.âLook for a Realtor who has the heart of a teacher.âMy favorite movie as a kid was The Swiss Family Robinson. In the movie, the family dug some pits and covered them up, hoping to catch some wild animals. A fierce, ferocious tiger came along, saw some meat, reached out to get it, and fell in the pit. The same thing can happen to home buyers and sellers.Sometimes, we get too excited about a house or an offer and forget to look around us, so we end up getting trapped.Â You need to work with a trusted advisor who knows how to avoid those pitfalls.We can certainly help you do that. If you have any questions, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!",

Hereâs what Fannie Mae suggests to sellers on the âKnow Your Optionsâ section of their website:âSelect how youâll market and list the home (e.g., with a real estate agent or for sale by owner). There are pros and cons to each, but unless you are experienced at selling homes, it usually makes financial sense to get professional helpâhomes sold by agents typically sell at a higher price and spend less time on the market. An agent will also help you determine the best pricing for the house, theyâll market the home, and theyâll be your advocate throughout the process.âLetâs go over the points they made:â¢ Homes sold by agents typically sell at a higher priceâ¢ Homes sold by agents typically spend less time on the marketâ¢ An agent will help you determine the best pricing for the houseâ¢ An agent will market the homeâ¢ An agent will be your advocate throughout the processIf Fannie Mae says that using an agent probably makes sense, perhaps you should interview an agent before putting your house up for sale.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "There are a lot of things that homeownership brings to communities. Homeownership provides social benefits beyond pure financial economic benefits.Young people that grow up in a situation with homeownership, theyâre in a different place than those people that are not. Itâs not saying that every renterâs kid is not going to go well in school, have a drug problem, and commit a crime. But the stability of owning a home and everything that brings, helps, gives kids an advantage. Why not give as many of those kids an advantage as you possibly can.Homeowners are more likely to be involved in a community. Studies have shown this. Academic studies have shown this. Civic engagements, local elections, and volunteer work compared to renters, again, with other things being equal. That not only makes sense, we call it pride of ownership.If you own a house in a neighborhood, you just care more about that house than if youâre going to be transient and rent, then rent the next neighborhood or the next city in two years from now. You get more involved because youâre putting roots down there.This has been an argument for the last couple of years. People who own homes have an equity they can tap into, and perhaps when their children, their teenage children, decide that theyâre going to go to college.Well, people that are homeowners can help their kids out with that. They can look their kids in the eye and say, âAre you worth the investment? Is it worth me taking money out of the house to invest in you?â And so many parents see that yes, it is. And thatâs what the study from Boston Federal Reserve shows. Homeownersâ children â the income of homeownersâ children rises as values rise. The more theyâre able to invest in their kids, the better future their kids have.Again, we donât list and sell houses for a living.Â We change peopleâs lives for a living.Â We do it by listing and selling homes.",

        "title": "Should You Sell Your Home This Fall? Five Reasons Why You Should!",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "The fall real estate market is upon us. Should you sell your home now or wait for spring? Here are five reasons why you should consider listing your home now:1. Demand is very strong right now.Â There is a lot of pent-up demand out there. People have been wanting to sell their homes for a long time and they are finally able to do it. There are also a lot of buyers who have been sitting in rentals and waiting for their credit to be cleaned up and are now ready to go. Not only that, a lot of people want to get into their new homes before the holidays.2. There is less competition.Â Although people want to get into their new homes for the holidays, you donât have to worry about that summer crowd full of people who are just shopping around. Buyers wonât have to compete with 10, 15, or 20 other offers â instead, if youâre buying a home, you may only face off against one or two other people. Buyers in the fall are also more serious about purchasing a home.3. The whole process can be quicker in the fall.Â In the summer, many people run into underwriting and closing issues at the end of the month. Since there are fewer people in the market, underwriters, processors, and title companies are able to move a bit quicker, ensuring a smoother process for you.4. It is a good time to buy a home right now.Â CoreLogic projects that property values will go up 5.3% this coming year. If youâve been thinking about selling your current home and moving up into a bigger one, now is a good time to do so and capitalize on that appreciation. By this time next year, interest rates will be about 0.5% higher. This combination adds a lot of money to your bottom line immediately and will compound over time.5. What are your reasons for moving? Consider why you are selling your house. Is it time for you to move closer to family or closer to work? Do you need to move up or downsize? If now is the time to sell your home and buy another, donât wait for spring. Your reason for moving is the most important reason to consider buying or selling this fall.If you have any other questions about the fall market or about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!Â Â ",
