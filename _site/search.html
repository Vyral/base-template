        "content": "Welcome to the latest episode of âWhatâs Working Now!âToday, I want to share a successful under-the-radar strategy for selling a home that worked in the middle of the holidays.Plus, if you are thinking of selling your home in 2018, I have something special to share with you.Now, we recently sold a home about a week before Christmas. When I met with the homeowner to talk about cleaning, sorting, staging, and making the house market-ready, she looked like she was going to cry. So, we decided on a different strategy.We decided to show the home before it was ready for the market. The market is full of buyers, interest rates are low, and inventory is so low that there is practically nothing for sale. In the last couple of weeks, weâve had eight buyers that wanted to buy two houses.âInventory is incredibly low right now, which means there is almost no competition for sellers.âWe went ahead and advertised this particular property under the radar to my network of prospects, agents, and the neighborhood. One of the neighbors had a friend who wanted to look at the house. This was the only person we showed the property to, and they turned out to be the right buyer.If you are thinking of selling your home in 2018, there is no need to wait for the azaleas to be in bloom. The seller I just told you about entered the market in the middle of the holiday season. The market is hot right now. Inventory is incredibly low, so there is almost no competition.Find an agent who can take advantage of current market conditions to make it easy for you to get top dollar fast.If you plan on selling your house in 2018, check out my new book, âSelling Secrets You Canât Afford to Miss.â To get your free copy, visit DCHomeblog.com/FreeBook.Thank you for watching âWhatâs Working Now!â Be on the lookout for our next video, where Iâll look back on the 2017 market and go over what you can expect in 2018.Of course, if you have any other questions in the meantime, please donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Welcome to another episode of âWhatâs Working Now!âÂ Today I want to talk about the value of negotiating experience and expertise, especially when sellers get multiple offers.Â Let me give you an example. We recently put a house on the market on a Friday. By Sunday, it had five offers, and we sold the house Sunday evening.Â Your agent needs to be able to talk to the buyer agents about how to write a good offer in the first place. Once the house is on the market and has had a couple of showings, the agents start calling me and asking, âWhen are you presenting offers? How are you doing this or that?âAt that time, I take the opportunity to discuss with those agents how I would like them to write their offer. I say, âThe seller would really appreciate a settlement date of X. The seller would really appreciate a short home inspection contingency or none at all. If your offer is going to have a financing contingency, the seller would appreciate seeing a financial information sheet, not just a lender letter.âI give the agents instructions to bring us what we want: a big number, a short settlement date, and a big, fat deposit from a well-qualified buyer. If possible, we want that from five different buyers if we can get it.Â So last weekend, I put the word out to these agents and told them exactly what we wanted. I even said, âI know there will be other offers on this property. Rather than doing an escalation clause, which says âIf someone makes me pay more, Iâll pay more,â just come in and say âI will pay more. I will give you this and take out that contingency.â That way, your buyer will have a better chance of winning the home, so please make your offer like that.âÂ After I talked to these five agents, I got two offers that were really low and had all kinds of contingencies. Those two offers were no good. I got three offers with really big numbers, so I called those three agents and coached them on how to make their offers better while I was sitting with the seller.âI reach out and coach the agents on what the seller wants in an offer.âAny other real estate agent might have looked at those three offers, picked the best one, and sent it over for you to sign. They would probably say something like, âWe got five offers! Look at what someone was willing to pay for your home! Here, sign this one.âÂ For me and my clients, thatâs not good enough. I take it the extra step. Once I get the offers, I take the best ones and have a conversation with the agents about how they can improve the offers if they want a better chance at winning.Â In this case, two of the buyers increased their price, while the other took out the financing contingency and the appraisal contingency. I was able to get one buyer and one back-up buyer for my seller.Â The first buyer called their home inspector, came into the property, and immediately got cold feet. That buyer wound up walking away from the transaction.Â Luckily, we had a backup buyer in place. I didnât have to change the status of the property and say, âThis deal fell apart and the house is now back on the market.â Instead, the home remained under contract, and the second buyer got the chance to slip in and get the house without renegotiating. It was a win-win for that buyer and for my seller.Â We just had the inspection today, and everything looks good so far.Â When you sell your home, make sure that you work with a listing agent who will price the home correctly and make it look good enough to get all those people in the door. That agent will be able to create the opportunity for multiple offers.Â Your agent also needs to be good enough to coach the buyer agents on how to make those offers into something that will get a better outcome for you.Â If your home is priced well, looks good, and you have an agent who is an excellent negotiator, you will end up with a win.Â To learn more about selling your home, make sure to watch the Home Seller Half Hour this week. Sign up here to learn everything you need to know in less than 30 minutes.Â Thank you for watching âWhatâs Working Now!â Next time, Iâll cover some of the coolest things happening in our red-hot real estate market.Â Meanwhile, if you have any other real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!",

        "content": "Welcome to the latest episode of âWhatâs Working Now!âÂ Today, I want to talk to you about an innovative way to generate additional buyer activity when selling your home.Â For example, we have a new listing that is getting market-ready. The seller is moving boxes around, packing, cleaning, and gardening so that the house is ready to hit the market in the next couple of weeks.Â The seller had the idea that they would like to invite their friends over to say goodbye to the house. We picked a day on the weekend and invited them over in the middle of the day while the sun was out and the friends all got to take a look at the house.Â I thought it was a really good idea. Then we started talking about other ideas weâve used on past properties to market the home to the sellerâs community.Â When it comes time to market your home, I have a network of 3,500 real estate agents, 2,000 prospects, and a neighborhood listserv of 20,000 of my closest friends.Â In the past, Iâve also had the sellers send my ad with the video tour of their home out to their own listservs.Â Think about it. You may have a network of fellow college alumni, other parents from your kidâs high school, or you may belong to a church, synagogue, or music group. You may have your own âlistservâ right on your own street.Â âDo you know anyone who might have a buyer for your house?âIf you take this ad and send it out to your friends, you can tap into a whole new pool of people. As a seller, your friends might know someone who would be interested in purchasing your house.Â Iâve also had past sellers send the ad to their Facebook friends.Â Basically, I show my sellers the examples of the ad and tell them about the networks and publications that I will send the ad to. Then, I say, âIf you have a group of people or friends who might know someone interested in your property, why donât we tap into those people as well?Â If the seller isnât sure, then I let it go. If they think itâs a great idea, we talk about their Facebook, their neighborhood listserv, or any newsletters they may send out as part of their job or other organizations they may belong to.Â By sending out the ad to the sellerâs network, we are tapping into even more people than I would ever have access to, which is great.Â I also have the seller make a video showing off their home. The seller walks around and talks about family dinners, the wedding in the front yard, and the attic the kids used to play hide and seek in. I make the video look like a really nice home video.Â Recently, before I could even offer, the owner said to me, âHow about I send this video to my friends?âÂ I thought, what a great idea! We are doing just that with a new listing this week.Â When getting ready to sell your house, make sure that you work with an agent who has some of these creative ideas. Think about who you know who may know a buyer for your house.Â Learn more about the value of getting your home ready for the real estate market. Be sure to watch the Home Seller Half Hour this week.

        "content": "Welcome to the latest episode of âWhatâs Working Now!âÂ Iâm recording live from 4550 Klingle Street NWÂ in Wesley Heights. Today, I want to discuss the value of backup contracts for both buyers and sellers.Â First of all, what is a backup contract?Â Letâs say you have accepted an offer from a buyer already but there is another buyer who wanted the house. Maybe they were too late to make an offer or they lost out in a multiple offer situation. This buyer can write a backup offer.Â Basically, the backup offer says that if the first buyer backs out, you will agree to be the buyer at this price and these terms.Â How does the backup offer benefit you as a seller?Â Letâs say you have a buyer already. They do the home inspection and decide not to purchase the house after all and get a release signed. If you have a backup offer in place, then you can automatically start working with that buyer. You donât have to put the home back on the market and spend time advertising the property againâyou just move on to the next buyer.Â âIf the seller has to relist the home, the buyer will face more competition again.âHow does the backup offer benefit you as a buyer?Â If you really want this house but it already went under contract, you can submit a backup offer in case the deal falls through. Without a backup offer, the house will go back on the market and advertised to more buyers, which gives you more competition. You may lose the house a second time if you wait for it to come back on the market.Â If you submit a backup offer and the deal falls through, then the house will automatically go to you.Â You may also end up paying less for the property. Letâs say you didnât get the house in the first place due to multiple offers. You had to escalate your price and you still lost. As a backup offer, you might have a different contract at a different price.Â Whether you are buying or selling a home, make sure that you work with an agent who understands the value of the backup contract.Â You can learn more about the value of getting your home market ready by watching the Home Seller Half Hour this week.

        "content": "Welcome to another episode of âWhatâs Working Now!âÂ Iâm recording live from our new listing at 4550 Klingle St. NW at Wesley Heights.Â I also want to discuss one of the smartest things a seller can do: price reductions. Â How do you know if you need a price reduction? There are two main things to look for.Â First of all, letâs say you have a brand-new listing in a hot market. If no one calls and there are no showings, whatâs wrong? Is the market bad? Is the market slow? No. Buyers respond to price, condition, and location. If the price of your home isnât right for its condition or location, then the phone isnât going to ring.Â So, one of the signs that you may need a price reduction is when no one calls or asks questions about your brand-new listing.Â On the other hand, you may have 20 or 25 people come in for a showing. They look at your house, say that it looks great, but no one makes an offer. This tells you that there is no urgency to make an offer on this product in this location at the current price.Â âIf no one calls to ask about your home, you may want to consider a price reduction.âSo what do you do? Â It usually falls to the agent to recommend a price reduction. Go to the computer to take some notes. Pay attention to what has sold over the last two weeks while your house has been sitting on the market.Â Then, call your seller to let them know what youâve found. Show that no one is looking at the home even though four listings in the area have sold in the last two weeks. Use the statistics to make the case that they need to have the price reduction.Â If the seller doesnât believe you, look to a partner, manager, or someone else in the office to back you up. Find a CEO or presidentâsomeone who will understand that the price needs to be reduced. Give them the statistics and have them write a letter for you to pass along to your client.Â Iâve done this with my partner, and itâs been very effective. In fact, I just did this a week ago. My partner wrote a letter to the seller backing up my recommendation for a price reduction. The sellers agreed. Soon after the price reduction, they got two offers and sold the house. The inspection went through and they are heading to the closing table next week.Â If you would like to learn more about selling your home in the current market, click here to sign up for the Seller Half Hour Seminar online.

The house opened on a Sunday afternoon and sold the next day.I want to talk about how high touch still beats this high tech deal killer known as virtual staging.You know how I feel about home staging and how important it is to my sellers. In some cases, staging has helped my sellers net an extra $100,000 or $200,000.So, whatâs wrong with virtual staging? After all, itâs easier and cheaper.The problem is that virtual staging is a recipe for disaster. You may dazzle prospective buyers online only to disappoint them in person. Itâs like going to an online dating site, finding an appealing partner, and upon meeting them in person, discover that their online photo must have been taken 25 years ago on a really good day.âVirtual staging is a recipe for disaster.âStaging is all about how you make the buyer feel the moment they step inside your home. You donât want them to feel deceived.In short, virtual staging is penny wise and pound foolish, with one notable exception.Letâs say you canât afford to stage your home to get top dollar and your home doesnât look like a million bucks. If some buyers are interested but not jumping, thatâs when you unveil the possibilities for your home with virtual staging. Only do this after the buyers have already seen the house. In this instance, they just need a little nudge.Honestly, Iâve never tried virtual staging. If the right occasion arose, I would give it a shot.

This home is on the market for $1.695 million.You all know how I feel about staging, and something happened at the Garfield house that demonstrates exactly how important staging is.In many cases, home staging has helped my sellers net an extra $100,000. Sometimes, though, a motivated buyer will get a sneak preview before the house is ready.I invited an agent and her prospective buyers over to the Garfield house. She was working with a family of four. They came into the dining room. The sellers had their wedding guest list on the wall. The agent noticed it and couldnât take her eyes off of it, and she told her buyers, âCome over here and see whoâs invited to the wedding.ââMake sure you pack away personal items before listing your home for sale.âThere were also a number of personal photos and other wedding memorabilia in the dining room. It turns out that the buyers were so distracted by all of these personal items that they never really looked at the house.After that, we came in and made sure to pack away all personal photos that were in that dining room. The kitchen walls were brown and covered in pictures as well, so we cleared everything away, opened up the windows, and made the house clean and shiny.As you can see, staging your home makes a huge difference.To learn more about the value of preparing your home for the market, you can sign up here to watch our Seller Half Hour seminar online.

        "content": "Welcome to another episode ofÂ âWhatâs Working Now!âOur market is crazy right now. Thereâs practically no supply and demand is skyrocketing. It seems like everyone wants to buy a house.As a seller, how do you get the most money for your home in this kind of market?You may think that since your house is the only one for sale in your neighborhood, you can price it as high as you want. After all, someone has to buy it if itâs the only home available, right?Actually, I recommend using pinpoint pricing if you want to get top dollar for your home.I recently sold a house in North Cleveland Park. The seller wanted to get at least $1.2 million for the home, but I wasnât sure that buyers would be willing to pay $1.2 million for the home. I told the seller that we should use pinpoint pricing and price the home just under $1.2 million. That way, buyers would be excited about the property and overbid.Instead of going right to pinpoint pricing, we decided to play with it for a couple of weeks. We sent the house out to my network of 3,500 local real estate agents and 2,000 prospects. We also placed a couple of ads in neighborhood listservs and some local publications. The home was advertised at $1.2 million.âPricing the home slightly under market value will help you sell for top dollar.âUltimately, nobody jumped up and expressed interest for the home. At that point, we decided to pinpoint that number in order to get a lot of people in the door and excited about the property.We put the listing on the MLS at $1.15 million on the first day and the seller wound up accepting an offer of $1.29 million, which is way above that first number we advertised.Advertising the home at $1.2 million put the home above comparable properties, which is why buyers didnât make an offer.Â Once we pinpointed the pricing, the seller was able to net more than they expected in the first place.Thank you for watching âWhatâs Working Now!â Stay tuned for our next video, where Iâll go over creative solutions for challenges in todayâs market.P.S.

        "content": "Welcome to the latest episode ofÂ âWhatâs Working Now!âHomebuyers and real estate agents alike often misunderstand the power of deadlines. Today, Iâll go over the pros and cons of including a deadline with your offer.Recently, one of my buyers settled on a house that was brand new to the market. The house went up for sale on a Thursday, and the agent asked for offers by next week. My buyer really wanted this house, so I said, âIf you write a compelling offer that is too good to be true, we can include a deadlineÂ and make them answer us tonight before midnight.âThe offer was all cash with no contingencies. The buyer offered to settle in four days and even included a rent-back that allowed the seller to stay in the home, rent-free, until August.The seller had four hours to make a decision. The agent wasnât prepared to accept offers so early and the sellers were traveling. Still, we required an answer by 11:30. They answered with thirty seconds to spare and we had a ratified contract!While the deadline certainly helped this buyer, deadlines arenât always a good idea. I had another buyer who wanted to make a full-price offer with a 24-hour deadline. I explained that the 24-hour deadline was not a good idea.âOnly use a deadline if you have a truly compelling offer.âBasically, this buyer was giving the seller 24 hours to call every prospective buyer that had been through the house and find a better offer. Deadlines are best used when you are making a compelling offer thatâs too good to be true. In this market, a full-price offer is simply not that compelling.Itâs very important that youÂ work with an agent who understands when to harness the power of deadlines.Â After all, this market is very competitive, and you donât want to give other buyers the chance to sneak in and get the house.Thank you for watching âWhatâs Working Now!â Next time, I will have some advice for home sellers.

        "content": "Welcome to another episode ofÂ âWhatâs Working Now!âÂ Sometimes, buyers will include escalation clauses when they make an offer. Today, Iâll go over the good, the bad, and the ugly when it comes to offers with an escalation clause.Â An escalation clause is when the buyer says, âMr. and Mrs. Seller, I will pay this amount more than any other buyer, but I wonât go higher than this amount.âÂ Whatâs the good thing about an escalation clause? As a seller,Â you may be able to get them up to that higher number.Â What about the bad news?Â Letâs say that a buyer offers $1.3 million and says that they will offer $7,000 more than any other buyer up to $1.5 million. Now, letâs say another buyer comes in and the price escalates to $1.45 million. You relay that information to the buyer with the escalation clause and the buyer may say, âWow, I didnât think anyone else would offer that much. Sorry, Iâm out of here!ââThe ugly truth about escalation clauses is you could end up with nothing.âThe ugly is that you could end up with nothing.So, whatâs the solution?Â As a buyer, you should write a contract without an escalation clause.Â If you want to buy a house and you are willing to pay a certain amount like $1.45 million, then write your offer for $1.45 million so the seller can sign off on it right away.Â You should also work with a strong agent who will give you the right advice, tell you to get rid of the escalation clause, and help you make a good offer to get that house.Â Thank you for watching âWhatâs Working Now!â In the next episode, Iâll go over a few solutions to common challenges in our current market.Â In the meantime, please donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email with any questions that you might have.

        "content": "Welcome to the latest episode ofÂ âWhatâs Working Now!âÂ Everyone knows that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. As a seller, there is a real danger and risk to making a ready, willing, and able buyer wait.Â If youâre a seller and you get two offers on a property, you need to remember that speed makes money. The sooner you respond, the more excited the buyer will be. The longer you wait, the more anxious the buyer will become. Theyâll decide to sleep on it, orÂ they may get nervous enough to bolt.Â When you sign on the dotted line, the buyer will get very excited. They will start planning out their living room furniture and figuring out which rooms the kids will get.Just yesterday, I got two offers on a property and the owner wanted to wait to respond. She waited for two days and one buyer decided to bail on their offer. Another two days passed and she hadnât accepted the remaining offer, so that buyer was anxious to the point where they almost flew after the first buyer.âThe longer you wait, the less money you will make.âThankfully, that buyer came back and we still had two offers on the property. Ultimately, my seller picked one and now we are about to ratify the contract.The lesson here is that when you have a good buyer who meets your price and your terms, please donât wait for someone better to come along.Â Sign the contract and move on.Itâs important to work with an agent who can tell when an offer is strong enough for you to sign right away. Donât wait for that person to disappear. Remember, more time does not bring you more money. Often, the longer you wait, the less money you will make.Â Thanks for tuning into âWhatâs Working Now!â Next time, weâll go over escalation clauses: the good, the bad, and the ugly.Meanwhile, if you have any real estate questions for me, please donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Welcome to the latest episode ofÂ âWhatâs Working Now!âRecently, one of my sellers made a counteroffer and was surprised whenÂ the buyer wanted to sleep on it.After all, we are in an incredibly competitive market right now, and homes are selling fast.The buyer initially made a great offer, but my seller didnât think it was quite great enough. We adjusted the offer just a tad and made a counteroffer. Instead of making a decision right away, the buyer said they would sleep on it.In the meantime, I contacted several agents who had been through the property. Some of these agents had a buyer but hadnât worked quickly enough to make an offer yet.âStay awake to complete negotiations. Donât delay. Be decisive!âSure enough, one buyer was very excited that the other buyer wanted to sleep on it. This new buyer made an offer right away. It was a full-priced offer with no contingencies, so we immediately signed it and withdrew our counteroffer to the buyer who wanted to sleep on it.The lesson here is that if you are a buyer in the middle of a negotiation, you need to make your decisions up front. If you decide to sleep on it, your dream of owning a home may become a nightmare.Youâre not the only buyer in the market who wants that house,Â so donât give anyone else the opportunity to come in and get the home out from under you.When negotiating a sale, itâs important to work with an agent who doesnât take a break or let you sleep on major decisions. Work with an agent who will keep going until you get what you want.Thank you for watching âWhatâs Working Now!âÂ  Next time, Iâll discuss a few solutions to common challenges you may encounter in todayâs market.Meanwhile, if you have any questions about the real estate, just give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Welcome to another episode ofÂ âWhatâs Working Now!âEven though we are in a competitive market, some of my buyers were able to successfully use the rare but effective âcomebackâ negotiating strategy.My buyers made an offer on a house and, after negotiating back and forth, they didnât get the property. So, they walked away and we looked at other homes. However, the more we looked at other properties, the more they realized how that house was really the perfect house for them.They also realized that the way we wrote the offer the first time wasnât the best strategy for them.So, we went back to that property and made a second offer.Â The seller still netted the same amount of money, but my buyers raised the sales price slightly and asked for money back in their closing costs.Enough time had passed that the seller might have been sorry they didnât take our first offer. When we made the second offer, we got the house. The home inspection was completed, we negotiated a few small things, and weâre going to settlement next week.So, if you make an offer on a house and your price is not close enough to what the seller is expecting, donât be afraid to go back and make another offer.Â The âcomebackâ negotiating strategy can be very effectiveÂ and help you get into your perfect house.âWork with an agent who isnât afraid to go back and make another offer.âTo use the comeback strategy, make an initial offer that lets the seller know what you really think. You might get them a little agitated if you offer a lower figure than they expect. Give them some time and, after theyâve had a chance to think about it, make a second offer. Oftentimes, the seller will accept your second offer exactly as it is.In this competitive market, itâs important to find an agent who isnât afraid to go in, make an offer, and then come back and do it again.Thank you for watchingÂ âWhatâs Working Now.âÂ Be on the lookout for our next video, which explores what happened to the buyer who decides to sleep on it before making an offer on a house. In this market, if you snooze, you lose.In the meantime, if you have any questions about our current market, just give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to speaking with you!",

        "content": "Welcome to the latest episode of âWhatâs Working Now!âRecently, I helped my clients kill two birds with one stone by buying and selling a house at the same time.No one wants to make an offer contingent on the sale of their home but in this case, that had to happen. Instead of going after a property already listed on the MLS and competing with non-contingent buyers, we set out to find an âUnder the Radarâ property that hadnât yet hit the market.One of my clientâs friends pointed us towards a great home in a co-op building. We got the key, went to see it, and my clients loved it. There was no price or contact information for the owner, so we figured out our own price and contacted the daughter.We sent her a contract and said, âHere is our offer. What do you want to do?â The daughter wanted nothing to do with the sale. We then got in touch with the sellerâs attorney, negotiated the contract, and made the offer contingent on the sale of my clientâs townhouse on Capitol Hill.We advertised their home and found a buyer immediately; they will settle that sale next week.âSince the home wasnât on the market yet, the sellers werenât in a hurry to close.âMany people are uncertain about how to buy and sell a home at the same time. After all, you need to take the money from the sale of your current house to buy a new one. No seller wants to accept a contingent offer, so how can you do that in a competitive market where properties sell extremely quickly?In a market like this, you shouldnât focus on the homes already on the market. Instead, work with an agent who will go out andÂ find a property that hasnât been listed yet.In this case, my clients were able to successfully make a contingent offer because the condo wasnât on the market and the owners were not in any hurry to close the sale. My clients even got to move in a week before settlement, which is highly unusual and never happens when you buy a property that is officially on the market.Ultimately, you need to find an agent who is not afraid to write a contingent contract and who is willing to dig up an âUnder the Radarâ property for you to purchase. That is truly the best way to kill two birds with one stone in this market.Thanks for watching âWhatâs Working Now!â Next time, weâll talk about how my buyers won in an unforgiving market that usually does not give buyers a second chance. Meanwhile, if you have any questions, please donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

        "content": "If youâre just getting ready to move, thereâs a lot you need to get in order. So, where do you start? Your home holds years of clothing, furniture, books, letters, mementos, photographs, etc. that can seem pretty overwhelming when the time comes to organize for a move.The best advice for starting the process is to keep it simple. Make a to-do list of things you need to sort, organize, clean, remove, throw away, donate, sell, repair, or paint. You also might need to include landscaping projects and hiring movers on the to-do list.Itâs important to know that not all to-do lists are the same. Different methods work for different people. In fact, I have three examples of different clients who used very different strategies to successfully complete their moves.âMoving just got a whole lot easier.âThe first client hired an organizer who brought in blue, red, green, and yellow dots to represent stays, goes, trash, and give to family. They then hired a maintenance contractor to check that everything in the home was in working order. Finally, they hired my stager to get the house show-ready for the market.The second client had lived in her house for 81 years. She was moving to be with her boyfriend and her biggest challenge was getting mentally prepared to leave a lifetime of memories tied to the home. Once she got past that, she started her moving process with something smallâher tea cup collection. I helped her find a new home for the collection, and from there she hired an organizer who also used colored dots to separate things. Then, she hired a mover that needed to be able to make three stops: her new home, her family home, and her boyfriendâs home. After that, she hired a stager.The third client didnât want to use any services. They got their boxes, collected and boxed up the things they wanted to keep, threw away the things they didnât, hired a mover, and moved.No matter your method, if you make sure to follow these five steps, youâll have a smooth, stress-free move.  Find your âwhyâ. What is your goal?  Decide to start.  Call me so we can come up with a plan that works for you.  Choose a start date.  Begin the sorting. Start with what is easiest, make lists and hire the organizer.Stay tuned for solutions to challenges in todayâs market on the next âWhatâs Working Now!âAs always, if you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Welcome to another episode of âWhatâs Working Now!âToday I want to share some tidbits from an upcoming Q&amp;A feature I did with Marissa Kashino of The Washingtonian about tips for navigating the D.C. real estate market. Hereâs an exclusive look at some of her questions and my responses.âWhat street or streets tend to be especially desirable? That is, where houses sell fast and where buyers stalk listings?âA different perspective is to consider the potential impact busy streets have on desirability. In a balanced market, a home on a busy street might be discounted 15% to 20% and take a long time to sell. In todayâs market, due to the scarcity of homes, the ones on busy streets sell quickly and at a much smaller differential in price.âWhich neighborhoods are you most bullish on right now?âCleveland Park, North Cleveland Park, and Woodley Parkâpretty much a blend of the uptown locations for the in-town convenience. Youâve got the metro location, movies, shopping centers, libraries, post offices, etc. Buyers are competing fiercely in those areas and most homes are generating multiple offers and selling for more than their full price.âWhat is your best quick tip for clients who need to make their house look clean in a pinch for a last-minute showing?âPick up around your house and clear your surfaces of all your family photos and anything personal. Leave no more than two or three items on a surface. Open all your shades and blinds, turn on every light, and clean your windows.âWhat is the biggest potential problem a home inspection wonât always find?âIn todayâs market, it isnât so much what isnât found, but rather the buyerâs expectation of the new houseâs condition. No matter how old the house is, itâs possible that everything thatâs found needs to be repaired, replaced, or removed.âBesides a premium price, buyers should offer sellers certainty and convenience.ââDo you have a tip for getting a seller to accept an offer before they hold the first open house other than offering a ridiculously high price?âIn addition to a premium price, offer the seller certainty and convenience. This means no financing contingency, no appraisal contingency, and no inspection contingency. Do your inspections in advance. You can also offer a quick settlement with a free rent back. Give the seller a deadline to accept your offer before it expires, too.âWhat is an impactful but easy and cheap way to improve a houseâs curb appeal?âTrim the shrubbery and paint the front door.Thanks for tuning into another episode of âWhatâs Working Now!â Be on the lookout for my next video where Iâll recap my âTips for Right-sizing and Declutteringâ seminar, which was cosponsored by the Cleveland and Woodley Park Village and the Northwest Neighbors Village.

        "content": "Today I want to talk about the emerging trend in buyer expectations that impacts marketing, contract negotiations, andâmost importantlyâhome inspection negotiations.Letâs imagine youâre a seller and weâve got a contract on your house, weâve negotiated the price and all the terms with the buyer, and weâre ready for the home inspection. This buyer will expect that your house is move-in ready and nothing is wrong with it other than what youâve already disclosed in your disclosure document.Suddenly, the home inspector comes in and has a long list of things you didnât disclose either because they donât matter or because theyâre maintenance items. Some of the things could also be recommended upgrades. In any case, the buyer presents this list to you and expects you to do all the things on it because their home inspector said so.âVerify that everything in your house works properly before the inspection happens.âHow do you deal with this situation?The most important thing you can do up front is check everything in your house that youâve never used and make sure itâs all functioning properly so that when you do get hit with that list, it will be much shorter. This is also a good way for you to avoid the buyer expectation that your house will be even better than what youâve already presented.Thanks for tuning into the latest episode of âWhatâs Working Now!â Be on the lookout for my next video where youâll discover other emerging trends in the market.Thinking of buying or selling?

        "content": "Welcome to the latest episode of âWhatâs Working Now!âÂ Today Iâd like to answer a question just about everyone asks: Is staging your home worth it?âStagingâ means a lot of things when it comes to selling your home. Primarily, though, it means making the house look appealing to the people coming in. This means taking you, your tastes, your family, and your stuff out of the house. To know how to identify what needs to go, put yourself in the mind of the photographer coming in to take pictures. What do you want in those pictures? You definitely donât want any family photos festooned everywhere or dirty dishes languishing in the sink.In the pictures, you want to show off the house, not the furniture. After youâve cleaned out all of your surfaces and removed all of your personal belongings, you then want to hire someone who has âstagingâ furniture. By this I mean items that are neutral in color and not too big in any direction. You should use only enough furniture to show off the rooms.Personally, I donât go for any of the fake stuff, like napkin rings or glasses set about when nobody is there drinking. You know your staging is working when someone walks in your door and asks, âIs this staged or does someone live here?ââStaging should show off the house, not the furniture.âAs an example of the impact of proper staging, let me tell you about a house I sold at 35th &amp; Porter in Cleveland Park. This house had lots of antique furniture, books, and knick-knacks, but staging for top dollar meant more than just rearranging those items. We moved out all the ownerâs furniture, and my stager refurnished the entire house. We spruced up the countertops and the front of the kitchen cabinets, reglazed over some tile, touched up the paint, installed some new carpeting and fixed a few lighting fixtures. The owners invested $20,000 to $25,000 in getting their home market-ready.We then listed the home at a lower price of $1.295 million instead of $1.45 to get more people in the door. The very first day it was on the market, we got an offer for $1.5 million.So, does staging work? Definitely.Stay tuned for my next video where youâll discover the most challenging recent trend in contract negotiations. If you have any questions about staging your home or anything else related to Cleveland Park real estate, give me a call or send me an email. Iâd be happy to help!",

        "content": "Welcome to the latest episode of Whatâs Working Now!Today, Iâll discuss why you should sell now instead of waiting. Many people want to wait until after the election or after the holidays; others want to wait for the spring market.Letâs talk about why you might not want to wait.Most agents tell their clients, âLetâs wait until after the holidays.â I wonder if they say that because they are on vacation and donât want to be bothered. I am in town during the holidays, and so are many well-qualified buyers that are ready to pounce. These buyers (and other agents that stay in town) call me daily and ask, âMarjorie, whatâs on the market right now? Whatâs coming up?âThere is so much demand right now, but there is no supply. January is the beginning of our spring market, so that is when weâll start to see more houses coming on the market. By listing now, you will avoid all of that competition and attract those highly motivated buyers.âThere is extremely high demand right now, but there are not enough homes on the market.âOther people are worried about whatâs going to happen now that the election is over. So we have a new presidentâI have been doing this since 1980, so I have been through many elections. I canât think of one single time that the election has ever affected my business. People are always moving in and out. If they are moving in from another state for a short period of time, they are usually renters, which wonât affect you if youâre not in the rental market.Some sellers just want to wait until spring. Sellers will say, âMarjorie, my house will look so nice once my azaleas bloom,â or, âWait until my tulip garden comes up.â They donât want to list right now. However, this December, there are many buyers who cannot find a house because of multiple offers. Do you want to wait until spring? Do you think these buyers care about your azaleas or your tulips?When buyers look for a home in the winter, none of the houses that they look at have azaleas. Those houses are still going to sell and they are going to sell for top dollar because there is high demand and low supply. If you wait until spring, you will miss out on good buyers who are willing to pay top dollar.In short, you donât have to wait to put your home on the market. Now is a great time to sell your home.Be on the lookout for my next video about the most challenging recent trend in contract negotiations.

        "content": "Welcome to the latest episode of âWhatâs Working Now!âToday weâre answering a question from Bob, whoâs curious about planning ahead when selling your home. Bob asks, âWhat repairs, improvements, etc. should be made in order to get the best return later?âIn my previous videos, I covered how to update the walls and floors of your home, as well as how to begin the home improvement process. Today, I am going to expand on the two most important rooms that you should focus on upgrading in order to get the highest return on your investment: the kitchen and master bathroom.First, letâs start with the kitchen. Depending on how large your home is or how many improvements you need, improving the kitchen could mean just changing the cabinets or the countertops.First, though, check the floor and the appliances and see whatâs old or could be spruced up. If the floor looks cracked or crusty, you might want to consider replacing it with something that looks like tile. If the appliances are old and canât be cleaned, you might want to switch them out for new ones. They donât necessarily have to be top of the line, they just have to look new. Silver is a very popular color in this regard.The cabinets may not need to be replaced. Repainting them completely and/or just changing the knobs or pulls may be enough.âIf itâs beyond repair, donât hesitate to rip it out.âNow, letâs move on to the master bathroom. The three items you need to look at in the master bathroom are the lighting, the mirror, and sink. If one or all three of these areas look old or shopworn, it needs to be replaced. From there, move downward and look at the tile. If itâs a neutral color (beige, gray, etc.) that hasnât undergone much wear and tear, you can probably leave it alone. If itâs disgusting, donât hesitate to rip it out.Whether itâs the kitchen or the master bathroom, always consult with your agent first about which of these improvements you really need.Thanks for watching Whatâs Working Now!

        "content": "Welcome to the latest episode of âWhatâs Working Now!âToday, weâre answering a question from Bob, who asked, âFor those of us who may not be planning to list our home now, what are the things we should do inside and outside of the home in priority order? What repairs, improvements, etc., should be made in order to get the best return later?âWe covered how to begin this process in an earlier video by talking about cleaning off your surfaces. That was step one.The next step is to look at the surfaces of your actual property, meaning the walls and the floors, and clean them up. Is the paint peeling? Is it colorful enough? Look at your carpeting for stains and rough patches that need to be cleaned.âA house should feel clean and crisp when a buyer walks in.âYou want the house to feel crisp and clean when a buyer walks in. If itâs dirty or something is chipped, itâs not going to look clean and fresh. Believe it or not, this puts a huge damper on the offers you get, and it might prevent you from getting any offers at all.As an example of this effect in motion, I recently had the task of selling a house that was pristine, priced correctly, and staged correctly. The only problem was that its kitchen and one of its bathrooms were painted dark orange. I told the owner, in no uncertain terms, that a $2,000 repaint job would net her an extra $40,000. The owner agreed to repaint, but she didnât get that extra $40,000âshe got an extra $60,000.Little things like that can make all the difference. Be on the lookout for my next video where we move onto phase three of the smartest things you can do to get your home market ready. If youâre thinking of buying or selling in the meantime, feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to talking with you!",

        "content": "Today Iâd like to answer a question from Elizabeth who recently asked about whether it would be possible to buy a new house when she needs to sell her current one to cover the down payment.Because weâre in such a sellerâs market right now, itâs common for people to be afraid of this situation. Though some buyers may be worried about including a contingent contractâone that makes the purchase of the new home contingent upon the sale of their current homeâIâve made contingent offers several times, and most of the time, they have worked out.The best way to arrange this would be to find a property that has been sitting on the market for at least two weeks because, in our market, two weeks can be a long time for a seller. If you find a property in this situation that you like, your next step would be to get together with your agent and determine where to price your offer.âIâve made contingent offers several times, and they usually do work out.âI would suggest that you offer the sellerâs full asking price, but make the offer contingent on the sale of your current home. After this, youâll sign a listing agreement which will show that youâre ready to list your house on the market, show the seller the comparable sales for your neighborhood so that they are assured that your house will sell quickly, and finally, show off your agentâs home selling statistics.Â If a seller whose home has been sitting on the market for a while receives an offer like yours, which guarantees them their asking price and proves that your home will sell quickly, theyâre much more likely to accept it, despite the contingency contract.If you have any other questions about buying and selling simultaneously or anything else related to Cleveland Park real estate, give me a call or send me an email. Iâd be happy to help you!",

        "content": "Recently, I asked you to send me your questions about buying and selling real estate. Ale asked about the pros and cons of selling your current house before buying the next one. He also asked about doing a rent-back.First of all, if you have a house and want to buy another one, selling your current home first is a great way to go. Youâll have time to clean up your house and put it on the market. Plus, once your home sells, you will have enough money in your pocket to purchase another home. Since you are all ready to go, purchasing your next home will go a lot smoother.Although it is more difficult to buy a new home before selling your current one, it is doable. There are a few different options, but you should always make sure to talk to a lender first to see which one makes the most sense for you financially.1. Make a contingent offer. Find a house thatâs been sitting on the market for a little while (in our market, that means two weeks) and make your offer contingent on the sale of your current house. This can be a difficult transaction, but it can be done.âSelling first leaves you free to purchase your next home.â2. Create a long settlement period. When you buy the new house, ask to close in 90 days. During that 90-day period, get your house on the market. The way our current market has been going, your home will likely sell in two weeks or 30 days, leaving you ready to close on day 90.3. Look at different loan options. Again, talk to your lender to figure out which of these options is best for you. You may be able to get a bridge loan or set up a line of credit based on your home equity. You could even refinance your current house so that you can purchase the next house.Finally, Ale also asked about a rent-back. If you sell your house but need to stay in it for a couple of weeks before you move, you can rent it back from the person you sold it to. Rent-backs are very common; they often make the settlement a lot easier on the buyer and the seller. Rent-backs do not hurt the value of the home, either â they are just part of the negotiation.Next time, weâll answer Elizabethâs question about the challenge of needing the equity in your current home for your next property. Meanwhile, if you have any other questions about buying and selling a home at the same time, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",
