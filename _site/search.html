        "content": "There&rsquo;s an eastward migration happening in our market.Today’s topic can be summed up in one sentence: Go east, young man.Over the last few weeks, we’ve seen a lot of people moving from the Bay Area to the Central Valley due to more and more companies allowing their workers to work from home (and to a lesser extent, low interest rates). This has had a big impact on our market. We’ve seen a huge influx of young buyers who don’t have to live in higher-priced areas anymore—areas where they had previously been renters.This has been a welcome improvement to our market because sellers are benefiting tremendously and home prices are rising. Every property we listed the week before the recording of this video attracted multiple offers and sold above asking price. Additionally, many home sellers in our area are moving even further east and settling in the Midwest.“We’ve seen a huge influx of young buyers who don’t have to live in higher-priced areas anymore.”If you’ve been thinking about leaving California and moving to another state but are still on the fence about selling, give us a call. We’d love to talk more about why now’s an optimal time to sell. There are far more buyers than there are sellers out there, so it’s a great time to get top dollar.As always, if you have any other real estate questions, feel free to reach out to us. We’re here to help.",

We listed four houses last weekend and had a total of 85 showings. We didn’t expect such a response so soon, and more people are getting anxious to take advantage of pent-up demand and low interest rates.

Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.As we continue to keep our clients and friends up to date with the latest goings-on in our market, we’ve been hearing a lot of people asking if we’re headed into a recession. Our friends over at eXp just had their shareholder meeting, and they provided a lot of great data to help answer that question.Back during the Great Recession of 2007 and 2008, 14.5% of homeowners had less than 10% equity in their homes. Today, that number has dropped to 6.6%. Back then, the number of active subprime loans hit 5.1 million, where today, it’s only at 1.98 million. Those were a huge factor in what caused the Great Recession, and today we simply don’t have the same issues.",

The answers we’ll provide today depend on when the shelter-in-place provisions will be lifted.At the moment, there are serious restrictions on showings; we can only show vacant homes in person, and we’ve been doing virtual home tours for sellers who still live in their homes.

To keep our industry moving, however, key safety procedures are needed anytime there’s an in-person interaction, like the showing of a home.Today we’re demonstrating what it looks like to safely walk through a home; masks, gloves, shoe guards, and a distance of six feet are critical.",

However, we don’t believe that will be the case. When the stock market is tanking like it is right now, people tend to take their money off Wall Street and put it into real estate because it’s generally a safe investment. We saw this happen after 9/11, the financial crisis of 2008, and other periods of uncertainty. During times like this, people put their money into mortgage-backed securities.It’s a very fluid situation, but we’re always on top of it from every different angle. If you need any advice, please reach out to us.For those of you who think that you’ll wait until the market adjusts to buy, know this: Interest rates will probably never be this low again, so you have to take into consideration the cost of waiting. Mathematically, are you going to save enough money by waiting to make up for the money you’ll save over 30 years on your mortgage? The answer is different for everyone.“People tend to take their money off Wall Street and put it into real estate.”We invite you to ask your parents what their interest rate was when they purchased a home. Our guess is that if you compare it to what we’re seeing today, you might want to get started buying or selling sooner than later.If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email.

Be smart about how you respond.Are you getting a lot of random calls from people representing real estate agents lately? Allow us to explain what’s happening.It’s January, and a lot of agents who are new, haven’t performed well, or don’t have a big marketing budget, are hiring assistants to call people in their database to try to get them to list their homes. Granted, this is the time of year people start thinking about listing their home. The holidays are over, taxes are finished, and you get a clearer picture of what you want your next step to be.However, don’t get caught up in these sales calls. Again, the person calling you is an assistant who has no real estate experience, so if you want to entertain the notion of selling, at least ask the important questions, such as:  Who is the agent?  What company do they work for?  How many homes have they sold?  What do their reviews look like?“If we can do anything to protect you and help achieve your real estate goals—not the agent’s—it’s better for you.”Don’t let them get away with just “selling” you on an idea or product. If you want to schedule an appointment with an agent, make sure you conduct multiple interviews so you know which agent you connect with the best.The goal of these assistants is to call at least 100 people a day; it’s a numbers game for them. Most of the agents behind these assistants took the holidays off, and now they’re coming back aggressively to start the year. This is borne more out of desperation than the need to help someone. We refer to this as “commission breath,” and you don’t want to work with an agent who has it. Work with someone who understands your circumstances and wants to do their best job to help you.We’ve found that if we can do anything to protect you and help achieve your real estate goals—not the agent’s—it’s better for you.If you have any more questions about this topic or need a second opinion about any calls you’ve received lately, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

Aren’t prices set to drop then?”Our response is always the same: We don’t know what will happen; prices may stabilize, which is normal, but they won’t go down.What’s more important for buyers to consider is securing a low interest rate. It’s a long-term benefit you should always be looking to capitalize on instead of waiting for some undetermined time when home prices may drop by $20,000.“Right now, the market is giving us a gift, and homeowners should take advantage of it!”Additionally, it’s good to remember that refinancing a 30-year fixed interest rate to a 15-year is always easier when you have a low rate.Ultimately, you can have compound interest work for you or against you.

This means there are a lot of buyers who want to move up to a larger home because their family is growing, they’ve developed different ideas of what they want in a home, etc.If you’re a move-up buyer, you need to have a great package to present to the seller of your “move-up” home. It’s not the end of the world if you need to sell your current home first in order to buy, but your agent needs to be able to submit a clean offer. By this, we mean your house needs to be either on the market or prepped for the market, it needs to be priced aggressively, and your agent needs a great portfolio for the area you’re selling in.Presenting this information to the seller is key in being considered over other contingent offers and noncontingent offers. Also, remember that when you’re presenting a contingent offer, you have to sweeten the offer at least a little bit. This could mean upping the offer price or offering desirable terms.“If you’re a move-up buyer, you need to have a great package to present to the seller of your “move-up” home.”Many sellers who would consider your contingent offer will want to know whether there is any certainty that the terms of the contingency will be met so their own sale can proceed to close.

        "content": "Our real estate market isn&rsquo;t as bad as it&rsquo;s being made out to be. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really happening. If you’ve been listening to any real estate news lately, you may have heard about recessions, trade wars, tariffs, and a new concept called a “negative interest rate.” What does all this mean?It seems like the answer changes daily, but the truth is that real estate is very stable. It doesn’t swing drastically one way or the other, and it won’t cause you to lose $100,000 overnight. However, there are still market swings you need to stay on top of.So, what’s happening right now? We recently transitioned from a hyper seller’s market to a normal seller’s market to just a normal market. In some price ranges, we’ve even transitioned to a buyer’s market. We determine this by using something called “absorption rate documents.” When buying a home, depending on the price range you’re in, you can either be in a seller’s market, a buyer’s market, or a normal market.“The truth is that real estate is very stable.”Let’s use Tracy as an example. If you look below the $350,000 price range, you’re still in a seller’s market. There’s a lot of demand in this area, and homes are still selling quickly. If you look between $500,000 and $600,000, you’re in a normal market, meaning it should take a home anywhere from three to six months to sell if it’s priced appropriately. If you look anywhere above $1 million, homes are taking anywhere from eight months to two years to sell.If you’re a seller, knowing the absorption rate (which we produce for you) will tell you what type of market you’re in and how aggressively to price your home.Don’t let the news scare you. It’s there, but it’s not impacting you the way you think it is.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Marketing your home as is can deter buyers, and today we'll give greater insight into why this is. Is it ever a good idea to sell your home as is?For some, the answer is yes.Maybe the seller has inherited the property and they don’t live there or perhaps it’s not financially feasible for them to make renovations. It’s important to remember that when you do market your as-is home, the common assumption will be that the property is in need of repair. Because of that, you won’t see much interest from buyers looking for a move-in ready home, but you will see a lot of interest from investors and cash buyers.Typically, the offer you receive will come in below market value, but also remember that, in such situations, market value is more of a mindset. Hear me out: If you have to shell out $30,000 in renovations to bring the home up the market value, you’re not necessarily selling it under market value, are you?“Marketing your home as is can be a viable option.”And let’s not forget, if your goal is to close on the home as quickly as possible, accepting a cash offer will ensure that you achieve it. As we mentioned above, if you’ve inherited the property and you can’t renovate it due to a lack of time, money, energy, or the fact that you’re in a different location, the most headache-free path is probably to sell it as is and take the profit.Mind you, there’s a difference between repairs and renovations. For example, don’t market your home as is just because you’d rather not put in new carpet or update your kitchen. This will lead buyers to believe that larger issues are present. Whatever the case, always communicate your desired course of action with your listing agent.The bottom line is that marketing your home as is can be a viable option so long as you understand that you’ll likely have to take an all-cash offer and earn less than you would on the open market.If you have any questions or you’re not sure if you should upgrade your home before it goes on the market or sell as is, please reach out to us.

Along with their children, they’re in need of a little guidance on what steps should be taken and what documents they’ll need to make the transition as smooth as possible.We as your real estate advisors urge you and your children to have this conversation with us well in advance so that we aren’t scrambling to file the necessary paperwork in time or set up a trust for your home.“Erring on the side of caution and preparing for the future will ensure your situation works out for the better.”We’ve seen these situations unfold in a number of ways—some were good experiences, some were bad experiences. In one instance, a homeowner’s conservatorship was tied up in court for months. In another, no roadblocks came up because the family made sure to take care of all the documentation up front, and that allowed the homeowner’s children to find the best care for their parent(s).Needless to say, erring on the side of caution and preparing for the future will ensure your situation resembles the latter.

Today we&rsquo;ll discuss. Today let’s talk about one of the latest trends that we’ve noticed in the market this year.Every time I’m called into an appointment, I ask people what their next move is. Many of these clients have told me their plan is to move out of California to such states as Idaho, Arizona, Tennessee, and Texas. In fact, a recent news article said that 50% of people wish they could leave California. At any rate, it certainly feels like the net migration is leaving the state.If you or someone you know is thinking about making a move out of the state to live somewhere with a lower cost of living, reach out to us. We know people in all different parts of the country that we can refer you to so that you’re ensured a high quality of service, and we’d certainly be glad to help you sell your home.

We were able to list and get her home under contract quickly.Then she went in to write a contract for a new construction home and let the builder convince her to write the offer without a home sale, knowing that we needed her house sale to close before we could close on her new home purchase.We were a little delayed on our close and the builder made it really difficult by threatening our client with fees, constantly calling and texting her, and turned a situation that should have been peaceful into a horrible and borderline-abusive situation.“The client didn’t save any money by going straight to the builder.”The best way to avoid a situation like this is to have someone represent you as a buyer. If we could have referred her to a representative that was looking out for her best interests, all the threats and bad vibes could have been avoided. Representing yourself on a home purchase is a bad idea. It’s like going to court without a lawyer and going up against an all-star team of defense attorneys.This client didn’t save any money by going straight to a builder. Hiring a buyer’s agent not only would have cost her nothing, but it would have saved her so much time, hassle, and money.If you or someone you know is thinking about buying or selling a home anytime in the near future, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "It&rsquo;s always important to verify the quality of an agent before you work with them, and today we&rsquo;d like to share a few ways you can do so. One of our clients recently asked us how they can verify that an agent they’re thinking of working with is as good as they claim. Moving from one home to the next is a huge milestone, so it’s obvious that you want the best person or team for the job by your side.A great way to verify the quality of an agent is by checking out their reviews. Seeing what those who have worked with them in the past have to say about their service can tell you a lot about what to expect.Of course, not all reviews are legitimate. If you see that an agent has only sold 12 homes in the past year but has 200 reviews, then you can be sure that most of that feedback is illegitimate. Anyone can ask their friends and family to write up a phony review, after all. It’s always critical to make sure that the number of reviews an agent has makes sense in relation to the number of sales they’ve handled.“If an agent who has mostly positive reviews conducts themselves with grace when replying to negative feedback, this is a good sign.”If an agent’s reviews are legitimate, don’t be surprised if you come across one or two bad ones in the mix. Agents are only human. When you happen upon negative reviews, don’t let them scare you away before you check to see how the agent handled their response. If an agent who has mostly positive reviews conducts themselves with grace when replying to negative feedback, this is a good sign.On the other hand, if a Realtor is hesitant to put you in touch with people who can provide testament to their service, this is a major red flag.If you have any other questions or would like more information about what to look for in an agent, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

Here&rsquo;s our mid-May update. We’re now into mid-May, which makes it time to recap our market’s performance this spring.Our spring market has turned out to be a roaring success for buyers and sellers alike due to increased stability. Last year, we were firmly a seller’s market, so the opportunities for buyers to get their offers in at lower interest rates in 2019’s spring market has been a nice shake-up.Homes in a price range below $500,000 sold in little time, while homes above that mark—namely homes priced higher than $600,000—were taking on average 30 days to sell. Much of that has to do with the FHA loan limits for San Joaquin and Stanislaus County.In December of this past year, a slowdown began to emerge as a result of rising interest rates that eventually topped out at about 5%. After some reevaluating, the Fed announced a scaleback that is set to be in effect for the next six weeks.“Lower interest rates strengthen the economy and widen opportunities for buyers to make a purchase before rates begin trending upward again.”This is great news because low rates serve to strengthen the economy and widen opportunities for buyers to make a purchase before rates start to trend upward again.We’ve discussed that loan limits are going up for both conventional and FHA products, but we haven’t given much attention to those of the VA variety. There are some exceptional VA loans out there, and we at Home Buyers Realty love every opportunity we have to work with veterans.If you’d like to know how you’ll fare with the current state of our market, please give us a call.

If you want to get the best deal possible, the answer is yes. As a homebuyer, you should always have an agent by your side when meeting with a new home builder.Why? First of all, the builder represents their own interests, so having an agent by your side will help you truly understand what your costs will be and help you negotiate the deal. Also, new home builders operate under a set of rules that are slightly different than what you’d find in other real estate transactions.For example, they may try pressing their own lender on you, and that’s fine—they might be a great loan officer—but don’t forget that there are other local brokers you might be better off working with. Don’t feel like you have to work with the builder’s lender just because they’re offering you a credit. Oftentimes, the fees these lenders charge are very high and nullify whatever you save from these credits.

Now they’ve recovered, though, and they want to re-enter the market because they see an opportunity.The first thing boomerang buyers need to know about our market is that purchasing a home with the right terms is key, so you need to get in touch with a good, local loan officer who can help you understand your loan and its terms.For example, we previously worked with a client who lost their home a few years ago, and we helped them buy a new home using an FHA loan with just a 3.5% down payment. The best part? Their current mortgage payment is actually lower than it was before they lost their previous home. They’re living better, they’re financially savvier, and—most importantly—they’re happier.“Get in touch with a good, local loan officer who can help you understand your loan and its terms.”Next, keep in mind that while interest rates are inching upward, they’re still historically low, which means your mortgage payment would be competitive with what you’d pay in monthly rent.If you or anyone you know qualifies as a boomerang buyer, we’d love it if you gave us a call so we can sit down and talk with you about how we can make you a homeowner again.As always, if you have any other real estate questions, feel free to reach out to us as well.

        "content": "Don&rsquo;t let all this talk about rising interest rates scare you. Rates are still historically low and there are plenty of great opportunities out there for homebuyers. Did you know that when we bought our first home, our interest rate was astronomical compared to today’s rates?It’s true. We usually invite homebuyers to ask their parents or their grandparents what their interest rate was when they bought their first home. If you try this, you’ll get numbers ranging from 8% to 18%.We’re not that old, but we can tell you that, historically, a normal interest rate is between 8% and 11%. That sounds crazy these days, but that’s the reality. Last week, interest rates got moved up again, and they’re currently hovering around 5%. That’s still about half of what ours was for our first home.The point is that there are still opportunities out there for you if you’re a homebuyer. Don’t let this talk about rising interest rates scare you. We’re still in a historically low interest rate environment and what we especially love about today’s interest rates is that they’ve helped us cut back from being a hyper seller’s market. In fact, more and more sellers are helping buyers get into homes by offering closing credits.“If you lock in a great interest rate today, you’ll have it for the next 30 years”Don’t let this opportunity pass you by. If you lock in a great interest rate today, you’ll have it for the next 30 years.We would love to help you find your new home and lock in a great interest rate, so if you’d like to talk more about this subject, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.As always, if you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to us as well.

        "content": "Though our market is changing, both buyers and sellers have a good opportunity to get a great deal right now. Now that we’re into fall, what can we expect to see from our market in the coming months?For one thing, we’re seeing more inventory right now, which is a great thing for buyers, but it means sellers have a little bit more work ahead of them. If you’re a seller, your house will probably sit on the market a little bit longer, but there are still ways to avoid this and sell for top dollar.One of these ways is to make sure your house is in top-notch condition and ready to show. If you do this, you will still be able to generate multiple bids. Home staging is becoming more important, and this is what we specialize in—we take the time to walk you through your home help you understand what changes may need to be made so that it’s more marketable and sells quickly.“If you’re a buyer, this is the opportunity you’ve been waiting for.”To sum things up, the phrase we’d like to use is “The market has crested.” We’ve reached the peak and now we’re slowly declining. This isn’t the same situation we had from 2008 to 2010; we’re just transitioning from a hyper seller’s market to a normal seller’s market. A lot of people aren’t used to this, so we just have to get comfortable with the fact that buyers have more buying power.If you’re a buyer, this is the opportunity you’ve been waiting for. Not only do we have more inventory available, but interest rates are still low. However, keep in mind that the sky’s not falling. You won’t be able to bid $30,000 below a home’s asking price, but this is an opportunity for you to get a fair market value. We’re also seeing a lot of concessions happening in transactions—sellers are giving up a little bit more to close deals and get buyers into their homes. As interest rates start rising, this is something to keep in mind.All in all, it’s a good opportunity for both buyers and sellers.

        "content": "Helping relocation clients is one of our specialties. Here&rsquo;s an example of how we were recently able to help one such client. The topic we’re exploring today is one that we don’t usually talk about: relocation. Essentially, relocation in real estate refers to homeowners who are displaced because of their job and need to sell their home but don’t have the time and energy to make sure it sells for top dollar. In this situation, you really need to trust that the agent you hire is working in your best interests to get the house prepared, on the market, and sold. We recently helped a relocation buyer achieve their goals and we wanted to tell you about that today. The client had a home on Jonathan Court and had to leave before the home was ready to sell. He was really stressed out and nervous because he couldn’t get everything done before he had to start his new job. He had to put his trust in us that we would get the repair work completed and get the home sold for top dollar. The work included flooring, light fixtures, and front and back landscaping. This man interviewed five different agents, but not one of them offered to finish the projects for him. Our team did.After he left, we were able to get the house ready in a week and a half and ended up getting three offers on it. We were able to do all the negotiating over the phone and over email with the homeowner, and that home is actually closing tomorrow.“We got the home ready and had it sold within a week and a half.”We didn’t charge an extra cent for doing that work for him. All we asked for was for a few referrals and to let others know how satisfied he was. He actually saved money on repairs by working with our trusted vendors, who give discounts to our team.At the end of the day, we wanted to make this the smoothest transaction possible and to relieve stress for the homeowner. If you or someone you know is relocating in the near future, this is an area of specialty for our team. If you need any help, we would be more than happy to help you just like we’ve helped our clients in the past. We will take over the stress and pressure of getting your home ready and sold so you can focus on your move. If you have any other questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

Today we’ll discuss exactly why teams matter in our business.In this age, everyone wants an answer to their questions right away—social media and texting have spoiled us on that front. So agents need to be on point, but they can’t be everywhere at once.This is why having a strong, synergistic team whose members all have the same goal in mind, understand our mission statement, and also have a clear understanding of our client’s goals is so critical.Hiring a team doesn’t cost any more than it would to hire an individual agent. On the contrary, it’ll likely make you money in the long run. It’s important and useful to have each team member’s expert opinion on your file so that each part is taken care of to its fullest potential.“Hiring a team doesn’t cost any more than it would to hire an individual agent.”There are about 124 different tasks involved in a single transaction. Do you think that a single agent could tackle all that easily? Or, think of it this way: Imagine a restaurant where the only employee is the valet, the host, the server, the cook, and the busser—Do you suppose that your service would be optimal?On our team, each member specializes in a different task, knows their duties, and does them over and over again, meaning you can trust them to get the job done well.What’s more is that our team has a few members who specialize in different areas like probate, foreclosures, and short sales. This brings a different dynamic and wider range of services to our clients.If you’re looking to hire someone to sell your home for you, consider our team. With our services, you won’t spend more hiring us than you’ll net with your home sale.",

Well, one thing we can safely predict is that they&rsquo;ll rise again sooner rather than later. Interest rates have been a hot topic lately in our market. So what should today’s buyers know about what’s going on?First of all, rates have gone up, but the increase has not been as significant as anticipated. This is causing a big push for buyers to get into their next home before they rise again. And current inventory levels already pose a challenge, so today’s market has become somewhat difficult to navigate.With low unemployment rates and our economy as strong as it is right now, rates are likely to see another increase sooner rather than later. There’s simply no reason for rates to be kept so low given the strength of our current conditions.“Do yourself a favor and stay ahead of the interest rate hike.”Whether you plan to refinance or buy, don’t put it off.

        "title": "The True Pitfalls of Listing With Discount Brokers",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "What does working with a discount broker truly cost sellers? Today let&rsquo;s take an in-depth look at this listing mistake. When it comes time to list, some sellers may be tempted to work with companies or agents offering discounted services. Paying less may sound attractive, but working with these companies (or agents) can cost sellers far more than it saves them.For example, we recently met with a seller who had been bombarded with cost-cutting brokers knocking on his door. Though these brokers were offering a reduced fee, they were also offering reduced service. They weren’t offering the seller guidance on how to achieve a successful sale; they didn’t have Zillow or Realtor.com “Premier Agent” status, and they didn’t offer maximum exposure. Even the price tag these brokers initially offer isn’t a done deal.Sometimes, the leads that come through these discount real estate companies are sent to other agents. This means sellers seeking a good deal may wind up paying the same commission fee as anyone else. In other words, the Realtor-client relationship set up in these situations is based on lies. And, because real estate transactions constitute such major life decisions, this deception could have serious financial consequences.At the end of the day, sellers who believe they’ll be paying a 1% commission fee are actually setting themselves up for minimal service and additional expenses later on in the transaction. To truly make the most of a transaction, sellers need access to the kind of resources, service, and support that these discount brokers simply can’t (or won’t) provide.One major resource these discount brokers cut back on is marketing. And without marketing, getting top dollar simply isn’t possible. Sellers need as many buyers as possible to see their listing in order to achieve a successful sale.“To truly make the most of a transaction, sellers need access to the kind of resources, service, and support that these discount brokers simply can’t (or won’t) provide.”So, choosing an agent based on a discounted commission fee alone is actually a major mistake. You may save money up front, but you’ll certainly lose money in the long run.When you work with high-quality agents like us, though, you can expect to earn well above list price on the sale of your home. In fact, our team recently helped a seller earn $21,000 over asking price. These results more than make up for the amount sellers “save” when working with discount brokers.If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want to discuss how we can help you sell your home for top dollar, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

Luckily, we are here to help with removing inspection and appraisal surprises before they happen. Congratulations, you listed your home for sale and you accepted a contract. Now you are in a contingency period for the buyer when they get to have their inspections and appraisals completed.How do you remove the element of surprise from this situation? We work really hard to do this to make the process easier for you.With our listings, we like to have our inspections done up front. We remedy the situations, if there are any, before we list the property, or let you know about them so you know what to expect when something does come up in an inspection.Sometimes we run across some challenges with the appraisal. We like to meet with the appraiser to see if we can get ahead of problems if we can. These are things that can hold up or kill deals if you are not well aware of them.“We remedy any problems before we list, or we let you know about them early so you can know what to expect.”After selling thousands of homes, we have learned some tricks that make the deal go as smoothly as possible so you don’t get to the end and have it blow up, creating frustration for everybody.The worst thing that could happen is you are 17 to 20 days into a contract and you find out you have a $7,000 pest issue that needs to be resolved. It is better to know about this in advance so you can be prepared and negotiate. It will save you money during the process as opposed to paying at the last minute and struggling to find a contractor to come in. Doing this all beforehand prepares you.So, what are today’s buyers looking for in a property? Buyers are looking for turnkey homes. They are putting most of their money into purchasing this home and, if they are first-time home buyers, they don’t want to have additional expenses. They would like a house they can simply move into and call it “home.”If you have any questions about this topic or you have any other home buying questions, please email or call us.

        "category": "",
        "content": "As a buyer, it’s really important that you understand your rights to all of your home inspection options, even if you are buying an “as-is” property. If the seller has already done the majority of inspections, such as a pest inspection, roof inspection, or even the general home inspection, that will save you a little bit of money. If they have that available, you should absolutely take advantage of that. If they don’t, then you have what’s called a contingency period to get all of your inspections done. In our market, the contingency period is typically about 17 days. We always recommend that you order the general home inspection. You should also get a pest inspection to make sure there aren’t any active infestations and, of course, the roof inspection.Once you get those inspections done, make sure you go over the results with your real estate agent so that you understand what’s happening.In a competitive market, you may get counteroffers prior to an inspection asking that you buy the home “as-is.” However, it’s important to understand that you should never waive your right to an inspection. Even when you take an as-is counteroffer, you still have the right to review those inspections.“You should never waive your right to an inspection.”In our market, there really is no such thing as “as-is.” If there is something in the inspection report that frightens you to the point where you don’t want to move forward, you have the right to ask the seller if they will do those repairs. Buyers often don’t understand this, so they get scared, walk away from the contract, and lose out on really big opportunities. At the end of the day, when you’re in a contract, there is going to be negotiation. Your agent is there to represent you and make sure that you move forward confident about your purchase and that you know what your options are. One of the things we highly recommend is that you show up to your home inspection. You don’t have to go to the pest inspection or the roof inspection. Just wait for those reports to come back and then review them with your agent. If you have any other questions about home inspections or buying a home in the current market, just give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Congratulations! You are thinking about selling your home and you’ve decided to interview us. We are so excited to be candidates for your home sale. We wanted to share a few things that set us apart from other real estate agents and explain how we can sell your home for more money in less time. One of the things we do differently from most agents is that we have a very large marketing budget. We spend about $9,000 a month in marketing. Compare that $9,000 a month to the average agent who only spends $400 a month and you’ll see how we are able to get your home more exposure. We utilize radio, Zillow, Realtor.com, and Trulia so that your home always shows up on the first page of search results, not the 10th page. The more exposure that you get, the more money you will net on your home sale. We make sure to target Bay area buyers that come out to the Central Valley to buy homes. They are comparing their rent payment with potential mortgage payments, and they usually find that they can get a bigger home with a yard for the same as or even less than what they are paying in rent in San Jose.  When you hire us, you are hiring our team. We will be your main point of contact, but we have so many different resources to get your house ready for sale. For example, one of the things we love to do to get the house ready for sale is to hire cleaners for the property. That way, you don’t have to worry about it and your home will be sparkling clean. “We sell homes for 18% more than other local real estate agents.”Professional photography is also an important part of our team. Pictures are incredibly important because people will look at your home online before they come out to look at it in person. If you don’t have professional photography that makes your home pop, they will simply scroll over to the next home and never ask for a showing on your home. We believe in professional photography. Those are the costs that we incur to make sure that your home is shown in the best light possible.  We are aggressive in our approach to selling homes. We don’t just put your house on the MLS and wait for someone to buy it. We do things like prospecting, calling neighbors, mailing postcards, and talking to other brokers and agents to sell your home. More importantly, we go directly to the consumers who are looking to buy your home. We have a marketing budget that is unparalleled compared to the rest of the local competition, which means more money in your pocket. Since we are actively and aggressively marketing our listings, we are able to sell homes for 18% more than the average agent. We look for new buyers and we have an enormous database of existing buyers. When we list your house, we send the listing out to everybody that’s already in our database. Finally, we have real estate authorities that have recommended us to their listeners and followers because they know that we have a proven, marketable system that will get your home sold fast and for top dollar. We look forward to meeting you. If you have any questions in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would be happy to help you!",

Today, we’ll be answering some of the ones we’re asked most frequently. One of the main questions we’ve been hearing is, “How will this law impact investors?” Well, while we cannot give tax advice, we can certainly guide you through some of the key things you need to know. Simply set up a meeting with us and we would be happy to walk you through the ways in which you’ll be affected. Another question we’ve been getting a lot has to do with capital gains exemptions. People have been asking, “If I sell, do the old rules still apply?” Actually, one thing that hasn’t changed is that sellers still need only to have lived in their primary residence for two of the last five years to take advantage of capital gains exemptions. Again, we’re not tax professionals, but we do spend a lot of time with tax professionals.  With that being said, we would be happy to direct you to a tax professional who can guide you through your individual circumstances. “For most people dealing with real estate, your taxes will be less this year.”At the end of the day, who cares about the tax law? The law will affect everyone differently, so what you should really be concerned with is your individual circumstances. We work with CPAs to help you take full advantage of your situation.Ultimately, our point is this: You are not alone. We are here to help you understand these new changes.

        "content": "We have some exciting news to share today with homebuyers and home sellers alike. The FHA and conventional mortgage loan limits have gone up so we’re here today to give you the details.For homebuyers, the changes give you the ability to buy more home while putting down less. Instead of having to put down 10%, you can put down 3.5% and get a nicer home.In San Joaquin County, the FHA loan limit has been raised to $391,000. In Stanislaus County, that figure is up to $322,000. In higher-priced areas like Alameda, Contra Costa, Santa Clara, and San Francisco, the limit has gone up to $679,650. The conventional loan limit has also gone up to $453,000. If you’re a homebuyer in one of these areas, your buying power has been greatly increased. That’s great news.How will these changes affect sellers? Well, they will net more money for starters because of the increased buyer pool. This is a win-win for everyone who gets involved in this market. This increase comes after years of limits that were determined based on a national average. The new limits give more buying power to everyone, but especially those in higher-priced areas.“This is a huge jump from just a few years ago.”These changes won’t take effect until 2018, so this won’t affect most people who are writing a contract today. Finally, some good news about Stockton. It was recently ranked No. 4 in the country by Realtor.com as a high-growth area. What that means is that Stockton is going to see some heavy appreciation this year as one of the best markets in the country. This is a huge jump from just a few years ago. The Bay Area is getting maxed out, which is forcing people out to the Central Valley and pushing Stockton home values up quite a bit. This is great news for the Central Valley as we continue to grow.It’s really exciting to finally give some great news for both buyers and sellers. If you have any questions for us in the meantime or you want some advice on how to handle this market, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "2017 was a fabulous year for real estate, but it looks like the projections are even better for buyers and sellers—particularly sellers.We did do some research and pulled some trend graphics. We can do this for any zip code. Not all Realtors utilize this kind of data, but we’ve found that it scientifically helps us net you more money for your home.So, let’s take a look at the number of homes available versus the number of homes sold this year compared to 2016. In November of 2016, there were 1,142 homes on the market and 532 sold for San Joaquin County. This year, there were 967 homes active on the market and 666 sold homes, which means that we have a shortage of homes on the market.This is great news if you are thinking about selling your home, but don’t be fooled. Anybody can sell your house, but if you want to get top dollar in a certain amount of time, you need to hire the right Realtor.When hiring a Realtor, choose somebody that sells houses above market value. The numbers indicate that we’ve sold houses for 18% above the market value, which is huge.“We’ve sold homes for 18% over the market value.”In San Joaquin, the average days on market was 39, which is the same as last year. Inventory did slightly increase from 1.6 months in 2016 to 1.7 months in 2017, but we are still in a strong seller’s market.However, since the FHA loan limits and conventional loan limits have increased, buyers actually have more buying power.In Stanislaus County, there were 1,004 active listings and 416 sold homes in 2016, compared to 789 active listings and 430 sold homes this year. Shrinking inventory means more demand for the Stanislaus market as well. In 2016, the average days on market was 40, and this year, that number dropped to 35. Inventory did slightly increase from 1.7 months in 2016 to 1.9 months this year, but again, that is still a strong seller’s market.Again, if you want to get top dollar for your home, you need maximum exposure. The right Realtor can sell your home for above market value.If you have any questions about selling your home or would like some trend graphics for your specific neighborhood, just give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "What is probate and how can you avoid it?The typical probate situation we encounter goes something like this: An heir’s parents or grandparents have passed away and left them with an inherited property, and they don’t know what to do next. Probate is something we’ve encountered in the last couple of real estate deals we’ve handled. In those deals, we worked with people who thought their paperwork was complete when it actually wasn’t. In fact, we’re handling a deal now where the people involved thought they had their wills signed, but that didn’t hold up in court. Their will was hand-written and signed, but it wasn’t notarized.It’s never fun to be the bearer of bad news and explain how the probate process works and how long it might take. This is why it’s important to have a living trust in place. A living trust will save you time, money, and frustration because it allows you to bypass the court system. Court cases take a long time. Plus, they’re very expensive. In most cases, you’ll need to hire a legal document preparer or an attorney to help you, which, again, can cost a lot of money. All of this is made even more challenging considering you’re in the middle of the grieving process. “Having a living trust in place will save you time, money, and frustration.”If you’re facing a probate situation similar to one we mentioned above, reach out to us so we can help you outline your next steps. If you need an attorney, we know plenty of them, so we can direct you to the right ones. If you don’t hire the right attorney, it will cost you more time and frustration because probate might not be their specialty and they might not be aware of how the court system works in those cases.If you don’t have a living trust, we also recommend that you reach out to us. Having one will save you and your heir(s) a lot of grief and money.This is an area we specialize in, so if you have any questions about this topic or you need our help, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Why should you hire a listing agent? A lot of people call us because they are trying to sell their home on their own. They usually say something like, “We can’t get any offers. We don’t have enough buyers coming through even though I’ve had an open house.” As agents, we explain to these sellers that it’s incredibly important to have the house on the MLS. It’s also important to market the home to other Realtors so that they can bring buyers to your property. For Sale By Owner sellers often don’t realize how important marketing is. Most only budget a couple hundred dollars toward marketing their home. That simply isn’t enough. It’s very important to bring buyers and agents from outside of the area to your property, and listing agents can do that. You don’t want to keep your niche so small that you’re only marketing to your local community. A good listing agent will bring in buyers from out of the area and provide information about your community to them. A lot of real estate agents see a For Sale By Owner sign and call the seller relentlessly. Many of the FSBO sellers we talk to are frustrated by agents who pester them about their home. They say, “Stop making my phone ring! I’m looking for buyers, not agents.” There does tend to be a vulture effect on agents when they see a For Sale By Owner sign. They simply must try to get the listing. However, we are not here to take listings; we are here to sell houses for as much money as possible. We recently had a seller who had previously listed the house as For Sale By Owner on Zillow for over a year without any buyers. They called us, interviewed us, and finally selected us to sell their home. We had a full-price offer within one week. The property closed and everybody was happy. One of the problems the seller had before they hired us was that the seller disclosure package he had filled out did not meet all of the regulations in California. Had someone made an offer on the property when he was selling it himself, he could have wound up in a lot of legal trouble. Here in California, we have one-third of the world’s lawyers. FSBO sellers are vulnerable to lawsuits. You may think you are saving money by not paying a real estate agent commission, but you could end up paying even more money in legal fees down the road. A listing agent will make sure that everything is done in accordance with regulations in order to protect you from lawsuits. “Putting an ad in the local newspaper will not sell your home.”Again, the marketing budget is so important when selling your home. Most FSBO sellers only spend a couple hundred dollars and put an ad for the home in the local newspaper. However, the local newspaper is not going to sell your house. In fact, most buyers start their search online anyway. In order to sell your house, you need to market the home and make sure you have a strong internet presence. It’s also important to reach out to buyers outside of the area and agents who will be comfortable showing your house to their buyers. We spend $9,000 a month on our marketing to attract buyers to our listings. We target Bay Area buyers who are willing to purchase a home because they know it’s better to make a monthly mortgage payment of $2,500 to $4,000 than to put that money into rent. Finally, let’s take a look at the numbers. Our houses are selling for 100% to 103% of the listing price. Competing brokers in our area are only selling at 94% to 98% of their listing price, so those numbers really speak for themselves.If you have been trying to sell on your own or if you have any other questions about putting your house on the market, just give us a call or send us an email.

        "title": "3 Tips for Selling Your House",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today, we’d like to talk about some common mistakes made by sellers. We’d also like to share the three most common problems we’ve seen and give you some advice on how to avoid them.1. Make sure your home is priced correctly. Unfortunately, the information you get online is not always accurate. This is why it’s so important to hire a professional agent, so that you don’t overprice your home when you put it on the market. Overpriced listings will sit unsold on the market for a while. Then when they do garner offers, they often come in below market value. If a house sits for too long, potential buyers make these lowball offers because they will perceive the seller as desperate and willing to take a bid below market value. Overpriced listings sit on the market unsold, and then when they do garner offers, they often come in below market value. If a house sits for too long, potential buyers make these “lowball” offers because of the perception that the seller might be desperate and willing to take a bid below market value.2. Make sure your home is well-advertised. For our agency, advertising isn’t a problem. We know how important advertising is in order to successfully sell, and we work hard to ensure our properties are well-exposed. But we’ve seen other listings falter in this regard. The days of putting a sign out front and putting it on the MLS are long gone! In today’s market, it’s necessary to retain professional photography and a robust web-based presence. All effort must be made to draw interest to your property from outside your area. The average real estate agent spends about $250 monthly on marketing. That’s nowhere near enough to expose a property adequately in order to get the right buyer to your doorstep. Our own marketing budget of $9,000 per month insures that the properties we list are exposed not only professionally, but extensively.3. Make sure your home is presentable. Whenever your house is being shown, whether it’s for photographs, for open houses, or for individual appointments, your house has to be presentable. When a buyer sees your house, they have to feel like it’s move-in ready. It has to feel homey and comfortable. Make sure your home is fresh and clean. Make sure it smells clean, pathways are clear, and it’s bright. Don’t give a buyer an opportunity to start digging away at your price point. Also, many buyers are not able to see potential, and while a good real estate agent will do everything to help them, it’s always better for a buyer to walk in and feel at home in your property as it is. To this end, it’s smart to really declutter your property by putting as much as possible in the garage, if possible. Buyers generally focus on the living space, not the garage. Presenting a clean property is so important to selling successfully that we offer a professional cleaning staff that will thoroughly clean each of our properties before it’s photographed or  shown.“Overpriced listings sit on the market unsold, and then when they do garner offers, they often come in below market value.”For more information about buying or selling a home in today’s market, feel free to drop us a line.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Today we’re going to talk about a subject that is very important to us: pre-approvals. The pre-approval is definitely the most important aspect of submitting an offer on a home. As a listing agent, Eva will recommend that a seller goes with the offer that has the strongest pre-approval—not the one with a pre-qualification. The letter has to state that all of your documents have been reviewed and that the only thing missing at this point is the appraisal. Prior to starting our real estate company, I was a mortgage broker, so I understand the pre-approval process. I’ve found a few important things over the last 20 years of being in the business. You will save thousands of dollars if you focus on getting the pre-approval done before you go out shopping for homes. You will also make the entire buying process easier and less overwhelming. When people go out shopping first, they fall in love with a home. Then when they talk to a lender, they find that they are buying either way over their heads or way below what they can afford, and now they are stuck because they are under contract. There are a few things you should have ready when you go see your loan officer:   A month of pay stubs.   Two years’ worth of tax returns.   Three months’ worth of bank statements. This shows your lender where your down payment is coming from. Those are the main things everyone needs. Other documents you may need include anything about a divorce, bankruptcy, a short sale, or child support. “Make sure that you get pre-approved first.”Make sure you bring all of the documentation with you when you talk to your mortgage professional about a pre-approval. You will save thousands of dollars and a lot of heartache. Good mortgage brokers will also find you free money. There are a lot of great down payment assistance programs out there. We can help you do that. I’ve taught classes on how to get free money; I’m very passionate about it. There are a lot of agents out there who will try to talk you out of VA loans. That is not the case with us. We are huge VA advocates and we love helping veterans purchase a house. In a future video, we’ll cover all of the down payment assistance programs available to you as a homebuyer. In the meantime, if you have any other questions about pre-approvals, just give me a call or send me an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "When buying a home, there are several things you should never overlook. Today, we’re going to list a few. Here are eight things to pay attention to when buying a home:8. Make sure you have room to grow. If you’re thinking of having children down the line but don’t have any now, you should still plan ahead for the kind of space a family will require. Beyond physical space, you need to also think about what kind of resources are nearby. Are there schools, nurseries, or parks in the area?7. What’s the resale value? A great house in a not-so-great neighborhood may seem perfect for you right now. But, if you’re planning on moving in the next three to five years, you may take a hit on this kind of property.6. Pay attention to features that can’t be changed. Many things about a home can be customized or improved. However, some things are simply impossible, or at least very costly, to change. The floor plan, the lot, and other things like that need to be taken into mind.5. The need for specialty inspections. Houses with solar panels or other atypical features will need to have additional inspections beyond the basics. When it comes to solar in particular, you need to determine whether the panels have been leased or purchased.4. The bedroom-to-bathroom ratio. Depending on the size of your family, or the size of the family you plan to have, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms may be critical to a happy home life. If five people are living in a house with just one bathroom, this could spell trouble. 3. What are your covenants, codes, and neighborhood restrictions (CCNRs)? These restrictions are different from being in a homeowners association, but are still important to know. 2. What is your daily commute? This is especially important in our area. If your job is in town and it’s going to take you 25 minutes just to get to the freeway from your new home, you may want to think realistically about how purchasing this home would affect your daily life. Are you really going to be okay with your commute a year from now?1. What is your neighborhood like at all times of the day? Houses are typically shown during daylight hours. However, this gives you a very limited look of what your neighborhood will be like at any given time. If the property is near a school, drive by during school hours to see what traffic will be like. Also, if you are buying in a neighborhood where you feel a little unsafe, take a drive around at night to see if you feel comfortable. “If you don’t currently have children but plan on having some soon, you should still plan ahead for the kind of space a family will require.”If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

This is a great question since the right updates can really boost value in a property.First, we always recommend starting with the kitchen. Spending some money on bringing your kitchen up to date could bring you an 85% return on investment. So long as you’re careful not to spend more than 20% of your home’s value, kitchen remodeling is a great place to start when improving your home. In fact, the kitchen is one of the first places people look at during home showings.Next, you need to consider your curb appeal. Pay close attention to the condition of your siding. Is the siding off-color or peeling? Fixing these little issues, potentially by replacing the siding altogether, can bring huge returns. This kind of update can actually bring an 85% return on investment.Our third major area of focus is the bathrooms. Remodeling projects can actually be very therapeutic. Remodeling rooms like your kitchen or bathroom will definitely bring more money. Exceeding your home’s current value is easier than you think by making these key changes.“The right updates can really boost value in a property.”Some of these changes are fairly small. Sellers should consider replacing old our outdated windows. A move-in ready home is always going to be more attractive to buyers.Finally, you may want to consider remodeling the deck. When people put money into their deck, this can bring great returns for the effort. Putting time, money, and energy into the areas we mentioned today can really make a huge difference. If you don’t know where to start, we have the systems in place to help out. We’ve got a lot of connections that we’d love to share with you. Use our expertise and our resources. We want to help you maximize your investment. The best part is that we don’t charge anything extra for providing you with this help. It’s all a part of what we do to get your home sold for top dollar. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. ",

        "content": "Does working with a listing agent benefit you as a homebuyer?Not really. You’re much better off working with someone who will get you the best deal and make sure you’re properly represented. We’re not inferring that a listing agent won’t do that, but we can speak from experience when we say that agents who are more dominant on the listing side can’t give a buyer all of the attention they need when they want to look for houses.This is why we have a buyer’s team who is very well trained and knows how to write a buyer’s offer so that it gets accepted. They’ll take you out and show you not only our listings, but every other agent’s listings in the area that meets your criteria too. Hopefully, we can also put you in touch with a lender and make your offer even stronger.“You want your own representation, and you want that person to fight on your behalf.”Remember—listing agents are hired to represent the seller first. This means that as a buyer, you’re secondary to them. Think of it this way—if you went to court, would you hire the same attorney to represent you that’s representing the other person? Probably not.The best way to get a great deal as a homebuyer is to go in strong with someone who will represent you properly and with whom you can feel comfortable with knowing they have your best interests at heart.If you have any questions about finding the right representation or any other real estate topic, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to speak with you.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Lately, a lot of buyers have been asking, “How can I get my offer accepted in such a competitive market?” Last week, we put a home on the market and, after 60 people came through the open house, we got 17 offers on the home. So, what made the offer that got accepted stand out above everyone else? First of all, the buyer came in with a pre-approval, which is incredibly important. You want to come in prepared. You should also work with a strong local lender. We felt comfortable with the lender this buyer chose, so we were able to call and get confirmation that the buyer was ready to go. The offer was also written very well. This particular offer was written by someone who obviously knew and understood our marketplace. The offer was concise. They shortened their inspection period, which does not hinder the buyer at all. If you have a buyer’s agent who knows what they’re doing, they can get all of this stuff done up front. The buyer wants to know that the house is in good condition, and the seller wants to know where you stand early on in the process. “Write a clean, concise offer.”Removing those contingencies will definitely strengthen your offer. You also need to work with a strong, knowledgeable buyer’s agent. Your buyer’s agent should be comfortable contacting the listing agent to let us know what’s going on. A good, proactive buyer’s agent wants to communicate with the listing agent. A lot of buyers also write letters to the seller. While sellers really do take those stories into consideration, at the end of the day, the seller is going to look at their bottom line. Sometimes there is an emotional attachment, but the seller is really looking for somebody who’s going to close on the house. So, absolutely go ahead and write your letters. Just keep in mind that it’s more important to make sure that your offer is written correctly, your lender is on your side, and your agent knows and understands how important it is to communicate with the listing agent. If you have any other questions about buying a home in this competitive market, give us a call or send us an email.

He had some really nice things to say about our team and specifically, our guaranteed sale program. Here’s what he had to say:“The solution is Ron and Eva Cedillo at Home Buyers Realty. They give you the homebuyer guarantee. You’ll meet with them and agree on a price and a deadline. If the deadline passes and your home isn’t sold, they’ll buy your home. Their marketing system is on an entirely different level than any other agent because they invest in making sure your home gets seen and their buyers know about your home.”D.J. also shared a story about a recent client we worked with:“After many life changes and financial stress, Esteban needed to sell his home in Tracy fast. After having it listed with another agent for eight months with no success, he hired Ron and Eva. With their aggressive marketing system, it sold in just one week at his listing price of $645,000.”“With our guarantee, there is no risk.”With our guarantee, there is no risk. If you want to get out of your contract, we will let you out free and clearly. However, we are rarely taken up on that offer because we continue to sell homes for top dollar.Thanks again to D.J. and KAT 103 for recommending us. If you have any questions for us about our team, our guarantee, or the real estate market in general, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Inventory is still very low here in the Tracy market, which is great news if you’ve been planning on selling your house. As a market, we’re averaging about 81 sales a month, and there are about 119 homes on the market. These numbers indicate a tight market that’s good for sellers. Even though conditions favor sellers, you still have to price your house right.It’s absolutely a seller’s market, indicated by the fact that we have just 1.46 months of supply. That means if no new homes came on the market, we would sell out of the currently available homes in about a month and a half. When inventory is anywhere under four months, it’s considered a seller’s market, and as you get closer to zero, it becomes an even stronger seller’s market. Between four and eight months of inventory signifies a normal market, and eight months and higher would indicate a buyer’s market.“It’s absolutely a seller’s market.”You have to consider these stats when writing an offer on a home. Due to current conditions in the Tracy market, selling your home now would likely mean you would receive multiple offers for your home and even some over list price—if you hire the right real estate team and price it correctly.If you’d like to know any market information about your specific area or an area you’re interested in, or you have any questions about real estate, you can always give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "When you sell your house, there are certain things you can do to make sure you don’t leave any money on the table.Some recent clients, John and Lauren, are a perfect example of how our marketing plan accomplishes this. We had to compete against some other brokers for their listing. Like most others, getting the most money for their home was very important to them.On the first weekend after listing their home, we had more than 40 families come through on the first day of the open house and received more than 14 offers. This allowed them to get more money than they ever imagined for their home. They also got the terms they wanted in the offer.“We take pride in making sure sellers walk away from their deal feeling good about everything.”For instance, we knew John and Lauren needed to stay in the home a little after the sale and that the home needed some repairs that they were concerned about negotiating. Since we had bid up the price so high, we also knew it might not appraise. We negotiated a deal to let them stay for a week longer, and while the houses didn’t appraise, we negotiated a deal to have the buyer pay the difference between the offer price and the appraised value.We take a lot of pride in making sure sellers walk away from their deal feeling good about everything, and we accomplished that with John and Lauren.If you’re thinking about selling your home or you’d just like to learn more about marketing strategy and how it helps you sell your house for the most money possible, give us a call or send us an email.

To answer it, we focus on four things in particular that will save you a lot of time, money, and frustration:1. Curb appeal: What’s the first the first thing you want buyers to see when they drive up to the house? Is the lawn green? Is the grass trimmed? Do you have some nice, colorful flowers planted?2. Decluttering: Buyers don’t want to see your personal items. You want to make your house look as big and spacious as possible. Specifically, your countertops must be clear, clean, and shiny.3. Repainting: Be careful with the tones that you select. What may be a beautiful or appropriate color to you may not be to someone else. You want buyers to be able to walk inside your house and see their own furniture and decor. We suggest you use earth tones.4. Pets, smoke, and smells: You may have grown accustomed to all the odors in your house, but it’s very important that you understand that a buyer is coming in with a fresh nose.“You want buyers to be able to walk inside your house and see their own furniture and decor.”These tasks will net you a generous return of both time and money.

        "title": "4 Mistakes to Avoid When Buying Your First Home",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "There are four common mistakes that first-time homebuyers make that you should avoid: 1. Not getting pre-approved before you look at homes. That would be like going on a shopping spree without knowing how much money is in your bank account. It’s important to get pre-approved so that you don’t fall in love with a home you can’t afford. On the other hand, getting pre-approved also prevents you from “underbuying” a home and winding up in a bad neighborhood when you could have actually afforded your dream home. 2. Not moving fast enough. If you just sit around and wait for a home in today’s fast, competitive market, then you will lose out. Don’t wait and watch your dream home slip away from you because someone else made a move and you didn’t. Taking action will definitely benefit you in today’s market. 3. Making a lowball offer. Everyone wants to save money, but we are in an extremely competitive market. As your agent, we will tell you how to make the best offer so that you can beat the competition without breaking the bank. However, it’s important that the offer isn’t so low that it insults the seller. We will work to negotiate with the seller and find the price that works for you. 4. Relying too heavily on the Internet. Zillow and Realtor.com can provide great information on some real estate topics. However, their home value estimates can be off by as much as 15%. That is a lot of money when it comes to buying a home. Plus, think of it this way: If you were sick, would you rely solely on WebMD or would you go to a doctor? You would go to a doctor! Having a true expert work for you will save you time, frustration, and money. As real estate experts, we have the inside track through the MLS that these websites do not have. “Make sure that you get pre-approved before you start shopping for homes.”When you work with a real estate agent to buy a home, you are not responsible for paying the agent. Why not work with us for free and rely on us to get you the right information so that you can successfully buy a home? If you have any other questions about avoiding these four mistakes or if you would like to know more about real estate in general, just give me a call or send me an email. ",

        "category": "",
        "content": "When you sell your home, there are four main pitfalls you need to watch out for when coming up with a list price.  Overpricing your home out of the market: When people search for homes on websites like Zillow or Trulia, they search in a certain price range. If you price high because you’re trying to get top dollar, your home will be in a range where many buyers will never even see it. You want to price correctly.   The home stays on the market too long: Everyone will begin to wonder what’s wrong with the home. The longer it’s on the market, the more reasons buyers will create to make a lower offer. An appraisal will determine the value of your home. Appraisers work for the bank, not the buyer or the seller. This price is critical because the bank won’t lend on a price that’s too high in case they get stuck with a foreclosure.  Even if you get a higher offer, you’ll have to renegotiate the price if the appraisal is low: At that point, you’ll be 30 to 45 days in, swaying the negotiation power to the buyers. Over our 15 years in the industry, we’ve certainly learned that overpriced homes take a long time to sell.  You’ll lose negotiation power:Buyers will know they have leverage if a house sits on the market for too long. We use a strategy of pricing your home effectively so that we have multiple buyers bidding on your home. You want that negotiation power on your side, not theirs. Having buyers competing for your home is how we get the maximum price in the shortest amount of time.“Overpriced homes almost always take a long time to sell.”If you have any other questions about the best strategies for pricing your home in the Tracy, CA market, give me a call or send me an email.
