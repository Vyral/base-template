Thereâs so much untouched beauty here, and I love visiting.My recent trip out here was a special one because it was with my team.As a team, itâs great to get out of the office setting, spend some quality time with each other, and then come back and serve our customers on a much higher level because we work together better.âThis was great for our team to spend some quality time together.âWe are natives to Northwest Florida and live a coastal lifestyle, and we can deliver expert local advice for our customers in order to deliver the ultimate results that they desire.If you have any questions for us about the real estate market, buying or selling a home, or anything else, give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

Bella Coola is one of the most remote mountain regions in the world. There are 2.5 million acres of terrain.

Here are just a few examples:  Moving expenses.  New furniture.  Window treatments.  Dishes and cutlery.  Shower curtains.âI was amazed when I bought my first home to see just how lengthy and expensive a process it was.âThere are many more beyond what Iâve listed. I was amazed when I bought my first home to see just how lengthy and expensive a process it was to fully furnish and decorate the home. Between shelving, appliances, paper goods, and more, fine details can really add up.For that reason, itâs important to do some budgeting beforehand. Compile a list of the things youâll need when you move in so that you arenât surprised at the additional costs associated with your new home. However, donât buy these items prior to closing. This can have a negative impact on your loan.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Mike Ragsdale, owner and founder of 30A.com, has an amazing story behind the foundation of the 30A brand, and Iâm proud to be able to interview him and share that story with you.Mike business background started at the University of Alabama, where he graduated with a masterâs degree in advertising and public relations. âDespite how clever and educated I thought I was, I couldnât get a job,â Mike recalls. He then bought a computer and forced himself to start a graphic design business. He ran that company successfully for seven years, and it grew in size to about 60 or 70 employees. After that, though, he had a long string of business failures. Those failures, however, led him to move to the Emerald Coast and start 30A.Mike had been vacationing in this area for years, and he always felt that it was a special place. âThe natural beauty is just unparalleled, and it felt like the perfect place to raise a family,â he says. When he arrived at the Emerald Coast, the area didnât have a cohesive brand. 30A was not used to the degree that it is todayâa company in Texas actually owned the URL. Every individual community in the Emerald Coast had its own brand, but the one thing that tied all of them together was Highway 30A.âToday, we really donât view it as a locationâwe view it as a lifestyle.â What he means when he says that is scenic 30A here in South Walton is just one of four 30A roads. State Road 30 runs from the Alabama state line to Perry, Florida, and there are four alternate routes (hence the âAâ) that branch off that old state highway. 30A isnât just hereâthereâs also a 30A in Bay County and two 30As in Franklin County. To him, the 30A idea evokes small-town America and âoldâ Florida.âItâs a lifestyle brand, not a tourism brand.âMike originally moved here to become a writer, so he initially bought the 30A.com domain name to be a blog. He had no intention of turning it into a business, but after several years of developing the URL, people started asking him if they could advertise on the site, and he agreed. He describes this evolution as âvery organic and unintentional.âToday, 30A.com has three different divisions: the digital division, the retail division, and licensing division.The digital division includes their radio station, mobile app, Facebook page, and their websites. Their retail division includes their four 30A stores, but their apparel can be found in over 100 locations nationwide. âThink of it as Patagonia,â he explains. âPatagonia is a place, but you donât have to go to Argentina to wear Patagonia apparel.â Their licensing division takes first-class products and licenses their brand to the companies that produce them.Mike was surprised by how fast his company grew, but as an entrepreneur, he always has an eye for growth and business. Having 900,000 Facebook fans is something he never really anticipated, but he thinks theyâre just getting started, and theyâre now focused on taking the brand national. Not the tourism brandâthe lifestyle brand.âI tell people itâs small-town America at the beach, and thatâs what weâre trying to capture in everything that we do.âAs to where 30A.com ranks online, itâs difficult to say and depends on a few different metrics. To them, though, the goal isnât about online rankings. They view their website as a way to share stories. Everything they do in their company comes down to four words: âWe love the beach.â That could mean loving it in ways that include music, cocktails, food, and lifestyle, and also loving it in ways that mean preserving and protecting the beach itself. Thatâs where they feel the company is going as much as the digital side.Whatâs next for 30A.com? Theyâre about to launch their 30A Sessions concert, and they have Lady Antebellum as their first opening act. They also have several shows coming up next year featuring big names and world-class talent which will be captured for broadcasts on major networks.30A is a blessing for our area, and weâre glad theyâre here. We all look forward to seeing whatâs next for them. If you have any questions about this interview, feel free to reach out to me. Iâd be happy to chat with you.",

        "content": "Fall is upon us, and with it the end of the high season for real estate.However, if youâre thinking youâve missed your chance to sell your home, let me reassure you.This autumn actually presents a fantastic moment to sell.Â Hereâs why.First off, housing inventory is still pretty low along the Emerald Coast.In fact, according to data from the Census Bureau and the National Association of Realtors, inventory remains well below historic averages, and is 50% less than the peak in 2006.Second, while mortgage rates also remain very low, recent announcements by the Federal Reserve might cause them to finally start rising.This would make mortgages less affordable and might turn away a significant number of potential buyers.This is even more of a concern when you consider the continuing growth of home pricesâ6.9% in the last year alone.Third, contrary to conventional wisdom, fall is generally a great time to list your home.Buyers in the fall are likely to be more seriousÂ because they have probably been searching for months without success.Also, because fewer homes are listed in the fall, this meansÂ thereâs even less competitionÂ than weâve seen due to the general low inventory.So what do you get when you put all those things together?Well, if you were to list your home right now, chances are good that you would be able to sell it and for a solid price.On the other hand, if you decide to wait, the situation might not be as favorable because mortgage rates might rise or because new construction might pick up.That means the time to list your home is now.You can get started with this home value calculator on my website, which takes into account recent Northwest Florida sales:Enter your home address to find out what your home is currently worth.This calculator will give you a good idea of what your home is worth.And if you would like a more precise estimate of what your home could sell for this fall, or if you have any other questions about the current Destin real estate situation, give me a call at 850.632.0136.

        "content": "Today Iâm super excited to bring you a look at a place my family and I have been visiting for years: the Tortoise Clinic. The acupuncture and herbal medicine they provide here are both absolutely amazing.To help me explain what the clinic does, I spoke with medical director Drew Smith. Drew first got involved in acupuncture fairly early in life. In middle school, he developed an interest in martial arts and in Eastern culture in general.It was specifically his junior year in high school when Drew says he first stumbled across the subject of Eastern medicine. He was browsing the shelves at a bookstore when he came across some material on the subject and was immediately fascinated.After graduating, Drew went on to graduate school at Florida State University. There, he met his future wife. When she had to return home to Japan, he knew he had to do whatever it took to follow her there.He received a scholarship from the Japanese government, allowing him to pick any university and course of study. On his second day of classes, he met a neighbor who happened to be a scholar of Chinese medicine The two began to practice tai chi together in the parks on campus.Drew briefly returned to FSU, but then returned to Japan. He had sustained some injuries from judo, and found that Eastern medical treatments worked very well for them. From then on, he knew he wanted to study this kind of medicine. So, he found a school in Maryland and has been working in related fields sinceâThe possibilities for what Eastern medicine can achieve are as broad as the field itself.âWith all of that traveling, I wondered why Drew returned specifically to the Emerald Coast. He told me that since he grew up in Florida, he had always known and thought of our area as the stateâs âsweet spot.â He didnât originally have plans of returning to Florida, but ultimately wanted to fully pursue acupuncture and Eastern healing.Having previously worked in a chiropractic clinic, he knew it was time to pursue his passion. It was actually when he saw an ad for an acupuncture business online that he decided to reply and see what would happen. Thatâs when he found the Tortoise Clinic. Next thing Drew knew, he and his wife moved to the area and have been here for nearly 10 years.As far as the benefits of acupuncture and eastern medicine, Drew believes the possibilities are as broad as the field itself. Â He says you could spend a lifetime studying the use of plants as medicine, and there would still be more to learn. In order to do this for a living, he believes you have to be able to help every pain there is.Personally, he enjoys helping people boost their fertility. He also says that acupuncture can benefit people emotionally and digestively. Eastern medicine has been around for so long and is largely about your body healing itself through stimulation from acupuncture and herbal medicine.If youâd like to learn more about the Tortoise Clinic, you can visit their website at www.TheTortoiseClinic.com. To drop by in person, simply go to 2441 US Highway 98 W Unit 111, Santa Rosa Beach. Their phone number is (850) 267-5611. I highly recommend checking them out.Also, for all of your real estate needs, call The Nathan Abbott Team at (850) 632-0136. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Today Iâm excited to feature a great local restaurant that is sure to impress: CuvÃ©e Kitchen and Wine Bar.The owners, Chris Ruyan and Tyler Jarvis, are both experienced restaurateurs here on the Emerald Coast. On top of CuvÃ©e Kitchen, they also own Jackacudas and Brotulaâs Seafood House and Steamer.Since I had the opportunity to sit down with Chris and Tyler, I decided to ask them a few questions.First, I wanted to know how the inspiration for CuvÃ©e Kitchen came to light. According to Chris, it was an evolution of their shared vision for restaurants they enjoyed. Chris and Tyler wanted to create a great menu as well as an amazing atmosphere. From the beginning, they wanted CuvÃ©e Kitchen to be a place where people could gather to enjoy food, drink, and company.Staying true to this vision is something that has always been important to themâeven now following their recent relaunch of the restaurant. The space has been opened up and the format of the dining experience has been changed, as well.âCuvÃ©e Kitchen is a place where people can gather to enjoy food, drink, and company.âSocial interaction through intimate spacing, small plates, and craft-style cocktails are all key features that Chris and Tyler have tried to bring with this relaunch. They wanted to create a fun and interactive experience instead of the more quiet atmosphere that is usually associated with upscale dining.Also, because they use fresh ingredients, the cuisine at CuvÃ©e Kitchen is always unique. The chefs have a lot of freedom to create different items on a daily basis. Recently, Chris and Tyler have begun to think about implementing a rotation-style menu that would change four times a year depending on the season.But the food isnât all that makes CuvÃ©e Kitchen unique. The restaurant also offers a wide variety of cocktails. CuvÃ©e Kitchen carries a lot of different craft cocktails that arenât typically found in the area, as well as some imported spirits.The âCorrupt Bargainâ cocktail is Tylerâs personal favorite. A spin on a traditional Manhattan, the Corrupt Bargain is a blend of single barrel and rye whiskey complemented with Carpano Antica and vermouth. Finally, the drink also has a flamed orange peel, which provides a unique and delicious smokiness.Food and drink arenât the only things CuvÃ©e Kitchen has to offer. Each week from Monday through Saturday between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., the restaurant hosts a social hour. From 9 p.m. to close on those same days, you can experience the reverse social hour.Each of these hours will feature small bites, sushi, local fish beignets, cocktails, and more.To learn more about CuvÃ©e Kitchen, you can visit their website: www.CuveeKitchen.com. Also, if youâre interested in dropping by to experience it for yourself, you can find the restaurant in downtown Destin at 26120 Emerald Coast Parkway.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "We give our customers a buyerâs guide that shares the 10 commandments of things you should never do when going through the process. Today Iâve listed those ten things below:1. Thou shalt not change your job or quit your job during the mortgage approval period. Even if youâve been awarded a promotion or offered a chance to change your environment, you donât want to make these changes during the loan process. Lenders like consistency, not change.2. Thou shalt not buy furniture or decor for your home before you buy it.Sometimes people use their funds that they have set aside for the closing and buy furniture or home decor. Itâs easy to get excited, but you donât even own the home yet! Focus on the mortgage first and then when you close, you can start looking at furniture for your home.3. Thou shalt not use credit cards excessively and miss your payment due dates. Little dings can affect your credit and youâd be surprised at how much that can put you in jeopardy of not being approved for your home loan. Keep that spending at a minimum and make your payments on time.4. Thou shalt not buy a car, boat, truck, or any large item.Itâs not a good idea to get a loan on that item, and even if youâre paying cash, itâs better to wait to make that purchase until your mortgage process is complete.5. Thou shalt not omit debts from your credit application. A lot of times folks want to make themselves look good on paper and leave stuff off their loan application. Omitting any items could get you in trouble and jeopardize your loan process if any of those things come up.âLenders like consistency, not change.â6. Thou shalt not stop paying rent or your current mortgage payment during the loan process. This can greatly affect your credit if you miss payments, and you can lose your loan approval for your new home.7. Thou shalt not originate any inquiries to your credit during the mortgage process. Lenders donât like a lot of change. Donât make a lot of inquiries to your credit and keep things neutral during that process.8. Thou shalt not cosign for someone elseâs loan. You may want to help a friend or family, and they may make the payments on time, but it could affect your ability to get your loan approved so itâs best to hold off while youâre going through this process.9. Thou shalt not make large deposits into your account without letting your lender know first. These deposits have to be verified at the source that they come from and you can get some advice from your lender about which accounts to deposit the funds into.10. Thou shalt not change bank accounts or make a lot of transfers from one bank account to the other. You donât want to make a lot of changes while youâre going through the mortgage process, so keep those funds where theyâre at as much as possible.If you have any questions about this topic, or youâre looking to buy or sell a home, give us a call.

There are so many wonderful places to explore by water to create memories that last forever.Recently I visited the Fort Walton Beach sound on the west side of Mary Esther to do a little boating on the adjoining intercoastal waterway and along the Destin harbor. There are many beaches like the one Iâm standing on in the video above scattered up and down the coastline, and weâre fortunate to live in such a beautiful area.âWeâd be honored to give you a private tour of waterfront properties if you want.âDestinâs original tag line was âThe Worldâs Luckiest Fishing Villageâ due to our vast variety of fish, but weâre now also recognized as one of the top coastal vacation destinations in the country.We live this lifestyle and if you ever want to explore waterfront real estate opportunities by boat, we would be honored to give you a private tour. Looking at real estate and our area by water gives you a much different perspective than by land.If you have any questions or you think you might like to take a ride to look at some waterfront properties, donât hesitate to give me a call.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "More often than not, whenever we have people looking for a resort condominium project to buy, the first thing they desire is low condo association fees. Is it a good idea to seek out low condo association fees, though?No, itâs not. This is the wrong mentality to have because it could negatively affect you in the long run. When these fees are too low, the property typically isnât being properly maintained, no reserves are being built for future replacements or improvements, and thereâs not enough staff to properly run the HOA. Without these things, the building usually falls into disarray and ages much quicker.I prefer to see a see a building that has great financials in place, whose budget is being met, and for which a constant reserve is being built for future improvements of the building. When a reserve isnât being built, thatâs when you get popped with an unexpected fee thatâs a much larger amount in one bulk fee versus one thatâs dispersed over time.âYou can see the difference between a building thatâs being properly funded and one that isnât.âCondo association fees also cover a lot of items in the building. They cover all of your utilities except for the electric and all of your exterior insuranceâthe only other insurance policy youâll usually have to get is a contents policy, which costs about $1,200 a year. They also cover liability insurance for the common areas and the maintenance for the common areas. You can really see the difference in a building thatâs being properly funded and one whose fees are too low.If you consider what those fees are compared to an individual homeâs costs, itâs usually a wash. When it comes to an individual home, you pay your fees in smaller increments. For instance, if you pay an $800 per month fee for a condo as part of the association, think about what youâd pay in a home at times. You might need to shell out $150 for the landscaping, $150 for the pool maintenance, and pay for all the exterior maintenance and insurance to boot. These costs can amount to more than the condo fee itself. Condos are more convenient because they charge a flat fee and you donât have to keep up with all the bills.Condos also offer a great way of life down here. They allow you to be closer to the Gulf or right on the beach at an affordable price. Overall, thereâs less maintenance and you can come and go as you please.Weâre extremely knowledgeable on every condominium from Fort Walton beach to Panama City Beach and everything in between, so if youâre looking for a condominium or you have any other questions, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

        "content": "Have you been to Vinâtij Wine Boutique &amp; Bistro yet? We recently sat down with owner Todd Reber to give you a taste of what youâre missing in our latest local venue spotlight.Todd got started in the restaurant industry through a series of jobs he held in college. That experience led him to decide that the marriage of food and wine seemed like a great lifestyle. He gravitated toward it because he enjoyed the camaraderie of restaurant tours and the crowds that came through. When he graduated from Florida State, he discovered he actually made more money in the restaurant industry than he could in a professional field. He decided to challenge himself and open up Vinâtij.âItâs been a good run for the last 17 years,â Todd says.He chose Destin as his location because Miramar Beach was close to his home and it was a big destination for outlet stores, which allowed him to use that synergy to test out his concept. 15 years ago, all of the fine wines were earmarked for restaurants. According to Todd, if you wanted a fine wine to take home and enjoy with your friends, you had very few choices. His idea was to find boutique wines and offer them at a reasonable price that you could either enjoy at the restaurant or take home with you.âWe always feel welcome at Vinâtij, and the food is superb.âIn his opinion, the people make Vinâtij stand apart from the competition. He also noted Chef John and his fare, which is fresh and consistently good, and the employees that work there, who are all lifers and have helped to create a family atmosphere.âWe try to welcome everybody that walks in the door,â he says. âWe know weâve got only this moment to make it well and make it right, and thatâs what we focus on. We donât focus on what happened yesterday or whatâs going to happen tomorrowâweâre in the now.âHe prefers guestsâ experience to be simple. He knows theyâre there to have a great meal, and their goal is to help them do so.This is a place our team loves to go to, and itâs one of the top-rated restaurants in town. We always feel welcome there, the food is always superb, and they support the local residents. We highly recommend you try the experience for yourself.We want to thank Todd for sitting down to talk with us.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are five creative tips that will help you get a great deal on the perfect property.1. Be very specific about what you want. The more you share with us, the easier it will be to find that dream property. Donât be afraid to let us know what you would be uncomfortable with spending, either. Everything you tell us will help us find the right pool of options that perfectly align with your needs.2. Be financially well documented. If youâre taking out a loan, make sure you are pre-approved and have that pre-approval letter before you start looking at homes. If youâre a cash buyer, youâll still want to have some form of financial verification to present to the seller. Having that paperwork presents you as a serious buyer. Weâll align you with the best lender for your needs that is already familiar with properties in our area.âThe more you share with us, the easier it will be to find that dream property.â3. Act quickly. Weâll be sending you properties as soon as they hit the market, so when you see one that checks off all the boxes, be ready to see it and possibly make an offer. Chances are, youâll be one of six or seven people also looking at that same home, so be prepared to pounce.4. Come in with a market-appropriate offer. Donât try to undercut the sellers. A low offer could cause the seller to reach out to other interested parties, creating a bidding war and ultimately driving up the price. If you present a great offer right off the bat, the seller will only be focused on yours so you can avoid that competition.5. Minimize contingencies. If you write in a bunch of ways in which you can get out of or cancel a contract, a seller isnât going to take you very seriously. You want to include some contingencies to make sure youâre protected, but limit the amount to show you are serious about closing on that property.If you have any questions or need any help buying or selling your home, please donât hesitate to give us a call.

        "content": "As a home seller, what can you do to get your home ready for the photo shoot, the market, and for buyer showings?When potential buyers pull up to your house, the outside needs to be just as inviting as the inside. This means having your bushes trimmed back, your driveway and home pressure washed, fresh light bulbs, and maybe some fresh cut flowers. If the exterior of your home is in disarray, that buyer may just keep driving because they got a bad first impression of your home.As they walk through your front door, itâs important to have all of your carpets vacuumed and your home smelling clean and fresh.You should also make sure that your home is free of all personal items. Take down family photos and make sure that there arenât any books stacked on the counter or above cabinets. You want the buyer to feel like this can be their home, and if your personal stuff is lying around everywhere, they will feel like they are intruding in someone elseâs home.âA few small fixes can go a long way.âItâs important to have all of the smaller items in your home functioning correctly. Check on cabinet hinges, sliding glass doors, and more.During the showing, we recommend that you have jazz music playing or cookies baking. Doing so will show buyers that you have pride in homeownership. We provide a professional stager to all of our clients. The stager will come in and let you know what you need to do to make showings fantastic. Sometimes just switching out the comforters on the beds or adding a new lamp makes all the difference. Little changes go a long way; you donât have to spend a lot of money to make your home more appealing to buyers.Hopefully some of these tips will help you sell your home faster and maximize your price. Itâs all about the little touches and the experience the buyer has from the moment they pull up in front of your home. If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email.

There are indications that itâs converting into a buyerâs market but some of that is due to December being a traditionally slow month for a vacation market, such as ours.We are in one of the fastest-growing areas in the country for primary residents, and weâre being discovered on a national level. Growing up in this area, I can tell you that, historically, most of our real estate traffic has come from the Southeast region. Now, though, we have residents coming from as far away as California.âOur area is being discovered on a national level.âIn the past, whenever we had a rise or fall in the market, there was so much speculation in our area that a lot of people who bought properties didnât have the holding power to keep them and shouldnât have been buying those properties on the level that they were. Today, there isnât nearly as much speculation. The activity in our market now is based more on our exposure and people wanting to live in our area.If you get a loan, lenders are very strict right now about who theyâre lending to. There is a lot of cash entering our market, and thatâs a strong indication of longevity. Another indicator I always look at in gauging market strength is how the commercial growth is happening in that area, and our commercial growth has been great lately. We have a brand-new 5-star hotel, a new Whole Foods, and plenty of new shopping centers up and down Highway 98. These property developments are all signs of a strengthening market.Shopping and Entertainment, Brand New and Expansions:Destin CommonsPier ParkPier Park NorthThe HUB30 AvenueNew Hotels:The Henderson (5 star)The Pearl of RosemaryThe Hampton InnIf you have any questions about our market or if thereâs anything I can assist you with, please feel free to give me a ring or shoot me an email.
