        "content": "These factors are changing as the housing market continues to shift.In case you weren’t aware, the real estate market is changing. We’re moving away from an extreme seller’s market, and things are slowly becoming more normalized. Today I’ll tell you about the three biggest changes that I’ve noticed lately:1. Inventory. In March, the Phoenix area MLS had about 4,000 listings, but we now have about 18,000. That shows demand has fallen below the rate of new listings, which is causing our supply to rise.2. Interest rates. Interest rates are currently around 6% for a well-qualified buyer who puts 20% down. That impacts affordability, meaning fewer people are willing to purchase a property at our current prices.“Things are slowly becoming more normalized.”3. Expectations between buyers and sellers. Buyers are noticing that the market is shifting, while some sellers are still clinging to the dynamics of the past market where they were getting 25 offers in one weekend. Those days are over.We’re moving toward a more normal market cycle. As things settle down, it’s very important to work with a great agent that understands the local market, pricing and marketing strategies, and negotiation tactics. If you have any questions about buying or selling a home, please give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to set up a free consultation. ",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are three key benefits to using real estate as an investment vehicle.If you haven’t invested in real estate yet, why not? There are so many great benefits to doing so. Here are my top three:1. Cash flow. This is the measure of the income a property will generate after all expenses are covered. It’s monthly income you can use to pay your bills or put into other savings and investments.2. Equity. This is the difference between the value of the property and the amount you owe on the mortgage. As renters pay rent, you’ll use that money to pay off your mortgage, and your loan balance will decrease. Real estate appreciates about 3% to 5% per year historically, although we’ve seen double-digit appreciation over the last few years.3. Tax benefits. As an investor, you’re able to depreciate the value of that property over time to offset your active income. Many high-earning, self-employed individuals pay a lot in taxes. A way to shelter themselves is to purchase investment properties and use the IRS tax rules to depreciate those assets over time and offset their income tax burden.“We’ve seen double-digit appreciation over the last few years.”If you’re interested in exploring your investment options or just have any real estate-related questions, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon. ",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Three ways inflation can benefit homeowners and real estate investors.How does inflation affect real estate? As an agent and investor, I study how inflation impacts both me and our market. I follow Keith Weinhold and his podcast, “Get Rich Education.” He talks about three ways inflation benefits both investors and homeowners: price appreciation, debt debasement, and cash flow enhancement. Let’s talk about what he means:1. Home prices will appreciate. The price of your home will go up in an inflationary environment because there’s more capital available to bid up the value.“Inflation benefits both investors and homeowners.”2. Your loan will be easier to pay off. The dollars you’re bringing in will be less valuable than the dollars you spent to get the loan on your home. Likely, inflation will outpace your mortgage’s interest rate, so it will be easier to pay off your mortgage with those less valuable dollars.3. You will get more cash flow from investments. Rents typically rise during inflationary times. However, if you have a 30-year mortgage, your payments will stay the same. That means your monthly net income will increase over time.If you have any questions or want to profit from inflation using real estate, call or email me. I’d be happy to schedule a free consultation with you.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Whether you’re a buyer or seller, you need a home inspection. Are you thinking about buying or selling a home soon? If so, you should probably get an inspection; yes, even the sellers. Today I want to talk about why inspections are important to both parties in a real estate transaction. In my opinion, every seller should get a pre-inspection before they list. This way, you can address any issues before you go on the market. This will ensure your transaction runs smoothly and your buyer doesn’t walk away. For buyers, the benefits of an inspection are a little more obvious. Often, your seller will be willing to help pay for any items on your inspection report. The cost of those repairs almost always exceeds the cost of the inspection. Don’t be scared of the inspection report. Properties deteriorate over time, and a report is just a tool you can use to make the best purchase you can. If you have questions about this topic or anything else real estate-related, please call or email me. I am always willing to help!",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Interest rates will affect our market but not as soon as you might think.Interest rates are going up, so what will that do to our market?Historically speaking, the market does not immediately soften when rates rise. In fact, we see a rush of buyers who fear that they may be priced out of the market. The Federal Reserve has indicated that they plan to raise short-term rates, which will indirectly impact the mortgage bond market.

        "content": "These are my three tips to help you improve your credit score.Having a good credit score can be the difference between getting a loan for your dream house or not. Here are three easy ways to improve your credit score:1. Pay down balances on credit cards. If you have a balance that’s over 50% of your max, that’s going to negatively impact your score. You may not be able to pay it off in one payment, but start making progress and get the balance under 50%. Ideally, you should get it under 30%. You can also call your credit card company and ask for a credit limit increase.2. Get a credit card if you don’t have one. Be very responsible with your use of it, and don’t go over 30% of your max credit limit.3. Set up automatic payments. This way, you’ll never miss a payment by over 30 days and get a late report on your credit.If you have any questions about buying or selling a home, give me a call or send an email.

Please consult with your CPA or tax attorney before you make any real estate transactions based on this advice.That being said, there are two exclusions in the IRS code that allow you to avoid or defer paying taxes on the sale of real estate. The first is the primary residence exemption. If you’ve lived in a home as your primary residence for two of the last five years and sell it, you can claim up to $250,000 in capital gains if you’re single or $500,000 if you’re married.The second exemption is for investment properties. A 1031 exchange has a couple of rules. First, it has to be an investment property, and you have to have owned it for more than one year. If both conditions are met, you can exchange that property for another one of equal or greater value without paying capital gains taxes. The money from your sale goes to an intermediary, then you identify another property to purchase with those funds. You can then defer all your taxable liability on that money and use it to buy another, more expensive piece of real estate.If you have any questions for me about this topic or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email.

Something to keep in mind about the real estate market is that it’s very stable. The stock and crypto markets can be incredibly volatile and rise or fall 20% within a day, whereas if there’s a shift in supply and demand, it’ll take months (if not a year or two) to impact the real estate market. I believe our market will stay strong and consistent in 2022.

As you may or may not know, Zillow has been essentially running a flip business, purchasing homes directly from consumers and reselling them. However, they’ve now dropped that program entirely and are laying off much of their staff. It turns out that human real estate agents who have specific market knowledge are better than algorithms at predicting what a market is going to do. When you’re running a flip business, you need to buy a house at a discount. On a home I looked at recently, Zillow paid $20,000 more than any other home had been bought for in the entire neighborhood. They’re now trying to sell that home for the same price they paid for it, but when you factor in resale, holding, and staff costs, it’s no mystery as to why they’re shutting down the program; it’s losing quite a bit of money. Their model proved unsustainable.“Zillow has now dropped their iBuyer program and is laying off many staff members. ”So what does all this mean for our market? We remain in a seller’s market, though it’s cooled down from the absolute frenzy of this spring and summer. Properties are currently taking 30 to 45 days to sell.

Whether it’s an issue with the inspection, appraisal, or financing, a contingency gives a buyer an out if they want it. In today’s competitive market, writing an offer with more contingencies is less desirable for a seller. Sellers want to accept an offer that has the least amount of potential to fall apart.One common contingency buyers waive is the appraisal contingency. That means even if the appraisal comes in below the agreed-upon purchase price, the buyer still wants to move forward with the transaction.Waiving the inspection contingency means you’re willing to take the home regardless of the things you find during the inspection.

That represents the wealth you have as a homeowner.Home equity can give you a few different advantages. First, you can take a cash-out refinance, keep your current property with a relatively affordable payment, rent it out to bring you a positive cash flow, and take that money to go buy your next home.“Equity represents wealth as a homeowner.”Another option is selling your current home and taking the equity to put a down payment on your next home, which may be your dream home.If you have any questions for me about buying a home, selling a home, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email.

        "content": "There are three seller misconceptions not to believe about our market.Though the market is in their favor, sellers still have to do the right things to sell quickly and for top dollar. Here are the three main misconceptions sellers have about our current real estate market:1. You can list your house as is. You could list with no preparation, but if you want to get top dollar, you need to clean and perhaps paint and replace the carpet. Preparing for sale will ensure more buyers are attracted to your home. If the house is dirty, the yard is overgrown, or something’s in disarray, it won’t appeal to buyers.2. You can list your home without an agent. Yes, selling the property yourself is possible, but with the market the way it is now, most sellers are working with a real estate professional. Day in and day out, real estate agents handle contract negotiations, and these can be stressful and challenging for those who don’t work with them constantly. In these negotiations, you can lose thousands of dollars. When buyers see a home hit the market that’s professionally marketed by an agent, you’ll generate more attention, more offers, and likely end up with a much higher net profit than if you sell it on your own.3. You can price above market value. Most buyers are limited in how much money they can spend over market value. Also, to generate the most interest, it’s always beneficial for you as a seller to price the property at market value; you’ll get many more showings and offers.“Preparing for sale will ensure more buyers are attracted to your home.”Extra tip: If your house is priced under $400,000 in our Phoenix market, you’ll certainly receive multiple offers if it’s properly priced and prepared well.If you have any questions about buying or selling a property, please give me a call or send an email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Here&rsquo;s how we deal with low appraisals (hint: the key is being proactive).What happens when an appraisal comes in below the contract price agreed upon by the buyer and seller in a real estate transaction? Well, most of the time, when a low appraisal does come in, we will have already been expecting it; due to the nature of our very competitive real estate market, a lot of buyers are overbidding the asking prices of houses, oftentimes exceeding the value that an appraiser is willing to assign.The first questions we ask ourselves when we get a low appraisal on a real estate transaction: “Did the appraiser make a mistake? Can we identify any human error?” We’ll comb through the report to see if that’s the case. As you may or may not know, appraisals are based on comparable sales that are similar to the property in question.So, for example, if the appraiser is comparing a home to another that’s bigger, or using a two-story house to appraise a single-story house, that’s a red flag; we can take that report back to the appraiser manager and make a strong case that there needs to be an adjustment on the appraisal. However, more often than not, appraisers aren’t going to change the value—a successful petition for adjustment is rare.Once we have a final appraised value (adjusted or not), we present it to both the buyer and the seller and begin an important conversation. Is the buyer willing to pay more than the appraised value of the home up to the contract price? Is the seller willing to take less than the contract price equivalent to the appraised value? Or, is there a middle ground that can be reached? If the answer to any of these questions is ‘yes,’ then we’re able to move forward.“More often than not, appraisers aren’t going to change the value—a successful petition for adjustment is rare.”If, however, the answer in each instance is ‘no,’ then the buyer has a right to cancel the transaction per the appraisal contingency. As mentioned above, though, low appraisal scenarios seldom catch us by surprise. In anticipation of a low appraisal, we implement a proactive strategy, like drafting an agreement that states the buyer will pay X amount of dollars over appraised value, etc.If you have further appraisal questions or are thinking about buying or selling a home soon here in the new year, please feel free to reach out by phone or email.

With the progressing pandemic and a vaccine hopefully coming soon, there’s potential for change, but likely not in the first quarter. More of the same means we’ll continue to have low interest rates. Interest rates in the 2s make it extremely affordable for buyers to purchase a home, even with the current higher prices.Arizona is seeing high inward migration and low inventory, which means demand and prices will remain elevated.

If and when the broader economy recovers in 2021, I believe the real estate market will stay as it is, if not get stronger, though it’s difficult to imagine it stronger than it is these days.“The first quarter of the new year will be similar to what we’re seeing now.”If you’re considering buying a house, interest rates in the twos are very positive. It’s a competitive market, but know that we have strategies and techniques to get you into the home you love. If you’re thinking about selling, we have extremely low inventory, so buyers will frequently fight over your house, which means multiple offers for you. So it’s currently a great time for both buyers and sellers in our market.If you have questions about buying or selling, please give me a call or send an email. I’d be glad to schedule a free consultation with you.",

        "content": "My thoughts on what, if any, impact the election will have on our market.Traditionally, election years tend to be ones with flat appreciation and slightly lower demand, which makes sense—there’s plenty of uncertainty and fear to go around, especially if the race for the White House is more contentious than usual. People pause on making major life decisions like selling their current home or buying a new one. Imagine if an election had been our only preoccupation in 2020…We know that COVID-19 has completely changed the way people value their homes. With companies shutting down their offices and forcing employees to work from home, and with school closures forcing parents to facilitate their child’s virtual learning, families have needed a lot more space this year. These unforeseen pressures have pushed many potential buyers off of the fence and into the marketplace, while our historically low interest rates have made it worth their hassle.Based on the statistics, the demand in our market remains very high with lots of in-migration, and supply remains incredibly low. I believe that the market will continue to grow at a strong rate, regardless of this year’s election result.“Families have needed a lot more space this year.”As always, reach out to us here at BTG Real Estate by phone or email if we can help you with any real estate needs or market-related questions.

        "content": "Here are the three reasons that real estate deals typically fall apart.These are the main reasons that real estate transactions fall out of contract:1. The buyer’s agent hasn’t taken their client through a professional process. This includes the proper education on the home-buying process and a pre-approval with a mortgage professional. Oftentimes, clients will make a move on an impulse but aren’t properly prepared to do so.2. The buyer gets cold feet. We have a very competitive seller’s market, and oftentimes in a multiple-offer situation, a buyer will get emotionally wrapped up in the deal and overextend themselves.3. The appraisal falls short. Obviously, a bank doesn’t want to lend more on a home than what they feel it’s worth. In this market, we have buyers bidding over asking prices and we’re pushing the limits on appraisals. In the event that an appraisal comes in short, a buyer and seller have to come to a mutual agreement. Otherwise, the deal will fall apart and the home will go back on the market.If you have any questions for me about buying a home, selling a home, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email.

While it’s true that statistically more transactions happen during those seasons, that doesn’t mean autumn and winter are unfavorable times to list. Here are three great reasons it’s a good idea to sell your house this winter:1. You won’t be moving in intense heat. I’ve moved in severe heat myself, and it’s unpleasant. Everyone else I’ve spoken to who moved in the summer felt the same.2. Some buyers will be looking for a winter home. Your property could be perfect as a second home for those trying to escape freezing temperatures. These houses are excellent to list during the winter because more people are interested in them during the season they’re trying to avoid.3. Capital gains tax on real estate will likely increase. It’s almost certain that legislation will lead to an increase in capital gains taxes on real estate. Though we don’t know exactly when that will happen, it’s something to consider.So if you have a property you’re thinking about selling, the upcoming months may be a great time.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are three tips to help buyers survive in this competitive market.If you want to survive as a buyer in our competitive market, there are three tips you must remember:1. Understand your price point and the available inventory in that price point.In the more affordable price points (e.g., $200,000 to $250,000), it’s a complete frenzy with very little available inventory. With our buyers, we like to examine how many homes are available in their price point and in the area they’re looking at versus how many homes are under contract and have been sold in the past 30 days. This gives us an indication of how quickly the available homes will sell and helps us prepare accordingly.“Take each home you’re interested in into consideration before deciding what to offer, and remember that it may take a few tries to lock down a contract.”2. Have your financing 100% ready to go.Have your pre-qualification letter handy and be absolutely certain about which loan program you’ll use when it’s time to make an offer. This enables your lender to call the listing agent and assure them that they have all of your documentation and that you’ll be able to process the transaction and close on time.3. Make your offer competitive.As I alluded above, in a typical buyer’s market like we have here in the East Valley, any price point under $400,000 is very competitive. This means it’s imperative for you to offer the seller what they’re looking for. Sellers are usually listing their homes at market value, but those homes are often selling $5,000 to $10,000 above asking price, so you have to be comfortable with that. If you find a home you can see your family living in, that’s a small price to pay compared to renting for another year. Take each home you’re interested in into consideration before deciding what to offer, and remember that it may take a few tries to lock down a contract.If you have questions about this or any real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "These two home upgrades shouldn&rsquo;t be made if you&rsquo;re selling soon.Many home improvements are excellent investments, but there are actually two upgrades you shouldn’t make to your house if you’re planning to sell it soon:1. Adding a pool. When you sell your property, you’re only going to get back 40% to 50% of the money you put into building the pool. It doesn’t make sense to put in a pool just to help it sell quicker. However, if you want to add a pool and plan to live there for 10 or more years to enjoy it, that’s when it’s a good idea.2. Installing solar panels. If you purchase the system, solar panels can cost between $35,000 and $40,000. However, you’ll only get about $10,000 to $15,000 back for them when you sell. The second downside is that when you need to repair or replace the roof, the panels have to be taken off, then put back on afterward.Recently, I had a client under contract to purchase a home that had solar panels, and the roof needed to be replaced. The quote just to handle the panels was $13,000. This meant the total cost of a new roof was almost $30,000. This was too steep and caused my client to cancel the transaction. Despite the drawbacks, some people want solar panels to be efficient and environmentally conscious, and that’s completely fine.“You won’t get all your money back for installing a pool or solar panels.”If you have questions about buying, selling, or anything else concerning real estate, please give me a call or send an email.

Here’s a look at where we currently stand in the market:In April, we had 14,000 active residential listings in our MLS, with 10,000 pendings. As of June, these statistics were nearly reversed— we have about 10,000 active properties and 14,000 pendings.Working with many buyers myself, I’m experiencing a high amount of competition for anything priced at or below $400,000. That’s why it’s so important to have a professional representing you if you’re purchasing a home. A good buyer’s agent in this market will have an established, positive relationship with the seller’s agent. You’ll need a top negotiator to help your offer stand out among the other competing buyers so that the seller will choose yours. In this climate, your offer should have as few contingencies and concessions as possible.“The bottom line: Professional representation is critical in today’s market.”One thing you can do to get the edge on your competition is to write a personal letter to the seller explaining why it is you love their home so much and how much it would mean to you to live in it. This will add some emotional appeal that could mean the difference between the seller choosing your offer over another’s.If you’re selling a home, you’ll also want professional representation; you’ll need an agent who knows how to deal with multiple offers and negotiate in your favor. The great news is that now is an awesome time to get top dollar for your property. If you plan to buy another home after you sell, I recommend that you buy that home first—inventory is extremely low, and you don’t want to end up selling your house without a replacement already under contract!The bottom line: Professional representation is absolutely critical in today’s market.

What are iBuyers, though, and should you work with one?Before we get into whether selling to such an entity is a good idea, let’s first clear up what they are.In short, iBuyers are investors who leverage technology platforms and use venture capital to purchase properties outright from home sellers. If you’ve ever seen those “We Buy Homes for Cash” billboards, then all you need to know is that an iBuyer is the modern equivalent of the companies behind those ads. Some of the top iBuyers in the game right now are Zillow, Offerpad, and Opendoor.So, with that out of the way, should you work with an iBuyer? The answer depends on your goals and circumstances. If you want to net the highest amount for your home, it’s typically best to work with a Realtor on a traditional home sale. However, if you want a more expedient option, then selling directly to an iBuyer may be a good alternative. Since iBuyers offers are done in cash and are free of contingencies, selling to one tends to work well for those who care more about convenience than overall profit.“Whatever your real estate goals, our team would be happy to have a conversation about what’s right for you.”This is why our team lets every seller we work with know about this option. Even if you don’t want to go the traditional home selling route, our team would still be happy to help connect you with an iBuyer and guide you to getting the best possible offer from them. Sellers who partner with an agent or team of agents when selling to an iBuyer tend to walk away with much more in their pocket than those who strike up this kind of deal on their own. The best part is that working with an agent to achieve such a sale won’t cost you a thing.Whatever your real estate goals, our team would be happy to have a conversation about what’s right for you.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

The second “bucket” includes your inspection and appraisal costs, and the third includes moving costs.As for the actual expense of buying a home, there are many assistance programs out there that can help you put as little as 3% down.“The bottom line is to always plan ahead.”The bottom line is to always plan for every one of these expenses. Otherwise, you might find yourself in financial dire straits by the time you’ve closed on your new home.If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want to know how I can help with your next home purchase, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

If you list with me, we will use statistics and data based on the market values of the area to agree on an asking price, so we’re not going to be too far out of range of what it’s actually going to sell for. If the home is properly priced, then we’ll analyze the offer to see how genuine the buyer is and to determine if they’re just testing the waters or tossing out something unrealistic.“Ask yourself if your home is priced accurately.”If it is a sincere buyer, then we would want to submit a counteroffer and engage them in a negotiation. Often when a buyer puts pen to paper and submits a contact, that’s the first sign they really like your home and they’re trying to see what they can get and what they can get away with. Lastly, if we find out this is an unrealistic buyer, we will respectfully decline the offer. If you have any questions about buying or selling a home, give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Have you heard of the new build-to-rent real estate trend? Build-to-rent communities are communities of single-family homes that are only available as rentals. These properties have the feel of regular single-family homes, but with the amenities and exterior maintenance that you’d find at an apartment complex.Today I’ll discuss three key points to keep in mind as you consider build-to-rent housing:1. Older generations are choosing to rent. Many people of retirement age who move to Arizona are making the decision to rent homes instead of buying them so they don’t have to deal with maintenance. They can still get the feel of a single-family home and take pride in their property like a homeowner.2. Younger generations aren’t yet ready to buy. Many in the younger generations are in financial positions that make purchasing a home difficult. They want a stepping stone between renting an apartment and owning a home of their own, and the build-to-rent movement is a great middle ground.3. They’re attractive investor opportunities. People tend to gravitate toward single-family homes over apartments for many reasons. Apartments, for example, have less privacy, share walls with other units, and just feel less homey. People in single-family homes tend to stay in their leases longer, whereas those in apartments tend to move more frequently. In addition, these properties are new construction, so as an investor who purchases one of these, you won’t have to deal with major maintenance issues for five to 10 years.“People tend to gravitate toward single-family homes over apartments for many reasons.”Overall, build-to-rent housing is an interesting trend that’s taking off in Arizona and across the U.S., and I only foresee it growing as time goes on.If you’re thinking about buying, selling, or investing in real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

Move out of your home emotionally once it hits the market. By that, I mean you need to reserve your opinions and personal feelings about the property, including the memories you’ve made and shared there. If your goal is to maximize the amount of money you receive from the sale, think about your home as an asset and try not to get easily offended by an offer you don’t like.2. Learn as much as you can about the buyer. This will allow you to understand their motivations and why this purchase is important to them. If the buyer’s offer isn’t acceptable, you may be able to send a counteroffer back to them, possibly allowing you to get additional net proceeds on your bottom line. Further, you might not know what that buyer’s highest and best offer looks like; typically, the first offer isn’t the highest and best.3. Take all offers seriously. Whenever an offer comes in, you need to respond to it. Each offer will be considered on a case-by-case basis, but each should be taken seriously and given a response.“Think about your home as an asset and try not to get easily offended by an offer you don’t like.”If you have any questions about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

First, you’ll need to identify the specific time period or month in which the largest number of transactions have historically occurred.Here in Arizona, sales activity is at its highest between May and July. For the remainder of the year, activity tends to lose a little momentum and we see an average of 5,000 to 7,000 home sales each month through fall and winter. In comparison, our spring market brings anywhere from 8,000 to as many 14,000 sales per month.From a selling standpoint, you’ll also want to know what kind of competition you’re up against (i.e., the level of inventory).

Find out today. Many people understand what occurs during a home inspection, but not as many know what happens after.First, the inspector will provide the buyer with an inspection report detailing any and all deficiencies they observed.Once they’re in possession of this report, the buyer can choose to request a financial credit or that the seller completes certain repairs. They can also back out of the deal entirely if the issues are so severe that they no longer feel comfortable proceeding.Buyers and sellers are each given five days to respond to negotiations from the opposite party. When the seller presents their offer to the buyer, the buyer then has five additional days to process and respond. It typically doesn’t take that long for the buyer and seller to reach an agreement, though.Then, assuming an agreement has been reached, the buyer will conduct a final walk-through between three to four days before closing to ensure that the home is in the agreed-upon condition. From there, the buyer and seller can proceed to the closing table and finish out the deal.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Here are the three main pitfalls that are caused by overpricing a home:1. Your home will spend more time on the market. This is a basic rule of supply and demand. If a buyer sees two similar homes on the market and one is priced for $50,000 less than the other, the market and the buyer are going to gravitate towards that home that offers the most features and benefits for the price.2. Buyers will have questions. When they start to see your home sit on the market, they will wonder why no one has made an offer yet and will start to think that something is wrong with it.“The longer it sits, the less it will sell for.”3. The longer a home sits, the less it will sell for. Statistics have proven this over and over.

Before you purchase the home, it’s important that an inspector visits the property to verify that it’s in good condition. The second half of this process is the move-in phase. After you’ve closed on a new construction home, you should ask the inspector to return within your warranty period to check for any undiscovered problems. If they find any, you can then take the report to the builder and ask that they resolve all issues. Following these steps will ensure that your new construction home is safe and sound.

This way, the money is allocated for investing instead of being used for vacations or other things that drain your funds.2. Choose a strategy. There are two basic strategies: flip and hold. You’ve already seen house flipping on HGTV, and while there are financial upsides, big risks are involved. I recommend starting with the hold model—buy a single-family home or multi-family home (duplex, triplex, or fourplex) and rent it out. It’s a secure investment that brings you long-term income, and there isn’t a lot of financial risk or volatility.3. Get professional guidance. This is the best way to determine which investments are good and which are bad. They’ll guide you through the process and help you figure out what to do.

The way your home looks in online photos will determine whether buyers want to schedule a showing for it or not, so make sure it looks amazing in these photos. Making it look amazing starts with the pre-packing process—put away any personal belongings and clear your countertops so buyers can visualize your house as their future home.Second, start decluttering your home so that it looks like a model home. Model homes usually only have a few items out for showings because, again, you want buyers to be able to visualize the space inside your home.“You want buyers to be able to visualize the space inside your home.”Lastly, pay attention to your home’s curb appeal. 50% of a buyer’s decision will be made the moment they pull up to your curb.

After seeing several years of aggressive appreciation, interest rates are rising and buyers are becoming more cautious. Sellers aren’t able to chase the market as they were before; homes that are overpriced are being quickly rejected by the market.Overall, our market is normal—we’re not in a crash or recession, though it does feel that way because Phoenix pricing has been artificially low, due to the mortgage fraud and subsequent crash of 2008. After experiencing such aggressive growth, it feels strange that we aren’t seeing the same numbers.“Buying now will save you money compared to later.”From the mortgage side of things, Amber says interest rates are a hot topic right now. Interest rates went up almost 1% in 2018, sitting at around 5%. As an example, this increase adds $160 a month to a $200,000 mortgage. People are already feeling the impact and there are more rate hikes on the horizon; the stronger our economy becomes, the higher interest rates will be. Our strongest housing markets have seen rates above 6%.Buying now will save you money, compared to later when interest rates have risen. As we go into 2019, it’s important for both buyers and sellers to find a good agent to help navigate the market.

        "content": "Selling a home during the fall is common practice in Arizona. Here are a few reasons why. Why would you consider listing your house during the fall as opposed to waiting until after the holidays? There are a few reasons why you should:1. Arizona has a seasonal market. During the spring and summer, we see local residents with families who need to move while school is out, and that’s more of a normal market cycle. In addition, we have seasonal residents who come from colder climates to feel the sunshine here in Phoenix. This means that there are a couple different waves of buyers that come into town during different times of years. Those buyers who are looking at a second home or coming here to retire are coming to the market now and they are searching.“It’s better to be on the market now as opposed to later.”2. If you wait until January, you’ll be competing against many other home sellers. If you wait, you’ll see an increase of inventory of about 20% when you list. Here’s my question for you: Would you rather have your house on the market now to capture the serious seasonal buyers, or would you rather compete against 20% more buyers after the first of the year?As you can see, the answer is clear that it’s better to be on the market now as opposed to later. If you have any questions or are thinking of selling your house any time in the near future, I’d love to hear from you so we can discuss your options moving forward.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I&rsquo;ll provide you with an update on the current state of the Phoenix, Arizona real estate market. In our current market, we need to think about how far we’ve come since the recession.We’ve had annual appreciation rates reach 10%, 20%, and even 30%—we’ve come up significantly in value.Recently, we’ve begun transitioning from a severe seller’s market with a shortage of inventory to more of a balanced market. This means that buyers have more homes to choose from. Overall, there’s still a relatively low amount of inventory for the number of homes that are selling every month and the number of new listings that are coming onto the market. We’re still at about 2.5 months’ worth of homes, meaning that if no additional homes came on the market, we’d sell all the listed homes in 2.5 months.Maricopa County has also undergone a population growth. Over the last 12 months, Maricopa County and the surrounding area has gained about 150,000 people. Some have forecasted that another 1 million people will move to the Valley over the next five to seven years; while that is hard to quantify as accurate or not, we do know that there has been substantial growth over the past few years and businesses are moving in from high-tech states due to our lower cost to do business. Their employees are moving to Arizona to follow the jobs, which stimulates the local economy. Though our home prices have increased in recent times, they’re still more affordable than states like California.“Some have forecasted another 1 million people moving to the Valley over the next five to seven years.”What does this mean to you as a buyer or seller?If you’re a seller who’s been thinking of listing your house but aren’t quite sure when is the right time, the value of your current home is likely to improve over the next five to 10 years due to the projected population growth. If you’d like to downsize or upsize, the value of the house you’d move to will also increase. With that in mind, it’s a good time to make the transition.If you’re a buyer who is planning to purchase a home and stay in it long-term, or even just three to five years, now is also a great time to do so. First and foremost, your house is a place to live and your decision should be based on affordability, but it can also serve the secondary purpose as an investment vehicle, providing a place to maintain your savings and grow your wealth over time if you hang on to it.If you have questions about buying or selling a home, please feel free to reach out.

        "content": "Buying a starter home will make buying your forever home much easier down the line. Here&rsquo;s why. Many buyers are unsure of whether they should wait to buy a forever home or start with a starter home. In my opinion, you should absolutely buy a starter home if you can.For starters, it’s a great way to start building some equity. Does that mean you have to sell the house when you’re ready to move into your forever home? No. You can hold it as an investment property to build long-term wealth. If you do decide to sell down the road after three, five, or seven years, you’re going to have significant equity in the home that you can use as a down payment on your forever home if you wish.The average renter has a net worth of about $5,000 or $6,000, while the average homeowner has a net worth of around $225,000. As you can see, owning a home will force your net worth to increase over time. This is going to be one piece of your investment portfolio that will serve you well in the long term.If you have any questions for us or are curious about our step-by-step process for helping our clients work towards their forever home, please feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "There are four key negotiating tips you need to remember during a transaction, whether you&rsquo;re buying or selling. Here are four negotiating tips both buyers and sellers can use during a home sale to ensure that they get a great deal.First, reply to an offer or counteroffer quickly. A quick response time shows the other party that you’re serious about the transaction and you know what you want. Dragging things out and waiting to respond, on the other hand, will make it clear to the other party that you’re not serious and/or you’re stretching yourself thin financially, which is a sign of weakness when negotiating.Second, make sure you hire an experienced agent. If the negotiations aren’t handled properly by your agent, you could lose out on thousands of dollars. An experienced agent knows, based on the conversations with the other agent, what the other party’s sentiment is. They’ll then be able to decipher that sentiment for you so you can make the right decision moving forward in the transaction.“If the negotiations aren’t handled properly by your agent, you could lose out on thousands of dollars.”My next two tips are specific to each side of the transaction.If you’re a buyer, check in regularly with your lender during negotiations. The difference between where you make your initial offer and where the seller makes their counteroffer is usually between $5,000 and $10,000. While $5,000 in a purchase contract may sound like a lot, it typically only amounts to an extra $25 per month for your monthly mortgage payment. Talking with your lender can help you overcome any financial fears you may have moving forward.If you’re a seller, be aware of all of the holding costs of the property—the mortgage, utilities, and things of that nature, as well as the intangible costs (i.e., the time and energy the sale is taking away from your day job or other life activities). Sometimes it’s better to accept a deal now that might not look as good than it is to accept a deal later on that’s far less beneficial or accept an equivalent deal which still required you to spend thousands of extra dollars to maintain the property.If you’d like to know more top negotiating tips when buying or selling a home, or if you have any other real estate questions for me, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Today we&rsquo;ll discuss the three main benefits of listing during this later season. Though the hot selling months of summer are almost behind us, fall is still a fantastic time to sell your home. There are three key reasons why this is the case:1. Buyers tend to be more serious during the fall. Many homebuyers have been searching since spring, and the competitive conditions they’ve faced until this point have left them more determined than ever to find and secure the right home before winter hits.2. There is less competition. It’s no secret that the majority of homes are listed during spring and the summer. Therefore, listing during the fall means your home is more likely to stand out, given the lack of other available inventory.“Now may be the perfect time for you to earn a favorable price for your current property while also securing a great deal on your next home.”3. It’s easier to move up. Those of you who are looking to sell in order to move up to a larger home may find it easier to do so during the fall. Certain listings have been sitting on the market for some time by this point, so many sellers are ready to make a deal. In other words, now may be the perfect time for you to earn a favorable price for your current property while also securing a great deal on your next home.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

To price it fairly, there are a few considerations you need to make first. As a seller, there are a few things to take into consideration to price your home fairly in today’s market.The first is that buyers are highly educated. They have more technology and information at their fingertips than ever before, so they’re more aware of what the market is doing on a general level. Obviously, they still need to consult with a professional before making a decision, but they now have more information to begin with than at any point in history.Second, buyers are more capable of comparing your home to other available homes because they can simply browse real estate websites like Zillow. There, they can see what properties are available in your neighborhood and at what price.“Buyers have more technology and information at their fingertips than ever before.”Third, the market reacts well to a fairly priced property. If the property is overpriced, the market will typically reject it. If this is the case, the signals will be loud and clear based on the little-to-no activity it is generating.Lastly, everyone who buys real estate wants to get a bargain. You need to make sure your home is competitive when stacked up against the other listings in your area.If you have any questions about pricing your home fairly or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, please feel free to call or email me anytime.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Not everything you hear about the real estate market is factual. Here is the truth behind these three common real estate myths. Today we’re going to talk about three common myths in real estate and what the actual truths behind them are:1. If it’s on Zillow, it must be true. Zillow is a great tool for consumers because it gives you an estimate of what your house is worth instantly. However, Zillow doesn’t know what your house looks like, what improvements you have made, or where it’s located. All they are doing is running an algorithm based on homes in the area and giving you an estimate on what your house is worth. Sometimes it’s accurate, but sometimes it’s off by 20% or more. If you’re trying to find out where you’re going to price your home, definitely check with a professional first.2. Sellers should overprice their homes to leave room to negotiate. The asking price of your home does not dictate its sale price. The asking price does dictate how long it’s going to take to get what the market is willing to pay. There’s no risk in underpricing your house unless you’re too eager to accept the first offer, and typically the market will react to your house very quickly. We don’t want to list it too low, but we want to list it at market value. The worst thing a seller can do is overprice their home from the start, which will alienate the property from potential buyers and cause other homes to sell sooner. We want to be competitive, have good value, and get a quick sale.“The asking price of your home does not dictate its final sale price.”3. All real estate agents are the same. Just like in any industry, there are certain people that excel in their careers, and there are bottom-of-the-barrel performers. Having a professional represent you is far different than having a licensed agent. Anybody can obtain a real estate license with 90 hours in a classroom and a passed test. That doesn’t mean they understand how the home sale process works from step to step. Hundreds of thousands of dollars can be lost if a sale is not handled properly by a professional.If you have any questions for me about buying or selling a home or need any assistance in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

Today I will highlight three points to think about. When scheduling a home inspection, there are a few things you should keep in mind. To give you a better idea of these considerations, I would like to share a brief list of what you should know before proceeding with the inspection process.1. Make sure you understand a home inspector does, and how to find and contact one. A home inspector’s job is to identify and report any major issues with the property. They will provide a general overview of the state of the property, and make recommendations as to whether they believe any specialized inspections should be ordered. As far as finding an inspector for the job, your agent should be able to make recommendations for professionals in your area.2. Make sure you understand the current market. In the Phoenix market, for example, we have homes built in the 1950s and those built within the last decade.“Once the inspection results are in, the buyer, the seller, and both of their agents can negotiate how to address what was found.”3. Be aware of what inspectors are looking for. Home inspectors will find issues, it is just a matter of how severe they are. They have to identify something to make their time performing the inspection worthwhile. And once the inspection results are in, the buyer, the seller, and both of their agents can negotiate how to address what was found.If you have any other questions or would like more information, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

What does that mean if you are buying or selling in the Phoenix area? Today I am going to talk about what the recent decrease in affordability means for you and your real estate goals.In the first quarter of 2018, affordability dropped about 5%. This is mainly due to rising mortgage interest rates. We have seen many people take on a higher percentage of debt relative to their income in order to buy a home, and some buyers are being pushed out of the marketplace altogether.Another drop in affordability, this time by 15% to 20%, is forecasted for later in the year. Again this change will be due to a shortage of inventory, higher price points, and rising interest rates.What does this mean for you?As a seller, there is a lot of demand and a shortage of supply. Phoenix, in particular, has a severe shortage of inventory. So if you are thinking about selling, we will be able to get your home sold relatively quickly—especially at the lower entry-level price points.“The cost of waiting to buy or sell could be massive.”Meanwhile, with the affordability forecasted to drop even further, buyers are beginning to get off the fence and make their move.However, there is no need to panic. Our current affordability is still 15% to 20% higher now than what we saw between 1987 and 2004.Yet if you are thinking about buying or selling, don’t delay.

Here are two of the most surprising things I uncovered about our market. I’ve been keeping tabs on the Phoenix real estate market, and today I wanted to let you know about a few surprising facts I’ve come to learn.The first surprising thing about the market is that competition and inventory are the biggest challenges for both buyers and sellers.For buyers in today’s market, things are very competitive. It’s likely that the house you choose will be the house that a lot of other buyers choose as well. It is very realistic to expect to compete against multiple buyers for that property.The second surprising thing about our market is that buyers are facing a severe shortage of inventory.“You always have to keep your competition in mind.”There are two pieces to this puzzle. The first is that because of our severe shortage of inventory, remodeled properties are very competitive and often swelling over asking price. Even the ones that aren’t renovated are listing with prices that are similar. It’s important for you to know the difference.As a home seller, you always have to keep your competition in mind. As I mentioned, there are a lot of updated and remodeled homes out there. It’s important to know exactly what is going to allow your home to sell for the highest price possible.Obviously, we are in a seller’s market right now. With that in mind, it’s important to know that you don’t have to update your entire home in order to sell it. All that matters is that your home is prepared properly an listed at a price point in line with what the market is willing to pay.If you have any questions for me about the real estate market or are interested in buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

It is crucial that you have gone through the process of providing full documentation to a lender so that when the moment comes that you find your favorite home, you are ready to buy. You need to be pre-qualified because there is a shortage of inventory, and if you found the right place, you don’t want to let it get away.Also, pre-qualification is important because you want to make sure you are being competitive. If listing agents are seeing multiple offers for their homes and yours is lacking certain documentation, such as W-2s, it is going to raise some questions. Since inventory is low and multiple offers are likely, it will cut certain offers out of the running quickly.“Chances are once you find your favorite property, it will also be somebody else’s favorite as well.”The biggest reason you want to be pre-qualified is that you are instilling confidence in the seller.

Most homeowners I talk to are anxious about balancing this because they don’t want to end up homeless or with two mortgage payments. Here are three simple steps we can take to help make sure things go smoothly for you:1. Make sure you’re comfortable with the current inventory and you have your financial ducks in a row. These include a pre-approval with a lender, as well as your down payment. If you can afford the down payment before you’ve sold your home, it would be better for you to buy before you sell. We can execute your purchase, then fully attack the sale once the purchase is finalized. If this isn’t an option for you, we want to make sure that your purchase is in order, then we can start talking about the sale.2. Determine the best marketing plan for you. We’ll do a market analysis on your home, aggressively promote and market your home, and negotiate with the buyer for terms that are favorable for you. Then we can aggressively find your new property.3. Make sure you hire an experienced team. If one thing happens to derail the purchase or sale, it can derail the entire process. They need to ensure that you have a great transition into your new home. &#8220;Make sure you hire an experienced team.&#8221;There are a lot of steps involved, but tackling it this way allows us to take action promptly and swiftly and can prevent those double payments.  If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

Rent has risen 2.7% nationally, and a quarter of renters are spending at least half of their income on monthly rent. Additionally, here in the Phoenix market over the last five years, rent has gone up 21%.2. It’s cheaper to buy than it is to rent. Even with market values increasing, homeownership with a traditional 30-year mortgage remains cheaper than renting.3.

        "content": "How can you keep yourself “mortgage-worthy?” There are three things to avoid when it comes to buying a home.  Don’t take out any new lines of credit from the time you are pre-approved for your mortgage until the time you close on your home. Doing so throughout the process could change your financials and render you unable to carry out the transaction.  Don’t deposit unsourced cash into your bank account. If you’re someone who likes to keep cash in a safe, or whatever the case may be, make sure that you deposit that money into your bank account for a minimum of 60 days. After that point, it will be seasoned and therefore eligible to be used for a down payment on a mortgage. If you’re receiving a gift from a relative, that’s another situation in which the transfer will have to be documented. Properly document all your cash deposits.  Don’t wait until the last minute to schedule an appointment with a Realtor (like myself) or a mortgage lender. If you do so earlier rather than later, you’ll have a clearer picture of what your finances look like, allowing you to clean up whatever messes you have in your credit history. You’ll also be able to search for properties that are within your budget range, meaning that if you want your payment at a specific rate, we can look only for properties that fit that criteria.“Properly document all your cash deposits.”If you have any questions about this topic or about buying and selling a home, please give me a call.

Today, I have three things you need to do in order to position yourself for the best sale possible.1. Declutter your home.The way you live in a house is not the way you sell a house. We obviously want to make the home look warm, open, clean, inviting, and bright—all those things are very important in the sale of your home. In order to achieve that, the number one thing to do is remove a lot of your possessions. Buyers need to be able to envision what they’re going to do with their life in their new home. Pack up any spare belongings that you have laying around the house, on countertops, in closets, and so on.2. Deep-clean your home. Hiring a professional company may cost you $300 on the front end, but on the back end, it’s going to translate into much more than that. A buyer that walks into a squeaky-clean, perfectly manicured house is going to notice. It will help them feel comfortable and confident moving forward to purchase the home.“Uniformity and cleanliness are absolutely paramount.”3. Consult with a real estate professional. Knowing what not to do is equally important as knowing what to do when it comes to selling your home. Sometimes sellers will update areas of their house with a modern decor style, but if other areas aren’t updated, that will stand out. The idea is to complement the style and design that you have in place without spending a lot of money and also to make sure the home is appealing to buyers. Uniformity and cleanliness are absolutely paramount, which is where consulting with a professional comes in.If you have questions about buying or selling a house, please give me a call or send an email.

Each year, Remodeling magazine releases its Cost vs. Value Report for various home upgrades. This year, only one project had an ROI of over 100% and that was fiberglass attic insulation. If you add insulation to your attic tomorrow and decide to sell your home right after, you can expect that you will be able to sell for a premium. Even if you aren’t selling your home just yet, then the improved attic insulation will accrue even more value as the years go on, in terms of lower heating bills and increased comfort in your home.2. Energy-efficient windows. A typical window replacement yields over a 70% return in terms of the resale value of your home. Depending on the shape of your current windows, you could save an additional 15% or more off your heating bills. Plus, new windows can add even more value to your home in terms of increased thermal and acoustic comfort, more light, and better design. “New, energy-efficient windows bring a nice ROI.”3. Have an energy audit. For only $99, SRP and APS partner with many local companies that will come out and check your windows, ductwork, A/C unit, and give you a full report of anything to be addressed to increase the efficiency of your home. Then from there you can choose what will be the best investment for your home.If you have any questions for me about any of these upgrades or anything else related to real estate, give me a call or send me an email.

Get a FREE home value reportWant to buy a home? Search all homes for saleWhy are homebuyers suddenly so optimistic? Right now, homebuyer confidence is at an all-time high, and there is an increasing number of renters who think that now is a good time to buy.There are three reasons that I believe explain this phenomenon:1. Lending guidelines are loosening up. Back in 2010 and 2011, things were a little bit harder on the buyer side to qualify for a mortgage. Now that the guidelines have opened up a bit, it has enabled more buyers to buy a home.2. Jobs are looking good. Fewer buyers are concerned about losing their jobs. Additionally, the median household income is now 150% of what their monthly payment would be as opposed to the historical average of 125%.3. Long-term renters are now opting to buy homes. Millennials, the generation born after 1980, have mostly opted out of homeownership up until now. Now that they’re entering the market as first-time buyers, they’re further along in their careers with higher income and more savings.“HOMEBUYER CONFIDENCE IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH.”So what does all this mean for you?

Get a FREE home value reportWant to buy a home? Search all homes for saleReal estate is an excellent vehicle for building long-term wealth as an investment.There are three benefits to focus on for buy and hold (rental) real estate investment properties:1. Cash flow: Once you close on the property and get a tenant, you’ll receive income every single month from their rent. You need to make sure you’re actually making profit and that the expenses of the property don’t exceed the incoming cash.2. Tax breaks: There’s a rule in the IRS code that allows you to depreciate the property - meaning you can write off its expenses over time and deduct it from your taxable income. This creates annual savings.3. Building equity in the property over time: As you rent out the property, the tenant will pay down the mortgage balance and the property will appreciate over time. Between your tenant paying down the mortgage and the appreciation (40-year average is about 4%), you’ll build a lot of equity.“OVER TIME, A TENANT PAYS DOWN YOUR MORTGAGE WHILE APPRECIATION BOOSTS YOUR PROPERTY’S VALUE.”At the end of the investment, it’s important to have an exit strategy in place to move that money into another investment or retirement.If you’re thinking of investing in Phoenix real estate or just buying a home, give me a call or send me an email soon.

Search all homes for saleWhen it comes to Zillow’s Zestimate tool, there are a few things you need to keep in mind about Zillow and home values:1. Zestimates can be manipulated by the homeowner or an agent coaching the homeowner. In preparation to list the property for sale, the owner can add updates, change the square footage, and do other things in Zillow that will drastically change their Zestimate. Sometimes, buyers will compare the Zestimate to your asking price to determine what kind of offer they should make and if the home is priced fairly. The problem is that the Zestimate is just a ballpark number, not a fair market value.2. Zillow can be off by 10% to 20%. In our county, that number is definitely closer to 20%. Zillow itself tracks the Zestimate and the actual sales price of their properties and say that it’s often off by 10%. However, I’ve seen Zestimates in our market off by 30% or 40%.3. You need to ask a professional. After all, if you think you might be sick, you will look up your symptoms on WebMD. If you are actually sick or concerned, then you will go straight to a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. It’s the same with your home value. It’s fine to look at Zillow if you’re just curious, but if you really want to sell or refinance, then you need to reach out to a professional real estate agent so that you have an accurate understanding of what your house is worth in the current market.“SEND ME YOUR ADDRESS AND YOUR ZESTIMATE TO SEE HOW ACCURATE ZILLOW REALLY IS.”Now, I’d like to give you a more specific example. Let’s try an experiment. Send me your Zestimate and your home address. I’ll pull some comparables and tell you what the actual market value of your home is.If we get enough people to participate, I’ll do another video sharing the results of what I found.

Search all homes for saleMany real estate investors here in the Phoenix area are making big returns using Airbnb and VRBO.com. If you’re thinking about using an investment property to use as a vacation rental, there are four things to keep in mind:1. Location: Phoenix is a destination city, so you want the property to be close to destination attractions like golf tournaments and other sporting events or things that attract winter travelers. Winter is the ‘hot’ season for vacation rentals.2. Zoning and/or HOA restrictions of the property: Some HOAs don’t allow vacation rentals, so check with a property’s HOA and the city’s zoning codes beforehand to make sure you can use it as a vacation rental.3. Management: You’ll want to have a management company in place to take care of it for you so you don’t have to deal with tenants coming and going constantly, or the cleaning and turnaround that comes along with it. A management company will handle the bookings, cleaning, and management, making your life as the investor and owner much easier.4. Exit strategy: Like with any investment, think about the end goal you’re shooting for. Personally, I’d be focused on the cash flow and eventually liquidating the property to move the money elsewhere.

Search all homes for saleBack in January, I gave four predictions for what I thought would happen this year in the Phoenix market: Homes priced under $250,000 being very competitive, interest rates, new construction, and the luxury market.Today, I wanted to break down how those predictions fared.First, we still see a lot of pressure in that first-time homebuyer price range of $250,000 and under. Currently, there are fewer than 7,300 pending sales in that price range with only about 5,800 active listings for sale.This means that in this price range, there is less than one month of inventory, which is extremely low, and it’s definitely a seller’s market. Multiple offers on homes are very common and it’s certainly a challenge for buyers looking to get into their first home.I predicted interest rates would rise this year, which they’ve done with some fluctuation thanks to the stock market going up and down a bit. Overall though, rates are higher than they were last year and we expect them to keep trending up.“IT’S CHALLENGING FOR BUYERS LOOKING TO GET INTO THEIR FIRST HOME.”With new construction sales, we’re seeing the activity go up. I can personally say that more and more of my clients want to see new builds because of the fact that they’re move-in ready and brand new.Finally, there’s the luxury market, which I predicted would get more active this year. Between the $750,000 and $1 million price points, we have 590 pending sales and about 3,300 active listings. That makes for a balanced, healthy, and stable market with about six months worth of inventory, which is much better than it has been in recent years. Over the past few years during the recession, luxury market inventory had been as high as 24 months.Thanks for looking back on our predictions.

The next best is the cabinets. If you have gold oak cabinets and you’re upgrading to a granite or quartz countertop, consider updating the cabinet color too. Painting them white will make them look clean and modern and won’t cost you much. Finally, look into a new backsplash. Subway tile is very popular right now and will really update your kitchen at a low cost.The second best room to update is your bathrooms. It can cost up to $15,000 to redo a bathroom completely, though. Recently, many clients have updated their plumbing fixtures like the shower and sink and have updated the lighting fixtures as well. Go for a brushed nickel or chrome finish to make it modern. You can also get an old tub or tile shower re-coated to make it look brand new. This can update the look of your bathroom and won’t cost as much as a full shower or tub replacement.“YOUR KITCHEN IS THE BEST PLACE TO SPEND MONEY ON UPDATES.”Next, you can always count on paint. I always say that paint costs $40 a gallon and is $1,000 when you put it on the wall. Fresh paint will give your house that clean, updated look without breaking the bank, but go for a color that complements the style of the home.

Search all homes for saleMaking a strong offer is essential in a seller’s market like the one we are seeing right now. Here are four tips that will help you make the strongest offer possible when the time comes for you to purchase a home:1. Understand how much you can afford. A mortgage pre-approval will show a home seller that you are serious about buying their home and have the financial capabilities to do so. This will give them confidence in working with you and accepting your offer.2. Act fast. Buyer demand has continued to outpace supply and we are seeing multiple offers at nearly every price point below $300,000. You need to take action right away in this market. If you sleep on it, you won’t sleep in it.3. Make a solid offer. Your strongest offer will need to be comparable with other sales in the neighborhood and represent market value. You could also include a personal letter with your offer, letting the seller know exactly why you want to buy their home. Those have helped us win out in multiple offer situations in the past.4. Be prepared to negotiate. Oftentimes, the seller will send a counteroffer. Usually, their offer revolves around the price and closing time frame. Understand that it’s likely we will get a counteroffer, and having that pre-approval in hand will give you stronger footing.“BUYER DEMAND IS HIGH, SO ACT QUICKLY.”The bottom line is that having a professional real estate agent represent you will ultimately end up with you buying your favorite home. Our job is to make sure you secure the home of your dreams. If you have any questions for us or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "Should you rent a home or buy a home? There are four main reasons why owning a home is ultimately better than renting one.Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value reportWant to buy a home? Search all homes for saleShould you rent or buy a home? Here are four things for you to consider when making the decision:1. The average net worth of a renter is lower than that of a homeowner. The average net worth of a renter is $5,000 while the average net worth of a homeowner is $225,000. Buying a home is a great way to automatically save money by paying down the principal for your home every month. Plus, a home is an asset that will always appreciate over a long period of time.2. It is more expensive to pay rent on a monthly basis than it is to pay off a mortgage. Mortgage rates are fixed for 30 years, while rent rises according to inflation every year when your lease is up.“YOUR MORTGAGE PAYMENT WILL STAY THE SAME, BUT RENT ALWAYS GOES UP.”3. Owning a home comes with tax write-offs. Your mortgage interest and property taxes are deductible, so that will save you a lot of money on your income taxes and you will get a bigger tax return.4. There are many low down payment options available out there. Here in Phoenix, there are actually several grant programs that can help first-time homebuyers purchase a property for as little as 0% down. You may have to cover some closing costs, but I’ve seen many buyers get into a home for less than $1,000 out of pocket. Buying a home can be less expensive than renting when you have to put down first and last month’s rent.As you can see, there are many benefits to owning a home rather than renting one. If you have any other questions about buying versus renting or if you would like to learn more about the home buying process, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

        "content": "When pricing your home you’ll want to make sure you avoid these common pitfalls.Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value reportWant to buy a home? Search all homes for saleMake sure you avoid these common pitfalls when pricing your home. First, don’t price your home out of the market. When buyers are searching they focus on round numbers, so they are going search up to $25,000 or $50,000 price breaks. If you are slightly over one of those price breaks because you think your home is worth a little more than that, you might be invisible to potential serious buyers. Also, keep in mind that buyers have the ability to research comparable home prices and will know if your price seems high.Second, don’t let your home sit on the market. A home that sits on the market for months does not look good to buyers. Buyers can log on to sites like Zillow and check how many days your home has been on the market, so if they think you are desperate there’s a good chance they will present a lowball offer.“BUYERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESEARCH COMPARABLE HOME PRICES AND WILL KNOW IF YOUR PRICE SEEMS HIGH.”Third, an appraisal is going to reveal your home’s value. A bank uses the appraisal for the buyer’s loan, so even if a buyer agrees to a high list price, you as a seller will more than likely have to drop that price to the appraised value so the buyer can obtain their mortgage loan.Fourth, overpriced homes take a long time to sell. If your home is priced too high it can delay your plans and keep you from moving on with your life. Also, statistics show that if you overprice your home it will end up selling at the same price if not less than the price you should have sold it for originally, but it will take three to four times longer.If you have any other questions about common home selling pitfalls or if you want to know what your home is worth in our current market, give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Purchasing a home comes with some hidden costs. Today I’ll go over what those costs are and how to prepare for them.Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value reportWant to buy a home? Search all homes for salePurchasing a home is one of the biggest financial transactions you’ll ever make, which is why you should know the money you’ll end up spending goes beyond the sticker price. There are a few things you should do in order to be prepared for hidden costs.The first thing you need to do is check the amount of your property taxes. Although here in Arizona we have some of the lowest property taxes in the nation, taxes are going up in some areas due to increasing home values.If the property you are buying has an HOA, look at the history of their assessments and things that the community might need. You don’t want to get hit with an extra cost, so being aware of that is always smart.“YOUR ELECTRIC BILLS MIGHT END UP BEING MORE THAN YOU EXPECT.”Something else you have to take into consideration is your utilities. Your electric bills might end up being more than you expect, so make sure you get billing history in order to prepare for high summer costs. Most importantly, make sure your A/C unit is running efficiently.Lastly, don’t forget about furnishing your house. Many buyers forget to consider the costs of moving, what furniture they are going to keep, what they are going to need to buy, and other things that go into physically moving from one space to another. Those things can add up, so keep furnishing your home in mind when you set your budget.If you have any other questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m always happy to help.",

        "content": "Today I’ve got a forecast for the Phoenix real estate market in 2017 that I wanted to share with you. Certain types of buyers entering the market could have a significant impact on Phoenix next year.Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value reportWant to buy a home? Search all homes for saleToday I wanted to take a moment to give you my forecast for the Phoenix real estate market in 2017.According to 247WallStreet.com, 50% of home buyers in 2017 will be first-time home buyers. That will put a lot of pressure on the entry-level price point of $250,000 and under. For that reason, I expect this price point to stay very competitive with multiple offers on homes.“IF THE STOCK MARKET KEEPS IMPROVING, I THINK THE LUXURY MARKET WILL TAKE OFF.”New construction sales will continue to increase and will be a large part of the move-up buyer midrange marketplace. The stock market continues to climb after the election; 20,000 points is a new all-time high. If this continues in 2017, I think the luxury market will take off with company owners and shareholders receiving more dividends and having more cash available, making them able to purchase bigger homes.I predict that interest rates will climb gradually in 2017. I don’t think we’ll see any sharp upticks, but they will go up slightly.So what does this mean to you as a buyer or seller in the Phoenix market?As a first-time buyer, you’ll really need aggressive representation to compete in multiple offer situations. As a seller, you’ll also need an aggressive agent to be able to market your home, generate a bidding war to get you the highest possible price, and handle all the offers.If you have any other questions about buying or selling a home or about the market in 2017, give me a call or send me an email soon.
