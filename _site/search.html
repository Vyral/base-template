We look forward to seeing you soon and giving you a real hug or handshakeâfor now, itâs virtual.Â âWith interest rates still low, there is plenty of activity.âWe do want you to know weâre still doing business.

For example, weâre conducting tons of virtual open houses, home tours, and appointments via Zoom and FaceTime.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "We love Tulsa, we love food, and we really love new bars in town! Weâre so excited to introduce you to Niki and Andrew Layson, the owners of Bar 473 here in Kendall Whittier district.Â The barâs name is an homage to the building it occupies, which was once a nationally registered historic place: Phillips 66 gas station No. 473, one of the early businesses in the first suburban development of Tulsa.Â According to Andrew, the location was also unique in that it allowed for more patio space, creating a more organic social atmosphere. Beyond being nestled in a lovely neighborhood, 473 draws in patrons with well-crafted, affordable cocktails. Providing a venue for local actsâcomedy, music, poetry, etc.âalso means that 473 is truly a community gathering space.Â Niki and Andrew were able to accent the neutral colors of the World War II-era building and create a clean, inviting space. The barâs minimalist approach to decor ensures that the smaller inside area never feels too overcrowded.Â âBeyond being nestled in a lovely neighborhood, 473 draws patrons in with well-crafted, affordable cocktails.âRight across the way from American Slayer and Cabin Boys Brewery, 473 is yet another testament to the increasing vibrancy of our Tulsa community! Though the many bars and breweries in this district cooperate more than compete, 473 aims to separate itself from the pack by having a deeper commitment to the cityâs blossoming music scene.Â As Andrew put it, âWe need to pay more attention to those local artists that are creating real, raw music and who are trying to put themselves out there as artists.âÂ Follow 473 on Instagram (@four.seven.three) and Facebook (@bar473), or visit their website: www.bar473.com.If you have any questions about the wonderful ways in which Tulsa is growing, or youâre interested in buying or selling soon, give us a call. Weâd love to talk with you.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Each year, our team has the privilege of helping hundreds of families make their real estate dreams come true. We know buying and selling a home can be stressful, but if you work with us, we make it easy on you. Through these incredible experiences, we create friendships and memories that last a lifetime.With that in mind, I want to share a testimonial from one of our clients that speaks to our mission in this business.Â âWe know buying and selling a home can be stressful, but if you work with us, we make it easy on you.âWe helped the Garman family sell their old home and buy a new one. They interviewed three Realtors before reaching out to us, but once they did, they described it as âa dream come true.âAt the time, they already had enough stress they could handle, so they wanted the buying and selling process to be as stress-free as possible. After staging their old home, we managed to sell it in just three days. We also staged their new home after helping them purchase it so they could settle in more comfortably.Â Watch the video above in its entirety to see their full testimonial and why theyâd recommend the Wolek Group to all of their friends and family.Â If you ever have any real estate needs, donât hesitate to call or email me.

        "content": "Today I sat down for a chat with Nate Araskog, an agent here at The Wolek Group. Heâs here to share his experiences as an agent on our team.Before coming to The Wolek Group, Nate Araskog had obtained his real estate license and worked with Daniel Sprik, a Realtor and good friend of his who had encouraged him to get into the industry in the first place.Â I helped him to sell a couple of his properties before, so one day Nate and I met for coffee. It was supposed to have been a short introduction, but it ended up becoming a two-and-half-hour meeting. During that conversation, Nate saw my experience and the opportunities that lay in the foundation of my teamâs structure and he decided he wanted to be a part of it.For my part, the conversation over coffee had originally been about real estate in general, but toward the end, something clicked within me. I asked him, âAre you asking me all these questions to join Keller Williams or to join my team?ââItâs fun to be on the front end of change within the real estate industry at large.âÂ With a smile on his face, Nate responded, âI donât knowâmaybe both.âWith that, I recommended that he and I set up another time to get back together. We did, and the rest is history.Weâve grown so much since then, andÂ his experience with our team and with Keller Williams has been fabulous overall. Itâs fun to be on the front end of change within the real estate industry at large.By the time Nate and I met for that fateful coffee meeting, he was already a go-getter who found success as a single agent. What was he missing that helped him see the value of joining a team?For him, the biggest factor was the opportunity to learn from someone who had experience. He knew that our team would provide the ability to help people as a part of an organization, not just a single agent. He knew from the first time we met that the partnership we could create by being in business together was going to be hugely successful for all of us.If you have any questions about starting career in real estate or would like to contact us about joining The Wolek Group yourself, donât hesitate to reach out to us. Weâd love to hear from you and discuss why making the switch to Keller Williams and The Wolek Group would be a great decision for the trajectory of your career.",

Joining me for a quick sit-down is Amy McMillin, who co-owns the restaurant with her brother.Â Amy and her brother have been involved in the food industry since they were teenagers, and they share a special love of Italian food. Amy got her first taste of wood-fired pizza 15 years ago when she got the chance to visit Naples, and after she did, she decided that she had to recreate the same taste back home.Â The secret to their pizzaâs amazing taste, according to Amy, is their dedication to cooking everything fresh and authentic, just like they do in Italy.Â âI learned the hard way that you need a reservation on most nights if you want to get a table here.ââEvery morning,â she says, âwe come in and light the fire in our wood-fired oven, which has no gasâweâre stacking the wood and making the fireâand weâre roasting all the fresh vegetables every day. All the meats are getting roasted. We make our dough from scratch. We import our flour from Italy. And weâre doing that fresh every single day.âIn addition to the great food, they have a fun, cool vibe inside their restaurant. Their five-year anniversary at their current location in downtown Tulsa is coming up on December 19, and in those five years, theyâve built a wine room and a second kitchen which makes handmade pasta daily. They also have an amazing patio (which Iâm a big fan of), where guests are known to wine and dine year-roundâeven when the temperature is nearly freezing.Â I learned the hard way that you need a reservation on most nights if you want to get a table here, and I canât wait to try my next Bohemian pizza.Â If youâd like to know more about the East Village Bohemian Pizzeria, visit their website atwww.eastvillagebohemian.com or check out their Instagram feed @bohemianpizzatulsa.As always, if you have any questions for me or thereâs anything I can help you with, give me a call or shoot me an email.",

        "title": "The Story Behind My Career in Real Estate",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Â People often ask me how I got into real estate, and so Iâd like to share that story with all of you today.Iâm originally from Tulsa and attended the University of Oklahoma just a couple hours away from there (Boomer Sooner!). I spent a lot of those years in school being average and only just barely getting by. I think thatâs because, like a lot of college-aged kids, I didnât know my passion or purpose in life. Finally, I got into classes that I cared about and I realized that I was a good student after all. I went on to get my masterâs degree in Human Relations.During that time, I was still waiting tables at the mall in Norman. I really think that a lot of the best real estate agents are those who have been servers. A friend of mine from high school who had just gotten into real estate reached out to me, asking if I needed to buy a house. At the time, I didnât have any money, so how was I supposed to buy a house? To that, he responded, âYou should get into real estate; a friend in my office just made $100,000 last month.âThe flexibility and lucrative nature of the real estate industry was very appealing to me at that age. After a while, though, I realized that there was a lot more hard work necessary than just selling lots of houses and raking in the money. I realized that my work ethic, which I somehow just had in me, was starting to pay off.I began working for a small brokerage with just five people in the office. I was learning how to be a property manager and how to be an office manager; I partnered with a broker and got to go on listing appointments and worked with homebuyers.Â After four years of working in real estate in Norman I knew that I was getting to the age where I wanted to be able to get back home to my family. I sold the two houses that I had bought in those four years and moved back home to Tulsa.âWeâre always looking for more people to come into our world so that we can help more families, have fun, give back to the community, and live large.âOnce I did, I signed on with a local, traditional real estate company. I was doing well at the time, but I didnât know how to be anything other than a lead receiver, which means that I would show up to open houses and smile and be nice to peopleâover time, they would open up and let me help them.Then, I discovered a company called Keller Williams. Thatâs when everything changed for me in my business and my personal life. Once I signed on with Keller Williams, I just ate up all of the available training, coaching, and mentoring that I could get my hands on. That really opened my mind; I started to dream big and realized that with Keller Williams, I could achieve those dreams.However, as a single agent, I was starting to get overwhelmed. I was working all kinds of crazy hours, and when I reached a breaking point, I knew that I needed help. Thatâs when the idea of building a team entered my mind. I didnât want to build a team to crush the faces off the Tulsa, Oklahoma real estate market, but rather because I wanted to hold on to my sanity! I wanted to be a good wife, mother, and agent, and building a team allowed me to do that.Whatâs fun about growing a team is that you get to help others do the same. Itâs such an amazing experience. Weâre always looking for more people to come into our world so that we can help more families, have fun, give back to the community, and live large.If youâve ever thought about starting a career in real estate, or if youâre currently in the business but youâre not finding the success that you want, reach out to me. Iâd love to chat with you about an amazing opportunity to join our team.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Why does Katherine Fondren recommend The Wolek Group to anyone interested in buying or selling real estate? Today, she can tell you herself:âI had a home that I needed to sell. I had known Jennie Wolek over the years through mutual friends, and I was definitely looking for something differentâ¦ something outside of the box. I was a Realtor in Louisiana when I lived there, so I thought I knew everything about the real estate business, but that was a long time ago, before the age of social media and all kinds of new marketing things.âThatâs why I loved about Jennie and what her company was doing: They were doing some outside-the-box marketing. Jennie would come over; we sat at my kitchen table and discussed what our goals were. She asked me what I liked best about my home and what prospective buyers should know about it. I was happy to share that information and she definitely used it in her marketing.âI felt she really wanted to do what was best for me and my family, as well as the people buying my home.ââThen we immediately started the buying process. I met with one of her buyerâs agents and we discussed what we were looking for and needed in a home. And throughout the process, there was a lot of feedback, which I really value; being a former Realtor, I know thatâs really important. A lot of my friends who are looking for Realtors always want feedback. If someone looked at your house, what did they think? How can we improve? What do they like? What do they not like?âWhen we finally did get a buyer, I was really excited. Jennie did everything she could to walk us through the process. She was great from beginning to end, and I felt she really wanted to do what was best for me and my family, as well as the people buying my home.âWe found this beautiful house that weâre standing in right now in a neighborhood we didnât even know about. Itâs a new home from a builder I didnât know; Jennieâs team had the knowledge of the market, so they knew what was going on even in new construction.Â âIâm thankful to The Wolek Group for helping steer us in the right direction and helping us find our dream home. Itâs a wonderful process from beginning to end, very stress-free with a lot of communication, and I definitely, definitely recommend them!âIf you, like Katherine, ever need any help with your real estate needs, please feel free to reach out to us here at The Wolek Group.

        "content": "Today Iâm excited to introduce you to my friend Luke Frazier with INSPiRE Financial Group. I met Luke at a Tulsa Chamber of Commerce event and I was so inspired by him and how he runs his business as a financial planner.Luke started this firm three years ago with what he calls âuncommon knowledge.âÂ He felt that the industry as a whole was going in one direction, but not enough people were asking why. Weâve taken that knowledge and applied strategies and recommendations behind it to better our clients. As opposed to the stock market, they tend to focus on cash flow.Products and services can only get you so far if you donât have a strong âwhy.â For Luke, he believes that there are five core areas in which everyone is trying to improve:Â relationships with family and friends, career, finances, spiritual well-being, and physical well-being.Â Luke and INSPiRE feel like the financial aspect too often adds stress or negatively affect the other five areas. Their goal with their clients is to put strategies in place to turn the financial aspect into a positive and positively affects the other areas.âEverybody has a different personality and mindset about finances.âWay too many people are relying on Wall Street and big banks for their finances. Luke and his team promote investing in themselves instead of Wall Street or big banks. They work with a lot of small business owners and even real estate investors to produce cash flow instead of just putting money away and not ever seeing it for 30 years.Their program is based on what the truly wealthy people in our country do. They go to work and make money, put their money to work for them, and use other peopleâs money to make even more money. They finance their own deals and use their own leverage, and Luke uses a lot of these types of strategies with his clients. As opposed to paying a lump sum for a boat, for example, you can take that amount and put it towards a rental property, for example. The income on the property can pay that mortgage and the loan on the boat. If we repeat that process over and over, it will create wealth.Everybody has a different personality and mindset about finances. Where Luke and his team shine are with the clients with abundant mindsets who want to get wealthy now and not wait for it for later.To learn more about Luke and what he does at INSPiRE, visit their website at www.planwithinspire.com or call Luke at (918) 500-2931.Thanks so much to Luke for joining me.

Whether youâre preparing to sell your home and move or you just want to simplify, Blue Jayâs owner Britt Greenwood says that decluttering is the way to go. This is especially important if youâre planning to sell your home. Look at your countertops in the kitchenâa good rule of thumb is to have no more than two or three appliances on them.âA good rule of thumb is to have no more than two or three appliances on your countertops.âIn the bathroom, try not to have more than a handful of items on your surfaces, including your shower. When you sell your home, you need to live in it differently than you would if you werenât planning to move.As youâre decluttering the home, pack things in moving boxes to help speed up the moving process. When filled, these boxes can be stored in the garage or in an out-of-the-way storage area.Itâs also a good idea to make a list of things that need to be done in your home regarding renovations, repairs, and touch-ups. Be sure to have all those things done before you have a professional house cleaner visit your home, since trade workers can sometimes leave a mess.If youâd like to contact Britt for an estimate, reach out to her by phone at (918) 277-3378, visit her website at www.BlueJayCleaning.com, or visit her Facebook page. One-time cleanings can be discussed over the phone, but if you have need of a recurring service, she or one of her staff members can come visit your home to see what needs to be done.For any questions you have for me or the Wolek Group at large, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

The majority of RTTâs clients are seniors or individuals with disabilities, and these people generally find out about the organization through word of mouth.

After that, the various improvement projects a given home needs are ranked by priority so that local contractors can handle the most urgent areas first. You can check out the video above at 1:13 for a slideshow of some before and after photos from RTTâs previous projects.Â Even more impressively, the money that funds RTT comes straight from our community. That said, monetary donations are always welcome. Still, there are many other ways to give back.

How are mortgage rates affecting buyers and sellers?Â Today Iâve invited Chris Padley of the Gateway Mortgage Group to join me for a quick chat so he can help answer these questions. Chris has been in the lending business for 16 years, and heâs one of the trusted lenders we work with here in the Tulsa area.According to him, what weâre seeing from the market right now can be described as the normal springtime explosion.Â âEvery single week is a new rush of pre-qualifications and contracts,â he says. âEvery year itâs exciting, and Iâm loving it.ââIf youâre a buyer and youâve been on the fence the past few months, nowâs a great time to take advantage of these conditions.âThe ups and downs of the real estate business can get crazy, so for Chris, staying positive when things get really busy means sticking to the systems heâs put in placeâhis scripts, daily phone calls, etc. He knows that letting the day in, day out craziness change his routine can cause everything else to fall apart. Every day, heâs on the phone and lead generating with potential clients and Realtors, and each day has its own theme.âMondays are my top 40, Tuesdays are my Tuesday update calls, Wednesday Iâm following up with anybody whoâs pre-qualified to make sure theyâre taken care of, and Thursdays and Fridays Iâm following up with miscellaneousâbuilders, leads that havenât applied yet, and whatnot. Every single day, thereâs work to be done.âWhat are mortgage rates like right now? Chris says that theyâre, in a word, awesome. In fact, the 30-year fixed rate is as low as 4.125%. This means if youâre a buyer and youâve been on the fence the past few months, nowâs a great time to take advantage of these conditions. We donât know whatâs going to happen in the future, but we do know that you can lock in a low rate right now. Since so many buyers will be getting into the market, now is also a great time to sell.Â If youâd like to get pre-qualified and start your home buying journey or you have any mortgage questions for Chris, you can message him at his website ThePadleyTeam.com.Â If you have any other real estate questions for me, feel free to give me a call.

They offer a full continuum of care to end youth homelessness.Brian sees a lot of runaway and homeless youth end up in their facilities. They offer safe places to stay and hold outreach programs during the day where youth can have their basic needs met.They have 20 beds in their facility and have helped 300 different individuals in their shelter within the last year.âThey helped 300 different individuals in their shelter within the last year.âMany come to Youth Services of Tulsa through their safe place program, which is advertised throughout the area. If an adolescent is going through a crisis and needs immediate help, a volunteer can pick them up and bring them to the shelter.A common misconception is that youth become homeless through some fault of their own. The vast majority are simply going through hard times. A third of the homeless youth population, for example, is made up of 18-year-olds who aged out of foster care and donât know how to make it on their own.You can help support Youth Services of Tulsa through donations or volunteer work. They rely on both in order to operate, and they also need items such as underwear and socks.

From there, he transitioned into finished carpentry, and then to building cabinets in the modern, European-style that Elite Cabinets specializes in today.Since he began his business four years ago, Brandon has been very busy due to the popularity of his cabinets. In that time, heâs noticed that the market in Tulsa has trended toward modern, clean, simple lines. Whatâs really cool about Elite Cabinets is that Brandonâs products can also blend into more rustic, traditional, or craftsman-style homes, depending on the finishes and wood grain colors.âThink about the layout of the cabinets and how that will interact with the way you use your kitchen in terms of storage and access.âIf youâre planning to remodel your kitchen, Brandon has some advice to offer: Keep the finishes of the products in mind so that they tie into the aesthetic of your home, and also think about the layout of the cabinets and how that will interact with the way you use your kitchen in terms of storage and access (e.g., if youâre right-handed or left-handed).To make an appointment with Brandon and to learn more about his excellent products, he can be reached at (918) 794-0757 or you can visit his website at www.EliteCabinetsTulsa.com.For any other questions regarding real estate, you are, as always, encouraged to reach out to me.

        "content": "Based on the market statistics that just came in for December 2018, weâre seeing that compared to December 2017, home sales were down 13%. Speaking truthfully, our team definitely felt that drop; it was slower than what weâve experienced in recent years. Â Itâs also useful to note that the number of new homes that came on the market was down 8% to 1,380 homes. Though fewer homes were coming on the market and fewer were selling, homes that were in great condition did sell pretty quickly. Some of you may have noticed that as well.âWe fully expect more sellers to place their homes on the market this year, especially as we draw closer to the prime time of the spring market.âIn Tulsa, the average sales price was $189,325. Within that price point, our average days on market was 47 days. Now, if your home was listed at a price higher than that, it would have taken a little longer to sell. Thatâs why itâs so important to work with a professionalâthey can look at your area market to come up with a detailed pricing strategy appropriate for your home.Â We monitor whether a market is a buyerâs, sellerâs, or balanced market by looking at the absorption rate, otherwise known as our monthsâ supply of inventory. The market is always in a state of flux between those market types, so we look at where itâs been to help us understand where itâs going. In December 2017, there were 5.49 months of inventory available. As of last month, there were 4.35 monthâs worth of homes on the market. We fully expect more sellers to place their homes on the market this year, especially as we draw closer to the prime time of the spring market.These stats are important to have on hand when youâre thinking about real estate, no matter if youâre buying, selling, or both. Whatever the case is, we can help and guide you through the process so that you can make smart decisions regarding when itâs a good time to buy or sell.

His father was a structural engineer too, and heâs the one who started FEI. Their company handles all kinds of inspections, but their primary focus is structural inspections. According to Jahan, the biggest home inspection issue he deals with in Tulsa is the foundation and floor slab problems.Â âUnfortunately, we have uniquely bad soil and uniquely relaxed building standards in Tulsa,â he says.âA great way for sellers to lay a foundation for a successful home sale is to get a pre-inspection done on their house before they list it.âBecoming a certified engineer requires a lot of schooling and a long apprenticeship, so inspectors like Jahan are the main authority on whether a home is safe and secure. Jahan and his father donât see eye to eye on every single home, but between the two of them, theyâve done about 50,000 inspections.Â A great way for sellers to lay a foundation for a successful home sale is to get a pre-inspection done on their house before they list it. That way, you wonât have to deal with any unwelcome surprises when the buyer does their own inspection and you give them peace of mind that theyâre getting a quality house.Â If you have any more home inspection questions for Jahan, you can visit www.FEIinspections.com or give their office a call at (918) 865-2593.Â As always, if you have any questions for me about our Tulsa market or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home soon, feel free to reach out to me.

        "content": "Today on âTulsa Foodie,â weâve decided to feature Ediblend Superfood Cafe in Utica Square. To give us a better idea about what this great restaurant is all about, we decided to meet up with its founders: Piper Kacere and Amy Murray.Â The idea for Ediblend Superfood Cafe began years ago when Piper and Amy, who are sisters, decided to do a juice cleanse. They got off to a rocky start, but shortly after beginning their second attempt, Piper and Amy began to attract the interest of people around them.Â Eventually, they started making cleanses for these people and, before they knew it, they started receiving text messages and calls from total strangers who were interested in their product. So they bought up all the mason jars and shower caddies they could find, then started making and packaging cleanses from a playroom in Piperâs home that they had converted into a kitchen.âThough these juice blends are where they got their start, the Ediblend Superfood Cafe has a lot more to offer.âThat coming summer, they moved their operation into a test kitchen they had rented out, and, lo and behold, they completely sold out for the season. Their satisfied customers couldnât stop raving about their experience, so Piper and Amy knew it was time to open a permanent location. Now, since opening in 2014, the Ediblend Superfood Cafe has two locations and a massive fan base here in Tulsa.Looking at their wide range of healthy and delicious blends, like the Sweet Green, 1717, and Sexy Yowza, itâs no wonder why. And though these juice blends are where they got their start, the Ediblend Superfood Cafe has a lot more to offer. When you visit their restaurant, you can also enjoy great salads or one of their customizable aÃ§aÃ­ bowls. Best of all, everything in the cafe is made fresh every single day.Â In the future, Amy and Piper are looking forward to expanding their business, and its menu, even wider. If youâre as interested as we are in seeing whatâs on the horizon for Ediblend Superfood Cafe, or youâre curious about their hours, locations, or menu, be sure to follow them on Facebook or visit their website: https://ediblend.com/If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

        "title": "5 Deal-Breakers That Can Wreck Your Home Sale",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "There are five deal-breakers sellers must prepare for and avoid if they want to sell their home quickly and for top dollar:1. Structural problems. Here in Oklahoma, our houses move over time. Depending on how old your home is, you might be able to notice a few settlement cracks here and there. Sometimes these are the normal effects of settling, while other times they can be more serious and may require the installation of a few piers. A single pier costs around $500, so if you see some cracks around your house that look a little more extreme than normal settling, youâll want to get that checked out.Â 2. The roof. Is your roof insurable and do you have proper coverage on it? If the buyerâs insurance company isnât able to insure your roof, many times the only other solution is to replace it.Â 3. The HVAC system. Itâs a good idea to schedule regular maintenance checks for your HVAC system with a local heating and air company. When the appointment is finished, make sure to ask for a receipt or to have a sticker placed on your system. This way, you can prove to buyers that the system has been checked.âTermites arenât prejudicedâthey love all types of wood and all types of houses.â4. Termites. Termites arenât prejudicedâthey love all types of wood and all types of houses. If thereâs termite activity in your house, treatment costs anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000. If your home had termite problems in the past, it may have been damaged, so get a visual inspection to see if thatâs the case. If past termite damage is apparent and it isnât fixed, termite inspectors will have to declare that your home needs termite treatment. Wood rot is another item that gets checked during a termite inspection, and if your home has this problem too, you need to get it cleaned up.Â 5. Low appraisals. This is a prevalent deal-breaker weâre seeing in our market right now. Appraisals are based on the current market, and appraisers have to look back in time at recent sales to make sure your home is priced correctly. There are always ups and downs in the market, though, so even though your appraisal might not be up to date with current trends, you have to go with what the appraiser says. A low appraisal hurts both sellers and buyers because when a buyerâs obtaining a mortgage, they canât pay more than the price the appraiser sets.Â We love helping sellers plan their move in advance, so if youâre thinking of selling your home any time soon, give us a call so we can help you get it ready for the market and have buyers wanting to pay full price for it.Â If you have any other real estate questions or youâre thinking of buying a home in our Tulsa market, donât hesitate to reach out to us as well. Weâd love to help you.",

We have the inventory. As real estate professionals, we have access to the multiple listing service (MLS), which is a database for Realtors. Of course, there are other websites out there that list houses for sale, but we all know that the MLS is the most up-to-date database for listings. Buyers who look for homes on other websites will only to be disappointed to find out theyâre not available.And, if we do not have the inventory, we have the tools and technologies and databases to help find you a home that fits all of your needs.âWhen a seller lists their home on the market, they have already agreed to pay the buyer agentâs compensation.â2. We have the negotiation skills. As a homebuyer, you may be hesitant to speak your mind on certain points, for fear of offending the seller.With an agent on your side, you will get the best deal and terms, you will know what is normal, and you will know what to expect. We will keep you up to date on timelines to make sure that you do not miss out on an opportunity for inspections or appraisals.3. A buyer agent is free. When a seller lists their home on the market, they have already agreed to pay the buyer agentâs compensation. There is no reason for you to do all of the work when you can use us. We can help you negotiate your best terms, hold the deal together to get you to closing on time, and provide you with all of our years of experience for free!If you have any additional questions or are interested in buying, please feel free to call me.

According to Eileen, about one in every four children goes to bed hungry at night. And, as we can all agree, this is unacceptable.Â âItâs part of our job just to make sure [these children] get what they need,â says Eileen.It was truly amazing to get a behind-the-scenes look at operations here at the Community Food Bank. Especially because at the time of my visit, they were preparing for âSummer Feeding.â The Summer Feeding program is one way that they are able to continue providing for kids who rely on school meals at other times of the year. On day one of this program, they fed an estimated 1,100 children.âApproximately one in every four children goes to bed hungry at night, so the work the Community Food Bank is doing is critical.âThe workers at the Food Bank are also delegating more resources to their partner programs, as they know that their lines grow longer in the summer months, as well.Â So, with as much as this organization does for our community, how can we give back and help them make a difference? Well, for every dollar donated, the Food Bank is able to produce four meals. Obviously, financial gifts are always welcomed.Â Of course, volunteering your time and donating food are also great ways to help.So, if you want to get in touch with Eileen, you can give her a call at (918) 585-2800, or visit www.okfoodbank.org.Â ",

Joining me is EIS Executive Director Bill Andoe.Â For the last 40 years, the mission of EIS has been to serve families who are experiencing financial hardship and have children under the age of five. They provide clothing, diapers, groceries, formula, and other essential needs these families have. All these families have to do is meet with an EIS interviewer to assess their needs so they can determine which services they can provide and which community services might be available to themâeven if their children are over five.Â Aside from their downtown location, they also have a location on the east side of Tulsa and two satellite locations on the north and south sides of town. Right now theyâre in the middle of a capital campaign, so a year from this summer, theyâll be moving to 11th and Denver. This move will help them provide more resources for families, centralize their warehouse, and stockpile more supplies.âAnyone is welcome at EIS.âOne thing in particular I love to share about EIS is anyone is welcome there. They provide their services with love and without judgementâitâs one of their founding principles. According to Bill, they average about 18,000 visits per year, and they expect that number to reach 20,000 in the near future. To help carry the loan, they have church groups, school groups, and a number of other regular volunteers who help them on a weekly basis.Â âWeâre in this because we want to help,â Bill says. âThatâs what attracts employees and volunteers to EIS. We often talk about the people who come inâwe talk about professionally mentioning them statistically as clients, but theyâre really more than just clients. Theyâre members of our community. They go to our churches. We see them at public events. Theyâre Tulsans just like us. Weâre here to help them.âEIS relies on the generosity of donors and the Tulsa community at large, so if youâd like to help them in their mission, they always welcome financial donations. They also accept diapers, wipes, car seats, strollers, and anything else a family with a young child might need.Â If youâd like to get in touch with EIS or youâd like more information on how to donate, you can visit their website at www.EISTulsa.org.Â As always, if you have any questions for me or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "title": "7 Tips for Decluttering Your Home",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Decluttering is so important in getting your home ready to sell as well as just cleaning up for spring. Whatever your motivation, thinning out your home is a great way to feel good. Today letâs go through the seven steps it takes to declutter your home.1. Make sure the front of your home is welcoming and encourages buyers to come inside. First impressions are everything. Buyers are probably going to find your home online first, and then they might even drive around the neighborhood to check it out. Youâll want to clear out any dead leaves and put some fresh mulch down. Be sure that there are no mud daubers or birdâs nests in your eaves. Pretend youâre a buyer and walk up to your front porch. What would you think?Â 2. Take it one room at a time. Decluttering can be really overwhelming, so just start small. Thin out the things in your room and closet; think about what your room would look like in a photograph. What isnât needed? Pictures will amplify those extra things on countertops and other areas.Â 3. Decide what furniture you really need in the home. To make your property look like a model home, get rid of extra furniture and end tables.4. Clean off countertops. These are common places for us to pile things up, but kitchens are very important rooms to make a good impression with. Put your toaster, blender, and other similar appliances away in a cabinet, and clear away other extraneous papers and tidbits.âThink about what your room would look like in a photograph. What isnât needed?â5. Clean your shower. When we come to preview your home, weâre going to pull back the shower curtain. Be sure the grout is clean and that tiles or paint arenât peeling. Your shower will tell buyers a lot about how you take care of your home.6. Take away your collectibles. Itâs great that you care about and collect things that are dear to your heart, but that can become a distraction to buyers. Go ahead and box it up and put it away.7.

Get a free home value reportLooking to buy a Tulsa area home? Click here to browse Tulsa homes for saleSomething thatâs really important to us as a real estate team is giving back to our community, which is why we like to spotlight our local nonprofits that are doing great things in the Tulsa area. Today, Iâm talking to Maryann Donahue from Global Gardens.Global Gardens was created by a teacher from Tulsa named Heather Oakley [spelling?] in 2007. Heather had a background in urban science education and peace education. She also had a bachelors degree in botany. She combined all of those things to create Global Gardens.The purpose of Global Gardens is to help fight the cycle of poverty and empower kids from high-poverty communities to be agents of change in their own lives and in their communities.When Heather came back to Tulsa in 2007, she started the first program at Eugene Field. She offered during and after-school programs. At that time, there was an empty lot next to Eugene Field that was bare, empty, and forgotten. She and that first group of students turned it into a beautiful, bountiful garden, and thatâs what Global Gardens has done ever since.Since then, Global Gardens has added three more sites in addition to Eugene Field, including the one Maryann and I are filming from today. This field services Union Middle School and Union High School. There are two other elementary schools in the program as well: Rosa Parks Elementary and McAuliffe Elementary in East Tulsa.âTHE PURPOSE OF GLOBAL GARDENS IS TO HELP FIGHT THE CYCLE OF POVERTY AND EMPOWER KIDS.ââWe serve over 1,800 kids every week in this program,â says Maryann. âWeâre helping about 2,500 people a year.âGlobal Gardens uses gardening as a vehicle for empowerment. They also use gardening to teach science and how to be peaceful. âIn the during-school program, they have a class garden. They get to decide what to plant, and they have a harvest party at the end of the year,â says Maryann. âThey do all of that together. Itâs very intentional.âThese programs teach science that addresses state science standards while also teaching teamwork. The students donât have many opportunities outside of Global Gardens to do hands-on, real-world things and have to do them as a team.We really believe that Global Gardens is doing a great thing. How can you help? Go to Global-Gardens.org to make an online donation. All of their funding is raised from community donations; they donât have state contracts or charge fees.Maryann says that Global Gardens hopes to add a fifth site at Jackson Elementary School in North Tulsa by 2019. This has been in the works for a while, so please consider helping them reach their goal.I would like to thank Maryann for taking the time to talk to me today. You can learn more details about Global Gardens at Global-Gardens.org.If you have any real estate questions or know another local nonprofit you think we should spotlight, give me a call or send me an email.

At that point in time, she was searching for something to do.Since then, sheâs found cleaning homes to be very fulfilling. She says it really helps her build relationships. On top of that, Lacie herself makes all of the natural cleaning products she uses.âFROM YOUR ATTIC TO YOUR JUNK DRAWER, LACIE IS HAPPY TO HELP ANYONE DECLUTTER.âThis is just one of the things that help her stand out from other cleaning companies in town.

Once she helps her clients declutter their spaces, Lacie also helps them develop an organizational system that can be implemented into their specific lifestyle.One thing Lacie highly recommends is to make use of vertical space. Instead of buying new furniture that takes up floor space, she suggests that people try to utilize their walls for storage, instead.To learn more about Lacie and her business, you can visit her website at www.CleansingRain918.com.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Get a free home value reportLooking to buy a Tulsa area home? Click here to browse Tulsa homes for saleToday, Iâm here with John Carter from John Carter Bathrooms. John has graciously agreed to answer some questions about his business.How did you get into this business?It started way back. Iâm from Namibia and my father did remodeling. He taught me everything I know. I learned everything from scratch and got to love remodeling, which made me decide to make it a business.I moved to the United States a couple of years ago and got a job like everybody else. Then I realized that I wouldnât be able to work on my dreams, so I decided to start a remodeling business. I can do kitchens, bathrooms, and even build homes, but I wanted to focus on something special, so I learned how to specialize in bathrooms.I love your story and that you are doing something you are passionate about, which is important to me as well. What makes you stand out from the competition?There are a couple of things that make us different. First, we complete all projects on time and on budget. It is a top priority for us to work around your schedule and your finances. Second, all of our projects are designed to fit your size and your style. We donât ask you to cut corners on the perfect remodel. Finally, we are the most available and we provide daily progress reports on whatâs done, so youâre never left wondering what we did all day.âYOU WILL GET DAILY PROGRESS REPORTS SO YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH WORK HAS BEEN DONE.âWhatâs a new style or trend that you have noticed lately?In kitchens, soapstone has been popular lately. Weâve been using it in bathrooms for a little bit. People do want to use quartz for their surfaces these days. There are a lot of new materials out there. People like wooden countertops as well.For bathrooms, people stick to light, neutral colors. Those will last a long time. Back in the 80s, people made pink, green, and purple bathrooms. That doesnât work. My job is to come into somebodyâs home and put something in there with tile that will last. Technology has improved with tile and cement, so we can build up bathrooms that are mold-free and 100% waterproof, which is great.How can someone get in touch with you about a remodel or to ask any questions?My phone number is 918-574-4610 or look at my website, JohnCarterBathrooms.com. You can enter your information and get a free 3-D model of what your bathroom could look like at no cost to you.Thank you to John for answering my questions. As always, if you have any real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

Theyâll do all the measuring, look at your paint colors, work with what pieces you already have, give guidance on space planning, give direction for new pieces, and more. It could be something as simple as window treatments, but whatever it is, the help of a designer can make all the difference.We do a lot in stages. It may just be planning for the big pictureâdoing a few changes now and a little bit more down the road to ultimately get the look that you want.What are you seeing in terms of design trends?Clean lines are still key here in Tulsa. Itâs becoming a transitional market, but neutrals are still very popular, and a lot of the taupes of years past are coming back. Adding in a little bit of fun with texture or a pop of color is a good way to brighten up your space.How can people get in touch with you?You can find us in our showroom at 9922 Riverside Parkway in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in the Kingâs Landing Shopping Center.

I had the opportunity to ask Carey some questions about her involvement with The Parent Child Center of Tulsa. Her and her husband, Brett Baker, are Co-chairs for Toyland Ball 2018.The Toyland Ball, held every January, is The Parent Child Center of Tulsaâs annual signature fundraising event. This black tie gala featuring a whimsical theme offers an elegant evening of dinner and dancing, with a live auction.I caught up with Carey at the Toyland Ball Stock the Bar Party where attendees bring a bottle of wine valued at $50 or more to be auctioned off at the Toyland Ball 2018 in January. In past years, the wine auctioned off at the event in January has raised between $8,000 and $10,000 for The Parent Child Center of Tulsa. That is just the money raised from auctioning the wine. There are other items that are auctioned off that raise even more money for the cause.For those of you who may not know, the mission of The Parent Child Center of Tulsa is to prevent child abuse and neglect through education, treatment, and advocacy. People who have been victims of abuse or neglect are given education and counseling so that they are able to end the cycle. Many people only know what theyâve been taught, so The Parent Child Center of Tulsa aims to reverse this.If youâre interested in attending, the Toyland Ball auction will take place on January 20th, 2018 at the Cox Business Center. For tickets, visit www.ParentChildCenter.org. You can also become a patron sponsor by donating $1,000 for two people.At the event, there will be raffles, an auction, and a live band. Also, all of the proceeds go directly to the counseling funds for The Parent Child Center of Tulsa.We hope you have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Get a free home value reportLooking to buy a Tulsa area home? Click here to browse Tulsa homes for saleToday, Iâm going to give my two cents on a topic that keeps coming up in our business. I know if youâve watched my videos in the past, I say the same things over and over again. That just because we sell lots and lots of houses and we get to help lots and lots of people. We have a lot of experience with this.I am still primarily the listing agent for our team, so I mostly work with sellers. I receive offers from agents that are working with buyers, and so many times these offers come in lower than the listing price, and sometimes with other concessions built in, such as closing costs and warranties.I will admit that sometimes, Iâm a little shocked at some of the offers we get.Then I remember that in a buyerâs mind, they are doing the best that they can for their family. Of course they want to make a lower offer, because they feel like itâs their job to negotiate.Well, as an agent, thatâs also part of our job: to best prepare our clients and to explain the market to them.When we receive these lower offers or offers that have different contingencies built in, itâs our job to settle the client (the seller) and explain to them that these are expectedâlow offers like these are the norm.âI WILL ADMIT THAT SOMETIMES, IâM A LITTLE SHOCKED AT SOME OF THE OFFERS WE GET.âIâll admit it: I forget that you guys donât do this every day like I do. I do need to slow down and understand where youâre coming from, because as a seller, you are working to get your best deal and to put the most money in your pocket. That is my goal for you, too.However, I do know that Iâm studying the market all the time and monitoring the average list-to-sales price of the MLS, how we can put the most money in your pocket and at the same time, get your home sold.An offer early on may be a little lower than you were planning on, and yet, if it doesnât sell, how much longer will you have it?Remember that the process of selling is a negotiation. Please do not ever reject an offer; you have to do a little bit of negotiating to show that you want to sell your house. The buyer is working to get their best number, and youâre working to get your best number, so sometimes you have to get together in the middle somewhere.Thatâs our goal: to get you the most money, and for the buyers to get the best deal. At the same time, we have to work together to achieve your real estate dreams.Let me know if this was helpful to you, and if you have any questions, give me call! Iâd love to speak with you.",

Do you have all the nice amenities, updates, and features that the other homes youâre competing with have? If not, you need to offset that by offering a better price.You have only one opportunity, and thatâs early on in the listing period. Thatâs where youâll see the most amount of activity, and thatâs when you need to capture a buyer.Whether youâre thinking about selling or buying a house in our market, weâd love to help you out. Just give me a call or send me an email and Iâd be happy to speak with you.",

Get a free home value reportLooking to buy a Tulsa area home? Click here to browse Tulsa homes for saleWe are seeing a shift in our market. I know that some people might have a little fear about that word, but we are always seeing shifts in this market throughout the year. As real estate agents, we are always prepared for these types of shifts.Based on the last few months, weâre seeing a bit of a change in the market. Youâve heard me talk about home sales above $200,000 slowing down. Homes in the $100,000 to $200,000 price range which have been selling within days over the last few months have also seen a slowdown in sales as well.We have put great homes on the market in the last month in the $150,000 to $185,000 price range that I thought for sure would be easy sellers, and they havenât sold as quickly as we thought.If youâre a consumer, just know that the market is always changing. You should always pay attention to whatâs happening locally, and pay less attention to whatâs happening on a national scale. There are other markets in different parts of the country that arenât seeing the same type of shift that weâre seeing locally.âBASED ON THE LAST FEW MONTHS, WEâRE SEEING A BIT OF A CHANGE IN THE MARKET.âHere at the Wolek Group, we make sure to pay attention to those local trends and statistics. All the Keller Williams agents in town do their best to ensure that weâre sharing the same message to the consumers. We want to be open and honest about whatâs going on, especially now that weâre starting to move away from the sellerâs market weâve been enjoying for quite awhile.Make sure that youâre choosing an agent that is really researching the market and understands whatâs going on in your neighborhood. As a final note, I wanted to assure you that homes still are selling, so donât be afraid of the market if youâre looking to dive in. Just make sure to be educated on whatâs going on.If you have any questions or need anything at all, give me a call. Iâm happy to help!",

        "content": "The moving and real estate industries have a lot in common. I recently spoke with Julie Woolslayer about some tips and tricks of the moving process.Looking to sell your Tulsa area home? Get a free home value reportLooking to buy a Tulsa area home? Click here to browse Tulsa homes for saleI was recently joined by Julie Woolslayer of Great Day Moving, who you may remember from past conversations weâve had.She and her husband have a great business that Iâve used personally and also that Iâve referred to multiple clients.The moving industry is very much related to the business of real estate, so I wanted to give Julie the chance to present some tips and tricks for moving.First of all, Julie recommends that you should always start early in the process. If you think youâre moving, decluttering will help you for a number of reasons. Not only does it prepare a home for showing but it also makes it easier on you when it comes time to move your belongings.Get as much help as you can from friends and family members when you undertake the task of organizing and decluttering your home. One tip that Julie recommended on the matter was to read the book âItâs All Too Muchâ by Peter Walsh. Itâs full of great tips on how to organize and get rid of items in your home.You may even want to enlist the help of professional organizers. The bottom line is that there is a lot of help availableâyou just need to get motivated and get started.âTHERE IS A LOT OF HELP AVAILABLEâYOU JUST NEED TO GET MOTIVATED AND GET STARTED.âThis process is especially helpful for sellers who are downsizing. Julie and her team are more than happy to talk to people undergoing the downsizing process in order to assess what kind of help will be most useful to them. She also mentioned Settled Inâa company sheâs worked with in the past that helps clients decide what to take and what to leave in a move.Julie also has a plan for people who are unable to move into their new home right away but need to move their items out of their old home.In situations like these, Great Day Moving partners with another Tulsa business: Premier Logistics. Premier Logistics has trucks and trailers available for rent, which Great Day Moving then loads and stores at their 24-hour secured lot for as long as the seller might need.Then, once it is time to move, Great Day Moving brings the truck on site to the new home and unloads it as they would during any other moving process.Overall, Julie works hard to offer moving solutions. In fact, if you call and tell our scheduler Kelsey that you saw this video, you can save $75 off on any move over two hours.If youâd like to reach out to Julie you can contact her by calling (918) 877-1971 or by visiting GreatDayMoving.com.If I can answer any other questions or youâd like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you, soon.",
