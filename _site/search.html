        "content": "The Bar-B-Q Shop, voted #1 ribs in America by the Food Networkâs âTop Five Restaurantsâ, located in the heart of Midtown, less than a mile from the Overton Square Entertainment District, is a local Memphis barbecue eatery that opened in November of 1987. It is a place known for real-pit barbecue with old fashioned barbecue sauces and cole slaw that are made from scratch.The unique taste of The Bar-B-Q Shopâs gourmet award winning sauces has always been something that has set The Bar-B-Q Shop off from other barbeque restaurants. The recipes for our gourmet sauces have been around for over fifty years.The Original (mild) Sauce provides a thickness that can be used to baste, marinade, or provide flavoring for your meat of choice.Our Hot Sauce also provides the same level of thickness but with a little warmth behind it. Our Hot Sauce does an excellent job of providing your meat with a hot flavor without taking away from the barbeque, smokey flavor itself.The Bar-B-Q Shopâs Dry Seasoning was created later by Frank Vernon in the mid eighties. Our Dry Seasoning is an extraordinary seasoning because it can be used to season anything from chicken breasts, hamburger steaks, salmon or fillet catfish, to even a beef roast. The seasoning can be used with a marinade while prepping your food item, or it can be applied when your food comes out of the oven.1782 Madison Ave, Memphis, TN 38104Restaurant: 901.272.1277Sauce Order: 888.372.8237By and photo credit: The Bar-B-Q Shop",

        "content": "The laundry room is probably not the first space you think of when you hear the word luxurious.  But it is a room you spend a lot of time in.  Doing laundry is a necessary part of life, so why not make it more appealing by creating a comfortable, practical and pretty environment that will make it feel less like a chore and more like a pleasant task. You donât have to spend a lot of money to make your laundry room a calm and soothing work space.  There are opulent touches you can add that will improve your disposition while performing the essential duties of washing, drying, folding and ironing.*Paint the room in a soft, neutral color - choose from greens, blues or yellow.-Hang some art on the walls.  Pick pieces that you love or are meaningful to you. You donât have to spend a lot of moneyâ¦just choose paintings or pictures that bring you joy.-If you lack storage in your laundry room, add some simple shelves with clean lines.  Get some clear containers for your detergent, fabric softener sheets, clothes pins etc. so you can dispose of the unsightly bags and boxes they come in.-Use baskets or bins to pre-sort clothes into whites, colors, sheets, towels etc.-If your laundry room is spacious, create a folding area.  You can have a table or if you are using front loading machines, design a counter to go on top of them.-Add a small, wall-mounted television and a comfy chair, and folding clothes wonât seem so boring anymore.-Add a small vase with fresh flowers.  Being amidst the beauty of nature will make you feel better about being stuck indoors doing laundry!Remember, guests are not likely to see your laundry room, so make it all about YOU.  Be funky and unique with your dÃ©cor and have fun with it!  Before you know it, you will look forward to doing all that washing, drying and folding.  Okâ¦maybe you wonât look forward to it, but at least you wonât dread it!More Resources:Quick Fix Tricks to Make Your House Sparkling CleanTop Home Renovations for Maximum ROIClearing the Clutter",

        "content": "If you want the best price for your house, you may have to do some repairs before selling it. Potential buyers will be willing to spend more for a home that doesnât need a lot of work.  Here are 5 important things to fix before selling:      Exterior - When was the last time the exterior of your house was painted?  Is the paint faded and chipping?  Is wood rotting around the windows?  Is your front door dingy?  First impressions matter when it comes to selling your home and buyers will get their first impression when they see the outside of your house whether in pictures or in person.  Donât forget the landscaping.  A well-kept lawn and simple, but clean flower beds will go a long way toward creating an enticing aesthetic for your property.        Interior Paint - If the walls are looking a bit shabby and the trim a bit grimy, painting is a quick and easy fix.  The same applies if you went through a crazy color phase a few years back and decorated with hues that might not appeal to everyone.  Choose neutral colors that will allow buyers to focus on the spaces without being distracted.        Kitchen - The kitchen is one of the most important rooms that buyers focus on when looking at a house.  So, if yours is looking run-down you will want to update it.  It will be worth the investment to replace appliances that are on their last legs or putting in a new granite counter.  Or it might be as simple as repainting cabinets and adding shiny, new handles.        Bathroom - Nothing turns buyers off faster than an unsightly bathroom.  Sparkling, clean fixtures and a fresh coat of paint will go a long way toward impressing someone searching for their dream home.  Inexpensive touches like a decorative mirror or a lovely picture on the wall will add to the ambiance without breaking the bank.        Flooring - If your carpets are stained or thread bare, it is worth your while to replace them.  Otherwise, buyers may ask for a carpet allowance when they make an offer on your house.  The same applies if your vinyl floors are in bad shape.  Hardwoods are always popular, but you may want to consider getting them refinished if they are looking old and scruffy.  It may seem counter intuitive to spend money on repairing or fixing up a house you are getting ready to sell, but at the end of the day, it will not only help you sell your house faster, but you will get a better price for it too.More Resources:Quick Fix Tricks to Make Your House SparklingTips for Showing Your Home to Potential Buyers",

You need to make sure you can afford that in addition to property taxes, utilities, and various other maintenance fees.âHOME VALUES HAVE BEEN INCREASING YEAR BY YEAR IN MEMPHIS.â      Choose your lender wisely. Online lenders arenât always the best option, even if they advertise the lowest rate. You should really get a recommendation from a Realtor or some other person you trust. Local lenders tend to work best in terms of being able to close on time.        Donât overlook the details. Purchase contracts have a lot of them. Take your time to read through it carefully and donât hesitate to ask your Realtor any questions you have.  These are just three tips for successfully buying a home for the first time.

        "category": "",
        "content": "If youâre looking to buy a home here in Memphis, you might have to compete against other offers for a home you like.For starters, remember that no other buyers know what the offers are, so you donât have to worry about your offer being revealed. However, you can do a few things to make your offer better.First, put down as much earnest money as possible. This speaks volumes to the seller about your interest level in the home and that you can follow through with the loan process. Putting down a small amount means you donât have any skin in the game, and the seller might not see your offer as worth it at that point.Secondly, show the seller that you are qualified for a home loan. Get fully pre-approved for a loan instead of just getting pre-qualified, which carries less weight. An offer with a pre-approval is akin to a cash offer for a seller.âSHOW THE SELLER THAT YOU ARE QUALIFIED FOR A HOME LOAN.âYou can also give the seller extra time to move. Call the listing agent and ask them whatâs important to their seller, because itâs not always all about money. For example, I recently worked with a seller who needed to rent the house back for a couple months after closing because they have a handicapped child. There are many situations going on in peopleâs lives, and accommodating them can help you win the home.Finally, add a personal touch by writing a letter telling the seller why you love the home. Also be aware of what youâre willing to pay for the home.If you have any questions about multiple offer situations when buying a home, give us a call or send us an email soon.

Donât close any accounts or open any new ones when preparing to buy a home. Also, make sure your credit to debt ratio looks good on all your open accounts. If you have a $500 limit, donât let the balance sit at $495.Next, donât switch jobs. If you do need to switch, try to stay in the same field so lenders have information about the switch. They want to see some job security, so if youâve hopped around a lot that can be a problem.âDONâT CLOSE ANY ACCOUNTS OR OPEN ANY NEW ONES WHEN PREPARING TO BUY A HOME.âPay attention to your balances. If you have a high limit and youâve maxed that out, it wonât look good to lenders. On the other hand, if you had a credit card that you use and pay off regularly, lenders will love that.Finally, donât make any big purchases until after closing on a home.

        "content": "Today Iâm here with Wendy Thompson of the Wendy Thompson Lending Team to talk about your tax appraisal. Unless you live in the downtown area, you should have received your appraisal by now.If you disagree with your appraisal, you can go to the Shelby County tax assessor site and fill out an informal request for a reassessment. You donât have to provide a lot of documentation for an informal request, so it is a fairly easy process. That said, there is a short time frame for informal requests. Beginning on May 1st, you can make a formal request. That is a much more involved process.âMAKE SURE YOUR LENDER IS USING THE CORRECT TAX ASSESSMENT.âIf you are selling your house and your taxes have gone up, this could impact you. Since taxes are divided between you and your potential buyer at closing, the buyer could come to you and ask for additional taxes since your appraisal went up.If you are a buyer and you are currently under contract to purchase a home, make sure that your lender is using the correct tax assessment. Unfortunately, in some instances even a slight increase in monthly taxes can make a huge difference between getting approved for a loan or not.As always, if you have any questions about this topic, just give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "Interest rates have been a hot topic recently, so today, Iâve brought in Wendy Thompson with the Wendy Thompson Lending Team of Bank of England Mortgage to help me explain.The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.25% last week, and the market actually responded very positively. Rates had been rising before, but weâve actually settled with rates at about 4.25% with FHA, VA, and USDA interest rates at 4%. The Federal Reserve anticipates two more rate increases of 0.25% this year as well.The good thing is that despite the recent rise, rates are still very low. If youâre thinking about buying a new home, itâs better to act sooner than later.Rates have been so low for so long that itâs actually better for the economy for them to go up now. After all, we all want our retirement funds and investments to do well also. The impact of rising rates on your costs isnât substantial either. For a $200,000 home, a 0.25% increase in rates only equates to about $25 more per month. Historically speaking, having rates this low is great compared to the 18% I saw when I started in real estate.âRATES HAVE BEEN SO LOW FOR SO LONG THAT ITâS ACTUALLY BETTER FOR THE ECONOMY FOR THEM TO GO UP NOW.âMany people donât know that mortgage-backed securities control mortgage rates. Thatâs why itâs important to work with a mortgage lender who follows rate changes daily. As Wendy says, itâs a bit volatile right now because things outside of the country can even have an effect on rates, so they can change on a dime. Having a knowledgeable lender is more important in these conditions.If you have any questions for Wendy about rates or getting approved for a home loan, you can reach her at Wendy@TheWendyThompsonTeam.com or give her a call at 901-461-8858.As always, if you have any questions about our market or youâre thinking about buying or selling a home, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

After all, the way we live in our home every day is different from the way we live in it after it has been on the market. Here are five things you need to pay attention to when selling a home with pets:      Tufts of fur: If you have a cat or dog that sheds, you need to clean up the extra fur that gathers around the house so that your home doesnât look messy.        Floor stains: Redo your hardwood floors if need be and make sure that any pet stains are cleaned out of the carpet.  âCLEAN UP ANY PET STAINS TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY.â      Pet odors: You can get used to the smell when you live there, but you donât want buyers to walk in and think your house smells like wet dog. Pet stores sell products, like candles, that will cover up pet odors without being too overwhelming.        Scratches and dings: Puppies love to chew and scratch at things. If you have marks on your furniture, there are special pens out there that can cover those up. Pay attention to your windowsills and doors, as dogs tend to scratch on those as well.        Bowls, pet beds, and litter boxes: Put away all of the pet paraphernalia that you can and make sure that the litter box is clean; buyers donât want to see or smell that.  Take care of these five things so that your home shows well. If you have any other questions about selling with pets or about the home-selling process in general, give me a call or send me an email.

There are plenty of things you may have put off, like new appliances or granite countertops, so why not enjoy them a bit before selling your house? Give yourself a chance to cook with those new appliances first.The second reason to start renovations early is that they always take longer than you expect. If you get an estimated timeline of six weeks, plan on 12 weeks. Itâs just the nature of the beast. If you plan for this, you wonât have to be stressed about getting your house finished and on the market in a certain amount of time.Thirdly, you might run into issues that youâre not aware of. A big part of my job is going to potential listings early to get a look at things that might need to be done. We often uncover issues that you never notice because you live in the home every day.âYOUR RENOVATIONS DONâT HAVE TO BE MASSIVE.âYour renovations donât have to be huge. Iâm not talking about taking things down to the studs for a renovation. In fact, thatâs not beneficial in many cases. **My goal is to get you $3 in return for every $1 you spend. **The fifth reason is that in this competitive market, you simply might need renovations.
