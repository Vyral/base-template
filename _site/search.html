Get a FREE home value reportWant to buy a home? Search all homes for saleIn our market, it is very important that you as a buyer have a buyer partner representing you.As our very own buyer partner Melissa Hayes explains it, a buyer partner is someone who protects the buyer, works with them from start to finish throughout the transaction, and helps them through the whole process. They can also make sure you have certain stipulations put in the contract that are for your benefit.âA BUYERâS PARTNER PROTECTS BUYERS AND MAKES SURE THEY GET THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE.âWhat do buyers need protection from? A few different things. For example, if you pull up to a house and see an agentâs name on the âFor Saleâ sign, that agent is representing the seller and looking out for their best interestsânot yours. A buyerâs partner like Melissa, on the other hand, protects her buyers and makes sure they get the best deal possible.Think of it this wayâif you were getting divorced, you wouldnât want the same lawyer representing you and your soon-to-be ex-spouse, would you?If you have any questions about buyer partners or youâre thinking of buying a home in our market, donât hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today Iâm joined by one of our buyer partners, Melissa Hayes, to bring you the latest information from our market. Itâs time for another market update.Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value reportWant to buy a home? Search all homes for saleToday Iâm excited to bring you the latest information from our market. To help me do so, Iâm joined by Melissa Hayesâa buyer partner on our team.Whether youâre a buyer or a seller, it is critical to understand whatâs happening in our Clarksville market.First of all, we had 1,377 properties on the market at this time last year. That number has since dropped to just 1,046 properties on the market right now. This 24% decrease means weâre in a sellerâs market.As a buyerâs partner, Melissa is a valuable resource to people trying to get an offer accepted in this kind of market.According to Melissa, weâve closed on 3,108 properties so far in 2017, compared to the 2,794 that closed last year. This 11.24% difference illustrates just how much the market can change in a year.Homes on the market move quickly. As Melissa puts it, they are âhere today, gone tomorrow.â Right now, the market is truly competitive.âHOMES IN TODAYâS MARKET ARE HERE TODAY, GONE TOMORROW.âIn 2016, the average list price was $174,800. This year, that average has gone up to $183,400. However, the average number of days on market has decreasedâmoving from 66 last year to 57 now.If youâve been thinking of selling, the time is now. Buyers have a lot of opportunities right now though, too. Even so, many buyers wonder what an appropriate offer looks like.Typically, this can be determined by following the statistics related to the list-to-sale ratio. The list-to-sale ratio refers to what sellers ask for compared to what they actually get. Currently, sellers are receiving about 99.02% of the list price.This is sometimes a good starting point for offers, but in competitive situations it may be better to offer more.

Search all homes for saleLately, a lot of people have asked me whether you can live in your home while selling it.Of course you can!The key to selling your home while living in it is staging. Your homeâs first showing is on the Internet, so it needs to look great online. Itâs better to have a home thatâs staged than to have a vacant home, so we like to give our sellers these tips:1. Remove all signs of personalization: We know youâre proud of your family, but things like family photos make it hard for buyers to imagine themselves living there.âYOUR AGENT DOESNâT THE PICK YOUR HOMEâS PRICE; THE MARKET DOES.â2. Redefine each room for its intended purpose: Say you converted one of three bedrooms in your house to an officeâyou want to change it back to a bedroom so buyers can see how all the living space works.3. Pick the right price: This is where the expertise of a real estate professional comes in. Theyâll give you a thorough market analysis to help us understand the right price. We donât determine the price; the market does.4. Price your home right the first time and donât lower it: Lowering your price isnât always the best option because there are other things we can do before resorting to a lower price.If you have any questions about selling your home or youâre ready to list it on the market, give us a call or send us an email soon.

Get a FREE home value reportWant to buy a home? Search all homes for saleWhen youâre shopping for a home, there are four mortgage mistakes you should try to avoid:1. Thinking the advertised you see is the rate youâll get: The advertised rate will be that companyâs lowest possible rate. In reality, many things go into determining the rate youâll get, like your credit score.2. Not comparing lenders: There are plenty of ways to compare lenders and their rates these days. You also want to compare their closing costs, especially in an area like Clarksville where you might ask the seller to pay some closing costs.3. Waiting for a better rate: If you wait for rates to drop in an active market like ours with prices going up, you might end up paying more for the house itself, even if the rate goes down. In many cases, it could actually cost you more money if you wait.4. Choosing the wrong type of loan: For example, many people think that since weâre in a VA market, they should automatically choose a VA loan. However, it all depends on what else you plan to do with the the financing. One big thing to consider in this situation is how much money youâre putting down.âWAITING FOR A LOWER INTEREST RATE COULD MEAN PAYING MORE FOR THE HOUSE ITSELF.âWe can provide more details and advice on any of these points if you have any other questions.

Search all homes for saleIf youâre looking to buy your first home in 2017, there are a few steps you should take in preparation. Iâll go over those today.First, you need to hire the right real estate agent. You might run into some uncomfortable situations if you work with a family member or a friend, so I recommend choosing an experienced agent whoâs only objective is to represent your home purchase. Also, an experienced agent can help you find homes that might not even be listed on the market. Furthermore, the right agent is going to be able to negotiate in your favor to ensure you get the best deal on a home.Second, donât be afraid to talk to multiple lenders. Some lendersâ rates might be better than others, or they might match each other. Either way, talking to multiple lenders can only benefit you. Also, if you are going to get a VA loan, make sure the lender you choose is experienced in dealing with that specific type of loan.âTHE RIGHT AGENT IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE IN YOUR FAVOR TO ENSURE YOU GET THE BEST DEAL ON A HOME.âLast but not least, mind your credit. Credit scores are incredibly important because a lender is going to base the interest rate you get for your mortgage off them. There are also going to be credit checks when you go to put insurance on your home.There are a few other tips, so if you would like to hear about them or if you have any other real estate related questions, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

How long have you been in the business? This is an important thing to know because youâd be surprised at how big of a role experience plays.

The more experience you have, the better you can negotiate, and the quicker you can get to the closing table.2. How many homes did you sell last year? If an agent has been in the business their whole life but only sells a few homes per year, they donât have as much experience as someone who has only been in the business 10 years but works in real estate full-time. Experience is important, but so is the level of activity an agent has in the market on a regular basis.3. How close are your list prices to your final sale prices? The final sale price is the most important piece of information, but the closer an agent can get you to your initial asking price, the better.âTHE MORE EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE, THE BETTER YOU CAN NEGOTIATE.âThere are several other questions you should ask and if youâd like to know what they are, Iâd be glad to help out.

This is a question I get quite often.You might be surprised to hear that itâs actually a perfect time to buy a home. Why? For starters, home prices are normally lower at this time of the year. Stats from RealtyTrac analysis from more than 32 million home sales show that buyers who purchased a home in October paid 2.64% below estimated value. That great deal youâre looking for could be out there this time of year.Additionally, there is less competition on the market since there are fewer homes for sale. Simply put, this means there will be fewer buyers out and about. Also consider that the holidays are right around the corner. Sellers who had their homes on the market during the summer probably want to be out of their house and into their new one before the holidays hit, so they are motivated to sell. Youâll have the added bonus of moving into your new home before the holidays, too.âLESS COMPETITION MEANS YOU CAN GET A BETTER DEAL.âFinally, there are year-end tax credits to be taken advantage of. There are credits for buying a house before the end of the year as opposed to waiting for next year.If you have any other questions about buying in the fall or winter months or youâre ready to buy now, give us a call or send us an email.
