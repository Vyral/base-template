        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I want to talk with you about how the appraisal process and the mortgage loan application process work.When the purchase contract comes in, all initial loan disclosures have been signed, and we have the intent to proceed as a lender, we will order an appraisal on the property.Since Dodd-Frank and mortgage reform, all mortgage lenders have to go through an appraisal management company. We will place our order through the appraisal management company and then they will contract with the appraiser.âSince Dodd-Frank and mortgage reform, all mortgage lenders have to go through an appraisal management company.âAs the lender, we will not know who the appraiser is on the property until we actually get the report. This ensures that there is no coercion of value. Also, it guarantees nobody has reached out to the appraiser and provided any information that could sway their opinion of value. This makes it so the lender can be sure that they are getting the most accurate depiction of the value of the property.This process also protects the buyer as well from any coercion of value from either side of the transaction.Once the appraisal comes back, it is reviewed and then it can be released to all parties in the transaction for review.If you have any other questions about the appraisal process or the cost of an appraisal in the home buying process, please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I would be happy to speak with you about it.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Despite being commonly confused, pre-qualification letters and pre-approval letters are two distinct documents. Today Iâd like to talk about the difference between them and, also, which is better for buyers to have.First, what is a pre-qualification letter?A pre-qualification letter is a document containing information from a mortgage loan application. However, little of the information listed on this document has been verified. This means pre-qualification letters are not reliable evidence in the eyes of a seller, since only the buyerâs credit score has been confirmed.Pre-approval letters, on the other hand, contain verified information about the buyer. All documentation has been collected, and the underwriter has reviewed and approved the loan file. For this reason, buyers with a pre-approval letter should be viewed as cash buyers when it comes to multiple offer situations.As long as the property appraises and nothing pertaining to the buyersâ financial situation changes drastically during escrow, the approval process should go quickly for buyers with a pre-approval letter. Having a pre-approval letter is very important in the mortgage lending process.âFor this reason, buyers with a pre-approval letter should be viewed as cash buyers when it comes to multiple offer situations.âIf you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Today weâre here to answer a few questions about why itâs never a good idea to let anybody pull your credit during the mortgage loan process without consulting with your mortgage loan officer first. Letâs get right to it.How do credit inquiries affect your credit score?When you apply for credit, itâs considered a âhard inquiry.â All hard inquiries result in a reduction of your credit score. However, inquiries are weighted. Mortgage and car loans will reduce your credit score by fewer points than a store or airline credit card. Each credit union will give you a different score, but hard inquiries result in a reduction in each case.We are switching utilities. What if they pull our credit?Utilities are a little bit different than a credit card or car loan. Itâs considered a soft pull. They will pull your payment history and they may pull a credit score on their site, but itâs not an actual hard inquiry. We wonât see a reduction or anything on our side from the utility companies. So, getting your credit pulled from the utility company wonât affect your mortgage loan application.âYou should avoid hard inquiries as much as possible.âWhat services and companies should you give permission to pull credit?Itâs going to come down to the things you need to have in place when you moved into your new home. Your utilities, cable, phone, internet, etc. You never want to have any hard inquiries unless they are absolutely necessary. Thatâs why itâs important to have a great one-on-one relationship with your loan officer so you can talk these situations out and find a solution.Do lenders run a second credit check before closing?Some loan programs do require a soft pull or a second credit check prior to closing. It isnât a hard inquiry, so you wonât see a reduction in your score. You always want to err on the side of caution. If youâre planning on buying a home, pay extra attention to your security, because even little mistakes could cause you to lose out on a loan.If you have any questions for me or anyone on my team, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Sometimes, families going through the loan process are so excited about the prospect of purchasing a home and how that home will look that they jump the gun and either make a major purchase with their credit card or open a new credit card to make some major purchases.Â As weâve discussed in previous videos, this can have a detrimental impact on your credit. There are some loan programs that require us to do a soft credit pull prior to closing, so weâll see any credit inquiries for large purchases. Depending on the purchase amount and what it does to your credit score, this could affect your qualification and eventual closing.Â Even though furniture stores can offer you 0% financing for 60 months, what theyâre essentially doing is providing you a credit card, which is a revolving credit line that will report to all three major credit bureaus. When you apply for the storeâs financing, that will show up on your credit history and, in turn, drop your credit score because a computer doesnât understand the circumstances involved. It doesnât know whether youâre credit-seeking or youâve perhaps fallen on hard times and youâre trying to take out a card and max it out.Â If youâre given $1,000 worth of credit and you spend all of it, not only will that inquiry drop your credit score, but you will have also maxed out another account. Even though that $1,000 sum requires 0% interest or doesnât require any payments for the first six months, it will still show up on your credit report, which could affect your debt-to-income ratio.Â âWait until after youâve closed on your home to start buying furniture for it.âBuying furniture for your new home is something that needs to be done, but you donât want the furniture truck to show up in the driveway the day of your closing because that means your furniture store account wouldâve had to have been opened and financed prior to that closing.Â Paying for new furniture with cash before you close on your home, on the other hand, wonât hurt anything unless you use the money you set aside for your down payment and closing costs. Itâs your money and you can do what you want with it, just be cognizant of what youâll need at the closing table.The best time to purchase new furniture for your home is anytime after you close. Us lenders wonât verify what happened after the day of your closing, so if you need to sign up for a line of credit from a furniture store, make sure you do it after you close. That way, you actually have a home to put your furniture in.Â If you have any other questions about this topic or anything else about the mortgage loan process, donât hesitate to reach out to me and my team.

        "content": "Will purchasing a car affect your ability to buy a home? Yes, and there are a few different ways a car purchase can impact your chances of being approved for a mortgage or closing on a new home.Â It doesnât matter if you buy a $20,000 car or a $100,000 car. In the grand scheme of things, the amount of debt is not as important as the monthly debt that goes along with purchasing a car. Your car payment will get calculated into your debt-to-income ratio, and some loan programs have higher debt-to-income ratio qualifications than others.Â If you are pre-approved and already looking at homes at the top of your budget without that monthly car payment, buying a car could affect your ability to qualify. We will not close on a loan that does not meet the debt-to-income ratio requirements. Â Buying a car can also impact your funds for closing. Sometimes when you buy a car, they require some sort of down payment to get into the vehicle. You might end up using funds that you had set aside for a down payment or closing costs. If you donât have those funds available, you may not be able to close on the home that you are looking to buy. Â Letâs say that you need to buy a car. What can you do so that you donât hurt your chances of buying a home?Â One thing we can do is look at the numbers and see what you could qualify for, what youâre looking for in a home, and what you need in a car. From there, we can see what that payment equates to in your debt-to-income ratio.Â Every $50 in a monthly car payment can affect your buying power by about $10,000. If you get a $200 monthly car payment, you may have limited your mortgage by $40,000, and thatâs a lot of house. It really depends on what you need and what works for you and your family. We can kind of reverse those numbers to make it work.Â âYou donât want to buy a car, truck, or van during the mortgage loan processâunless you want to end up living in it.âAnother thing to consider when you go to buy a car is that the dealership will pull your credit. Some dealerships pull your credit 10 or 12 different times in order to get you the best rate or payment, and those are hard inquiries. If you come to us after you purchase a car, your credit score could be substantially lower. We also pull your credit during the mortgage process; interest rates are calculated largely based on your credit score. You may end up paying a higher interest rate because buying a car has lowered your credit score.Â What if you pay cash for the vehicle?Â If you pay cash, itâs not going to affect your mortgage loan whatsoever. Weâre not going to see that on the credit report. Just make sure that you have set aside enough funds or assets for the down payment and closing costs for your home. Donât deplete those to pay cash for a new vehicle.Â Is there a difference between buying, leasing, or financing a vehicle?Â There really isnât a difference as far as qualifying for a new home. Weâll look at a monthly lease payment or car payment and calculate that in your debt-to-income ratio.Â Letâs say youâve had a lease for four years and the lease is about to be up. Even if you werenât going to get a new lease, as your mortgage lender, we would still have to count that lease against you. Even if you only have a couple of payments left, you will have to get a new car somehow in order to get back and forth from work. The only way that would work would be if we could prove that you were paying cash for a new car.Â As you can see, it may benefit you to wait until you close on your new home before you start looking for a new car.Â If you have any other questions about what you can and canât do during the mortgage loan process, just give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Today weâre going to be talking about large deposits and why you shouldnât make any large deposits into your bank account, switch banks, or transfer money between accounts during the mortgage loan process.What constitutes a large deposit?Every loan program has their own guidance on what constitutes a large deposit. For example, in a conventional loan, a large deposit would be considered anything over 50% of the monthly qualifying income. For government loan programs, it would be 1% or more of the purchase price.Ultimately, the underwriters have the final say. Even though we have some guidance from the secondary market investors and government agencies about what they expect, underwriters can always question or require explanations for any deposits that seem out of the ordinary in the mortgage loan process.What if you were given a financial gift?Gift funds are always acceptable if theyâre from a first-generation relative and as long as theyâre verified properly. By that, I mean that each loan program will have its own verification requirements. According to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, VA, and USDA, to document the gifts, we have to have a signed gift letter that we provide at application, which states that the funds are gifts and that no repayment is expected. This is signed by the one who gave the gift and yourself. We also need to see the donorâs most recent bank statements with no blackouts or altered account numbers, proving that they have the funds to give.Additionally, the underwriters will look through the donorâs bank statements for any unusually large deposits that might be constituted as suspicious. Itâs their job to look for and report any signs of money laundering. After that, youâll need a copy of the canceled check or the wire confirmation of the donor wiring the funds to your account so that we can see the funds coming from their account and going into yours.âEverything requires a paper trail in the mortgage loan process.âWill switching banks hurt your chances of closing?Switching banks isnât necessarily as bad as having unsourced cash deposits. The important thing about switching banks is being able to demonstrate that the exact same amount of money from your old bank is transferred to your new one.Everything requires a paper trail in the mortgage loan process. There are a lot of bad things that people try to use mortgage transactions for, like terrorism and laundering, so if youâre changing banks, just make sure that youâre saving all your paperwork from the closure of your previous account and the opening of the new one. It might be a good idea to start your new account with a cashierâs check from the old account instead of a cash deposit, just so that we can document and source it.Will an overdrawn checking account hurt your chances of closing?In the mortgage loan process, we are looking for non-sufficient funds and overdrafts, as well as anything that will reflect on your ability to make your mortgage payment timely every month. Explainable overdrafts wonât necessarily be bad, but underwriters will look for numerous overdraft fees. If youâre consistently overdrawing your account, they may question your ability to make that payment.Itâs always best to manage your money and watch your bank account through the loan process. Your full financial history over the last couple years is being assessed, so youâll need to have your best foot forward.If you have any questions about the mortgage loan process or your financial account history, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

However, sometimes they get a little too excited and jump the gun by not paying enough attention to the loan process.

Depending on how large your purchase was, it could really affect your credit score, potentially disqualifying you from being able to close on the home.Does that mean financing is a better option than using a credit card?More or less, those options are the same.

        "content": "There are many moving parts to your mortgage loan application. Today, Iâll answer a few common questions when it comes to your employment status.How will your employment status affect the mortgage loan application?Your employment status can affect your loan application in a couple of different ways. We are looking to see if you have part-time or full-time employment, as part-time has different guidelines. We will also look to see if itâs seasonal employment. You need to prove that you have a regular, steady, stable income that will continue.âAs your lender, we check to make sure that your income is steady, stable, and increasing.âWe do see some families that work in union states. They may have a full-time job but only work 10 months out of the year with two months off in the winter. They spend those two months on unemployment income because that is how their union works. That income would be acceptable as long as we have a two-year history of such employment.Again, we are really looking to see if you have income that is steady, stable, and increasing. We are also looking at the likelihood of its continuance.Is employment verified or claimed on the day of closing or in advance?Employment has to be verified at least 10 days prior to closing. Itâs usually done when we send the file back for our clear to close as soon as the underwriter reviews the loan. If we donât have that verbal verification of employment in the file, they canât push that to the closing department. Â In a perfect world, thatâs done a few days before closing. In a 30-day contract, an average of 21 people touch the loan file from beginning to end, so sometimes the verbal verification of employment is not done until the day before closing or the day of closing. As a client, you need to stay at your job and stay in good standing all throughout the loan process.What if I get promoted or find a higher paying job?If you get promoted within the same company, take the promotion and keep going. We can verify the new terms of employment with HR. As long as we are able to show that the income is steady, stable, and increasing, then we are good to move forward.If you find a higher paying job, there are a couple of different things to consider.Employment contracts often have contingencies, such as drug screenings or background checks. You usually donât get an offer letter and then start the next day. Most of the time, the hiring process takes at least a couple of weeks.Once those contingencies are met, we do require 30 days of pay stubs in order to close. If it takes two weeks to start the job and then you need 30 days of pay stubs, that can delay closing. If the pay period is biweekly, you might not get your first paycheck for a month, which could delay things further. Starting a job at a new company could potentially delay your closing for 45 to 60 days.Different loan programs, such as FHAs, will have their own guidelines. Unfortunately, one of my clients and I are dealing with this right now.My client is a cancer survivor. Two years ago, she had a gap of employment for six months while she got her chemo and radiation treatment. Since then, she has been employed for 19 months. She spent 13 months at one job and switched employment to another job. FHA requires that if you have a gap in employment over the last two years, then you have to be at your current job for six months.We have to adhere to those guidelines, so her closing has been delayed. Iâm happy to say that she will be closing in a couple of weeks now, so we did make it through.Can I leave my job after the closing?As lenders, we always want to make sure that your loan can perform. We never want to put you into a home that you may not be able to afford.Now, we wonât verify employmfent after closing. Once we close, itâs your life. No one can predict the future. You can change jobs or quit, but I advise that you proceed with caution. Make sure that you are making the right decision. After all, when you buy a home, you are making a 15-, 20-, or 30-year investment, so make sure that you set yourself up for success.As you can see, your employment status plays a major role in the mortgage loan application process. If you have any questions, please donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

Credit cards have different limits, but whatever the limit is, the rule of thumb is to keep your balances below 30%. If your debt is any higher, it will affect your debt-to-income ratio, which will affect your credit score and your monthly payment.âKeep your credit balance under 30%âEven if you have a 0% interest card, itâs important to keep the total balance of all your credit cards under 30%. If you have multiple cards and are considering consolidating them into one, I would discuss it with a loan officer in advance of qualification.If you want to use part of your loan approval to pay off debt on a card, we can do whatâs called a credit supplement. We have a partner that can call the creditor with the data to verify that the payment has been made and the resulting balance is $0.Your loan approval is based on the picture of your credit at the time of qualification. Keep in mind that if you make any credit purchases or open any new cards after qualification, itâs vitally important to keep your loan officer in the loop. Some lenders do a soft credit score pull prior to closing as a final check on your eligibility. Taking on new debt so soon after qualifying could put your entire mortgage in jeopardy.If you have any questions about credit in the mortgage qualifying process or anything else about mortgage loans, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "From an underwriting perspective, cosigning for a loan in the mortgage process is a bad idea. It can not only affect your credit score, but it can also hurt your purchasing power as a homebuyer.Say youâre cosigning for a car loan for a $6,000 car that has a $150 payment. To get the car loan, your credit has to be pulled, and that can affect your credit score. That $150 payment also has to be counted against you in your debt-to-income ratio, which can impact what you can qualify for.Even if the other cosigner will be making that payment, there is no way that payment can be excluded until theyâve consistently and consecutively made 12 monthsâ worth of payments to the lien holder. Youâre stuck with that payment for at least 12 months.Additionally, if that person misses one of their payments or theyâre 30 days late on one of them, that would also show up on your credit report and potentially affect your qualification status. There are some loan programs out there that donât allow you to have any 30-day late payments in the last 12 months.From a mortgage standpoint, there really is no difference between a cosigner and a co-borrower. Lenders look at whatâs on your credit report, and it doesnât matter whether you cosigned or co-borrowedâthe account will more than likely show up on your credit report, and theyâll see the payment.âItâs not a good idea to cosign for anybody, especially if youâre thinking about buying a home.âThe total amount of the cosigned loan doesnât detract from your mortgage eligibility because itâs the monthly payment that lenders calculate into your debt-to-income ratio. It doesnât matter if itâs a $10,000 loan or a $200,000 loan; itâs the monthly payment that we care about. Keep in mind that every $50 in a monthly payment equals $10,000 in a purchase price.If you have any more questions about this or any topic related to the mortgage loan process, donât hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email.

        "content": "Should you clean out your savings to purchase a home?Actually, this is one of the biggest mistakes people can make. Putting too much money down on the transaction is unnecessary and can dramatically deplete your reserves. Having these extra funds is very important since you never know what unforeseen expenses might arise after closing.âPutting too much money down on the transaction is unnecessary and can dramatically deplete your reserves.âPersonally, I recommend having two to six months of reserves ready at all times in the event that something unexpected occurs.It is possible to have this kind of money ready even after your home purchase. There are down payment assistance programs that allow you to put 3.5% or even 0% down on a property. Something most people donât realize is that every $10,000 you put down on a home only saves you $50 per month.The true way to save money in the mortgage process is by making one extra payment per year, which will ultimately cut seven to eight years off the lifespan of your mortgage. So, how much should you really spend on a down payment? This is actually something you should discuss more fully with your loan officer. However, if you do qualify for the USDA loan I definitely recommend this option.The USDA loan requires no down payment, has the lowest interest rates, the lowest mortgage insurance, and therefore has the lowest monthly payment. Not everyone qualifies for this specific option, but there are many other routes out there.Another thing I advise against is frivolously spending money in savings prior to closing. Even if you donât plan to spend all of it on closing, you should be careful about touching the money in the savings account youâve set aside for your mortgage and closing costs.Having a good idea of what your closing costs will be is also important. Once youâre under contract, your initial loan disclosure will be sent out within three days. There will also be an estimated cash-to-close worksheet that I like to call your âmortgage bible.â This worksheet will detail all expenses that will be associated with closing and with your mortgage.You will also need to pay your first year of insurance up front. Also, this disclosure package will have a loan estimate. This will discuss all of the terms of the loan.So what happens if you do come up short at the closing table? Well, gifts are always acceptable. In the event that this happens, you may consider having a family member help out. You can also pull from certain investment accounts. From the lending side, we could also adjust the interest rate and give you a credit to offset the difference.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Today weâll answer both of these questions.Check out the next Agent MastermindApply OnlineIn the final installment of our series where we answer agentsâ questions, today weâre fielding a two-parter from Allison Wheatley of First Realty.First, she asks, âSomeone said that the FHA loan limit in Lake County is $274,850; however, one of my buyers has a loan amount of $285,000. How does that work?âSecondly, she asks, âCan the seller hold a small note for an FHA, like a second mortgage?âTo answer her first question, the FHA does set loan limits per county, and theyâll change based on what county you live in. The FHA loan limit in Lake County is $274,850, but thatâs not the purchase price limit. People can purchase homes for however much they want, but the FHA has stated that they will not lend any more than the $274,850 limit in that county.âFHA LOAN LIMITS CHANGE BASED ON WHAT COUNTY YOU LIVE IN.âFor example, if somebody wants to buy a house that costs $300,000, thatâs perfectly OK; however, theyâre going to have to put down the extra $25,150 to bring the base loan amount down to the FHA loan limit in our county.To answer her second question, the FHA doesnât allow interested party contributions such as seller-held second mortgages into the transaction. The only thing the sellers can do, per FHA guidelines, is help pay up to 6% in closing costs into the transaction.If you or your buyers have any other questions in regard to FHA loans or their requirements, please donât hesitate to give us a call.

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "FHA 203K loans and conventional renovation loans actually have a lot in common. You should, however, know the two main differences if youâre considering a loan with rehab costs built in.Check out the next Agent MastermindApply OnlineWe had another question from an agent that we wanted to address today. The question was, âWhen dealing with a repair loan, I have made it through an FHA 203K; however, is there a conventional product as well, and what are some of the differences?âThis is a great question. Yes, conventional does have a repair loan like FHAâs 203K, and itâs called the Fannie Mae HomeStyle Renovation loan. One of the biggest differences between a 203K loan and a conventional renovation loan is the same difference between an FHA loan and a conventional loan. With FHA, the private mortgage insurance lasts for the life of the loan, no matter what your down payment is, as opposed to a conventional loan, where PMI will drop off when your loan balance reaches 78% of the purchase price. This is just one of the benefits of a conventional loan over an FHA loan.Additionally, FHA 203K loans only let you make repairs to the property itself; you couldnât add a pool or a fence since the repairs must be within the structure of the home. Conventional home renovation loans allow you to do pretty much whatever you want with the property, so you could install a pool or fence or update the landscaping.âOTHER THAN TWO BIG DIFFERENCES, BOTH LOANS BASICALLY PARALLEL EACH OTHER.âOther than these main differences, both loan types basically parallel each other in terms of their guidelines. Both loan programs will lend on the total price of the project, meaning the price of the home itself and the cost of the repairs.With these two loan packages, some people get confused about the involvement of an HUD consultant. With the FHA 203K loan, an HUD consultant will only be required when the total cost of the rehab exceeds $35,000. This actually parallels the Fannie Mae HomeStyle Renovation loan in that if the total cost of the rehab project is more than $35,000, we are going to require an HUD consultant to oversee the project along with the general contractor making the repairs.Now, this is just a general breakdown of Fannie Mae HomeStyle Renovation loans in a nutshell. Feel free to share this information with your clients or anyone you know who is interested in a home renovation loan! A lot of different factors come into play with this type of loan, so if you have any questions at all about them, give me a call or send me an email. I would be more than happy to help you out.",

        "title": "How Do You Qualify for a USDA Loan?",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Qualifying for a USDA loan is different than qualifying for other loan packages since itâs 100% financing. These are the basic requirements youâll need to meet to qualify for this loan.Check out the next Agent MastermindApply OnlineI recently had a Realtor ask for some clarification on USDA guidelines and how buyers can obtain approval for a USDA mortgage.There are three basic requirements for a USDA mortgage:1. The buyer has to buy in a USDA eligible area. Fortunately, Lake County and all surrounding counties are eligible.2. They have to meet household income requirements. Itâs not just the buyerâs income, itâs the householdâs income. If the buyer has children older than 18 living in the home, their income is considered, too, as well as a spouse thatâs not included on the loan. An easy example is that a family of one to four canât make more than $75,850 in our county, and a family of more than four canât make more than $98,000. Things can be deducted from this income, though, like child care or disability expenses for older adults.3. At Success Mortgage Partners, we require a credit score of at least 620. Since itâs on the lower end, itâs not crazy for people to qualify for, but we do need them to meet that benchmark. USDA allows financing for those with no credit score, but that doesnât mean a bad credit score. Some people have simply never used credit, and thatâs OK. You can do this by confirming things like rent and insurance payments. USDA looks over the last 12 months. If you have a 620 credit score but still have some derogatory credit like collections or late payments popping up, it can disqualify you.USDA is also very strict on their debt-to-income requirements. Since it is a 100% financing loan, they want to make sure the buyer can afford the payments, so they are more strict than some other loan programs. They will only allow us to use 29% of their income for their housing expenses and 41% total income for all of their other expenses. This helps prevent buyers from becoming house rich and dirt poor.The other potential deal killer for a USDA loan is if you own another house. With a USDA loan, you canât have two mortgages. However, there are some exceptions to the rule, like relocation from out of state that leaves you unable to sell your other house prior to your move, in some cases.Other than that, a USDA loan is just a conventional loan with FHA appraisal requirements; there canât be health or safety concerns with the home as far as the appraisal is concerned.If you have any more questions about USDA loans or the guidelines surrounding them, please donât hesitate to call or email me.

We are going to talk about a few of them today.Check out the next Agent MastermindApply OnlineWeâve been getting some great questions from our viewers about mortgages lately, and we wanted to answer one of them today. This one comes from Ron who asks, âWhich programs are out there for first-time home buyers?âThe first thing we should mention is that all of the loan programs weâve previously talked about, including VA, USDA, FHA, and conventional loans can all be used by first-time buyers. However, there are some additional programs out there that you can combine with your loan if youâre a first-time buyer.What we like to do with our first-time buyers is pair our USDA 100% financing loan with the MCC tax credit program, which is for first-time buyers as well as buyers who havenât owned a home in three years or longer.The MCC tax credit program provides those buyers with up to 50% of their mortgage interest paid on their tax return each year they live in and own the house as a primary residence. The value of this credit can be up to $2,000, which could equate to a few mortgage payments that will be covered just by agreeing to own a home.âTHIS PROGRAM HELPS SWING THE PENDULUM IN FAVOR OF FIRST-TIME BUYERS.âOne reason this tool is beneficial to our buyers is because, from an underwriting standpoint, it allows us to use the credit as income to offset your debt-to-income ratio. Salaries arenât increasing at the same rate as home prices are, so a lot of our buyers are being priced out of the market. This program helps swing the pendulum in favor of first-time buyers.I hope this answers your question, Ron. If you have any other questions, donât hesitate to reach out to us via phone or email.

This is done for a few different reasons.The first is that this is how we mortgage bankers make money in our industry. We sell your loan with hundreds of other loans that month. Thatâs how we get paid, but the benefit for you as the buyer, the borrower, is that you get access to the bigger banks and their interest rates. The second reason is that it allows us to keep our fees very low compared to our competition because weâre not having to charge origination fees or discount points to make money on your loan.âAFTER YOUR LOAN CLOSES, IT GETS SOLD ON THE SECONDARY MARKET.âDoes this change my payment or loan in any way? When your loan gets sold on the secondary market, the only thing that changes is where you make the payment to. Your interest rate, the loan balance, and the term of your loan has to stay exactly the same.Do you sell my loan to a bank of my choosing? Unfortunately, no. When we sell the loan on a secondary market, we have a group of investors that we at Success Mortgage Partners sell to. It may end up with your financial institution, but that institution may be one weâre either not approved to sell to or not actually involved in mortgage loan servicing, to begin with. From a lending standpoint, it depends on who we can package your loan with and who we can make the most money with.We understand that the post-closing process can sometimes be a little confusing, so if you ever have any questions about it, donât hesitate to reach out.

Letâs walk through whatâs going to happen on closing day step-by-step.On your way to the closing table, you will wire your funds to the title company. Once you get to the title company, thatâs where you will re-sign everything that you have previously signed. You may have done e-signatures all the way through, but we need your physical signature on every single document. Bring an ice pack for your hand if need be.You should also bring two forms of identification with you. One should be your driverâs license, and the other can be something that verifies your name or identity, like a social security card. The closing agent is going to review all the paperwork with you as you sign it. Once you are done signing the documents, they are going to take a few select documents and send them back to our closing department to get funding authorization. We as the lender will then have to review those documents before we release the money to the seller.âYOU HAVE ACHIEVED THE DREAM OF HOMEOWNERSHIP.âIf youâve been issued funding authorization and the buyer and seller documents are all signed, you can leave the closing table and go directly to your new house to celebrate.
