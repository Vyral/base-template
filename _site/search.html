        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "A question about the viability of purchasing a starter home in todayâs market was recently posed to us, and it boils down to this:Â Should you invest now in a starter home or would it be more prudent to wait and save for your forever home?Letâs first make sure weâre talking about the same thingâamong economists, the prevailing definition of a starter home is one that falls within the lower-third of the marketâs valuation, unlike, say, trade-up or luxury homes.Â Homebuyers themselves may define a starter home a little differently, though; rather than a starter homeâs defining characteristic being price, the question thatâs front and center for buyers relates to time. Therefore, to a buyer, a starter home is one that they may only live in for a few years.Â This is where the dilemma really lies. If you choose to purchase a starter home, the bulk of your payments in the first few years of ownership will go toward interest, which hampers your ability to build any equity in the home.Â âThe best time to buy is imminently approaching.âIn fact, some estimates indicate that the break-even point for starter homeownership is somewhere around five to seven years. To put it simply, if you plan to live in the home for a short period of time, it might not make sense to buy at all. Â To be perfectly clear: We arenât necessarily telling you not to buy a starter home. In some cases, going this route may be squarely within a buyerâs interests. Staying in a home for more than five years, for example, will allow you to build savings that might otherwise go to rent and also build equity over time.Â You might also find that, with the right renovations and care, your starter home could blossom into your forever home. Alternatively, you could keep the home and rent it out at a later time if your plans change.Â Ultimately, this decision should be based on decisions and preferences specific to your situation. Letâs say, after careful consideration, youâve decided a starter home is right for you. If thatâs the case, take note: The best time to buy is imminently approaching. Why? Per Trulia, starter home inventory sharply increases and listing prices drop in fall and winter, which translates to maximal choices at less cost to you.

        "content": "Interest rates are on an upward trajectory, but not everyone can take advantage of the low rates we have now.Iâm joined today by Mandi Henriod of Intercap Lending, who shared with us a great way buyers can lock in current interest rates. Letâs say rates are 5.25% now and you know you want to buy a home within the next year, but by then, the rate will likely increase to 6.25%. Intercap Lendingâs new program can help.Their clients can now lock in a rate for up to 120 days while shopping for a home. Most lenders wonât lock in a rate without having a purchase contract, but thatâs not the case with this program. Intercap Lending will be able to lock it in with no up-front fees, and they can even lock the rate on a specific property for up to 360 days (with a fee). This is a great option if you have a home under construction.âMost lenders wonât lock in a rate without having a purchase contract, but thatâs not the case with this program.âUnlike any other option weâve seen, the up-front fee is refundable at the time of funding. All of their rate-lock options allow for renegotiation if rates somehow decrease. Theyâre able to offer this on all agency loan programs, including FHA, VA, and conforming loans.If youâre looking to make a move within the year, contact Mandi at Intercap Lending so you can lock in a low rate today. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

Today weâll be talking about how co-borrowers works in real estate.Weâve seen home values increase by over 30% in the last five years, and combined with recent interest rate hikes, affordability has been affectedâespecially for first-time homebuyers.As a result, weâre seeing more and more people purchase properties together. It makes sense: Rather than waiting to afford something on their own, theyâre compounding their homeownership efforts.Co-borrowers are creating long-term partnerships of five to 10 years, even creating LLCs to spell out the terms. Others have taken title as tenants in common instead of through common joint tenancy.âWeâre seeing more and more people purchase properties together.âTenancy in common imposes joint liability and several liability of tenants, meaning each owner can be liable for property taxes and deductions equal to the amount they paid. Simply put, tenancy in common allows several people to share their interest in real property while retaining the freedoms that would be restricted through joint tenancy.If youâd like to buy real estate but are unable to on your own, and you have a friend or family member whoâs in the same boat, consider a partnership. Whether you want to have a home to live in or a property to invest in, you can compound your purchasing power together.Keep in mind that when youâre purchasing as a partnership, both credit scores will be used. The lowest score will determine the financing ability and interest rate.If you have any topics youâd like us to cover in the future, have any questions, or need further information, feel free to reach out to us.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Whatâs the latest news from our Wasatch Front market as we move further along into 2019?To answer that question, letâs first compare the statistics from the fourth quarter of 2018 with 2017âs fourth quarter. Home sales dropped 7% from just over 9,600 to 8,994. The average sale price, meanwhile, increased 8% to $350,000. For new construction homes, the average asking price rose a little over 8%. The average days on market for all housing types decreased 5% from 43 to 41 days.With interest rates rising almost a full percentage point during that time and an exceptionally low number of starter homes available, first-time buyers are being squeezed pretty tightly right now.Â Currently, we have a tale of two markets. Our supply of inventory for all home types is at 5.3 months, and because a six-month supply is considered a level market, weâre close enough to that mark to be considered a level market too. However, for homes priced under $350,000, thereâs just a 3.9-month supply, which is a strong sellerâs market. For homes priced over $500,000, we have a 10-month supply, which is a strong buyerâs market. In other words, the higher you go in price, the more we become a buyerâs market.Â Our market can also be described as more of a trickle-up market, meaning first-time buyers dictate the rest of the marketâs movement. When a first-time buyer buys a home, that seller is able to move up into the next price range. In that sense, we can see how a lack of supply impacts the higher price ranges.âSlightly slower economic and demographic growth along with higher prices and interest rates will dampen demand.âWhat about the year-over-year numbers from 2018 as a whole?The number of total home sales stayed relatively flat compared to 2017. The average home price increased 9% to nearly $340,000, while the median price rose 10% to $300,000. The average market price decreased 5%. Like our fourth quarter snapshot, home prices continued to rise while affordability decreased. That being said, the supply of inventory increased from 3.19 months to 4.06 months.Whatâs in store for 2019? Slightly slower economic and demographic growth along with higher prices and interest rates will dampen demand, which will mean fewer single-family home sales but more condo and townhome sales as more buyers seek affordable housing.Overall, prices are expected to rise between 5% and 7%. Single-family home sales are expected to decline 8%, while condo sales are expected to increase 7%. When you combine the two, we expect the total number of sales to drop 4%. With fewer expected sales but higher sale prices, itâs still a great time to sell your home.As we finished the fourth quarter of 2018, the Federal Reserve was expected to increase interest rates four times this year, and there was some speculation that we could see rates rise as high as 6%. Those expectations have been tempered a bit, and weâre now expecting just one adjustment this year. If youâve been holding off on buying a home due to high interest rates, it might be time to get off the fence and make a move.If youâre thinking of buying or selling a home or you have any more questions about our Wasatch Front market, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

        "content": "A quick note before we begin todayâs topic: Weâre not tax professionals here at the Stern Team, so please be sure to meet with a qualified CPA for more details. If you donât know one, weâre happy to refer one whom we trust completely to you.Every four years, some candidate for higher political office tries to focus our attention on equalizing the tax laws and repealing the homeowner benefits, but these arguments have consistently fallen on deaf ears. Thankfully, our own local political action committee has successfully fought off and worked diligently to ensure that our legislators donât tack on the insidious transfer fee, which gets charged to the seller or buyer at closing.For those of us who own homes, hereâs a list of the itemized tax deductions available to the average homeowner. Every year, youâre permitted to deduct the following expenses:1. Taxes.Â Real property taxes, both state and local, can be deducted. The one exception is that tax filers can deduct on Schedule A any combination of state and local property taxes, as well as income or sales taxes, but only up to a total of $10,000. Interestingly, married couples who file their own separate tax returns can only deduct up to $5,000. However, it should be noted that real estate taxes are only deductible in the year that theyâre paid to the government. Thus, if in the year 2018, your lender held money in escrow for taxes due in 2019, you canât take a deduction for these taxes when you file your 2018 tax return.Mortgage lenders are required to send an annual statement to borrowers by the end of January each and every year that reflects the amount of mortgage interest in real estate taxes that the homeowners actually paid during the previous year.2. Mortgage and interest. Interest on mortgage loans on a first or second home is fully deductible, subject to the following limitations:Acquisition loansâup to $1,000,000Home equity loansâup to $100,000If you are married but file these separately, these limits are split in half. Note that for the new loans taken out after December 14, 2017, the limit on the deductible mortgage debt is reduced to $750,000. Loans in existence prior to that date are grandfathered in.You must understand the concept of the acquisition loan: To qualify for such a loan, you must buy, construct, or substantially improve your home. If you refinance for more than the outstanding indebtedness, the excess amount does not qualify as an acquisition loan unless you use all of the excess to improve your home. However, any other excess may qualify as a home equity loan; if you pull out a home equity loan, you actually have to use that money to improve your house.3. Points. Because mortgage rates are still considerably low, not too many borrowers right now are paying points. But with interest rates on the rise, this is something to attend to. When you obtain a mortgage loan in order to get a lower-rate mortgage, you would pay one or more points up front. Whether referred to as loan origination fees, premium charges, or discounts, theyâre still points. Each point is essentially 1% of the amount thatâs being borrowed. If you obtain a loan of $170,000, each point will cost you $1,700 and the interest rate on your loan will then be lowered. The IRS has also ruled that even if points are paid by sellers, theyâre still deductible by the homebuyer. Points paid to the lender when you refinance your current mortgage are not fully deductible in the year that theyâre paid; you have to allocate the amount over the entire life of the loan.For example, if you paid 1,700 points for a 30-year loan, each year youâre permitted to deduct only $56.66. However, when you pay off this new loan, any remaining portion of the points that you have not deducted are then deductible in full.âIt should be noted that real estate taxes are only deductible in the year that theyâre paid to the government.âNeedless to say, if you have any questions about these tax benefits, discuss them with your financial and legal advisors. We hope that this topic has been useful for you, and if you have any real estate questions, donât hesitate to reach out to us. We are happy to help you.",

        "content": "Thereâs a misconception among many sellers out there that any commission they pay to their Realtor will be reduced if theyâre able to secure a buyer on their own.Â At the heart of the real estate transaction, the goal is to obviously find a buyer to sell the property to, but thereâs much more that goes into finalizing the process. In the event that you find your own buyer, itâs oftentimes spelled out in your contract that you, nevertheless, remain beholden to pay a specific amount to your agent.Â With this in mind, you can request a flexible commission plan. If you make a point of requesting this up front, your agent may be agreeable to establishing this type of plan with you. Should you find your own buyer, this will allow for the possibility of adjustable commission.But what is the true value you extract from your agentâs efforts?Â Contrary to what you might think, finding a buyer is a relatively small piece of the process for your agent. Once youâve accepted the buyerâs bid, your agent has the responsibility of doing paperwork with all other parties involvedâthe buyerâs agent, legal representation, and even title companies.âContrary to what you might think, finding a buyer is a relatively small piece of the process for your agent.âBefore signing an agreement with an agent, take the opportunity to discuss services and commission. If you have a pre-established idea of what youâre willing to pay and itâs somewhat lower, understand that this means the scope of services your agent provides might be narrower. As the old adage goes: You get what you pay for.Â From there, your agreement should detail what youâll pay, whether or not you can cooperate with other agents, your agentâs responsibilities, the length of the contract, and whether or not you can cancel.

        "content": "Home affordability is shrinking rapidly, according to research by Arch Mortgage Insurance.Â In the first quarter, affordability (defined as the size of the monthly mortgage payment needed to buy a home) dropped by 5%. This was mainly due to the increase in mortgage rates. As a consequence, more people are now stretched and taking on greater debt relative to their income. Other buyers are being pushed out of the market altogether.Â âThereâs no need to panic if youâre a homebuyer.âAnd thatâs not all: Affordability is expected to drop an additional 15% to 20% by the end of the year. Thatâs because home prices continue to rise, and the Federal Reserve is expected to ratchet up its reference interest rate, which often leads mortgage rates, two more times this year.What does this mean for you?If youâre looking to sell, you wonât have a hard time finding a buyer. Even with decreasing affordability, demand for homes still far outstrips supply. However, itâs certain that buyers will look to take advantage of current conditions before affordability drops further. That means that this spring and summer might see an additional rush in the real estate market. It also means that right now might be a very good time to list your home if youâve been thinking about selling for a while.On the other hand, if you are thinking of buying a home, you might think that this news spells doom for you. However, thereâs no need to panic. While affordability is dropping, it is still well above historical averages (just like current mortgage rates). In fact, Arch Mortgage Insurance estimates that homes are now 15% to 20% more affordable than they were in the period from 1987 to 2004. When rates go up, it will affect what your monthly payments will be on a new home. From this perspective, it makes sense to move now in case youâve been looking to buy before rates rise further.Â So whatâs the next step?If youâre thinking about buying or selling a home, give us a call.

        "content": "For todayâs topic, weâre going to discuss the benefits of buying or selling in the winter. Contrary to what you might think, the passing of the summer season doesnât necessarily equate to stagnation in the market now. Â There are great tax advantages to buying or selling late in the year. Buyers who close escrow before yearâs end will enjoy tax write-offs that they otherwise wouldnât receive in the new year. This can result in highly significant savings for you when tax season rolls around.Â Itâs not just buyers that reap the benefits of end-of-year movesâclosing costs and home improvements are also tax deductible.Â Youâll have greater availability to services. Buying in the winter can also open up greater access to resources, such as moving services, that the influx of buyers and sellers in the spring and summertime makes hard to find.Â âDue to a higher scarcity of buyers and sellers in the fall and winter months, closing at a realistic asking price can be most easily accomplished during this window.âThe âoff-seasonâ is anything but. Due to a higher scarcity of buyers and sellers in the winter months, closing at a realistic asking price can be most easily accomplished during this window. Coming up with a good pricing strategy is sure to make your home shine brightly over the competition.Â Buyers will likely see an upsurge in the chances that theyâll get that home thatâs within their budget, since bidding wars and homes selling above asking price are less of a factor this time of year. Competition may drop in the fall since people often consider it to be the âoff-season,â but this is far from the case for a serious buyerâthere seldom is a drop-off in inventory in the winter seasons.Â Less competition and stable inventory are highly attractive to buyers. This is mutually beneficial to both buyers and sellers because it means that a sellerâs agent wonât have to wade through non-serious offer after non-serious offer.Â Lastly, if you need to make some last-minute home improvements before itâs time to sell, contractors and subcontractors tend to be more available and more affordable with the slowing down of business that the winter brings.Â As always, please give us a call or email us with any other real estate-related needs or questions.

        "content": "Unfortunately, real estate deals donât always make it all the way through closing. There are a number of reasons they can fall apart, and today weâd like to share five such reasons:1. The buyer and/or seller encountered pre-contract problems. This includes issues like a lowball offer, an extensive list of repairs, or an appraisal problem.2. The buyer and/or seller encountered post-contract problems. Whether a buyer gets cold feet, the buyer and seller canât agree on how to handle repairs, or a problem with financing arises, there are several different things that can kill a deal once the buyer and seller are under contract.3. A contingent buyer failed to sell their current home. One of the most common reasons a real estate deal falls through is that buyers who need to sell their current property before buying their next may be unable to do so.âWhether for one of these reasons or as a result of something else, about one in four real estate contracts will fail.â4. The buyer was denied financing. In a perfect world, every buyer out there would be going about their search with a pre-approval letter in hand, but this isnât always the case. Financial issues on the part of the buyer are a major reason deals can fall apart.5. There were issues with the pre-settlement walkthrough. Even once the closing table is in sight, last-minute problems can pop up and sink an entire deal. Liens, a previously unnoticed safety issue like mold, or an unforeseen financial hardship could all pose a threat.Whether for one of these reasons or as a result of something else, about one in four real estate contracts will fail.

        "content": "It can be a scary world out thereâthough a majority of people are good and honest, some like to try taking advantage of others. The real estate market is no exception, so today weâll be looking at the scams we want to make sure youâre aware of:1. Mortgage closing scam. This scam has become so prevalent that the FBI estimates itâs led to over $1 billion in stolen/diverted funds in 2017 alone. It begins when a hacker gains access to a real estate agentâs email account. When itâs time to close a deal, the hacker poses as the agent and sends money-wiring instructions to the homebuyer. The truth only comes out after the buyer has already lost thousands. Never wire money without confirming the account with your title company and/or your agent.2. Fake real estate agents. Similarly to the previous scam, the scammer will impersonate someone who is legitimately involved with a deal. The hacker will often pretend to be a real estate lawyer who is associated with a sale and, at the time of closing, call or email the homebuyer with changes to the money-wiring destination. If this works, the buyer loses a lot of money. In Utah, wire fraud is happening on housing every other day.3. Bait and switch. Unlike the first two, this scam targets sellers. It also doesnât require any hacking or impersonation; it just needs a dishonest buyer. Hereâs how it works: A buyer makes an offer above selling price and the seller happily agrees. The contract is signed, but then the buyer begins procrastinating and dragging out the process for weeks and months. In the meantime, the seller is becoming worn out emotionally in continuing to pay costs for the home. Finally, the buyer says they can only buy at a lower price and the desperate seller agrees.âWe are proud of our guaranteed sale program.âHow can we protect ourselves from these and similar scams? Donât send account information over email, confirm everything over a valid phone number or in person, and find an agent who you trust to represent your best interests.If youâre ever in need of an agent you can put your faith in, our doors are always open.

        "title": "9 Reasons Our Real Estate Market Is Not Headed for Another Crash",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Despite some concern, a market crash isnât imminent, and there are nine reasons why.1. There are many differences between the market of 2005 and the market of today. In 2005, for example, subprime loans totaled more than $620 billion and comprised about 20% of the mortgage market. In 2015, they totaled only $56 million and comprised just 5% of the mortgage market.2. Banks have raised lending standards. According to CoreLogicâs Housing Credit Index, loans originated in 2016 were among the highest quality of the past 15 years. In October 2009, the average FICO score was 686. In 2001, the average score was between 490 and 510.3. Tighter lending standards have made a difference in the flip market. Lenders now only finance 55% of the homeâs valueâthe flipper has to come up with the rest. During the subprime crisis, banks lent 80% or more.4. Nationally, the number of homes sold today is 20% below the pre-crash peak. Thereâs only a four-month supply of inventory, and as a result, about 64% of Americans own their homes, compared to 68% who owned their homes in 2007.5. Home sales are lower because the recession interfered with a lot of peopleâs ability to start a career and buy a home. Faced with a poor job market, many decided to further their education. As a result, theyâre now burdened with school loans, which makes it less likely that they can save enough money to buy a home. This will keep demand down.âLoans originated in 2016 were among the highest quality of the past 15 years.â6. Home prices have outpaced income. The average income-to-housing cost ratio is 30%. In some metro areas, it has skyrocketed to 40% to 50%. Unfortunately, metro areas are also where the jobs are, and this forces young people to pay more for rent and be closer to a job that doesnât pay enough to buy a house. 32% of home sales today are going to first-time homebuyers. Historically, that number has been closer to 40%, according to the National Association of Realtors. Typically, this buyer is 32 years old, earns $72,000 per year, and pays $182,500 for a home. A two-income couple pays, on average, $208,500 for a home.7. Homeowners arenât taking as much equity out of their homes. Home equity rose to $85 billion in 2006 and then collapsed to less than $10 billion in 2010. It remained at that level until about 2015, and by 2017 it only rose to about $14 billion. Obamacare is one reason for thatâ bankruptcy filings have fallen 50% since the ACA was passed in 2010.8. When adjusted for inflation, housing prices are only at a similar level to where they were in 2004. From 2012 to 2017, prices rose 6.5% a year on average. From 2002 to 2006, they rose 7.5% per year (in 2005, they skyrocketed 16%).9. Home builders focus on high-end homes. New homes are large and more expensiveâthe average size of a new single-family home is almost 2,700 square feet. In 2006, the average size of a new single-family home was 2,500 square feet.If you have any more questions about our market or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home, donât hesitate to get in touch with us.

These numbers are through October 4 of 2018 and weâll be comparing them to the numbers that we saw through October 5 of 2017.As for home sales, theyâre relatively stable and unchanged from last year. Nearly 28,000 single-family homes, townhomes, and condos have sold along the Wasatch Front so far this year.Our average sale price through three quarters of 2018 is $341,173 with the median price being $303,000. Last year, our average price was $309, 657 with a median price of $272, 761. This means that our average price and median price have both increased by nearly 10% in just this past year.Interest rates are up about 1% year over year for 30-year mortgages. Theyâve gone from just over 3% to about 4.62% year over year. As of October 4, weâve seen five consecutive weeks of rate increases on 30-year mortgages. Additionally, weâve seen the Fed increase their rate three times this year with a fourth on the horizon. Most experts predict them to raise rates an additional three times in 2019 and once more in 2020. I think of this as more of a normalization of interest rates than a spike. If you go back to 1990, our average interest rate is around 6.6%. Donât be surprised if we get close to that number by the second or third quarter of 2019.Â âPrices are up about 10% and the supply of homes remains tight.âThe average days on market along the Wasatch Front is 38 days, only 5% less from the same time last year at 36 days. Our overall inventory is currently sitting at 3.95 months of supply. This is a relatively low level of inventory. However, our inventory has gone up by 16% from the second quarter of this year.As weâre seeing more and more price decreases among listing inventory with interest rates hitting a seven-year high, weâve seen affordability drop, leading to more existing inventory and adjustments in price. In fact, nationally, more than 25% of all homes listed on the market experienced a price drop in the month of September. In areas of the country that have seen significant price growth in recent years like Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Portland, weâre seeing these rising interest rates put a halt on demand. These are areas with three or fewer monthsâ worth of supply and unemployment rates below 4%.The general narrative here is that prices are up by about 10% on the Wasatch Front, while the supply of homes remains tight, especially in the entry-level price range. At the same time, supply levels above that price range are beginning to increase and loosen some of the pressure on pricing.If you have any real estate-related questions or needs that we can assist you with, donât hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "Our goal is to keep you educated about all things real estate so that you have the ability to make great decisions when it comes to your own home buying, selling, or investing goals. Todayâs topic is why fall is a great time to sell a property.Sometimes it pays to go against the crowd. The real estate market is definitely at a peak during the spring and summer, but going against this trend and listing your home in the fall can have some great benefits:1. Buyers are more serious. During the spring and summer, many buyers are more curious than actually committed to purchasing a property. On the other hand, buyers in the fall tend to be more serious. Many have been searching throughout the summer and have not found their perfect home yet. Other fall buyers are simply forced to look for a new home because of a new job, a work relocation, or because they want to complete their move ahead of the holidays. In other words, fall buyers make up in dedication for what they might lack in numbers.âThe fall is a great time to make a move up.â2. Thereâs less competition. Itâs no secret that most homes are listed in the spring and summer. However, homes that are not sold by the end of the summer are often delisted or simply overpriced for their condition. Otherwise, they start to draw less interest because of the time they have spent on the market. If you list in the fall, you have the benefit of standing out, as well as facing less competition than during the âhotterâ seasons.3. Itâs easier to move up. If youâre looking to buy a new home and also sell your current one, then the fall market may offer the best opportunity to do so. You will enter the market with confidence and without stress, while many sellers who have been unsuccessful in selling their homes during the summer will be more eager to sell during this time. This can lead to very flexible negotiations that will work in your favor.If you have any questions about why the fall is such an opportune time for you to sell or about the home selling process in general, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "title": "Key Facts About Home Inspections",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "To understand how a home inspection benefits you as a buyer, you need to first understand what a home inspector does and whatâs all included in a home inspection.Â First, although you can choose your own home inspector here in Utah, they arenât actually required to be licensed in our state, so make sure your Realtor can recommend an inspector whoâs held to a high standard or is a member of the National Association of Home Inspectors (NAHI).Â Second, home inspections are intended to point out adverse conditionsânot cosmetic flaws. You should attend the inspection and follow the inspector throughout the process so you can learn whatâs important and whatâs not. No house is perfect, and an inspection is bound to uncover some faults. An inspector will point out conditions that need to be repaired or any other safety-related items. They wonât comment on any cosmetic items if they donât impair the integrity of the property. The also wonât conduct any destructive testing.Â Third, home inspection reports include only the basics. A home inspector considers hundreds of items during an inspection. Their report should cover all of the homeâs exterior and interior features and comment on the working order of things like the faucets and the garage door opener. They may also point out termite damage and suggest that you get a separate pest inspection. The final written report should be concise and easy for you to understand.Â âA home inspection gives you the information you need to make a sound buying decision.âFourth, home inspectors work for the party whoâs paying the fee, which is you. The NAHI Standards of Practice and Code of Ethics states that their members act as an unbiased third party to the real estate transaction and will discharge their duties with fidelity and integrity to the client. A reputable home inspector will not conduct an inspection or prepare an inspection report if their fee is contingent on untruthful conclusions. The inspection should maintain client confidentiality and keep all findings private (unless required by a court order). This means that if youâre a seller you have the choice of disclosing the report to others. If thereâs a failure in the integrity of the home or with any of its systems, though, you must report them.Â Fifth, inspectors arenât responsible for the condition of the home. Inspectors donât go behind walls or under floorings, so itâs possible that a problem can get overlooked. Also, keep in mind that inspectors arenât a part to the saleâs transaction, so if a major problem surfaces after the sale is complete, you wonât be able to make them liable or get to them to pay for it getting fixed. In fact, you may not be entitled to any compensation beyond the cost of the inspection. As a buyer, you just need the inspector to decide if the home is in a condition you can tolerate. You can then show it to the seller to negotiate a better price or point out repairs that need to be made. You can also take it to a contractor and use it to remodel the home.Â The one thing you shouldnât do when buying a home is skip the home inspection because of the cost or any undue pressure from the seller. Itâs also important to note that inspections are required by many lenders, especially for FHA loans.Â For older homes, be sure to have the plumbing and sewer lines inspected during your inspection. Additionally, you can talk to your inspector about adding other tests to the basic inspection, like a radon or mold test. Most competent inspectors your agent refers you too will add these tests anyway, though.Â If you have any other questions about home inspections or how they can benefit you, please feel free to reach out to me. Iâd be glad to help you.Â ",

        "content": "How do you know if itâs the right time to sell?If this is something youâve been wondering lately, weâve got some good news: Itâs a great market for sellers right now. Limited inventory continues to drive up home prices, and the latest data from the National Association of Realtors shows that recent listings spent an average of just one month on the market.Â âHaving a knowledgeable professional working on your behalf will be the key to your real estate success.âWith these incredible factors in mind, letâs now turn to some relevant advice by businessman and author Dave Ramsey. According to him, knowing whether youâre ready to sell comes down to identifying these seven signs: Â 1. Equity is on your side. During the market crash in 2008, millions of American homeowners found themselves with negative equity. This meant they owed more than their homes were worth. But, today, home values have been on the rise. To determine how much equity youâve built in your home, simply grab your latest mortgage statement and find your current mortgage balance. Next, find your homeâs current value by asking an experienced agent to run a free comparative market analysis. Once you have these two numbers in hand, subtract your current mortgage balance from your homeâs estimated market value. The result of this equation will be a good approximation of your current equity position.Â 2. Youâre out of debt and have cash in the bank. Being a money-smart homebuyer by taking a hard look at your finances will be key to your success. If youâve got a good store of emergency funds reserved, this is a positive sign that youâre ready to make your next real estate purchase.Â 3. Youâre ready for a home that better suits your lifestyle. If your current home doesnât match your current needs, it may be time to make a change.Â 4. You can cash-flow the move. Donât get so excited by the thought of your next home that you forget to account for the cost of leaving your current one. Hiring professional movers, contractors, stagers, and more are all expenses to consider. That said, small changes can go a long way in getting your property market-ready.5. Youâre emotionally ready to sell. Even if you are financially stable enough for another home purchase, the matter of selling your current home can still be a major emotional drain. You must be committed to facing potential difficulties associated with the listing process before you can think about reaping the benefits of a home sale.Â 6. You understand the market. No one can predict exactly how the market will perform, but staying on top of developing trends will make you more successful as both a buyer and a seller.Â 7. You have a real estate agent. Each real estate market is unique, so consulting an experienced local Realtor will help you discern whether selling is advisable given your particular circumstances. Ultimately, having a knowledgeable professional working on your behalf will be the key to your real estate success.Â If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "So youâve decided to sell your house, and you canât wait to buy a new place. However, thereâs just one thing standing in the way: Youâve got to close the deal on your current home first. You hope it doesnât take months to get an offer, since you want to sell your home fast and for as much money as you can. If this describes you to an extent, I want to provide you with five no-cost tricks to sell your home faster in todayâs market.A study by the Real Estate Staging Association found that homes that were staged before listing received an offer in just 23 days on average. Thatâs 90% faster than those who waited months after listing to bother with staging. With that in mind, here are your top five tips:âAn experienced agent can lend a fresh eye and help you reimagine your home.â1. Channel your inner neat-freak. You always knew your tidying tendencies would come in handy one day, right? Well, itâs time to clutter-bust your way through to the buyersâ hearts. Pay particular attention to junk vortexes like kitchen and bathroom counters, fireplace mantels, laundry rooms, pantry shelves, tabletops, bookshelves, magazine racks, and so on.2. Rearrange your furniture. Once all the clutter is out of the way, take a step back and look at the big picture: Does your home invite buyers to sit and stay awhile? Can buyers move freely through your home without bumping into this? If not, you have some work to do. Start by putting bulky pieces of furniture into storage and moving furniture away from the ways. Many times, rooms are put together for the kidsâ sake, allowing them to play in the middle of a room or so that the TV can be seen from every chair. Buyers want to walk in and see an open, yet intimate, space that inspires conversations. If you have a fireplace, go ahead and make that the centerpiece to which your furniture points. An experienced agent can lend a fresh eye and help you reimagine your home.3. When you clean, think like a buyer. Many people underestimate just how clean your home needs to be when preparing to put it on the market. This isnât your average weekend tidy-up; think of it as spring cleaning on steroids. You need to think about what buyers look for and then get down to the nitty-gritty. That means addressing even the smallest details and making them shine, like your ceiling fans, floorboards, window blinds and sills, tile grout, tubs, sinks, and so on.4. Set the table if people are coming over. Staging paints a picture for potential buyers, allowing them to imagine living in your home. If they can see that a family lives here and can have company over, then theyâll see that for their own family, too. Nothing represents family and company life quite like a nicely prepared dinner table, so break out the nice flatware and add some seasonal flair with a dash of bold colors. Set two to four places at the table and arrange a decorative centerpiece on top of a neutral table runner. Check out websites like Pinterest for more ideas.5. Bring the outside in. Make your house feel like a home by taking advantage of whatâs in full bloom right outside your door. Fresh flowers are very inviting; they warm up a room and send a message that yours is a really nice space to be in. If plucking decorations from your yard isnât an option, stop by your local flower shop or grocery store. If you do have a few bucks to spare, you may want to consider spending it on paint and mulching in the front yard. Buyers give you about three seconds to make the sale. Mulch and fresh paint will go a very long way.Of course, every home is different, so before you spend one red cent freshening up your casa, ask a real estate agent you trust for advice. You see, a true pro knows what buyers in your area want and can help you maximize your homeâs appeal without breaking the bank.Â As always, feel free to give us a call if you have any questions or have a topic youâd like us to discuss.

        "title": "How to Invest in Real Estate With a Self-Directed IRA",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Did you know that you can use self-directed IRAs to purchase investment property? Itâs true. The IRS permits retirement accounts like IRAs to invest in real estate, among other options. There are a lot of advantages to using a self-directed IRA, or a solo 401(k) plan, to buy real estate. The first advantage is tax deferral (or tax-free growth).If you were to purchase a $250,000 property with retirement funds, and later sell that property for $450,000, the $200,000 profit you earned would, generally, be tax-deferred.Â Alternatively, gains earned from an investment property purchased with personal funds would be subject to federal and state income tax.Â The second advantage is that a self-directed IRA can allow you to invest in hard assets you know and understand, such as rental property.Â Finally, having the ability to invest in alternative assets outside of the stock market is believed to be a great source of investment diversification.Â âAlways become familiar with the locality, rental rates, and the costs involved with purchasing and holding property before investing in real estate using an IRA.âBut before buying real estate in Utah with a self-directed IRA, there are three things you should consider.Â 1. Research. Itâs important that you do your due diligence on the real estate asset you plan to purchase with your IRA. This means you should become familiar with the locality, rental rates, and the costs involved with purchasing and holding real estate as an investment.2. Price. Unlike stocks or mutual funds, which typically donât have ongoing costs, real estate investments will carry expenses like property taxes, maintenance costs, and insurance fees. Keeping a three-month reserve of funds for each investment property is advisable, as this will help you cover vacancies and repairs.Â 3. IRA custodian options. Most traditional financial institutions and banks donât allow IRA holders to buy real estate with their investment account, since it doesnât generate a profit for the institution. However, there are a number of self-directed IRA custodians throughout Utah, and the United States as a whole, that allow clients to make alternative investments like real estate. There are essentially two options you have if you plan to purchase investment property with your IRA. Your first option is a custodian-controlled self-directed IRA, and your second is a checkbook-controlled self-directed IRA.Â In a custodian-controlled IRA, the holder will direct the custodian to invest in traditional and alternative assets. A checkbook-controlled IRA, meanwhile, requires that a special-purpose LLC is established. This LLC would be wholly owned and managed through a local bank account by the IRA holder. The use of the LLC allows the holder to act quickly and cost-effectively when the right investment opportunity presents itself.Â The custodian-controlled option is often used by IRA investors looking to make alternative investments without a high frequency of transactions, like the purchase of raw property. The checkbook-controlled option is popular among IRA investors interested in making real estate investments with a high frequency of transactions, such as rental properties or fix-and-flip projects.Â While using a self-directed IRA to invest in real estate is becoming more popular, itâs still important to think about the benefits and considerations mentioned today. We also recommend consulting with a tax professional for further guidance.Â If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "I want to talk to you today about the sellerâs disclosure. First and foremost, do not be afraid of the sellerâs disclosure. State and federal laws are strict in requiring sellers to disclose what they know about the condition of their homes, but this isnât obvious or discernable to a potential buyer.Buyers are unable to see behind walls or under houses, so they rely on truthful information from the seller about the operations, appliances, and systems of the home. When you sell a home, your real estate agent is going to present you with the federal and state mandated disclosure called a real estate disclosure statement.âWhile disclosure forms do allow you to answer âI donât knowâ or write âN/Aâ to a question, you should only do so if you are unsure about the condition of that item.âYou are required to disclose the presence of things like lead paint, radon, asbestos, and other toxic products if you know your home has them. While the forms may ask you to disclose whether or not you know there are lead paint and radon present, you are not required to do tests to determine the presence of toxic chemicals. However, your buyerâs lender could always require proof of tests and/or remediation for any problem that has been disclosed, such as fire or water damage.Itâs important to answer every question as truthfully as you can. You must answer the questions yourself because your real estate agent, as a professional, canât fill out the disclosure for you. However, they can help you understand what is being asked of you. If youâre in doubt about what you should disclose, itâs best to err on the side of too much information rather than not enough.While disclosure forms do allow you to answer âI donât knowâ or write âN/Aâ to a question, you should only do so if youâre unsure about the condition of that item. If you answer that you donât know the condition of an appliance that you use daily, such as a sink or bathtub, that might actually raise some suspicions in the eyes of the buyer.Â The best way to feel confident about the condition of your home is to have it inspected by a licensed, professional home inspector. Your real estate professional will be able to recommend someone to you. For a few hundred dollars and a few hours of your time, youâll either find that your home is market-ready or the inspector will bring a problem to your attention that you can fix.If you have any questions about this or buying or selling, please feel free to call or email.

        "content": "Whatâs the latest news from our Wasatch Front market? Here are the latest year-over-year numbers from our second quarter through June 21.Â Over 11,000 homes have sold so far, which is nearly a 5% increase compared to the 10,500 that sold during 2017âs second quarter. We also saw a 9% increase in the average sale price. Interest rates rose from 3.91% to 4.62% for 30-year mortgages, and experts agree that weâll probably see rates over 5% by the end of the year.Â Thereâs no need to panic, though. Over the last 42 years, the average interest rate is 8.4%, so weâre still well below that mark. Even if we go back as late as 1990 and hit the reset button, the average interest rate is still 6.6%.The average days on market dropped 10% to 41 days, and our level of inventory for all housing types is 3.3 months. Remember, all markets are driven by supply and demand. Generally, a market is considered âlevelâ when it has between five and six months of inventory. Anything below that is considered a sellerâs market; anything above is considered a buyerâs market.Â âEntry-level home availability is low.âFor homes priced under $350,000 along the Wasatch Front, thereâs only a 2.5-month supply of homes. Between $350,000 and $500,000, thereâs just above a four-month supply. Above $500,000, thereâs a 5.5-month supply.Â As you can see, entry-level home availability is low, and I expect that weâll continue to see tight inventory and lots of competition in that price range throughout the rest of the year.Â If youâre selling your home, nowâs a great time to act, but there are still strategies you must use to get the most for your home, so make sure you talk to an experienced agent. If youâre a buyer, you absolutely must work with an experienced buyer specialist to find and close on the home you want.Â If you have any other questions about our Wasatch Front market or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

Change your furnace filter every three months. This will extend the lifespan of your furnace and will also keep it running more efficiently.Â 2. Fix leaky faucets. Being proactive and fixing leaks expediently is critical. Doing so will cut costs on your water bill and prevent what could become serious damage.Â 3. Unclog your drains. I recommend pouring a cup of white vinegar down all the sink and shower drains in your home. This will help prevent clogs and eliminate odors.4. Know the location and functions of all the switches on your circuit panel. Having this knowledge could make future electrical issues much easier to approach.5. Fix squeaky doors and cabinets. This can be achieved by rubbing vaseline or WD-40 on the hinges.Â âTo prevent water damage, you will need to caulk (or re-caulk) certain areas of your home periodically.â6. Know the location of your water shut-off valves.Â 7. Understand how to operate your water shut-off valves.Â 8. Determine whether water drains away from or toward your home. This can be easily tested by placing a ball near your foundation and watching which way it rolls. If the ball rolls toward your home, your propertyâs foundation is at risk of water damage.Â 9. Check that your water heater safety valve is working properly. The last thing you want is an exploding water heater. The pressure valve on the top of the heater can be popped up. Then, the line will be drained outside of the house into a visible location. If you see water coming out of the drain, the pop-up valve may have failed and needs to be replaced.Â 10. Caulk necessary areas as-needed. To prevent water damage, you will need to caulk (or re-caulk) certain areas of your home periodically.Â If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "title": "How to Compete and Win as a Buyer in a Seller's Market",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Sometimes, homebuyers wonder if itâs even worth trying to compete over homes in a hot sellerâs market. When there is very little inventory in the market, it isnât unusual for a single property to receive upwards of 20 offers. And only one buyer can win.Nevertheless, it is almost always a good idea to write an offer anyway. So letâs discuss six tips to help make your offer outshine the rest.1. Submit a large earnest money deposit. Pending home sales sometimes blow up. Sellers are often worried that once they commit to an offer, the winning buyer might back out of the transaction or default on the contract after all the other potential buyers have disappeared. An earnest money deposit speaks volumes to the sellers about your commitment as a buyer. And once the deal goes through, this money will go toward your down payment.Â 2. Show sellers that youâre qualified by presenting a loan approval letter. This letter is what we like to call âthe golden ticket.â Almost every offer in a multiple offer situation will be accompanied by a lender letter. To stand out, ask your lender for a full loan approval letter. Being pre-approved is different than being pre-qualified. When you are pre-approved, the seller will essentially view you as a cash buyer. So make sure you undergo the pre-approval process before beginning your home search.Â 3. Give the seller time to move. Buyer possession is often a sticking point. Itâs hard enough to juggle multiple closings when youâre buying and selling simultaneously, let alone when the seller on the other end of your transaction is doing the same. Cut the seller some slack and allow them to take a few days after closing to finish up their move. Doing so without expecting any compensation will help your transaction go much more smoothly. Also, before sealing the deal, itâs critical for you to have a home inspection. By federal law, you have 10 days to have the home inspected for lead-based paint. Tightening your time frame or removing related contingencies from your contract can help you stand out as a buyer.âIn todayâs market, youâve got to offer your highest price and best terms right out of the gate.â4. Write a letter to the seller. Moving can be as emotional an experience for the seller as it is for the buyer. Writing the seller a letter can be an effective way to let them know how much you love the home. It can also be an opportunity to tell them about how you plan to care for the property.Â 5. Write your best offer from the beginning. Donât hope for negotiation. In todayâs market, youâve got to offer your highest price and best terms right out of the gate. Make your offer attractive, whether that means offering a little above list price or using an escalation clause to ensure yours is the highest offer. You can also speak to your agent about performing a comparative market analysis, as sellers sometimes deliberately set their home below the price of comparable sales in order to generate multiple offers. Paying a little extra doesnât necessarily mean youâre overpaying. What you may have thought was a high price may actually be market value.Â 6. Consider submitting a backup offer. If at first you donât win, try and try again. Also, realize that about 24% of all accepted offers are going to fail. If a listing agent doesnât accept your offer, then write an addendum to your offer using a secondary backup clause. The Wasatch Front MLS system includes backup statuses. This means Realtors have access to an entire database of sellers who are actively looking for backup offers. Of course, the success of your offer will also vary depending on the agent you work with.

        "content": "My goal is to keep you educated about all things real estate so that you have the ability to make great decisions when it comes to your own home selling, buying, and investing goals. With that in mind, I want to talk to you today about the first quarter housing statistics for the Wasatch Front.First quarter sales are actually up this year, having increased about 6% from 2017. Already, 6,500 homes have been sold in the first quarter of the year. Thatâs compared to 6,100 in 2017.Additionally, weâve seen an 11.5% increase in the average sales price year over year along the Wasatch Front. Right now, weâre actually nearing $400,000.With interest rates beginning to rise, and with inventory being exceptionally low for starter homes, first-time homebuyers are being squeezed pretty tight. On top of that, the average time on the market for all housing types along the Wasatch Front is decreasing. Last year, the average was about 53 days, and right now, the average is about 48 days. Thatâs about 10% less time to sell a home at the start of this year.For all price ranges, we have an inventory level of 3.7 months, meaning it would take 3.7 months for us to sell all of the homes we currently have on the market if no new homes were added. A balanced market is one with around six monthsâ worth of supply, so we are indeed in a sellerâs market.âThe market is kind of a trickle-up market; first-time buyers give the rest of the market the ability to move on.âCurrently, we have a tale of two markets: If we look at homes priced under $350,000, our entry-level price, we have well under a three-month supply of properties. However, when we look at homes priced above, say, $500,000, we have close to a seven-month supply of homes. The higher up in price that you go, the more the market favors buyers. Really, the market is kind of a trickle-up market; first-time buyers give the rest of the market the ability to move on as well. For example, when a first-time buyer purchases a home, that gives the seller the ability to move up into a home in a different price range.We can see how the lack of supply and affordable housing actually impacts the market in the higher price range. We have more supply of those higher priced new construction homes along the Wasatch Front. The average price is up just over 8% for the first quarter of this year over last year.Given the fact that cities like Salt Lake City, Provo, Lehi, and Ogden have all made top-10 lists for places to live, work, and invest in homes, itâs expected that prices will continue to increase through the remainder of 2018. I expect that weâll continue to see very tight inventory at the entry-level price range with lots of competition.Itâs a great time to sell your home! There are strategies you must use to ensure that you get the most from your agent. For buyers, youâll need a full-time buyerâs agent with experience in navigating these waters. Do not go it alone. If youâre thinking about selling your home or you have any other real estate questions, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd be glad to help you.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I want to tell you the truth about interest rates and how they affect home sellers and buyers in the current market.Interest rates have been on the rise over the last couple of months, and we shouldnât be surprised by this. In fact, most experts have been predicting the increase in mortgage rates for the last two years.First, letâs garner a little perspective about whatâs normal in terms of interest rates. If we go back over the past 42 years, the average interest rate is about 8.4%. For the younger population, thatâs simply not realistic. If we go back to 1990, the average rate was 6.8%. Today that number is somewhere around 4.5%. Weâre still quite a bit lower than the historic average.he Federal Reserve prefers to keep the Fed Funds rate between 2% and 5%. This is the sweet spot for maintaining a healthy economy and matches the nationâs GDP growth which falls between 2% and 3% annually. Here, the natural unemployment rate is between 4.5% and 5%.Price increases remain below the Fedâs inflation target of 2% core inflation rate. But there were times in history when the nationâs benchmark interest rate was well above the sweet spot. That was to curb runaway inflation. Since 2008, itâs been well below that point to stimulate economic growth.Once you see how the Fed changes the Fed Funds rate, then youâll understand how it manages inflation and recession. The current Fed Funds rate is about 1.5%. The Fed signaled it will raise rates to about 2% in 2018, 2.5% in 2019, and 3% in 2020.âWhen mortgage interest rates go up by 1%, the cost of owning a home goes up by about 10%.âThe rate is critical in determining the U.S. economic outlook. This means that interest rates are likely to continue their rise to normalcy. How will that affect homebuyers?As you can see on the chart in the video at 2:24, when mortgage interest rates go up by 1%, the cost of owning a home goes up by about 10%. In other words, if you were shopping for homes priced at $350,000 and interest rates went up by 1%, now youâd be shopping for homes priced at $311,100 to get the same monthly payment. Thatâs a pretty significant difference.If youâre a home seller, realize that weâre in a trickle-up economy. This means that if thereâs a 1% increase in interest rates, youâll have 18% fewer potential buyers. Statistically, if an interest rate increases by 1%, then we lose the bottom 18% of first-time homebuyers. Theyâre the answer to the move-up buyers, since theyâre buying the move-up buyersâ homes. This story plays out all the way up the housing price chain.As a side note: because of the continued low interest rates, affordability has remained near record-lows going back again about 42 years.What is the affordability index? This index tells us what percentage of the average household income at the average interest rate it will take to buy the average home. Nationally the average is around 22%. This is around the fourth or fifth lowest on recordâstrike now while the iron is hot and sell while the buyers are still able to buy.If you have any questions about this topic, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd love to help you any way I can.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "With each and every home that Iâve purchased, Iâve gone through this period of cold sweats that we in the industry call âhomebuyerâs remorse.â Itâs very likely that you may experience it too. So what can you do about it?First, create a list of your top 10 wants and needs (five of each) with regards to the home youâre eventually looking to purchase. This list should be made before you select a home so that youâre sure that the home you pursue will fit as many of each as possible. Most people will end up owning five homes before they retire, which means that youâll find probably five or six of these things on your list if youâre a first-time homebuyer.Does the home include the most important features on your list? What qualities made the house you chose stand out from the others you looked at? Did you find many houses that met your needs, or was this one a rarity? If you can back out of the contract, is it realistic to think that youâre going to find a house thatâs better, in terms of your list?Analyzing the facts that led you to the home will help you sort out your feelings about the purchase. Was it truly a poor choice, or would you be nervous moving forward on any house?âWe are proud of our guaranteed sale program.âHere are some scenarios that can bring on buyerâs remorse:1. Family dissent. If you have discussions with your family about your purchase, they often mean well, but itâs not uncommon for family and friends to question your choice and how much you paid for itâespecially if itâs your first house. However, do they really know the current market? They might not have bought a home themselves in several years; things have changed since their time.2. Continuing to look at houses. Unless you feel like your contract has a good chance of falling apart, the appraisal will be unsatisfactory, or the inspection might uncover serious repair issues, stop looking at other homes.3. Real estate agents who offer no guidance. Some agents donât guide their buyers through the closing process, causing questions and doubts to pop up. The agents arenât around to provide answers and assure the buyers that what theyâre feeling is normal. Unanswered questions can put buyers in a panic mode, especially when itâs their first home. Panic leads to doubt and, ultimately, buyerâs remorse.Nothing in life is actually certain. We tend to think about the uncertainties even more whenever we make important commitments. The bottom line is when you buy a house, youâre going to go through that weird, cold sweat experience that is homebuyerâs remorse, and itâs normal.If you have any questions that you feel like youâre not getting answers to or would like to know more about Salt Lake City Real Estate, please donât hesitate to reach out to The Stern Team.

Every market is different, but these tips will certainly apply regardless of your area.1. Add a fresh coat of paint.Â Buyers these days begin their search online, so you want to make sure your home looks as good in person as it does in your virtual listing. A fresh, neutral coat of paint will go a long way.2. Clean up. Pressure-washing the exterior of your home, cleaning the windows, and adding planters with flowers can all make your home much more attractive to buyers. These and many other little touches will help your property stand out.3. Plan a great marketing strategy. Youâve got to cast a broad net to capture the most buyers possible. Marketing to a wide number of buyers will allow you to sell your home for a high price and in a low amount of time. A great marketing strategy is a worthwhile investment. It makes sure no money is left on the table.4. Interview real estate agents. If youâre interested in working with an agent, interview several before making a decision. Ask them about their track record, their strategies, and what they would highlight about your home. If youâre interested, I do have a list of the top 10 questions to ask potential agents that I would be happy to send you. So, feel free to get in touch.âMarketing to a wide number of buyers will allow you to sell your home for a high price and in a low amount of time.â5. Price correctly.Â To make sure you set a price that is fair and competitive, look at homes in your area that have sold in the last 90 days and compare them to your property. The homes you look at should be similar in age, lot-size, and style. Beyond looking at past sales, you should also look at the active competition on the market. Look at homes that are pending and see how long they were on the market before accepting an offer. All of this information will help you determine the best price possible.6. Toss any junk. If youâre going to move anyway, why not get a head start on getting rid of the things you donât need? Packing and decluttering will give your home an open feel. Remove anything that isnât decorative from the flat surfaces in your home, including counters, bookshelves, desks, cabinets, and more.7. Stay on top of the market. In order to be successful in the market, you need to have an idea of whatâs been going on. Brush up on current and past trends and statistics. The real estate market can and will change quickly, so itâs good to stay current in your understanding of market conditions.If you would like additional tips or have any other questions, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "title": "7 Reasons to Invest in Real Estate in 2018",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "There are many reasons why 2018 is going to be a great market for real estate investing. Here are the top seven reasons to invest in the Wasatch Front real estate market:1. Strong economic indicators. The 2018 economy looks sunny-side up. For all you novice and expert real estate investors out there, itâs a simple equation. If the economy is growing, then the housing market will see positive repercussions and growth in turn.In fact, the Wasatch Front just made the PricewaterhouseCoopers and Urban Land Instituteâs Top 3 U.S. Markets to Watch list. Additionally, Salt Lake City was named No. 6 in the Top 10 Housing Markets for 2018 according to Realtor.comâs 2018 National Housing Forecast. That is great news for the Salt Lake City real estate market.This year, we expect more people to sell houses, buy houses, and get mortgage loans. 2018 is a great year to get your first rental property and delve into real estate investing. Not only is real estate a safe investment option, itâs a financially rewarding option for the long haul.2. Itâs easier to get a mortgage. It has been tough to get a mortgage for a while, but itâs easier to get a mortgage due to lenient credit qualifications and low interest rates. This means more people are taking out loans to finance their investment properties, whether itâs a condo, single-family property, or multi-family property. Real estate investors are taking advantage of this perk and investing heavily in the real estate market left and right. The competition is strong out there, but you have a good chance of getting approved for your loan and kickstarting your real estate business today.A mortgage is a great way to leverage an investment. You canât borrow money to put into the stock market, and the stock market does not provide you with a tangible investment anyway.3. Appreciation. Real estate is one of the safest investments out there, and it is a great long-term investment strategy. Your rental properties increase in value over time, given that the property is in a prime location and growing economy. You will be able to sell your property for a lot more money and make a good profit 20 or 30 years down the road, and in the meantime, you will receive rental income every month.âReal estate is one of the best long-term investment strategies out there.â4. Tax benefits. There are certain tax advantages to investing in real estate. Real estate is a business, and any business owner, entrepreneur, or investor out there gets tax exemptions and benefits for owning and running a business. Investors who own a rental property can write off the interest rate charged on the mortgage, and appreciation, expenses, maintenance, and repairs associated with the property. That said, itâs very important to hire the right accountant to get more tax exemptions and help you with the money along the way.5. You will have a steady flow of income with a rental property. Not only are you becoming your own boss, but youâre also earning a steady flow of rental income every single month. This passive income is one of the best reasons to invest in real estate today. If you get the right tenants, you can secure a steady flow of cash for a long time, and you avoid the risk of vacancy.Trust me, Iâve been doing this a long time, and good tenants matter. Nevertheless, itâs important that you always underestimate your rental income and overestimate expenses. Donât forget, your rental income is helping you pay down your mortgage payments. Thatâs a win-win situation.6. Financial freedom. In the long run, one reason to invest in real estate is to accumulate wealth. Owning rental properties is passive income for the long haul. In the most ideal case (i.e. no vacant units), whether you want to save for retirement or use that extra income for a side hustle, investing in real estate is the answer to gain financial freedom for years on end. It took me less than 12 years to buy and pay off all the investment properties that I have now. You can do this, tooâitâs not rocket science.7. Financial security. In a nutshell, real estate offers investors financial security for many years down the line. When you own a tangible asset thatâs bound to appreciate over time, you have the financial security to sell it for a lot more than its original price. If you need cash, you can always sell the property. If you donât sell, youâll continue to earn passive income from the tenants who are also helping to pay down the mortgage. The financial security youâll find in real estate is what makes it a very lucrative business for a lot of people.As you can see, there are a number of reasons to invest in real estate in 2018. You could reap the financial benefits if you start today.If you have any questions about investing in Wasatch Front real estate or Salt Lake City real estate, be sure to reach out to The Stern Team.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Iâve got a report card to share with you today for the Wasatch Front real estate market in 2017. Letâs start with some of the numbers for single-family homes.Single-family home sales were down slightly in 2017. They dropped 3.5% from where they were in 2016 and we saw 28,000 of them. If we go back to the previous height of the market in 2006 when 28,300 single-family homes sold,** t**hat was our strongest sales year ever in terms of home sales and weâre very close to that level right now.The average sale price for single-family homes is up about 6% year-over-year, from $305,000 to $323,000. A big reason for this is because of the limited availability of entry-level housing and the luxury market picking up momentum as well. Home prices have increased about 16% over the last few years. Over the last 40 years, we have seen an average appreciation of 3.2%, so this is definitely an indicator of Utahâs growing population and the new home buildersâ inability to keep up with demand. Itâs a great time to be a home seller and move up to take advantage of the market.Letâs switch over to condos and townhomes. In terms of the total number sold, we saw nearly identical numbers in 2016 and 2017. However, 2016 was a record year for condo sales so it looks as if weâve had another one of those this year. The average condo price in 2017 was just over $209,000, an 8.4% increase over 2016âs record high average. Keep in mind that one in five condos sold along the Wasatch Front were new construction and naturally priced higher.âThings are looking strong along the Wasatch Front in 2018.âLetâs switch over to condos and townhomes.

Keep in mind that one in five condos sold along the Wasatch Front were new construction and naturally priced higher.Weâre expecting some big things from the Wasatch Front market in 2018. Salt Lake City was named No. 6 in the Top 10 Housing Markets for the 2018 National Forecast. Price Waterhouse Cooper and the Urban Land Institute ranked Salt Lake City No. 3 on their list. We were also recently named the No. 6 housing market in Realtor.comâs list of Top 10 Housing Markets in 2018.Finally, letâs talk about interest rates. We assumed that we would have seen those 5% rates already, but it just hasnât happened yet. We werenât the only ones who were wrong about our assumption. Most experts predicted that rates would hit or exceed that 5% mark by the end of 2017. Lawrence Yun, the Chief Economist of the National Association of Realtors, expects that we will see an average rate of around 4.6% this year on the standard 30-year fixed rate loan. Realtor.com, meanwhile, is expecting rates to hit 5% by the end of 2018 due to stronger economic growth, inflationary pressure, and monetary policy normalization in the year ahead.Things are looking strong here along the Wasatch Front in 2018.

        "title": "What Are the Biggest Issues Facing Buyers Today?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Purchasing a home for the first time is no easy task. Today, Iâd like to share a list of the six biggest obstacles facing first-time homebuyers:1. Down payment. Unless youâve won the lottery or are independently wealthy, youâre probably going to need a mortgage. If you happen to be a veteran, you can take advantage of the VA loan. This program allows you to put 0% down on a home. However, most other loan types will require some sort of down payment. Typically, this down payment will be a minimum of anywhere from 3% to 15%.2. Minimum FICO score.Â If youâre using an FHA loan, you must have a minimum score of 620. But if youâre using a conventional loan, your score must be a minimum of 720. If your score falls below these numbers, you may not qualify for a mortgage or the interest rate may be higher on the mortgage you do qualify for. To find out your FICO score, ask your lender to run your credit report. Your lender will pull your score from three different credit reporting agencies and use the middle score.3. Meeting lender ratio. Most lenders expect buyers to have a maximum 33% front-end ratio. This means the total from your mortgage payment, taxes, and insurance cannot exceed 33% of your monthly gross income. If you earn $5,000 a month, the maximum principal, interest, taxes, and insurance payment (or PITI payment) you may qualify for is $1,650. The back-end payment is a little trickier, since it involves adding together your PITI payment and all monthly revolving debt. This back-end payment needs to fall between about 41% and 50% of your gross monthly income.âBuying your first home in todayâs market isnât easy.â4. Receiving an appraisal at value. The Home Valuation Code of Conduct (also known as the HVCC) applies to all conventional transactions since January 1, 2010. It now applies to FHA transactions as well. In the past, a lender could choose their own appraiser. Now, an appraiser management company chooses an appraiser at random. This appraiser may not be from the area, which may result in a low appraisal. If the appraisal does not come in at the value and the seller refuses to alter the price, the buyer must come up with the extra funds or the transaction will fall apart.5. Satisfying loan conditions. Underwriting can be brutal. An underwriter reviews the file and can make demands. They will ask for documents, sometimes more than once, and may request an appraisal review. Even after all demands are met, they could reject the loan for a variety of reasons.6. Low inventory. As you may know, weâre seeing tighter inventory than ever. Today, itâs common for buyers in our area to be competing with a dozen or more offers on a single home. There are two solutions Iâd like to offer to this. First, be the first one to a property so that you can weed out the competition and get the best price. Second, call an experienced, competitive buyerâs agent who can help match you with the perfect home.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "title": "The Top 10 Tips for Selling Your Salt Lake City Condo",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "What are 10 helpful tips you can use to sell your condo?First, learn about the process of selling a condo in Salt Lake City. One of the biggest mistakes condo owners make when selling is thinking itâs the same as selling a single-family home, so educate yourself on the condo-selling process so you know what to expect throughout that process. One of the easiest ways you can do this is by discovering helpful resources.Second, know the condo associationâs rules, regulations, fees, and assessments. One of the major differences between selling a condo and selling a single-family home are the homeowners associationâs rules, regulations, fees, and potential assessments involved. When selling a single-family home, itâs unlikely an HOA is involved, which typically makes the process easier. Youâre obviously aware of the pros and cons of an HOA, but that doesnât mean potential buyers will be, so be aware of them and disclose them to any buyer.A common real estate contract contingency made by condo buyers is the ability to review the HOA rules and regulations. This contingency states that the purchase contract is contingent on the buyer and their attorney reviewing the HOAâs rules and regulations. Before listing your condo, gathering any HOA documents will save you a lot of time. Not having proper documents readily available is one of the biggest reasons these kinds of closings get delayed, so you must be proactive and gather that information beforehand.Third, hire a Realtor. Who knows better how to sell a condo than a Realtor? One of the culprits of unsuccessful condo sales is hiring the wrong Realtor, so hire one who knows how to sell a condo. There are some obvious signs youâve hired the wrong Realtor that you need to be aware of. For example, if you get your agentâs voicemail every time you call them youâve hired the wrong Realtor. Frequent communication with your Realtor is critical, especially when selling a condo. There are many tips for interviewing agents when selling a condo, and some specific Â questions you should consider asking, including these four:  How many condos do you typically sell in a year?  Do you have preferred lenders who offer financing on condos for potential buyers?  Would any of your past condo sellers be willing to discuss their experience with me?  How do you market condos to prospective buyers who are actually interested in buying a condo?Fourth, decide on the right listing price. The two most important factors in the sale of a condo are price and marketing. By hiring the right Realtor, youâll have marketing covered. When it comes to pricing your condo, though, there are many mistakes you need to avoid. For example, pricing your home high to leave room for negotiations can be a very big mistake. While thereâs no formula to determining the exact right listing price for your condo, there are excellent methods and data available that can improve your chances at choosing the right listing price.âWho knows better how to sell a condo than a Realtor?âFifth, get your condo ready for the market. The first couple of weeks your condo is listed for sale should be the busiest for showings. You only get one opportunity to make a great first impression on buyers, so itâs vital your condo is ready for the market. Correctly preparing your condo for the market requires time, effort, andâpotentiallyâmoney. If you decide to stage your condo, make sure you evaluate it so you know what it will be worth.Sixth, decide whether open houses are worth it. There are both pros and cons to open houses that you need to weigh before making a decision, and the Realtor you hire will likely have their own opinion regarding open houses. My personal opinion is open houses are awesome. Open houses allow all of the buyers to come into the property at the same time. Quicker access to more buyers means your home will sell for more money in less time.Seventh, accommodate showing requests. Restricting showing requests is one of the worst mistakes you can make when selling a property. While it may be inconvenient to leave your condo at 1 p.m. on a Sunday, it may be the only time a prospective buyer has to view your condo. Any time a seller is difficult with showing requests, it raises the question of whether theyâre actually interesting in selling the property. Sellers who understand that preparing and accommodating for showings can be inconvenient are less stressed about the whole process.Eighth, prepare for inspections. When selling a condo, itâs likely the buyer will want their own inspections done on it. A great way to prepare for these it to check the functionality of your systems and appliances and do your best to eliminate potential issues before they become issues. The inspection period is generally short (10 to 14 days), so make it count.Ninth, hire an attorney. This is optional in the state of Utah, but hiring an attorney whoâs experienced in condo closings can assist you with the reviewal of HOA documents and other documents.Lastly, start packing. Since the ultimate goal of selling a condo is to get the property sold, it makes sense to begin packing and preparing for the move. Itâs somewhat common for sellers to wait until the last minute to do this, and that doesnât makes sense to me. Packaging and preparing early can greatly reduce the amount of stress you endure. Putting things in storage and boxing them up can also help with decluttering. Lining up a moving company in advance is also important, because these companies are often booked weeks in advance. Waiting until the last minute can create a huge issue if there are no reputable moving companies available.If you have any questions about selling your condo in Salt Lake City or the Wasatch Front, just give me a call or send me an email. Iâd be happy to help you.Â ",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "A home appraisal is a part of every home that is bought with financing. Low appraisals can happen for many reasons, including:-Artificially inflated values because of multiple offers -Incorrect evaluation by the underwriter -An inexperienced appraiser who doesnât understand influences on value -Market values rising due to limited inventory -Appraisers looking at pending sales data from the wrong areas -Declining market values due to fewer buyers shopping among a larger inventory -A fallout from an abundance of foreclosures and short sales in a neighborhoodWhen you have an appraisal that comes in low, you have quite a few options as a buyer. One is making up the difference between the appraised value and the purchase price in cash. A low appraisal doesnât mean that a lender wonât lend on a property, it just means that they will only lend up to a certain amount based on the ratio agreed in the contract.âYou have a lot of options.âAt the same time, the seller could lower their price as well. If the homeâs value was inflated due to multiple offers, this is often the best solution. It makes the buyer happy and leaves the lender satisfied. The seller could also offer to carry a second mortgage for the difference. This rarely happens, but itâs still an option. Getting a second appraisal is also an option, although there is no guarantee that it will be higher.If you are buying a home with an FHA loan, youâll need to ask your lender for a list of approved appraisers. An FHA appraisal will stay with a home for an extended period of time. For conventional loans, you are subject to the rules of the HVCC. If an appraisal comes in on your home from a national appraiser and is low, you have every right to contact the lender and demand that a local appraiser be used.Finally, you always have the option of canceling the transaction with a low appraisal. If youâve exhausted all other options, this might be the best course of action.If you have any questions about low appraisals or anything else relating to real estate, give me a call or send me an email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Now that weâre about three quarters of the way through the year, itâs time to take a look at the real estate market in the Wasatch Front.In order to best understand whatâs really going on in our market, letâs look at a couple of the key market indicators.From January to August of 2017, we sold 15,891 single-family homes along the Wasatch Front. 4,800 condominiums and townhomes also sold during that time. This means nearly 20,000 homes and condos sold.The average sales price right now is hovering around $320,000. This is about a 9% increase from what we saw last year.Also, itâs important for us to look at supply and demand. These two factors are what drive the economy. When supply is down, demand goes up.In real estate, a steady supply is considered to be between four and six monthsâ worth of homes on the market at any given time.Anything below that means we are in a sellerâs market. This puts upward pressure on pricing. Anything above six months constitutes a buyerâs market. 2008 through 2011 was very much a buyerâs market, for example.âIt costs about 12% less to buy a home today than it did 10 years ago.âRight now, we have about three monthsâ worth of supply in price points below $350,000 for single-family homes. Also, condominiums and townhomes below $350,000 are seeing approximately a 3.5 monthsâ supply. This is approximately a month above where we were at the end of this yearâs first quarter.As we see supply beginning to increase slightly, this may provide some relief for first-time homebuyers.During the first quarter, our team saw multiple offers on about 80% of homes we had listed beneath $350,000. Now, only about 30% of homes in that same price point are seeing multiple offers.For homes priced above $350,000 on the Wasatch Front, thereâs just shy of six months of inventory.To put all of this into perspective, letâs take a moment by talking about mortgage rates and affordability. Mortgage rates havenât changed as much as was predicted. All in all, weâre hovering around the 4% mark. As prices have increased, this has helped things to remain affordable.If you look at the average price of a $320,000 home at 4% on a 30-year mortgage, your principal and interest payment would be about $1,527. Ten years ago, the average price of a home was just $271,000 but the average interest rate was 6.5%. This meant the mortgage payment was actually $1,707. With these conditions, it costs about 12% less to buy a home today than it did 10 years ago.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today Iâm joined by a very special guest, Travis from VIP Roofing, to help me discuss roofing inspections and certifications.Â So, what is a roofing certification? Ultimately, a roofing certification gives you a document verifying the condition of your roof. It will give you an idea of any current issues, as well as things you may be able to do to extend the life of your roof.This certification is something that will often be requested by FHA appraisers. These appraisers will look at things like the ventilation systems, as well as for any balding spots. These shiny, âbaldâ patches on the roof are actually where fiberglass is coming through due to age or lack of ventilation.Â From the perspective of a seller or homeowner, itâs a really good idea to have a company like VIP Roofing come out. Roofing inspections can really give you a good idea of how your roof can be improved, and also how long you can expect it to last. People like Travis will also help you to identify ways you might be able to extend the life of your roof.Â Roofing inspections are a little bit more in-depth than a roofing certification.Â During an inspection, the inspector is going to look for problem areas. Sometimes this can involve lifting a few shingles, pulling back some siding, or otherwise examining the roof beyond simply looking at it.Â Â âThe difference between good and poor ventilation could be the difference between a roof lasting or not.âHaving a lot of past experience, Travis and his team know what to look for when theyâre searching for problems with a roof. We here at the Stern Team trust VIP Roofing as a quality, local vendor.Certain issues can cause roofs to deteriorate much faster than they should. One key issue Travis pointed out is poor attic ventilation. One way to help with this is by installing a turtle vent, which allows the attic to breathe. The difference between good and poor ventilation could be the difference between a roof lasting for 30 years instead of lasting for seven.Another factor that can cause roofs to deteriorate more quickly is when shingles are layered on top of each other.Our local climate is incredibly harsh. From extreme heat in the summer to below freezing in the winter, the roof can see a lot of damage.Whether youâre a buyer or a seller, roofing is more important than you might think to Salt Lake City real estate. VIP Roofing is a great place to go to make sure your roof will actually last. If you have any questions or would like more information from Travis, you can reach him at (801) 631-6182 or visit VIP Roofingâs website at www.VIP-Roofing.com.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

We asked our own team members why they joined us and why theyâre still with us so you could get an idea of what weâre all about and what you can expect if you came onboard. Â Mike Wolters, our operations director and listing specialist, had known Josh and other members of our team for many years, and the prospect of entering an environment like ours that had the systems and back-end support to deliver top-notch customer experience was very attractive andâto this dayâfulfilling.Having been in the corporate environment for 20 years, he had reached his ceiling for his development in that industry. When he joined us, he knew there would never again be another ceiling.His first year on The Stern Team, Mike fell forward a lot, which was encouraging. âIf I had to sum it up, service is king,â he says. âWhen you treat your clients and focus on them, everything else will take care of itself.â On the team side, as we grow, having the opportunity to hire, train, and develop new agents is vital to both our success and theirs.For Lee Stern, one of our elite listing specialists, the fact that sheâs taken five listings in the last four days sums it up. Most of the people she works with are raving fans of The Stern Team, which means she has less competition.âWhen you join our team, we want you to succeed.âHer clients love the fact that the first question she asks them is how she can make them a raving fan. âWe have a promise that we use on The Stern Teamâto make the experience better than the clients ever couldâve imagined.âBuyer Specialist Justin Acheson came to us wanting to provide a better customer experience for his clients. He was still new to the industry, so he didnât quite have the knowledge to provide a great service.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today, Mandi Henriod from Veritas Funding is here to explain a great new tool for homebuyers.As you know, the Salt Lake City real estate market and the Wasatch Front market both favor sellers. Properties are going on the market and getting five, 10, 20, or even 33 offers.As a homebuyer, it can be very difficult to compete in that type of market.Luckily, there is a great new loan product available to help you.First, we need to explain the benefits of conventional loans vs. FHA loans. If you present an offer to a seller and you have an FHA loan, your loan puts a burden on the seller. The seller will have to do more work on the property in order to get to the closing table with your offer. Also, sellers generally regard FHA buyers as less strong than conventional buyers.However, the advantage of the FHA loan is that low down payment. When you combine the FHA loan program with Utah housing programs, you can get into a house for no money down.Luckily, Mandi has a tool that will help you get a conventional loan and pay even less money out of pocket for a home than you would with an FHA loan.âYou can qualify for a conventional loan with a 1% down payment.âThis program allows you to get a conventional loan with a 3% down payment, which is half a percent lower than the FHA loan. The program also allows the lender to give you a 2% gift, which leaves you with a 1% down payment.The lender can give you $1,000 for every $100,000 spent, which may not seem like much but certainly helps you get into the home of your dreams.So, this program makes your offer look stronger because you have a conventional loan and you donât have to put as much money down as you would with an FHA loan. Plus, you do not need to be a first-time homebuyer to qualify for this program, and there are no household income limitations. That is great news because income limitations are a big stumbling block for other low or no down payment programsIf you have any more questions about this great Fannie Mae program, you can contact Mandi at 801-638-1005. As always, if you have any Salt Lake City real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "When inventory is tight, competition between buyers significantly increases. In fact, with as few choices as are on the market right now, it isnât uncommon for us to see 30 or more offers on a single home.This can be extremely frustrating for buyers. Sometimes against that much competition, it can feel like the best thing to do is to simply give up and walk away without even making an offer.But today I have a few tips Iâd like to share with you that will help your offer stand out above the rest.First of all, earnest money is incredibly important. The more earnest money you put down, the more serious you will appear to the seller. In the $350,000 range, for example, the majority of buyers tend to put down $1,000 to $2,000.But, when your down payment on a home like that can run you $75,000 or more, why not put down the extra money to show youâre truly interested?Â When you get the closing table, your earnest money will simply count toward that down payment.Putting more earnest money down wonât cost you any more than youâd already be paying for that down payment. So, why not make your offer stronger by putting down as much as you can?Additionally, your offer will be contingent upon inspections and the approvals of those inspections. Therefore, you can be sure your money wonât vanish if something about the property isnât as it should be.Secondly, approval letters are great. However, every other buyer making an offer on the property will have one, too. So my team and I like to recommend that buyers take one extra step that we call âthe golden ticket.ââBeing considerate of the seller is just one more thing that will help you win in this market.âWhen you talk to our preferred lenders, Veritas, theyâll provide you a full, free-of-charge underwriting. This document shows the seller that you are essentially a cash buyer.Including an additional, more personal letter to the seller that explains why you love the home will also give your offer a huge boost. When you talk about your family and why the home is important to you, it makes your offer truly stand out.Also, understand your time frame. When you already have your approval letter, you donât need the additional 21 days it takes to go through the loan process. Talk to your lender and have them work your appraisal and inspections right out of the gate. Lining these things up ahead of time will really expedite the process.Speaking of time, whenever you buy a house itâs natural to want to move in right away. Understand, though, that sellers have to move too. Remember not to rush the seller. Being patient and considerate of the seller is just one more thing that will help you win in this market.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

As a result, the average price for listings is up 8.5%.Whatâs interesting is that the number of properties in the âpendingâ statusâmeaning the offer has been accepted between the buyer and seller and is waiting for closingâexceeds the number of properties actively for sale. The failure rate of pending properties is also higher than in years past, which means weâre having more appraisal issues and buyers getting cold feet or finding a property they like better and canceling the contract. Either way, as a buyer in this market, itâs a good idea to consider placing a backup offer on a property you want because thereâs a 24% chance youâll win it.âTake advantage of this market while you can.âUnder the $350,000 price point, there is less than a two-month supply of inventory, which means itâs a great time to be a seller and the waters are a little bit testier for buyers. If youâre a buyer, make sure you have a winning strategy before entering this market.Based on my experience coaching other top agents across the country, the market in Utah is similar to the markets all across the nation. Inventory is tight, prices have risen, interest rates are still very low, and I suspect weâll see this type of market throughout the summer and fall and perhaps the rest of 2017.If you have any questions about our market or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home, donât hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email.

        "content": "Today Iâm here with Jayson Kisselburg from Veritas Funding with some good news for those buying a home with a lot of student loan debt.Student loan debt in America is incredible, as college is not cheap. If you have a lot of student debt, it can be daunting to purchase a home. However, Fannie Mae, one of the mortgage giants in our country, actually allows you to do a cash-out loan on your property.Basically, your home will be appraised and then you can take out a substantial amount of equity to pay off those student loans.When you pull the equity out to pay off your student loans, the loan is then tied against the house, which turns it into a tax deduction. When the time comes to sell your house, you can actually sell your home student-loan free.âThis Fannie Mae program will help more people with student debt qualify for home loans.âAnother benefit of this program is that if you qualify for another Wasatch Front home now, then you donât have to report that debt against your income.Â Before, you would have to include a payment all the way up to 1%, no matter what the credit bureaus were reporting. Now, we can go off the exact payment from your student loan company.As a loan officer, Jayson sees a lot high student loan debt. Fannie Mae offers a way for more people to qualify to buy a home.This is great because student loan debt is a real problem in the U.S. Finally, the government stepped in with the Fannie Mae program to actually help people with student debt get into a home.If you have any questions about how to qualify for a home loan, make sure you contact Jayson at 801-638-1005 or sternteamlending@vfund.com.As always, if you have any Salt Lake City real estate questions, please donât hesitate to reach out to the Stern Team.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "What is radon gas and where does it come from?Radon gas is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, radioactive gas that is formed during the natural breakdown of uranium in soil, rock, and water. Radon exits the ground and can seep into your home through cracks and holes in the foundation. Radon gas can also contaminate well water.Radon gas is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States. The first leading cause of lung cancer is of course smoking, which kills 120,000 people every year. Radon kills anywhere from 20,000 to 22,000 people per year.At what level should you be concerned about radon gas? There is no safe level of radon gas. However, the U.S. EPA has indicated that any home that tests four picocuries per liter should be mitigated. If there are less than four picocuries, you are still at risk for lung cancer. Again, there is no safe level.âThere is no safe level of radon gas.âHow can you test for radon gas? Testing for radon gas is very simple. You can test the home yourself, or you can have a professional test the home. When selling a home, a third-party tester is recommended to get a non-partial, certified test.Are there any myths about radon gas people should be aware of? There are actually a number of myths and misinformation out there. For example, people will say they did a radon test but the home was closed up for a month, giving them an inaccurate test. However, radon has a half-life of three-and-a-half days, so even if a home is vacant for a month, the test will be accurate.If you have any questions for Dave you can send him an email at dave@hometekutah.com or give me call at (801) 673-5050.As always, if you have any questions for me or are looking to buy or sell a home, please donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "When you sell your house, there are six mistakes that can sink your sale. Hereâs how to avoid them:1. Donât go it alone: Use a Realtor to help you because 90% of home sales in 2016 took place with one. The National Association of Realtors found last year that homes sold by their owner fetched an average of $210,000 while homes sold with a Realtor sold for $249,000. They sold faster, too.2. Donât decide on an agent based on the price they tell you theyâll sell your house for: Instead, ask them their strategy for marketing your home.3. Donât trust automated values: Theyâre easy to find on Zillow or Trulia, but since Utah is a non-disclosure state, itâs impossible for them to see comparable home sales. We often find these values are much higher or lower than your homeâs true market value, so make sure you get a complete equity evaluation.âBuyers are sensitive to a homeâs presentation.â4. Have professional photos of your home taken: 100% of buyers will decide whether they want to see your home in person based on what they see online, and they gravitate toward great photos. Donât try to take listing photos with an iPhone! Waiting an extra week for a professional photographer is well worth it.5. Donât ignore your agentâs request for some fixes around the home: You might want to consider staging as well, or at a minimum, a deep clean. Buyers are sensitive to a homeâs presentation and they have no imagination.6. Donât refuse to negotiate: You might receive low offers and itâs easy to get offended, but always send a counteroffer, even if itâs just $100 off of your list price. You always want to keep things moving forward. Drawing a line in the sand sends a message to the buyer that youâre not really interested in selling. Instead, say something like, âI really appreciate you taking the time to put an offer together, but unfortunately, it doesnât allow us to exit the property with what we need. So, weâd like to give you a counteroffer back at XX.âAs always, give me a call or send me an email if you have any questions or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home in Salt Lake County.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Some people think that all real estate agents are Realtors. What makes a Realtor different than a real estate agent?A career in real estate is complicated enough, and many brokerages require their agents to become Realtors, but itâs not legally required. So, your Realtor is a real estate agent or an affiliated professional who is also a member of the National Association of Realtors, or the NAR for short. Realtors are located all across the world, and if you ask them what sets them apart from a regular real estate agent, theyâll point out being held to a higher standard.That higher standard is called the Realtor Code of Ethics. If you can believe, real estate agents were considered peddlers way back in the early 1900s. When they agree to become a Realtor, they must agree to conduct their business in a way that adheres to the NAR Code of Ethics, which covers ethical requirements that deal with all aspects of the job from working with consumers and fellow agents to creating truthful advertising.Multiple listing services (or MLS) are groups of local agents who have banded together in order to share listings more effectively. Most of these groups are affiliated with their state and national Realtor associations, and typically require all MLS agents to become members of both those groups. Agents pay dues to their state and to local Realtor organizations, and they may also pay fees to maintain their membership with local MLSs. Realtors can also be held accountable for their actions; you can file a complaint against another Realtor, and the organization accepts complaints from consumers, as well. Complaints can affect membership status, and at times, fines can be levied against members who have been involved in wrongdoings.âRealtors are held to a higher standard and a code of ethics.âLicenses in the U.S. are granted by each state and only the state can revoke it. Complaints are first assessed by a grievance committee, which is made up of volunteers. The group doesnât establish whether the complaint is valid or true, but rather determines if the facts as stated are true and whether there could be a violation or the Code of Ethics. If the answer is yes, a hearing date is established. A complaint is generally based on a possible violation of an article of the Code of Ethics. During the hearing, the Realtor can obtain legal counsel and will get an opportunity to present their side. The verdict is final and if the Realtor is found guilty, the punishment can include temporary or permanent revocation of benefits or could include a monetary fine.Now, Realtors also have to continue their educationâall licensed agents are required to take continuing education courses approved by their state licensing board, and to retain membership in the NAR, Realtors must take additional continuing education classes, which are often focused on ethical work habits and other consumer protection topics. Realtors must complete an ethics course every two years.If you have any other questions about what sets Realtors apart from regular real estate agents, donât hesitate to give us a call.

        "content": "Springâs nearly here and as a homeowner, itâs an exciting time to get your home ready. Many parts of the house might have been neglected or unused over the winter since youâre staying inside for most of the season, so itâs important to get out and check on these things.The first thing you should check on is your hose bibs. If you left your hose open over the winter, you could have frozen or cracked pipes. Before you turn the bib back on, remove the hose and turn on the waterâif no water comes out, you could have an issue with a cracked or broken pipe, which could leak into your house. You can also have someone inside the house look at the spot where the bib comes into the house while you turn the water on to make sure.Outside your home, take a look at any caulking around the windows and doors, as well as the condition of the weather stripping around windows. Now is also a good time to wash away any winter muck from the windows as well.âSpring is a great time for your annual HVAC service, which you may need to maintain the warranty.âWhile youâre at it, take a look at your shingles and roof. If you noticed any big icicles in any areas of your house during the wintertime, it could be a sign of ice damming. In that case, you might want to put additional insulation around the eaves where the icicles occurred.Also take a look to see if your gutters need to be re-secured to your house or cleaned. Finally, put some accordion-style downspout extenders on to keep the water away from the foundation.Inside your home, now is a great time to change your HVAC filter and have the system serviced. Many people donât realize that if you donât have them serviced annually, you can actually void the warranty.Lastly, take a look in your attic for any water stains on the sheathing. You could have cracked or corroded vent pipes, or you might need to add flashing to your roof where two gable ends meet.If you have any questions about refreshing your home this spring or youâre thinking of selling your home in the Salt Lake area, give me a call or send me an email.

Where has this left homebuyers and sellers?Whatâs been happening the last 60 days across the Wasatch Front market?Single-family homes are entering market much more slowly than buyers would like. Only 1,532 have been listed since January 1st. Compare that to the nearly 25,000 homes that sold in 2016 and you can understand their frustration.Pair that with the fact that 2,204 homes have moved into pending status (meaning the offer was accepted between the buyer and seller and itâs waiting to close) since the beginning of the year and you can see there are a lot more homes going off the market than coming onto it. 2,538 homes have sold since the beginning of the year, which means weâve had a total of 4,742 homes that were for sale come off the market.Moving into the condo and townhome market, we see a similar pattern in that we have an undersupply of inventory. There are 557 condos and townhomes currently for sale, with 752 in a pending status. 750 condos and townhomes have sold since the beginning of the year.All markets are driven by supply and demand. In real estate, itâs considered a level market when there is a four- to six-month supply of homes available. We currently have about aÂ 1.5-month supply of single-family homes. This favors the seller considerably. We also have about 1.75-month supply of townhomes and condos. This too favors sellers.âOur market favors sellers right now.âIf you are a buyer in this market, hire an agent who either has immediate access to homes that come on the market that fit your criteria or knows about homes getting ready to be listed, which we call pre-list properties.On our team, we call this our VIP Buyer System, which guarantees our clients priority access to all listings from all brokerages. They also have advanced notice of our pre-list properties as well as a full-time buyerâs agent whose only job is to get them in front of these homes and weed out the competition.If you are a seller, this may be your time to shine. Take advantage of staging and get professional photos taken. You only get once chance at a first impression, and almost all buyers start looking for homes online.Be sure your agent launches the home live on the market to all buyers at the same time and has a grand opening that weekend. That way, all interested buyers have an equal opportunity to view your home. This also ensures you wonât have to show your home weeks or months at a time and increases the likelihood that youâll generate multiple offers and create an auction-like environment to sell your home for the most amount of money possible.If you have any other questions about our market or are looking to buy or sell a home, feel free to call me or send me an email.

        "content": "Today I am joined by Fred Larsen from Pillar to Post Home Inspection to answer some common questions about home inspections. So what should you expect when youâre inspecting?The most common issues found during home inspections are water related. Water can get into the house by grading and draining from the exterior, rain gutters leaking, leaking around flashing, and through improperly installed roofing and siding materials.If you are looking to sell a home, a good first step is to get your gas appliances checked and serviced to make sure that they are safe for use. Of course, itâs also a good idea to address any of the water issues previously mentioned. Take care of anything you know needs to be taken care of before the inspector gets to your home.Getting your home pre-inspected also boasts a ton of benefits. Doing so will save you lots of time and money. Also, when your home in under contract, it will save you the headache of trying to scramble to get everything fixed or repaired during the due diligence period.âIf youâre a buyer, get the inspection done as early as possible.âIf youâre a buyer ordering a home inspection, make sure to get it done early in the due diligence period. There may be some things that the inspector finds that youâll want to be checked out further. Also, make sure you find a good home inspector by asking your agent for referrals and interviewing potential hires. Itâs always a good idea to ask for a sample report, as well.Itâs important to understand that a home inspection is a visual inspection. Home inspectors donât tear things apart or dig through walls, and there are things they canât see. Fred and his team try to be as thorough as possible, though; they cover up to 1,600 items.Keep in mind that Utah does not require a license to do home inspections, so make sure you get an experienced and qualified home inspector.If you have any further questions for Fred or youâd like to schedule an inspection, you can reach him at 801-281-0484 or go to saltlake.pillartopost.com.If you have any questions about buying or selling a Salt Lake City home, give me a call or send me an email.

Thatâs 29,000 single family homes that have sold, which is very strong. In fact, our strongest sales year was in 2006 when 29,300 homes were sold.Our average sale price along the Wasatch Front in 2015 was $285,250 and in 2016 it is just over $305,000, which is a 7% increase. If we adjust for inflation, we are actually above pre-recession pricing.Condos and townhomes have been off the charts. There has been an 18% increase in sales between 2015 and 2016. 2015 was already a record year, so this year has been phenomenal.First-time home buyers should buy before a rate increase.âFirst-time home buyers should buy before a rate increase.âIf we look at the average price of these properties, the condos and townhomes in the Wasatch Front area were $193,000, a 5% increase year over year.So what might 2017 look like? Utahâs economy remains one of the strongest in the country, and the number of families that are moving into the state remains one of the highest in the nation. The average age of our residents is 29, which is also the average age of a first-time home buyer. Therefore, we anticipate that we are going to continue to see strong sales, but not record breaking sales. However, something is going to happen with interest rates.Predictions for 2017 are widely varied. They are dependent on world events, the incoming presidency, and signs of a recovering economy. All of those factors will influence the direction of mortgage rates in the new year.We know that rates have been on the rise for the last 30 days, and the FED has been fairly clear about their intention to raise rates even more. So what does this mean for home buyers? A 1% increase in mortgage rates equates to a 10% increase in the cost of a home over a 30-year loan. Even more unfortunate, itâs predicted that if we have a 1% increase in rates, 18% of first-time home buyers will no longer be able to afford a home.

        "content": "Should you sell your home during the holidays? I believe the answer is yes, and here are the top six reasons why:      You will face less competition. There are fewer sellers on the market this time of year, which means your home will have fewer homes to compete with. One of the common myths in real estate is that you should wait until school is out to put your home on the market. The thing is, that is exactly what most people will do. You can get an edge over the competition by listing when there is only a handful of other properties on the market.        Buyers are serious. In the spring and summer, some buyers are just getting their feet wet and trying to decide whether or not they want to buy a house. In the wintertime, buyers are strapping on their snow boots and coming to your house because they are ready to buy today. It wonât take as many showings to find the right buyer in the winter.        Homes show really well this time of year. Nothing says home like the holidays. All consumer decisions are based on emotions first and are then justified by logic, so people become very emotionally attached to holiday themes. They envision having their family in your house over the holidays and cozying up to the fire with their family. Another way to appeal to buyersâ emotions is to bake some apple pie, cookies, or bread. These scents bring back memories and create a positive attraction to your home.âBuyers are ready to purchase your home right away!â        Buyers have more time off at this time of year. Everyone takes time off during the holidays, which gives buyers more time to look at your home. They will be able to make it to more daytime showings, which works great for sellers and makes things easier for buyers who have to work those tough 9-to-5 jobs.        There will be more competition after the holidays.Â If you are planning on selling your home, do it during the holidays. Most sellers will wait until right after the holidays to put their home on the market. In the second week of January, there will be a surge of homes on the market. My recommendation to you is to list now and beat the surge.        You can sell now but move after the holidays. You can put your property on the market in November, get a contract in December, and then you have 35 to 45 days before the buyer moves in. That means you can spend the holidays in your home and be secure in the knowledge that you have a contract on your home.  There are many benefits to putting your home on the market during the holiday season. If you have any questions about getting your home ready for the market or about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

        "content": "Itâs that time of year, folks â winter is coming. Itâs going to get cold. Now is the time to harvest what is left of your garden, winterize your sprinklers, and cozy up at home with your friends and family.That said, there are three huge mistakes that can cost homeowners thousands of dollars. Luckily, you can easily avoid these mistakes by properly winterizing your home.First of all, make sure that you buy a $2 protector for your outdoor faucet. Itâs amazing how much damage a little bit of ice can do. Ice can cause pipes to explode or leak into your basement. Just an inch of water in your basement can cost up to $15,000 to pump out and dry. All you have to do to prevent this disaster is buy one of those protectors and take your hoses off of your faucets.Now, I know everyone loves Instagramming icicles, but donât just take your pictures and leave the icicles on your roof. If there are icicles hanging off your roof, then you probably have ice damming issues. Basically, when the ice melts, the water has nowhere else to go. Ice damming can cause serious damage to your roof, which costs thousands of dollars to repair. Not only that, icicles are also safety hazards; it can be very dangerous to walk beneath some of those huge icicles we get here in Salt Lake County.âA little ice can cause a lot of big, costly problems for your home.âIf you notice that you have ice damming, you can pay a few hundred dollars to have someone come out and steam the ice away. You can even rent one of those steamers yourself. I also recommend installing a little extra insulation around the eaves of your house, which is typically where ice damming occurs. Heat tape can also help you avoid ice damming and water damage, which will save you thousands of dollars.Finally, donât let cold air sneak into your home. If you add up all of the cracks in the average home, itâs like having a 3x3 foot window open at all times. Not only will that make for a cold winter, it will also cost you a lot of extra money in energy bills. Fortunately, you can head to a Loweâs or Home Depot and buy some caulk. Caulk comes in all kinds of different colors, so find the one that matches your home and fill up those exterior cracks. That way, you wonât have all of that cold air coming in through your windows, stucco, or doorframes.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "A couple of weeks ago, I did a market update for our local radio station KNRS. As I was preparing the data for the show, I realized that we had a tale of two markets on our hands.You see, if we look at the availability of all the housing types across the entire Wasatch Front under $300,000, we have about a three-month supply of homes available. In a real estate market, itâs considered a level market when you have between a four-to-six-month supply of homes available. When there are fewer than four months, itâs considered a sellerâs market. When there are more than six months, itâs considered a buyerâs market.âI want you to be able to win no matter what market youâre completing in.âIn any price point less than $300,000, then, itâs absolutely a sellerâs market. Here are three quick strategies you can use to help you compete if youâre a buyer in that market:  Be the first to know. Your agent should be able to match your specific home buying criteria so you can be the first to know about homes as they become available. This will allow you to weed out the competition and avoid multiple offer scenarios that may cause the price of the home to increase.  Get a full approval letter.  This will take you through parts of the underwriting process, and thatâs exactly what the seller wants to see. This will turn you into a cash buyer in the eyes of the seller and help you stand out from the competition.  Try using an escalation clause on the offer you write. For example, you could state that youâre willing to offer X amount of dollars higher than the highest net offer the seller receives, provided the cost doesnât exceed a certain price.As I said, weâre experiencing a tale of two markets. The other market Iâm referring to is all the housing types above $500,000, in which there is a 10-month supply of homes. This, obviously, is a buyerâs market. Here are three tips you can use if youâre a seller to ensure your home priced more than $500,000 sells fast and for the most amount of money:  Boost your curb appeal. Itâs a fact of lifeâeveryone judges a book by its cover. Make sure the front doorâs got a fresh coat of paint on it and the landscaping looks good. Take photos now if youâre planning on listing over the winter.  Stage the home. Clear off all the flat surfaces in the property of everything other than decorative items. Clean lines show the property, and itâs the property youâre selling, not the stuff. Flat surfaces run vertically as well as horizontally, so make sure both surfaces are cleared of all clutter.  Price the home right. Be sure to use accurate comparables within your micro-market and view those comparables through the eyes of the buyer.Regardless of what tale our market is telling, I want you to win. If you have any questions, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!",

        "content": "We recently sold a property for more than list price in less than two weeks. Prior to working with us, these clients had their home on the market for over six months before the listing expired.During that time, the property had six showings and no offers, so the sellers were understandably frustrated. When they were referred to us, I told them exactly what they needed to do to get the property sold.The first thing you need to understand is curb appeal. If you look at the video above, you will see before and after pictures of the property. I had the clients paint the exterior of this beautiful log home because the photos from the original listing showed that the home had deferred maintenance. Everybody on the Internet judges a book by its cover, so your home needs to look good.Imagine going to an expensive restaurant and paying $50 for a plate of food. That plate of food will come out looking good, and because it looks good, itâs going to taste better. The same principle applies to buying a home.If you look at the video above, you will see a couple of interior photos as well. Before, the property had not been staged. I found that the clients were more than happy to stage the home but their prior agent didnât give them any direction on what to do or how to do it. We went room by room and staged the property correctly. For instance, we referred them to our countertop guy so they could finish updating the kitchen. It cost $1,500 to replace the countertops and they look great.âAlways look at comparable properties to see if the property is fairly priced.âWhen you look at a listing online, after the exterior photos, the buyer should see a picture of the kitchen, the master bedroom, and the master bathroom in exactly that order. Those three rooms are the most important to buyers and most buyers will only look at your listing for a little bit, so you need to post photos of those rooms up front in order to grab their attention.We are incredibly grateful to these clients. They did everything that we asked them to do. We launched the property using our grand opening technique and, as a result, we sold this property in fewer than two weeks.If you have any questions about the home selling process or if youâre having trouble selling your property, give us a call or send us an email.

        "title": "Do You Want to Buy a Fixer-Upper?",
        "author": "liz@getvyral.com",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I have a few tips for buying a home that needs work. There are different types of fixer-uppers out there and some need more work than others. The way you pursue a purchase offer on the home most likely depends on which fixer-upper category it is in.Most sellers realize that a home needs work when they put it up on the market and have already accounted for that when they priced the home. I have yet to find a seller who is willing to subsidize a buyerâs home improvement dreams, yet that doesnât stop buyers from trying to get a discount on an already discounted price. It is very important to look at comparable properties in order to determine whether a fixer-upper has been priced correctly.Now, letâs talk about the different types of fixer-upper homes.First, you have your basic fixer-upper. Fixer-upper homes are generally priced for sale as-is. These homes often have deferred maintenance items or other minor repairs that the sellers either arenât willing to fix or cannot afford to fix. When you make an offer on these properties, have your buyerâs agent pull comparables for other fixer-upper properties to see how the price stacks up. That way, you are comparing apples to apples.On the other hand, you may be interested in a mint condition vintage house. Although these properties are not modernized, they can be very desirable. Mid-century modern houses have made a real comeback recently; other vintage houses include Victorians or Craftsman bungalows. Generally, the seller will add a premium price pad due to the area and architectural uniqueness of the property.Usually, the interior of a vintage property will be in incredible condition. However, they can look very outdated. When you write an offer on this kind of property, be aware that there may be a premium price to pay for the uniqueness of the property. Make sure that you look at other similar homes and compare the listing price to those that have already sold.Another kind of fixer-upper is the newer home that may be outdated. Lots of subdivisions have homes that were built in 1995; these sellers know there are newer homes out there, but still price their homes as if they are brand new. That is unfortunate because a lot of the trends from the 90s â like hunter green carpeting â are not popular today. Some of these sellers may be priced above where they should be, so again, make sure to look at comparable properties. When you send your offer in, send along the list of work it would take to modernize the home and include how much it would cost to do all of that work. That way, the seller can see things from your perspective.âAlways look at comparable properties to see if the property is fairly priced.âA lot of buyers think they will get a good deal when it comes to buying a foreclosure property, but thatâs not always the case. Banks will usually not lower the purchase price on a foreclosure property within the first 30 days. Foreclosures normally come with other rules beyond that. For example, after 30 days, the bank may lower the price by 3%. If 60 days go by without an offer, they may lower the price again by another 3%.You should also make sure to do a title check on foreclosed properties because the banks have not occupied these properties. The bank should have cleared any hidden liens on the property, but it is still a good idea for you to work with a good title company and pull a complete title report.If you are interested in a short sale, you need to know that there is nothing short about them. Short sale transactions can take a lot of time to close. Since the seller cannot afford to make the payments on the home, they also cannot afford to do any work on the property, so short sale homes are often sold as-is.You should also be aware that the price an agent sets for a short sale property is not always accepted by the bank. The bank will do an independent appraisal on a short sale property to ensure that it will be sold at market value. Donât be lured in by the price on the MLS system unless it says that the price has been previously approved by a third party. More often than not, thatâs the price the bank is willing to accept.Finally, you may want to buy a âpackratâ house. If you have ever watched Hoarders, you know that these houses have stuff stacked up to the ceiling and aisles to get from room to room. The challenge with these properties is not that there is a lot of stuff in the house (which makes it hard to visualize what youâre going to do with the property, though), but that there is a monstrous amount of deferred maintenance that needs to be addressed.Again, it helps to look at other distressed properties to see if the packrat house is priced correctly. It is especially important in this case because you wonât know how much work the property really needs until you get a home inspector in there. Keep in mind that if all of that stuff in the home is still in the way, the home inspector wonât be able to do their job thoroughly. Consider extending your due diligence period and require the seller to allow access to all visible parts of the interior of the property before the home inspection.The number one thing to keep in mind when purchasing a house that needs some work is to look at comparable sales. You can then deduct the price of the work thatâs needed based on estimates from licensed contractors. If that adjusted price lines up with the listing price, you might need to pay the listing price to purchase that fixer-upper.If you have any questions about fixer-upper properties or need to get in touch with a licensed contractor to fix up your property, just give us a call or send us an email.

The analogy weâve come up with makes a lot of sense, and we hope it will help shine some new light on the process for you if youâve been thinking about selling.For this analogy, letâs say we are starting with the ball right on our own one-yard line. There are 99 yards between you and the goal line. Once an offer is accepted, youâve made it to midfield.An offer will be contingent on a few things, including due diligence. Due diligence is basically any type of inspection a buyer wants to do. We know that 24% of contracts fail and 80% of those are due to due diligence. The buyer could decide they donât want to buy at this point for pretty much any reason.The good news is that once weâve made it past due diligence, we are in the red zone. Good offense so far, but youâre not quite there yet. Now the offer is contingent upon the financing going through.Your buyer should already be pre-approved by a lender; however, that still doesnât mean they will get the loan. The âdefenseâ in this situation is underwriting. Itâs a secret weapon that is going to look for every reason not to lend the buyer money, so certain things can come up.ââA good agent will be in contact with the lender who issued the pre-approval to ask certain questions to see if they will be able to pay. You want to find out as much as you can up front about their financing.After the financing hurdle has been cleared, you are on the 10-yard line. The offer is now contingent upon the appraisal. In the last couple of years weâve had more and more issues with appraisals because the market is improving. Homes still have to appraise for buyers to be able to purchase. If you get a bad appraisal, you do have options to remedy it without throwing the deal away.After youâre through the appraisal, you are at the five-yard line. The final hurdle is the settlement table. This is where we sign all the documents with the title company to be able to transfer the deed into the buyerâs name. It usually happens a week or two after the appraisal.Bad things can happen, like a medical emergency or the buyer losing their job, but itâs not likely. Now you are at the one-yard line, and the property must fund in order for the seller to receive the money and the buyer to get the deed. Once that has happened, you are in the end zone!

        "content": "When updating or renovating your home, you may be under the impression that making major renovations to your property will net you more money on the appraisal. This may not always be the case. In fact, some improvements may not increase your homeâs value at all, leaving you with a sunk cost. In an effort to help you avoid this situation, Iâd like to share with you seven home improvements that will not add to the value of your home.      Extensive professional landscaping. You may not recoup the cost of that koi pond and waterfall in your backyard. Realize that major outdoor features like these are personal aesthetic choices, and that a future buyer may not share your same vision or want to pay for the maintenance of those choices.        Upgraded electrical or plumbing. Odds are, your neighbors have already upgraded to copper plumbing and have probably already updated their electrical systems as well. These improvements are only considered to be ones that bring a property up to modern standards, so theyâre not likely to increase the value of your home.        New roof, gutters, sprinklers or HVAC. These are all major systems of a property since they can last for over 10 years. The reality is that it is unlikely that the appraiser is going to add any value to your property, since these are the kinds of systems that the buyer is going to expect are already in great working order at the time of purchase.    Swimming pool. Here in Utah, swimming pools and other water features like hot tubs are not all that common, and some buyers may have a problem with that. This is called functional obsolescenceâsomething about the property that you will not get back from a value standpoint.âPainting your home is not likely to add value in an appraisal.â      Making dated improvements. Upgrading to white appliances or white ceramic countertops might seem like a great idea because they are newer to you, but these decisions may deter some potential younger buyers, since theyâll see those as âdated updates.â If you have questions on which improvements to make or not make, ask me!        Painting your home. While painting your home can actually freshen up the property and strengthen its appeal, it is not likely to add value in an appraisal; it may, however, increase the probability of it selling.    Solar panels. Regardless of the Kool-aid that the solar panel salespeople are selling you in regard to resale value, realize that an appraiser is not adding value for solar panels. Worse yet, if youâve financed solar panels, youâll probably have to pay them off at the time of sale, which is something that probably was not disclosed to you when you purchased them.If you have any questions about what to do or what not to do in order to get your home sold for the most amount of money possible, please give me a call or shoot me an email and Iâd be happy to answer.",

Most agents are advising their clients to hold off on responding to offers until after the first weekend theyâve listed, in which an open house will often be held.This benefits buyers because many can only go out to look at homes on weekends when they donât have to work. It gives everyone equal footing to get into the property and enough time to prepare financing. The seller benefits as well because they donât have to show the property as much and can get all the offers around the same time.When youâre responding to an offer as a seller, you do have four different options:  Accept the offer.  Make a counter-offer.  Reject the offer.  No response to the offer.âYou want to be gracious, not forceful.â That being said, a seller really isnât going to ignore an offer unless itâs blatantly ridiculous. The real key to getting your offer accepted is understanding timing. Maybe the seller is waiting for other offers to come in before deciding because they just listed. However, if the home has been on the market for a month or more, the seller is probably very anxious to get an offer.I recommend that you call the sellerâs agent and ask them what would be enough time for a response.

Itâs considered a level market when you have a four to six month supply of homes.If thereâs less than four months of supply, itâs a sellerâs market. Likewise, a more than six month of supply of homes gives us a buyerâs market. âYou need a strong Realtor to help you navigate this market.âSo letâs take a look at the Wasatch Frontâs supply of single-family homes (excluding townhomes and condos). Right now we have a 4.4 month supply of homes available. Seems like weâd be in a level market, right? Not so fast.If we look at homes by price range, we only have a 3.4 month supply of homes on the market under $350,000. If we look at homes under $250,000, we have just 2.75 months of supply. This poses a real challenge for first-time homebuyers, as theyâre finding they are competing with multiple offers for almost all of the well-priced homes under $350,000.For that reason, weâre seeing condos and townhomes really take off as affordable housing for first-time homebuyers. In this market, we only have a 3.78 month supply of such homes along the Wasatch Front. As a result, weâre seeing buyers try to tie up homes to lock out the competition - sometimes without even seeing the inside of the home before writing an offer! This allows people to lock up a property even though they sometimes cancel the offer down the road after finding a better option. Weâre seeing a lot of this right now.If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!",

        "content": "There are eight things that we feel you can do to compete to get the home you want in the Wasatch market.  Be informed. If thereâs a specific neighborhood, community, or builder youâre interested in, start researching and following them on social media and set up Google alerts. The first line of defense is to know whatâs going on so you can act fast.  Register your name on the internet list. Most of the communities and builders will reach out to those who have interest on their internet lists. Youâll receive news about model homes, property releases, and other updates. If you want to be the first to know, make sure the community or builder knows about you.  Work with a Realtor. We have the inside track and in many cases will be able to alert you to important news before the public is aware of it.  Make a friend. It doesnât hurt to make friends with a sales agent in a community because theyâre great resources for details that other people might not be aware of.  Get pre-approved for a loan. If youâre not pre-approved and you go to buy, you could lose out to someone who is pre-approved.  Check for financing options through the builder. Sometimes builders will provide incentives for using their lender, like assistance with closing costs or money towards upgrades at the design center.  Talk to your Realtor about options and upgrades. Model homes will likely be very upgraded and full of options that raise the price beyond the base price of the property. Having an idea of the options and upgrades that you want will be important for you to know upfront to make sure you can qualify for that loan and still be within the payment youâre comfortable with.  Familiarize yourself with the community and the properties. Intense community interest can cloud judgement and create a frenzy. You never know which line youâll be in for a home. It could be the home youâre dreaming of, and itâs gone by the time you get to the front of the line! Knowing the community well will help you make an informed choice when the time comes.âRealtors have the inside track on many new homes.âIf you or anyone you know has any real estate questions, email me or give me a call!",

        "content": "Today, we are going to talk about inspecting your sewer line before you buy your home, especially if you are buying an older property.The last thing you want to do is spend an additional $2,500 to $10,000 after youâve moved into your new house to accommodate a sewer line problem. I recommend having a small operation inspect the sewer line with their cameras. Large franchise operations tend to recommend replacing the entire sewer line, which is just more money in their pockets.One problem you might encounter is tree roots growing into sewer lines. Roots crawl into tiny openings and expand in the sewer line, latching onto other debris that typically cause backups, such as grease or eggshell waste. Sometimes chemicals can kill the tree roots. However, if the roots reappear, the pipe may be damaged and require excavation to fix the problem. Another option is to have the lines snaked once or twice a year to avoid backup.Another common problem is a belly in the sewer line. A belly is a low area or sag in the sewer line that has lost its positive slope for drainage. This can be caused by a number of factors.  It should only be corrected if the belly is truly causing an actual problem, not just lacking perfection for a short distance. A low area holding a half-inch or so of water for 3 or 4 feet is likely not going to cause a major problem. Consult a licensed plumber after having the sewer line scoped to determine how much of an issue the belly really is.âYou need to get your sewer lines inspected.âIf youâre buying an older home, those sewer lines were often installed in sections or segments. When a connected section does not line up perfectly with the other it is considered âoff-setâ. Not all instances of âoff-settingâ are a problem. Avoid evaluations from large franchise companies and look to a reputable licensed plumber to determine the extent of the issue.Older homes also tend to have sewer lines made of clay or cast iron, which erodes from the inside. Not all older sewer systems will need replacement anytime soon, and not all systems will need a full replacement. You can get away with partial replacement.Again, because the cost of sewer line replacement is high, we recommend you have your sewer line examined by a professional via camera as part of your home inspection process. Then have a good professional plumber take a look at it.If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!",

        "content": "If you make an offer on a home on The Wasatch Front, thereâs always a chance it will get rejected. To decrease the chances of getting your offer rejected, we are going to give you four different reasons why your offer could get rejected.      Your offer price was too low.Sellers can easily feel insulted if a buyer offers too little for their home. They may believe the buyer isnât serious and may even reject the offer outright. If the house just came on the market, itâs much too early for sellers to look at lowball offers or even offers that are more than 5% below asking price.        The buyerâs agent is a jerk.They may scream or raise their voice on the phone, make demands and ultimatums, or insult the listing agent by printing out comparables and inferring that they donât know what they are doing. Whenever a buyerâs agent fails to show professionalism, thatâs bad.        The listing agent represents a competing buyer.A little known agent practice among consumers is the variable or dual-rate commission. This is something that the listing agent has up-front with their sellers. During discussions, the listing agent might say that if they are representing a buyer that ends up purchasing the home, they will take less on their commission. If youâre competing for a home, and the listing agent wrote an offer for another buyer, youâre at a disadvantage. On our MLS in Utah, you can look to see if there is a variable-rate commission on the home. You can always call them and ask as well.        The buyer didnât meet the sellerâs specific needs.The buyerâs agent should always call the listing agent to find out whatâs important to the seller. Itâs not always about the price. If the seller needs a longer escrow period or settlement time, write it in the offer. If they want more earnest money, give them more earnest money. Do whatever you can to stand out in the sellerâs mind. It will help you get the home.  Thanks for joining us today.

Thatâs when the title of the property is transferred from the seller to the buyer. Closing costs are incurred by either the buyer or the seller or, sometimes, both.Typically, home buyers will pay between 2% and 5% of the purchase price of the home in closing fees. These fees include wiring fees, hazard insurance, and priming your escrow account for property taxes, title insurance, appraisal, underwriting, and processing fees.âIn todayâs market, sellers arenât paying closing costs.âThe Wasatch Front market is hot right now, and buyers who try to make the seller pay for closing costs are losing out. There are a lot of multiple offer situations, and buyers are offering to cover closing costs in order to get the home.One way to position yourself to win in a multiple offer situation is to get a premium priced loan. The lender bumps up the interest rate by 0.25% or 0.50%.

        "content": "Today, weâre going to talk about what not to do when selling in the surrounding Salt Lake County area.First of all, donât set an unrealistic price. The market is hot right now, so it can be tempting to set an extremely high price for your home. However, buyers are well-educated and know the difference between an accurately priced property and an overpriced one.Overpriced properties sit on the market for a long time. Buyers start to wonder whatâs wrong with those properties. The longer a home sits on the market, the less money you will get. Accurately priced homes actually draw in multiple offers and create a bidding war situation, which drives the price up.âOverpricing your home costs you time and money.âAnother mistake people make is selling without an agent. The National Association of Realtors reports on average, For Sale By Owner properties sell for 12% less compared to homes sold with an agent. Thatâs a lot of money, and itâs less expensive than paying a commission for an agent to sell your home. You will also save time by hiring an agent because selling a home is a full-time job.Not marketing your home is not a good idea. Quicker access to more buyers means your home sells for more money in less time. Your listing agent has a sophisticated marketing plan that will cast the biggest net possible for buyers.Finally, donât skip repairs. According to NAR, 24% of all offers accepted between buyers and sellers fail, and 80% of those fail due to the inspection contingency. If you have deferred maintenance, fix it. The buyer will choose their own preferred vendors, which could cost you more money than it would to hire some people and take care of things on your own.",

Remember, the front door is the first impression a buyer has of your home, so you should repaint or restain it if necessary.  Roof. Make sure that the roof is leak-free and in great shape.

        "title": "7 Deadly Mistakes for Salt Lake County Home Sellers",
        "author": "Emily Peterson",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Selling your home is one of the most important steps in your financial life. Today, weâll go over the seven deadly mistakes most home sellers make. Knowing these mistakes will help you maximize your profits, maintain control, reduce stress, and help you make good decisions with your moving goals.Failing to analyze why you are selling. We encourage you to have a very clear motivation when it comes to the decision to sell your home. Many home sellers simply arenât clear on why they are selling their homes, and try to sell for the wrong reasons.  Not preparing your home for the buyerâs eyes. You have one chance to make a good first impression. Nearly all buyers begin their home search online, so pictures are incredibly important. Work closely with your agent to stage the property, and consider hiring a professional photographer to take photos of your home.  Pricing your home incorrectly. Everyone wants to get the most amount of money for their home as possible. Unfortunately, many buyers are unrealistic about their homeâs value. If a home is priced too high, it tends to sit on the market for a long time, causing buyers to wonder whatâs wrong with it. By the time you decide to adjust the price, it is often too late to get a quality buyer. Pricing your home correctly right out of the gate saves you time, money, and reduces time on the market.  Selling too hard during showings. Nothing is more awkward for buyers than having a personalized tour of the home by the seller. Buyers make decisions based on their emotions first, and then justify the decision with logic. A buyer is unable to emotionally attach to a home when a seller gives them the grand tour. Step back and let your agent handle the showings.  Signing a long-term listing agreement without a written performance guarantee. Unfortunately, some agents have a tendency to over-promise and under-deliver. If you sign with that agent, the only time youâll hear from them is when they want to reduce the sales price. You should never get stuck in an agreement without a written guarantee of performance or a cancellation contract that allows you to get out of the contract if you are unhappy with the agentâs performance.  Making it difficult for the buyers to get information on their homes. Buyers are three times more likely to inquire about a home when thereâs no risk of feeling obligated. This means they donât want to have to call you or your agent to get information on the home. Make it easy to get information on your property instantly and free of charge.  Failing to obtain a pre-approved mortgage buyer. You donât want to get stuck with a buyer whoâs unable to get a loan. The first 5 weeks you are on the market are the most important, so you donât want to be under contract for 45 days and find out that the buyer is unable to get financing. Do your due diligence. Make sure the buyer has a full approval letter, and check in with the lender to make sure they have verified all of the buyerâs information.If you have any questions about todayâs video, give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "Today, weâll talk about what rising interest rates mean for you as a buyer in the Wasatch Front.We know that the Federal reserve Chairman, Janet Yellen, has increased the Federal Reserve rate. What we also learned at that time was the chairman mentioned her plans to continue to gradually increase rates each quarter. The first rate increase was anticipated, so the market was able to absorb most of that increase without seeing much of a change to long term loans like 15 or 30 year mortgages. The next 3 increases will see a bigger impact on the 15-30 year mortgages.For our millennial home buyers, this is a bit of a challenge, as most of their young adult lives they have had rates at or just below the 4% mark. First thing to know is that the 42 year average for interest rates is 8.39%.  If we hit the reset button at 1990 the average interest rate is 6.6%.  All of my blog viewers over 40 are chuckling because they remember buying their first home at rates in the 8% to 15% range.We likely will see interest rates exceed 5% by the end of 2016.  Letâs suppose this is a 1% increase. This is how the 1% increase affects you as a home buyer on an averaged priced home along the Wasatch Front, which is about $275,000. Assuming the loan amount is the purchase price, the principal and interest payment for a 30 year loan at 4% is $1,312.89 if the interest rate goes up to 5% the principal and interest payment  goes to $1,476.26 or $163.37 more than the 4% rate which is about 11% more per month.Over the course of 30 years, a 4% loan with the original principal balance would be $197,642.  On a 30 year loan with a 5% interest rate the total amount paid in interest is $256,453 almost $59,000 more youâd pay in interest if interest rates go up by 1%.The thing to know is that interest rates will go up because they have to go up. When interest rates go up by 1% the cost of your home goes up by 10% or more. Another way of looking at this is that the home at $275,000 becomes the same cost as buying a home at $302,500.I hope this makes sense and helps you digest the affordability of housing now versus the affordability of housing in a historically average market.",

        "content": "There are 4 common strategies that most sellers use to price their homes. It is unwise to assume that a higher asking price will net you a higher selling price. In fact, this equation works in reverse if youâre not paying attention to what the market is telling you. Bear this research in mind when you set your asking price.      Clearly Overpriced â Every seller wants to get the most amount of money they can for their home, and real estate agents know this. If more than one agent is competing for your listing, an easy way to win the battle is to overinflate the value of your home. I can see this in our own market, which has been VERY good for sellers this year by looking at the fact that over 8,500 homes expired. Thatâs 27% of all home sellers who intended to sell and couldnât because of overpricing.        Somewhat Overpriced â About Â¾ of the homes on the market are 5-10% overpriced. These homes will sit on the market longer than you want. There is usually one of two factors at play here: either you believe in your heart that your home is really worth this much, despite what the market has indicated, OR youâve left some room for negotiation. Either way, this strategy will cost you both time on the market and, ultimately, the price that you receive from a buyer.        Priced Correctly at Market Value â Some sellers understand that real estate is part of the capitalistic system of supply and demand. These people carefully price their homes based on a thorough analysis of other homes on the market. These competitively priced homes usually sell within a reasonable time-frame and very close to the asking price.        Priced Below the Fair Market Value â Some sellers are motivated by a quick sale. These homes attract multiple offers and sell fast â usually in a few days â at, or above, the asking price. Be cautious that the agent suggesting this method is doing so with your best interests in mind.

        "content": "When the real estate market gets tough and youâve found a home that you absolutely love, then it might be time to take some drastic actions in order to secure it. I have three things that you can do to improve your chances of buying your dream home.      Make your offer âsharpâ: In Utah, putting down 1% or more in earnest money will make your offer more sincere, especially in a competitive environment. A seller needs to know that youâre serious about buying, and this is how you prove it to them.        Find out what sellerâs moving time frame. Sometimes a quick close seems like an obvious plus to a buyer, but what if the seller needs more time to move out? Consider writing an offer that allows a seller a short interim occupancy agreement that allows the seller to stay an extra week after settlement to help them get moved and eliminate the short term moving stress.        Donât get pre-qualified, get pre-approved: A pre-approval is what you need to stand out as a buyer, and with new TRID rules itâs actually the only designation you can have as a buyer. If youâre pre-approved, youâre on par with a cash buyer.        Keep short time frames on contingencies: Make the inspection and due diligence periods the acceptable length. It usually takes 14 days to complete the inspections and 21 days for the financial paperwork to be completed.        Write a personal letter to the seller: Explain to them why you should be their #1 choice. Tell them about your family and how much you admire the home. Pull on their heart strings a little bit and you could become their #1 choice. Then, have your agent make an offer in person to the seller and their listing agent. This is a powerful move, and it puts more gravity on your offer. Itâs an old school tactic, but sometimes it does the trick.        Ask your agent to present the offer in person. Going along with the emotional connections a seller has with a buyer, itâs much easier to represent you as a buyer when your agent is willing to meet the listing agent and the sellers on their turf. A little communication from your agent directly to the sellers can go a very long way in making a win-win relationship happen.  I have found these techniques to be very useful when the situation calls for it.

        "content": "Many people are getting ready to put their home on the market this holiday season, so today we wanted to talk about the most common mistakes when selling a home. We want you to avoid these when it comes time for you to sell, no matter what time of year it is. Hereâs what you need to avoid as a seller:      The home isnât readyNothing kills a transaction like a home thatâs unprepared for the market. Hereâs what you need to do to ensure your home is:          Declutter-  Decluttering is a big deal, but you already know that.      Flat surfaces- Make sure you clean off all flat surfaces, which include fridges, countertops, bookshelves, and more. Make sure they only have decorative items on them.      Curb appeal- Make sure to repaint your front door and remove any debris in your yard to help buyers feel more relaxed and comfortable when they walk into your home.      Pay special attention to the kitchen, master bedroom, and master bathroom.      There is nothing worse for your price than showing or photographing a home thatâs not ready.        Too many improvements          Most improvements that you make on your home should be for yourself and your family, because you enjoy them. Many donât generate a positive return. Even putting granite countertops in will only get you seventy cents back for every dollar you spend. Improvements also make things that are unimproved stand out like a sore thumb, which isnât good.        Not hiring the right people          This is one of the most common mistakes I see as a listing agent. After you sign a contract with an agent, itâs hard to get out of because you have to honor the contract. With our contracts, they are day-to-day, up-front, and in writing.      Donât make these mistakes! If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!",

        "author": "Emily Peterson",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today, weâll talk about the TRID Mortgage Disclosure Form, which affects both buyers and sellers. This new integrated disclosure rule is the Federal Governmentâs attempt to clean up and simplify the mortgage closing process. It helps make things easier to understand for buyers. The rule has a good basis, but it also has some unintended consequences for both parties.TRID has now gone into effect. Letâs talk about the good stuff first. Buyers will get the payment on the document signed at closing. We love the new look of this document, because buyers are always concerned with payment. It makes sense. Additionally, you will receive the closing documents directly from the lender, instead of the title company.However, there are some unintended consequences. For instance, changes in concession amounts by the buyer will require a mandatory three-day redisclosure by the lender. This means you canât change this just before the settlement deadline, before you purchase your new home. You have to do all of that in advance.Terms now are changing, which can cause confusion here in Utah. Previously, settlement was defined as closing in the Utah real estate purchase contract. Instead of settlement referring to the title company, it now refers to when everything is recorded. This could also be confusing because the Utah real estate purchase contract has not changed its verbiage and I believe the Federal Government will likely override the stateâs verbiage. Furthermore, we will use consummation now instead of settlement. Consummation refers to what happens when we submit documents to the title company.A change in loan will require a new six-day redisclosure. This is a big deal. Lenders will no longer send documents to the title company, but instead, prepare the documents for themselves. Many lenders are not prepared for this. An average escrow period will shift closer to 45 days, making thirty-day closings a thing of the past. Please note we do not advise accepting or writing an offer with a thirty-day settlement, unless the lender confidently fulfills the new rules. Our preferred vendor has assured us that theyâre able to stick within this thirty-day time frame.Thanks again for taking the time to watch our blog!

        "content": "Do rising interest rates affect home values on the Wasatch Front? The answer might surprise you.Many people are wondering whether they should sell now or wait until the spring season arrives. Hereâs something to think about if you are asking yourself that question: when interest rates increase, the purchasing power of buyers decreases. In fact, if interest rates increase by 1%, the market loses the bottom 18% of first-time home buyers.In addition to those changes, a 1% rise in interest rates makes your home 10% more expensive to the next buyer. Just recently, the Fed has decided to keep rates where they are, but Janet Yellen has made it clear that rates will slowly start creeping up soon. As it is, low interest rates are keeping buyers in the market, and sellers often sell their homes for more money and in less time.If youâre looking for certainty in the marketplace and want your best chance at getting top dollar for your home, now is the time to make your move.

        "content": "Today we are going to talk about real estate investing, crowdfunding style. This morning, when I woke up, I went online and researched crowdfunding in real estate. What I began to notice is that there are dozens of platforms for individuals to begin investing in real estate.Crowdfunding has a distinct advantage in the real estate investment world. Instead of having to invest $50,000-$100,000 of your own money, you can invest as little as $5,000 into an existing investment platform and begin to see returns.However, there are some downsides to this method. You donât get to choose your own properties, and you donât get to see them in person either. Itâs an elusive investment, like the stock market. Itâs something you canât physically see or touch, but itâs there.Thereâs another way to crowdfund in real estate. With local crowdfunding, Iâve had many real estate investors who have created an LLC involving multiple business partners looking to invest in real estate. Local crowdfunding offers some additional benefits that national crowdfunding doesnât.First, you get to choose your own partners. Secondly, you get to choose your own real estate agent. Third, you get to choose the property you buy, and it will be closer to home so you can go see it in person. Finally, you also get to choose the tenants, rental rate, and rental terms. You and your partners are in control of this transaction, and donât have to trust that someone else will make the right decision.If youâre thinking about crowdfunding on a local or national level and youâd like to talk about these options, I would love to talk. Just give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to speaking with you!",

        "title": "Why Should You Get a Home Inspection?",
        "author": "Emily Peterson",
        "category": "",
        "content": "I find most folks are willing to take a used car to a mechanic to look it over before they purchase the car. They probably spend about $150 to do this, and the car may cost between $5,000 and $10,000. So, why wouldnât you consider having your home inspected by a house âmechanicâ before spending $200,000 to $300,000?A professional home inspection can be done at a cost between $350 and $500. Your Realtor can write your contract up to be subject to these inspections. Here are some of the common items I see in inspections, and the costs associated with repairing or replacing any problems the home inspector finds:  Double tapping in the break panel. This usually means you have too many wires feeding into one circuit in your break box, which makes it a fire hazard. Resolving double tapping can cost between $75 and $150, but if the break panel is out of room, you would also need to add a distribution panel at a cost of $1,000.  Heating and Air Conditioning. I find most sellers arenât in the habit of servicing their HVAC systems yearly. This could be a hidden cost passed along to you, the buyer. Servicing the HVAC costs around $75 to $150. If the HVAC hasnât been serviced, you could end up with AC condenser issues ($3,000 to repair) or issues with the furnaceâs heat exchanger ($3,500 to repair). As you can see, servicing your HVAC systems avoids some costly problems down the road.  Attic and Crawl Space issues. This is where we find hidden problems never seen by the homeowner that can explode into large cost problems for you, the buyer, to fix.  Water seepage along the vent flues. Sometimes the rubber boots that go along the flues become cracked, and when it rains or snows, you get water in through those vents. That costs $50 to $100. Ice damming causes water damages along the eves of the property, which could cost $250 to $350 to fix. If water gets in and mold grows or the wood rots, then your repair costs would be thousands of dollars.These are just a few of the common issues we see during home inspections here in Utah. As you can see, an inspection pays for itself. Donât forget, always inspect!A good home inspector can save you lots of money and give you peace of mind. Feel free to email me. Weâll be happy to put you in touch with our own NASHI and ASHI certified home inspector.",

        "content": "Today weâve got a special guest joining us, Mandi Henriod of Veritas Funding who is going to talk to us about some guideline changes that are coming for FHA loans that you should be aware of. There are two things you really need to know about, and here they are:Student LoansIf youâve had them in the past while applying for or receiving a mortgage, the FHA has allowed lenders to not count deferred payments against you. However, starting September 14, thatâs all about to change. Lenders will now be required to count the full payment, or 2% of the balance, against you. This is important for a lot of people doing income-based repayment. This is going to change your buying power substantially.Installment LoansThese are things like car loans or anything that has a specific time for repayment. In the past, FHA has allowed lenders to not count these against you either if it was less than 10 months to repayment, but that is changing now too. Lenders will not count those payments against you unless that payment is less than 5% of your gross income.Both of these changes are going to significantly affect your qualification. Now is a great time to find a property if youâve been thinking of looking, and you may still be able to avoid these changes.

If you think the tax assessed value has come in too high, you have a few options to consider that will assist you with the dispute.Hereâs the 3-step process you need to look into:  Contact your favorite local real estate agent. (We recommend us, but weâre biased.) Why? Because with MLS access, we can get you comparables. In order to say that your home is worth less than the county says it is, youâll need a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 comparable homes which sold in your area during 2011. Real estate agents have access to the true price that those homes sold for.  Next, youâll need to complete an appeal form. We can help you do that.  Then, submit both the comparables and the appeal form to the Salt Lake County Board of Equalization, either by mail or in person. This is located at 2001 State St, Salt Lake City, UT 84190.If you purchased your home during 2014, and your purchase price itself was less than the countyâs assessed value, than the process is also simple: attach a copy of your HUD-1 settlement statement (closing statement) and the appraisal of your home, along with the appeal form. Submit it to the above address, again either by mail or in person.If you refinanced in 2014, you can do the same thing if you have an actual appraisal. Make a copy of the appraisal, fill out the appeal form, and submit it to the above address.There is a deadline, though: the appeal form and any other paperwork must be into the Board of Equalization by September 15th.The good news is that in this process, youâre not alone.

Online marketing involves using photo and video, so you want to make sure that your home looks good. This means youâll want to plant as many flowers as possible, and make your home appear as good as it possibly can.After working on the outside, youâll need to impress the buyers with the inside of your home. This means clearing every flat surface of every object except for decorative items. This includes bookshelves, end tables, and more. You should also make sure that your home is painted uniformly throughout, with no red or neon rooms that would stick out.New paint can actually bring a big return on your investment, and it can go a long way towards attracting buyers to your home.Once you have multiple offers on your home itâs important to evaluate the different offers that you have on your home and decide which one would benefit you the most. Is there a pre-approval or a pre-qualification letter? Are they asking for closing costs? Do they have contingencies?Overall, you have to pick the offer that best suits your needs, and sometimes the highest-priced offer is not the best.Thanks for watching again, and if you need any help buying or selling real estate in Salt Lake City, please donât hesitate to reach out to me.

This is going to be brief, because weâre in the busy summer market here in Salt Lake City, but here is what you need to avoid:  Overestimating how much you can buy: You want to be able to comfortably afford a home when you buy it. A lot of people fail to calculate the monthly expenses of owning a home such as maintenance and repair, as well as insurance. I recommend visiting a qualified lender before committing to buying a home, because he or she can tell you what kinds of properties you can afford, and this will make your home search much easier.  Donât let your emotions get the best of you: I want you to make a top 10 list of the most important things that you need in a house. When you finally buy a home, there will probably only be 5 or 6 things from that list in your home, but you then need to decide which of those things are the most important to you.  Buy with the end in mind: Most people live in a home for around 3-5 years, and when you sell it back, you need to be able to make a profit off of it. Whatever you buy needs to have a broad appeal for the next buyer.Hopefully these tips can help you out when youâre looking to buy a home, but if you need any more help when youâre buying or selling in Salt Lake City, please donât hesitate to contact me.",

We have very little inventory, but there are several things you can do to help you and your offer stand out in this market.The first thing you want to do is make sure you secure a strong pre-approval letter. Have your lender run you through a desktop underwriting system and share it with the agent when you submit your offer. Another thing you can do is write a letter to the seller, letting them know everything you love about the property. Be passionate, sometimes sellers will surprise you with how they respond to heartfelt communication.Asking the listing agent what is important to the seller is a good idea. Maybe they donât care as much about price as they do a closing date or shortened inspection period.Watch out for closing costs. When buyers ask sellers to pay closing costs in this market, itâs going to be problematic. Chat with your lender about how much you need, and make sure you donât take a cent more.Finally, you can submit an escalation clause, which is a way you can get the seller to accept an offer that is above all other offers by a specified amount. Presenting the offer in person is a good idea as well.If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us a quick email. Talk to you soon!",

As we take a look at the Wasatch Front through the history books, letâs first examine the affordability of a home in 1989.In 1989, the average price of a home was $94,000. The average mortgage interest rate was 10%, making the average monthly payment around $825, with median incomes hovering around the $30,000 mark.Fast forward to 2015, and things have changed for the better. Although the average price of homes is up to $208,000, mortgage interest rates are down near 4%, making the average monthly payment of $995 much more affordable to the average person, whose income has risen to $52,250.âIn 2014, an average person would only have to spend 15% of their income to purchase a home, the 3rd lowest figure on record.âIn 2014, an average person would only have to spend 15% of their income to purchase a home, the 3rd lowest figure on record. From this data, you can see that homes have very rarely been as affordable as they are right now.One thing we want to make sure you know is that interest rates are going to rise this year. We donât know when, but we do know that they are low right now. If you want to find out if now is a good time for you to consider making a jump in the market or at least testing the waters, take a look at some homes, and give us a call.

        "content": "Today Iâm going to take some time to answer your questions about the Salt Lake City and Wasatch Front real estate markets. Iâve been getting questions from a lot of different people regarding some different subjects, so if you donât see your question answered here, please donât hesitate to contact me and Iâd be glad to assist you.  Will we see more Millennials buying in 2015?          Statistically speaking, we are seeing more millennial buyers turning to buying instead of renting, but theyâve been delayed by a stagnant economy. However, we are seeing a huge increase in first-time home buyers, and this is expected to have a ripple effect in the market, which is going to generate a lot of activity in 2015.        What do we expect to see this spring?          I expect to see a lot more home buyers this spring with interest rates so low and great loan products available for first-time buyers. Unemployment is at 3.2%, and with the highest amount of inward migration in the nation, I expect this spring to be particularly busy.        Credit Requirement Loosens:          Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have come out with new loan products that require only a 3% down payment on a home. On top of this, private mortgage insurance premiums for FHA loans have fallen by half of a percent, which could save you $85 per month on a $200,000 home.      Hopefully these topics have been helpful to you. If you need any assistance buying or selling homes in Salt Lake City or the Wasatch Front, please donât hesitate to contact me.

        "content": "I recently came across an interesting article on Zillow that was talking about the strange effect that Starbucks was having on home values across the country.The article basically stated that if you lived within a quarter mile of Starbucks that your home value wouldâve appreciated by 96% from 1997 to 2014. This is compared to a 65% appreciation rate if your home wasnât located near a Starbucks. My only idea of why this could be happening is because often times there is development happening around Starbucks, and that could increase the value of your home.While I still donât know exactly whatâs happening with Starbucks, I do know that supply is low and demand is high in Salt Lake City, which means that itâs a perfect time to put your home on the market. If itâs priced correctly and marketed to the right audience, thereâs no reason why you shouldnât be getting top dollar.If youâre interested in buying or selling real estate in Salt Lake City this spring, please feel free to contact me.

        "content": "Hey everyone, welcome back to our blog. Today we want to discuss a few things you can do to prepare your home for sale in the market this spring on the Wasatch Front.The first thing you have to do is change your mindset. Donât think of your home as a home anymore, think of it as a house, a building that you need to sell. If you treat your home sale more like a business transaction, it will make everything a lot easier.The next thing you want to do is make sure you have an accurate picture of your homeâs value. The first step to doing that is clicking the link below, which will give you a good estimate of your homeâs value. The next step is giving us a call to come out and visit your home. This way we can get the most accurate value for your home, within 1% of what itâs market value is.Now comes pricing the home. Pricing your home with the market will make sure that more buyers see it, and it will sell quicker and for more money.Finally, we want to see how mortgage rates can affect you as a home seller. For instance, if rates were to go up by 1%, we would lose the bottom 18% of first time home buyers, who are the people actually driving the market. Without them in the market, nobody else can move up, and the market becomes stalled.We are currently at about 50% of the historical average for interest rates. Every time rates increase by just 1%, the cost of owning a home rises by 10%.If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call or send us an email anytime. Weâd love to set up a time to meet with you and discuss your real estate goals.",

So letâs take a look at what we believe is in store for the housing market in 2015.First of all, we are starting out at a much stronger pace than we did at this time last year. With the government shutdown, a lot of the nation experienced a slow down in real estate last year. Overall, oursales volume is down about 4.5% on the Wasatch Front, however the median home price is up 3% which is a good thing.What we are looking for in 2015 is simple: a stable supply of homes. Anywhere from a 4-6 month supply of homes is considered a balanced market , and thatâs what we would like to see. We firmly believe inventory will stabilize in 2015 and we will see a moderate amount of housing appreciation.Thanks again for taking a moment to check out our predictions for 2015.

These buyers typically have either recently sold their home and are looking to find a new one quickly, or are moving from an area outside the Wasatch Front.

        "author": "Kaitlyn Brown",
        "category": "",
        "content": "We came across a CNN Money article the other day in which an expert described the real estate market as a âcrapshoot.â He explained that there is no guarantee that home prices will continue to rise, so investing in real estate is essentially a gamble. In a sense, heâs right - market conditions are ultimately unpredictable. But the fact that there are no guarantees in real estate doesnât mean you canât make a safe bet.There are a lot of variables when investing in real estate. For instance, if you are looking for a new construction property and only plan on living there for a few years, yourâe going to want to get a great price on it so you can get a good return on your investment. On the other hand, if you are interested in a new construction property where you plan to live for 10-15 years, you donât have to worry as much about what youâre paying to get the property. Your particular circumstances play a role in how market conditions will affect you.Another thing to remember is that real estate is local - conditions vary depending on the particular area. If we look at the East Bench area of the Wasatch Front, we have a 4 or 5 month supply of homes. Once we focus on a particular price range things begin to change; under the $300,000 price range we have a less than 4 month supply, whereas for homes over $500,000 weâve got close to a 5 month supply. The larger the supply of homes, the lower the pressure on pricing - which means it takes longer for appreciation to occur.So, the article can be seen as overstating something that is pretty much common sense - home appreciation relies heavily on inventory, and available inventory is always changing. But, as weâve seen, inventory levels vary depending on locale, so a national report tells us little about conditions on the Wasatch front.Investing in real estate isnât a gamble. Itâs a matter of finding the right agent to help you negotiate and leverage to find an ideal price. Depending on what your goals are for you next move, an agent can help you make sure you find a property that is the right fit so that, when you plan on selling, you have equity to sell.We hope to be your number one source for real estate information in Salt Lake County.
