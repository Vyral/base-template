The raffles consisted of two rounds of 18 holes at Boweâs Creek provided by Toll Brothers and the driving range raffle provided by Boweâs Creek. The Kohler Group raffled two tickets to a Cougars game! Congratulations to the winners, by the way. All of this is simply to remind you of how important you are to us. We appreciate you so dearly, so we were so glad see you there.

A home like this, located at 5N287 Switchgrass Ln, Saint Charles, IL 60175, also comes with a one-year builderâs warranty, which is another great incentive to buy. According to our friend Bill Pendley with Caliber Home Loans, they can also offer a lower interest rate for one of these homes than what you would find on the market otherwise.",

        "content": "If youâre a seller, how do you prepare your home for a showing? If youâre a buyer, how do you prepare for getting a pre-approval?To answer the first question, there are two main tips to remember.Â First, make sure everything about the exterior of your front door is perfect. Everything should be perfect on the interior and around the foyer as well. These are the two areas where people make buying decisions: They make it on the way in, and they make it on the way out.âDepending on your price range, cleanliness can get you anywhere from $5,000 to $15,000 more for your home.âSecond, make sure your home is cleanâclean countertops, dressers, bathrooms, etc. The home should even have a clean fragrance to it. Depending on your price range, cleanliness can get you anywhere from $5,000 to $15,000 more for your home. Remember to hire professionals for this work. We have plenty of vendors weâd love to refer you to whoâd do an excellent job.Â Now, what about preparing for a pre-approval? According to Bill Pendley of Caliber Home Loans, there are three factors lenders look at that you need to examine as well:1. Income: You need to have a monthly income in order to pay your bills.2. Assets: You need to have the funds available to pay your down payment and your closing costs.3. Credit: 740 is the credit score you want to shoot for, and making a couple minor adjustments will help you get there. Paying off revolving debt, for example, can improve your credit score 20 or 30 points and save you thousands of dollars when closing on your home. Â If you have any questions about these topics or youâre interested in scheduling a showing for the beautiful home we shot todayâs video in, donât hesitate to reach out to us. Weâd love to help you.",

There are actually a few reasons, and weâll share just a handful of the most significant factors today.Â For one thing, there are 2% fewer homes on the market in our area right now than there were at this time last year. Also, home values have risen by 3% on average. This means those who list now can enjoy lower competition and higher prices.âBuying a home now means youâll be able to build equity faster after you close.âAs for buyers, one of the greatest advantages in todayâs market is our incredibly low interest rates. Itâs also good to know that, because home values are rising, buying a home now means youâll be able to build equity faster after you close.Â As a final note, weâd like to invite anyone looking to buy a home out to join us for a private showing and some lemonade by the pool at (ADDRESS). And, of course, weâd like to thank the sellers of this great property for allowing us to film on location at their listing.Â If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

I absolutely recommend everyone to move here; itâs a wonderful community with a vibrant downtown. In fact, theyâve just done all kinds of renovations and are adding restaurants, office buildings, and both two- and three-story parking garages. There are great places for shopping and other awesome businesses to stop in. Thereâs something for everyone in downtown St. Charles.The town runs right along the Fox River. A bike path runs along the river all the way to Batavia, and the river is the site of various festivals throughout the year, which include riverboats, steamboats, bands, and much, much more. We recently had our annual Thanksgiving Day Parade, where businesses, students from the high school, and all sorts of people come out to participate. Itâs a fun event for everyone in the community.Hotel Baker is a beautiful historic building built right along the Fox River. With more than 50 rooms, itâs a great venue for hosting weddings and other elegant events. Inside is Rox City Grillâa fabulous place for an upscale dining experience where you can get fish, steak, and a wide variety of other menu options. The menu is changed fairly frequently, so there will always be new and interesting dishes to try.Did I mention the outstanding school districts? Park District is truly exceptional.  âThereâs something for everyone in downtown St. Charles.âAdditionally, Iâm so proud to represent JRH Properties, LLC, and the fine homes that they build. Recently, theyâve built a beautiful 150-homesite subdivision on the west side of St. Charles that you just have to see. Each property is anywhere from a half-acre to an acre, and almost all of them are backed with some type of open space. Much of this greenspace is tree-lined and has bike paths, lakes, and ponds. Itâs absolutely gorgeous.Though they primarily build in St. Charles and Glen Ellyn, theyâve also built a series of beautiful custom homes that are typically 5,000 square feet or more and fall into the million-dollar price range. The work on these properties is absolutely exceptional; the features and craftsmanship are state-of-the-art. JRH Properties, LLC is proud to build homes in Prairie Lakes.I welcome everybody to come see the three spec homes we have available right now for occupancy. The kitchens will just knock your socks off if the rest of the houses donât first.If you have any questions about the properties available for purchase or about why St. Charles is such a fantastic place to make a home, please reach out to me.

It makes a difference in cost, especially when a client says they have 50 boxes when, in reality, itâs more like 200.Mitch loves his town and loves to provide a helpful service to the community.

The MLS is reporting that our market time is down 20.6%.2. There are buyers that are being transferred into our marketplace. At this time of the year, many people are transferring to our area for jobs. These people make for fabulous buyers, because they come pre-qualified and ready to purchase. Many fly in for a weekend and fly back with a new contract.3. Much of your competition comes off the market at this time. This, of course, creates lower supply and still leaves a strong demand for your home. It is a great chance to let your home take center stage.âIt is a great chance for us to let your home take center stage.â4. Many buyers like to close out their transaction in the current year for tax purposes. This means that there is a little more pressure to get the transaction completed before the start of the new year.5. Interest rates are still low. This increases affordability for buyers and helps sellers list at higher prices.Â All of these are excellent reasons for you to consider selling this fall.

        "content": "Here at The Kohler Group, we are always striving to uphold your homeâs value for when it comes time to sell. There are four things that will help keep your homeâs value up in todayâs market:1. Make sure the exterior presentation of your home is excellent. Make sure that your garden beds are edged and are full of seasonal flowers. Trim your bushes as well. Make sure your front door and doorbell look good and are working properly. Buyers and their agentsâ first impression of a home starts with the front door, so you want to get started on the right foot.2. Make sure the home has neutral colors. This is especially important in the critical rooms such as the foyer, living room, dining room, kitchen, master bedroom, and master bathroom. Make sure windows are open throughout the home so buyers can see the natural light pouring through the windows.âIt pays to hire professionals to help you get your home ready.â3. Â Remove any clutter. Iâm sure youâve heard this many times before. Removing clutter is essential for buyers being able to see the money features of your home more easily. We want them looking at the flooring, cabinetry, countertops, appliances, and the other emotional grabs of the property. This is really what drives offers.4. Make sure the home is clean. Weâre all busy and itâs very challenging to keep a home clean. However, making that extra effort to make the home spotless will give the buyer a great impression of how the home has been cared for over the years. A home cannot be clean enough when itâs on the market.One thing Iâve learned over the years is that it pays to hire professionals when getting your home ready. We have vendors at our office that weâd be more than happy to get you in touch with. These vendors include cleaning ladies, landscapers, painters, and more who know exactly how to make a home look its best. Weâd love to share them with you so that you can enjoy your time spent with friends and family.If you have any questions for us about getting your home ready for sale or about the real estate market in general, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

And when the market heats up, you should expect there to be bidding wars.So, what are some ways you can position yourself for success in the face of competition? Iâve got some key tips on winning those bidding wars when youâre searching for your next home.First of all, write a cash offer if you can. This is going to get the sellerâs attention. If this isnât something youâre able to do, talk to your loan officer about a loan commitment. This is stronger than a pre-approval and is another way to capture the attention of the seller.Have your loan officer call the listing agent to tell them what a strong, qualified buyer you are. This will put you in a very good position with the sellers.âIt is critically important that you hire an experienced agent.âNext, work through the contingencies quickly and efficiently. Be very communicative with the seller during this process.Finally, it is critically important that you hire an experienced agent. You should work with a professional with a proven track record of negotiating contracts. There is a tremendous amount of skill required in these kinds of negotiations, so make sure you work with someone who has the right knowledge and experience.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are some key things you need to know about appraisals and how the appraisal process works.The cost of an appraisal in our area is typically $500 to $600 and is usually paid for by the homebuyer at loan inception after the purchase contract has been executed. Appraisal fees vary depending on the location of the property and the complexity of the appraisal process. The cost is also driven somewhat by market demand, as with any other service.Appraisers are selected by the mortgage lenders, and those lenders are bound to strict regulation when making their selection. Most lenders will use an appraisal management company to order and coordinate their appraisals. You may want to ask your specific lender how they select an appraiser.âIf a low appraisal happens, you can renegotiate or get a second opinion.âAppraisers are not immune to the fact that the buyer and seller are counting on the home to appraise at the agreed-upon value. However, they canât base an appraisal on the sales price. They have to use the most recent sold comparisons within the closest range of the home. Their work is then submitted to the bankâs underwriters who also review that data and must give a final approval of the appraisal.Low appraisals can and do happen. If this happens, you can renegotiate or get a second opinion in some cases, which is called a value appeal.To save on the cost of a home appraisal, when youâre selecting a mortgage lender, ask them what the cost will be for the appraisal so you know before you apply. Compare with other lenders and confirm youâre receiving the market rate for the appraisal.If you have any questions about appraisals or any other real estate topic, please donât hesitate to call or email me today. I would be happy to be of service to you.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "How do you live in a home youâve already listed for sale? Follow these five tips:1. Start packing now. The secret to getting a house clutter-free is to remove the things you can live without while the home is on the market. For example, remove seasonal clothes from your closets. This will give them the appearance of being spacious. Also, straighten your clothes in your closets, as this will give the impression of a neat home with generous space.2. Store it, sell it, throw it out, or donate it. Doing this wonât just give you a head start on movingâbuyers appreciate the extra space when searching for homes.3. Get squeaky-clean. A clean house can gain you $5,000 to $10,000 on your home sale. Aim for five-star hotel perfection when cleaning sinks, glass, mirrors, windows, and toilets. Details do matter. Itâs all about the feeling when a buyer is selecting a home. Let them feel impressedâthis will translate into them writing an offer quicker and for more money.âA clean house can gain you $5,000 to $10,000 on your home sale.â4. Maintain your privacy and safety. Protect your valuables and the things that are important to you. Put them away, and when in doubt, lock them up.5. Hire a real estate stylist. Real estate stylists are essential when your home is for sale, so ask your agent to recommend one. They help with furniture placement and can help confirm that a home is best prepared for showings. We have found that a furnished home sells faster. Ask your agent or stylist for recommendations on renting furniture if needed.If you have any questions about this topic or how I can help you capitalize on our market, donât hesitate to call or email me.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "In order to get top dollar in todayâs marketplace, there are a few simple steps you can take.One of the first and best ways to obtain top dollar is by hiring and working with a top-producing agent. Working with a quality real estate agent who specializes in the market in which you are selling is key.You need to hire an agent with a proven track record and a reputation for success. To be sure of this, interview the agent. Watch and listen carefully to see what kind of sales skills they apply during the conversation.These same skills are the ones theyâll bring to the table when they help sell your home. Powerful negotiation skills are a great indicator that they will do a great job.However, selling your home for top dollar will take more than simply a great agent. Your stylist and agent may make suggestions during the process on how to improve your home. If either of them suggest repairs or aesthetic changes, be open to doing them.Some common improvements that are done to homes before theyâre sold include making them depersonalized and also maximizing their space. Buyers will want an open, neutral slate when they view your home.Sanitizing, cleaning, and modernizing the home will also make a difference.âWorking with a quality agent is key.âAlthough you are striving for top dollar, you need to be realistic about what that number can be. Your agent will provide you with a comparative market analysis, which will show you the correct price range in which to list your home.Another tip is to make sure that your agent approaches the transaction with a very specific and proactive mindset. One of the first things they should do is market your home online using professional photographs. Next, the right client will have the skills and knowledge to undertake a massive networking campaign to promote your home.This campaign begins with your agent getting into contact with other top agents, relocation companies, their own database, and anyone else within their sphere of influence in order to find the right buyer for your home.With a market that changes daily, this step is imperative to making your home visible and to getting it sold.A good agent will also be honest with you when providing feedback. A top agent will relay information from the buyers to you exactly as it was originally stated. Not only that, they will also be able to provide you with solutions to any given objections or obstacles that appear. You should always be receptive to your agentâs feedback.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you, soon.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Whatâs been going on in the market here in the St. Charles area?There are currently 482 homes actively for sale, 211 are under contract, and 506 total homes have closed in the last six months. With these market conditions in mind, there is some great news for home sellers. When your house is staged and priced correctly, it will sell for top dollar.From a technical perspective, we know that the current market absorption rate is about eight months, which favors homebuyers. That means if no new houses came on the market, it would take a full eight months to sell all the currently available homes for sale at the present pace.âCurrent conditions provide an incredible opportunity for savvy homebuyers and sellers alike.âThe current market conditions provide an incredible opportunity for the savvy homebuyer as well as the savvy seller since weâre near this equilibrium point of housing inventory levels. Thatâs why itâs so important to list and/or buy your house with a top producing agent.Interest rates are another key factor in the marketplace. The Federal Reserve recently increased the short-term interest rate about 0.25%, which was actually anticipated by the market, so mortgage interest rates have actually dipped just below 4% for the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage.With these conditions, having the right Realtor in your corner can make all the difference in the world when buying and/or selling real estate.If youâd like to learn more specifics about our market or youâre planning on making a move, give me a call or send me an email soon. Iâd love to help you get the most out of this market.",
