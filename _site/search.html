        "content": "Zillow is one of the most popular real estate websites online today, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it can replace the knowledge and experience of an agent. Here&rsquo;s what you should know.Â Why shouldnât you trust Zillow to help you find your next home?Utah is a non-disclosure state, meaning weâre one of the very few states that disclose private sales of real estate. As such, Zillow has a hard time identifying the true value of a property. Also, Â there are many things to consider when it comes to valuing a home, and only some of which areâ¦Zillow also doesnât show 100% of what is available on the MLS; oftentimes, theyâll show homes that arenât even on the market anymore. Many brokerages opt out of the Zillow feed, so youâre not getting the full scope of whatâs actually on the market.âYou wouldnât go on WebMD to diagnose your illness, would you? Of course not; youâd go to the doctor.âFurthermore, Zillow cannot replace the range of services that actual agents can provide. As Realtors, we can give you an accurate view of your home not only in terms of value, but we can also give you a full diagnosis, including how to best position your home to maximize its value in the market. You wouldnât go on WebMD to diagnose your illness, would you? Of course not; youâd go to the doctor.So many times over the years a client has come to me saying that Zillow has valued their home a particular way. Weâve actually been able to increase home values because we have the complete pictureâfull data and professional experienceâto back that up.If you have any questions or would like additional information, please reach out to us. Weâd be glad to help you with any of your real estate needs.",

        "content": "News reports have said that the affordability index is dropping, but what does this mean to you?Â There has been talk in the news recently about affordability. So, we decided we would explain what affordability means and address how it may impact you. We hope doing so will assuage any worries you may have.You may have heard that the affordability index is dropping. The affordability index is a number that is measured by mortgage rates, interest rates, and pricing. The news has reported that this index has dropped by about 5%.As a consequence, buyers in the market are now worried that their budgets will be stretched. But there is no reason to be overly concerned. We are nowhere near historic lows in terms of affordability, though we will continue to see the affordability rate drop from about 15% to 20% by yearâs end.So, what does this mean to you? If you are a seller, now is the time to prepare your home and get it on the market.âThe affordability index is a number which is measured by mortgage interest rates and pricing.âIf you are a buyer who is ready to buy, why wait any longer? There should not be any excuse because waiting until next year hoping that prices come down will be a disappointment. Prices will not come down because of the market. Now is the best time.The key is to reach out to us right away if you would like to discuss your buying and selling plans. We would love to help you succeed.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

Let&rsquo;s discuss this important question today.Â Back in January, we predicted that our market was about to heat up. Well, now that we are further into the year, it has become clear that these projections have come true.We are well into the thick of the spring selling season, with homes today spending an average of just 11 days on the market.So, what does this mean for buyers?

No matter what you choose, youâre paying a mortgage.Some people are scared of the word âmortgageâ because of the commitment. Even if you donât technically have one, youâre paying for one if youâre renting. Youâre actually paying more than a mortgage would cost and making your landlord money in the process.Renting does have some benefits, but only as a temporary solution. The goal should be to own the roof over your own head. If you donât, youâre just paying for somebody else to own the roof over your head.âRenting has benefits, but itâs only a temporary solution.âThose that own homes tend to have a much higher net worth than those who donât. A mortgage also gives you a fixed rate that you can use to predict what your payments will be now and in the future. The price and payment stay fixed in this case. If youâre renting, youâre at the mercy of the market and the landlordâs decision.

        "content": "Should you keep saving to purchase a home, or should you buy a home now?Â This is a great question, and it all comes down to how much you are saving and whether your savings are outpacing the rate at which the market is appreciating. For example, if youâre saving $1,000 a month and the market is appreciating at $500 a month, it makes sense to save your money to buy a house.Â Unfortunately, our market is growing at a faster rate than most people are able to save right now.Â In our last video, we mentioned that appreciation is going to be anywhere from 6% to 8% in 2018, so keep that in mind.Â If weâre at a pace of 6% appreciation and youâre not able to keep up with your savings, itâs probably wise to buy a home sooner rather than later. That way, youâll end up ahead.Â You should also keep an eye on interest rates. Weâre in an environment where they have been talking about raising interest rates for a long time, and they are starting to do that now. As rates go up, a buyerâs purchasing power is going to be greatly limited.Â âInterest rates are the single greatest factor that can influence your monthly payment.âFor every 1% increase in interest rates, your mortgage payment goes up about $200. Interest rates are the single greatest factor that can influence a monthly payment.Â The good news is that there are some really favorable loan programs right now with low down payments or no down payment at all. In a market thatâs appreciating like ours, itâs a good idea to take advantage of some of these programs to buy a home. There are also some grant programs that provide money for down payments. So, there are some favorable options out there if you donât quite have the money you think you need.Â If you have any questions, please donât hesitate to reach out to us. We are well-versed in whatâs going on in the market, and weâd love to help you.Â Â ",

Certain price ranges are generating multiple offers for the listings that are out there, so sometimes an appraiser will enter the picture and disagree with the price that is listed on the contract. Â From a buyerâs perspective, the first thing to remember is that you always have the right to cancel the contract if the appraisal comes in low. This is the easy solution, but it doesnât get you the house.Typically when an appraisal comes in low, most people will try to renegotiate. This may mean that the buyer will have to come up with some extra funds or get rid of some closing costs that have been previously negotiated with the seller.Â Usually, there is an attempt by both parties to make it work out for everyone.Â âSometimes an appraiser will enter the picture and disagree with the price that is listed on the contract.âIf it was an FHA appraisal, then the appraisal stays with the property whether the deal works out or not.Â During the process of renegotiating, itâs important that everyone pays attention to the contract deadline. Buyers especially need to realize that you must negotiate within this deadline if you want to get your earnest money back in the event the deal falls through. If you negotiate outside of the deadlines, the earnest money can be lost.Â If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

We want to share our forecast with you today.Â Since the real estate market was strong in Â 2017 and we expect it to continue to be strong in 2018, interest rates should go up. The Fed will probably raise interest rates two or three times in 2018.Â According to what we saw in 2017, you can expect more low inventory in 2018. We will continue in a strong sellerâs market because of strong buyer demand.Â As we continue to add more people to the Wasatch Front through job growth or people having children, we are going to continue to see strong demand going forward, which will also cause prices to continue to go up. Â If you plan on selling your home, you want to make sure that you justify your pricing, even if you are in a strong sellerâs market. Reach out to a real estate professional like us. We can definitely help you with pricing.Â âStrong demand will cause prices to go up in 2018.âWhen you sell your home, chances are your buyer will use financing to purchase the house. That means you are selling your house twice, once to the buyer and once to the appraiser. The home has to appraise, or else nobody wins.Â If you are a first-time buyer in the $200,000 to $300,000 price range, itâs especially important that you are prepared to be very competitive with your offer. You need to be able to move fast. We have a number of different tips that you can help you succeed in this market.Â This is a general forecast for our local real estate market.

This shows that prices are going up. It is important to keep in mind that price per square foot isnât the best way to measure value, but it is an indicator of where values are going.Â We are also seeing what youâd expect when prices per square foot go upâthe median sales price is also up from $268,000 to $299,000.âThe rising price per square foot indicates that home values are on the rise.âInventory remains low, especially in lower price ranges. We see inventories of two months or fewer across the board. When you have lower inventory like weâve seen, it will also reduce the days on market. On average in 2017, the days on market was 20 days. This will vary a bit based on the price point of the home or where itâs located.This is just a snapshot of what we observed over the past year.

Even in a sellerâs market, this can be a mistake people make.Our market is experiencing a slight shift, so overpricing can become very frustrating for everyone involved in the transaction. Listing your home too high will only lead to price reduction after price reduction.The next mistake sellers commonly make is advertising too little. There tends to be an assumption that just because youâve hired a Realtor, youâre in the clear.âPutting your home on the market and waiting isnât enough to successfully sell.âThe truth is that merely putting your home on the market and waiting isnât enough. You will need a detailed marketing strategy to expose your home to the most buyers possible.The last mistake weâd like to talk about is not preparing your home adequately for sale. Once a home is on the market, it is no longer just a place to live in. A home thatâs listed on the market needs to be ready at a momentâs notice for buyers to view it.

Donât just observe it when you visit the home. Check out what traffic is like during rush hour or after school.2. Pay attention to your daily commute.3. Know your neighborhood codes and restrictions. This is especially important in neighborhoods that have HOAs (homeowners associations).4. Donât overlook the bedroom/bathroom count. If you are looking at a 4-bedroom home, for example, make sure it doesnât have just one bathroom.5. Make note of any specialty inspections. We always recommend a general home inspection but depending on the home youâre looking at, you might want to order a radon inspection, a termite inspection, or a number of other specialty inspections.6. Pay attention to the things that canât be changed about the home. This includes the lot size, the location, and the floor layout.Â 7. Make note of the homeâs resale value. Sometimes buyers can get too excited and forget to pay attention to any barriers that would make the home harder to sell than normal.8. Is there room to grow into the home? This depends on your individual circumstances, obviously, but should be considered no matter what those circumstances are.âDonât buy a 4-bedroom home with one bathroom.âWe hope this list is helpful to you.

We totally understand thatâwe spent a lot of time in our careers as single agents, and we believe that a team is a valuable way to get out of the agent rat race.Â One of the myths itâs easy to talk yourself into if youâre a single agent is that you can do everything and skip paying for things like transaction coordination, communicating with title companies, and other services.Â When it comes to this myth and agent activities, single agents like to believe their time isnât worth what it should be worth. What they end up doing when they meet with a client who tries to beat them up over their commission is offer a discountâthey discount themselves, their service, and their fees. They then stay in the rat race by convincing themselves they only need to work harder and put more time in.Â âWe all only have 24 hours in a day.âThe reality is, we all only have 24 hours in a day. As much as some of us want to think weâre Superman, there is not enough time in the day to increase business volume to what we think weâre capable of doing. This philosophy leads to agent burnout.Â You can spend your time scurrying around, putting up signs, and hanging lock boxes if you want. On a team, though, you have someone else doing those jobs so you can focus on writing purchase agreements, getting contracts signed, and prospecting.Â You can work hard and be effective as a single agent, but you will cap out at a certain volume because you donât have enough time in the day to do it all.Â If you have any questions about our team or are interested in attending some of our training sessions, donât hesitate to contact us.

We recommend hiring a third-party management company to handle the essential maintenance tasks so that doesnât become a full-time job for you.  Having an exit strategy in place: Specifically, there are two strategies we want to mention. First, make sure that if short-term rentals become unavailable, the property can still generate cash flow in a long-term rental scenario. Second, if the property doesnât work out and you need to sell quickly, make sure you buy into an area with enough appreciation that you wonât lose money during that quick sale.Â âHire a management company so maintaining your Airbnb property doesnât become a full-time job.âIf you have any questions about investing in real estate, please donât hesitate to give us a call.

        "content": "Inventory has been shrinking recently and a lot of buyers are turning to building new homes instead.When buyers do this, though, they need to ensure they are being well-represented.Â Today, weâd like to share three reasons why that is.Â First of all, when a buyer enters a model home the agent they are greeted by is actually representing the builder. This agent is focused on the builderâs money and best interest as opposed to the buyerâs. Â While they are usually very friendly and donât mean ill will toward the buyer, it is important to be represented nonetheless.Â Next, buyers should remember that many builders use their own purchase agreement. Weâve personally seen these contracts and know that they can be upwards of 30 to 40 pages long.Â âItâs nice to have someone around who is familiar with the ins and outs of the process.âSo having someone who is representing you available to read and interpret these kinds of documents will be very important to the process and your understanding of it.Finally, the purchase of a home is an emotional decision. All else aside, a home is somewhere you are going to put down roots, make memories, and spend time with your family. It can be hard to separate yourself from this emotion, so having someone who will be able to help you do so is greatly helpful.Â Ultimately itâs nice to have someone around who is familiar with the ins and outs of the process and can help you make the many decisions associated with homeownership.If youâd like more information or have any other questions feel free to get in touch by giving us a call or sending an email. We look forward to hearing from you.",

        "content": "Weâve had to deal with quite a few multiple offer situations recently. These can get tricky, but we have been able to find consistent success in getting buyers the home they want while competing against other buyers who want the same home. We are here to share some of our best tips with you today.Â The first important thing is to make sure your agent tells the sellers your story. Striking an emotional chord with a seller will go a long way when it comes time for them to accept an offer. A lot of sellers are interested in the buyer who will live in their home next. You want your agent to present your case to the sellers as strongly as possible.Â âMake sure the seller knows your story.âÂ We recently had a buyer who was a nurse at a local hospital and ended up getting her offer accepted because of the sellerâs connection to the nurses at that hospital. Making sure the deadlines on the offer are nice and tight is another good strategy.Â Finally, you need to have a solid pre-qualification letter from a lender that your agent has a relationship with. If they have closed many transactions with that lender, you can rest assured that you wonât be led astray.Â Â If you have any questions for us about real estate or you know anyone who is interested in buying or selling a home, feel free to give us a call or send us an email anytime.

The 1031 can be a little tricky, but there are some basic rules to follow:Â Â First of all, once you close on the property that youâre using the 1031 on, you have 45 days to identify three properties of interest. From there, you have 180 days to close one one of those properties. You can also close on multiple properties.Â Â In the meantime, you canât have any boot. That means you cannot take any money from the sale and put it in your pocket or else you will be taxed on that.âRemember, third parties are necessary.âÂ The last thing to keep in mind is that third parties are necessary. You need to use a third-party intermediary to handle the exchange on your behalf. Remember, you cannot touch the money from the sale of the property going into the exchanged property. That has to be handled by a third-party intermediary.Â Â We have great resources to help you find that third-party and we can answer any other questions you might have about the 1031 exchange.

Click here to view a .pdf of investment formulas to help you out!Now that youâve found a property you like, what happens next? Next, you have to evaluate that property, and there are three important factors to take into consideration.The first is location. Weâve all heard the saying âlocation, location, location,â and it certainly applies to real estate investment as well. For example, a busy road can be a positive thing when it comes to real estate investment. Whether the property in question is located in an affluent area or one with a high crime rate is an example of the risk versus reward issue you must deal with when considering the location of your investment property.This leads us to the second thing you must factor in: the age and condition of the property. We always advise people in this situation to order a home inspection. From that report, youâll be able to determine what repairs are needed. This can also be a huge negotiating point for driving the price of the property down. You also need to consider the long-term objective of the property. Will the roof need to be replaced in five years? How are the water heater and the furnace?âThe numbers in investment real estate are critical.âThe last thing you want to factor in is how to run the numbers. The numbers in investment real estate are critical. This means things like the analysis of cash on cash, your return on investment, and the cap rate analysis.

If youâre thinking about buying an investment property, there are three points you need to consider before following through.First, whatâs your overall objective in buying an investment property? Most people buy them for one of four different reasons:  They want an additional monthly cash flow.  They want to buy a property in a very strong area thatâs appreciating in value.  They need a tax shelter for their income.  They need something to do with their time and want one as a hobby.Second, remember that becoming a landlord is a business, not a charity.Make sure youâre using the proper contracts and youâre following them.

        "content": "One of the worst things that can happen during a real estate transaction is a bad appraisal. You are already under contract, things are rolling along, and suddenly, everything stops because the appraisal didnât meet the purchase price.Â If the home does not appraise, the home will not be able to be sold for the agreed upon purchase price. This is bad news for both the buyer and the seller. However, there are a few things you can do to make it to the closing table:Â First, the buyer can come up with the money to meet the appraisal price. Most buyers donât want to do that. However, we are in a hot sellerâs market right now, and many homes are drawing multiple offers. As a buyer, you might just have to bite the bullet and come up with the money.Â âWe are in a sellerâs market, so buyers may just have to come up with the extra cash.âThe other option is for the seller to come down a bit on the asking price. Again, in this market, that is unlikely.Â The third option is to renegotiate the terms of the contract. As a buyer, go to the lender and see if there is any room for adjustment in the interest rate. If the seller is paying for the closing costs, offer to cover them yourself. Ultimately, you can renegotiate to try and make the deal go through in a way that works out for everyone.Â If you have any other questions about how to handle a bad appraisal or if you want to know more about our current real estate market, give us a call or send us an email.

This will contribute to the overall health of our market.Scarcity of listings was a big theme in 2016. We expect the supply to improve this year, but donât expect it to go too high, as demand for homes is still very strong.Finally, we expect to see a moderate increase in home prices. We wonât see double digit increases, but we will see a nice, healthy appreciation of home values.âWe love working with millennials.âThere is some uncertainty about the housing market on a national level.

If you have an elaborate chandelier made of glass or deer antlers, replace it with something neutral while youâre in the process of selling.  Textured surfaces. Whether itâs your walls, ceilings, or other surfaces, buyers donât tend to care much for them.  Using the wrong flooring. Replacing your flooring with the cheapest option might actually hurt your value more than it will help it.Â   Too much carpet. Carpeted bedrooms and living areas are normal- carpeted bathrooms and kitchens are not. Most buyers want hardwood or tile floors in those areas.  Bold wall colors may turn buyers off. When in doubt, go neutral with your wall colors.  Pools and hot tubs donât add much value. While they may add value to you while you are living there, most buyers donât necessarily want to take on the cost of owning and maintaining these items and continuing to pay for them.âFollow this advice, and your home will be much more attractive to potential buyers.
