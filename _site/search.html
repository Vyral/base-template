Get a full home searchSelling your Kansas City home? Get a free Home Price EvaluationThe leaves are falling and filling up your gutters. Most people wait to clean their gutters in the spring when the rain comes, but guess what?If you clean your gutters before winter hits, snow wonât pack those leaves down and clog your gutters. It is easier to clean your gutters when the leaves are dry, anyway. If you wait until spring, the leaves will be a soggy mess.Not only that, if we happen to have a 40Â° day this winter, it could rain. If your gutters are clogged, that rain will come down the side of your house. If your sump pump does not keep up with it, youâll wind up with water in your basement.âIT IS EASIER TO CLEAN YOUR GUTTERS BEFORE ALL THE SNOW HITS ANYWAY.âSo, check your gutters now. Itâs always good to clean them in the spring, too, but cleaning the gutters now should help you avoid any major problems in the winter or early spring.If you have any real estate questions or need to hire someone to clean your gutters, please donât hesitate to reach out to me. I can certainly refer you to someone. I look forward to hearing from you!",

        "content": "Placing an insulated cover over your homeâs outside spigots can prevent them from freezing over and possibly causing your basement to flood once you turn them on again in the spring.Buying a Kansas City home? Get a full home searchSelling your Kansas City home? Get a free Home Price EvaluationOne of the easiest, cheapest winter home preparation tips I always recommend is placing an insulated cover over your homeâs outside spigots.If left uncovered during the winter, they can freeze over, which can cause your basement to flood once you turn them on again in the spring. Repairing that kind of damage can cost you a couple hundred dollars to fix.You can buy insulated spigot covers at Loweâs, Home Depot, or any hardware store for as little as $3. As you can see in the video above, attaching them over your spigot is a simple process.âPUTTING A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY TOWARD YOUR HOMEâS PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE CAN GO A LONG WAY.âMost of us are almost done using our spigots anyway, so you might as well do this now. Putting a little bit of money toward your homeâs preventative maintenance can go a long way.If you have any other questions about preparing your home for winter or youâre curious about whatâs going on in our Kansas City market, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd be happy to help you.",

        "content": "Today I have some advice about patching your walls: never use brushes.Buying a Kansas City home? Get a full home searchSelling your Kansas City home? Get a free Home Price EvaluationToday Iâm at one of my investment properties touching up sheet rock dents in the wall.Iâve got a little spackle on it, and Iâm about to sand it down. While doing this, I realized that a lot of my clients donât realize that if you use a brush to cover a patch, the strokes will show; almost all your walls are rolled on.For little spots like this, I use a mini tray and roller to make the process easier. Regular-sized trays and rollers make a mess and would really be overkill for a small patch. When you roll it on, the texture matches the wall around it, and when it dries, itâll look perfect.âIF YOUâRE EVER TOUCHING UP YOUR WALLS, USE WHATEVER SIZED ROLLER YOU NEED, JUST DONâT USE A BRUSH.âIf youâre ever touching up your walls, use whatever sized roller you need, just donât use a brush.If youâd like one of these little roller kits, Iâll be happy to give one to you. Call, email, or text me, and Iâll bring one over to you and say hi. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
