The Fed is talking about raising rates three more times throughout 2017.Buyers are pouring into the market now in order to lock in a low interest rate. If they wait to buy, they will likely get stuck with a higher interest rate.There is light inventory right now, which is beneficial to home sellers. If youâve been thinking about selling your home, I recommend getting on the market as soon as possible. Buyers are ready to make a purchase now and you wonât face as much competition from other sellers.If you have any other questions about our current market, just give me a call or send me an email.

That is why we loaded up a van full of turkeys and took them over!We help The Burbank Temporary Aid Center out year round, and you can too. They always need food, but those arenât the only services they offer for the less fortunate. They offer programs for many of the other basic necessities of life, including: Groceries, Lunches, assistance with utility bills, transportation services, limited medical assistance, shower facilities, and laundry facilities.Here at the Brad Korb Real Estate Group we are so thankful for the support from our friends and family.

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "How accurate are Zestimates? Most of the time, not very. Theyâre basically a computer program designed to give you a ballpark figure of what the property is worth in todayâs market.How does Zillow determine my homeâs value? It gives you a broad range of whatâs been sold in the neighborhood, but it doesnât go into specifics about your exact home. It doesnât know about what kind of features youâve got; maybe the kitchen youâve upgraded, or that big back yard behind the deck, or the fantastic view over the neighborhood. Since Zillowâs Zestimate is a computerized program, it doesnât know about these things, and that can result in quite a bit of fluctuation between what the real value is and what Zillow says it is. Zillow also canât measure how market trends function, meaning it can give you a wide estimation of whatâs selling in the area, but not in specific niche markets.How off is Zillow on pricing? If you check their website, youâll see that they themselves say their Zestimates can be off by as much as 8% to 10%. When youâre talking about the California market, that can result in an extreme difference between Zillowâs price and the real price. The founder of Zillow himself recently sold his home for far less than it should have been because the Zestimate was 10% off.What goes into pricing your home and why is it important to be accurate? To sell your home for top dollar in todayâs market and get the most we can for you, itâs important to examine market trends to know how to compete against the other homes out there. How do we do this? We come to your home and check things like what kind of landscaping youâve done and what updates youâve made. From there we make sure these kinds of things are showcased to maximize value.Click on the link above if you would like a free market analysis. If you have any questions about Zillow or anything regarding real estate, donât hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Recently, Iâve had a couple of clients working on their property and doing things that I didnât think were important in order to get top dollar in the market.This got me thinking about how I could help others. Before you go and spend any time and money working on things around the house to get it fixed up and ready for sale, talk to an experienced real estate professional who knows about the buyers in your market.

        "content": "In our current market, many properties are getting multiple offers. So how do you handle multiple offers as a buyer or seller?As a seller, it is very important to get multiple offers in order to drive up the price. With our pricing strategies, we can get you a great offer and promote it to other agents so they have the opportunity to bring other bids in. Drawing multiple offers is a great way to get top dollar for your home.As a buyer, consider writing a personal letter to the seller. Warm, fuzzy letters about your family, kids, pets, and how you connected with the house or neighborhood can really appeal to sellers. It also helps if you introduce yourself to the seller and talk about how much you love the house.Recently, one of my buyerâs agents created a fantastic letter that really won the sellerâs heart. The property had 10 offers on it, but we were able to help them get their dream home!If you have any questions about how to navigate a multiple offer situation, just give us a call or send us an email.

Inventory is very low, so multiple offers are common and sale prices remain high.Home values in LA are still rising, and appreciation is still on the rise.

The average days on market is currently fewer than 30 days, so the market is moving very quickly right now.Where are we seeing the hottest real estate markets? I would recommend looking at homes in Glendale, Burbank, the NoHo District, Toluca Lake, Lake Balboa, all of the areas in the Valley, and East LA.If you have any further questions, please donât hesitate to contact me.

In this video, weâll give you tips on how you can conserve water this season.This time of year, plant preparation is important to consider for the future. What you do now affects what happens in the following spring. Take care of the soil, add fertilizers or mulches, and garden new plants early. Gardening plants early helps them benefit from naturally occurring processes, including natural rainfall and cooling temperature of the ground. From moisture and a relaxed temperature combined, spring flowers will form better, more organic roots. This process, if repeated every fall, will help conserve water gradually over time.Additionally, itâs a good practice to check your sprinklers and choose the right plants for your garden. Use the best plants suited for the climate you live in.",

Most of them have had to do with mortgages, refinancing, and interest rates, so we thought we would bring in Brian McKim of Skyline Home Loans to help answer them.How often can I refinance?This is a great question. You can refinance as many times as it makes sense for you. There are no longer any pre-payment penalties, so you can refinance 2 or 3 times a year if it makes sense to. What we mean by âmaking senseâ is that if the refinance will save you money down the road and you can afford it, you should do it.When and how can I refinance if Iâm planning to sell in the future?If you are planning on selling in the next 18-24 months, it probably doesnât make much sense for you to refinance. Youâll want to give yourself enough time to reap the benefits of getting a lower rate, and that probably wonât happen for at least 2 years.There you have it.

In the past few months, rates have dipped below historical lows and sit below 4% in most places. Because of this decrease in rates, Fannie Mae has recently agreed to offer a 97% loan program as opposed to a 95% loan program.This is going to help first time buyers get into the market sooner rather than later. With low interest rates and even lower down payments, things are setting up perfectly for that first-time buyer to get into a new home. In addition, the FHA has lowered their private mortgage insurance premiums, making your monthly payment even lower.With conditions the way they are, buyers and sellers need to take advantage. Right now, you can afford more of a home and secure a lower monthly payment than you ever could have.

Because of this slight slowdown, many people are asking whether they should wait until the busy spring season to sell their home. This is a great question - to answer it, letâs take a look at interest rates because they have the biggest impact on your spending power.Say you get a $600,000 mortgage with the current interest rate of about 4.25%. Your monthly payments will only be $2,900 a month. Local lenders predict those low interest rates to rise next year. If you wait to buy, interest rates may be as high as 5.5%. If you lockin a 5.25% rate next year, you will have lost 10% of your purchasing power! This means you will have to pay the same price for less home - youâll have to pass on that $600,000 mortgage for a more affordable $540,000 one.Itâs really quite simple: If you are ready to buy, itâs probably not wise to wait.

        "content": "Happy October, everyone! We just wanted to share with you an interesting story that we heard recently. Itâs sort of a cautionary tale about refinancing while switching career paths.Recently, our former Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, was denied refinancing for a new mortgage. Why? Well, Bernanke is now retired from the Federal Reserve, using his time now to be a speaker and author. Because of this career shift, lenders determined that he had no job stability, and therefore could no longer qualify for refinancing. Hopefully they will loosen up these standards soon to help out home buyers.The moral of this story is: If youâre thinking about buying a house and changing job fields at the same time, reach out to us and give us a call so we can run everything by our lender. Sometimes, but not always, when you switch job fields, you have to wait a while to buy another home because you have to gain some experience and tenure in your new field.We thought this would be an important story to share with you, and we hope you are enjoying your October. If you have any questions, please give us a call! Weâd be glad to help!",

Not all home buyers will be lucky enough to move into a house like this with rarely used appliances and A/C. When things break, rather than going back to the seller with a broken A/C, if you have a home protection policy, you can get it fixed easily for as little as $55 or $60.If you donât have that policy, you could be looking at spending between $1500-$3500 to fix it. Having your appliances covered by a home protection policy gives you great peace of mind.

The problem is that they donât always have up-to-date information. The information they are getting on homes is from 3-6 months ago.If prices have dropped in your Los Angeles neighborhood in the last few months, this will not reflect the actual value of your home in the current market.For buyers, they also donât put price reductions up right away and they donât update information on homes that are pending sales.

They were at 4.5% a few weeks ago and then dropped down to 4.1%, and have now risen back to 4.25%. However, 4.25% is still a phenomenal interest rate.  Inventory in Burbank has also risen slightly, but itâs nothing too significant. We still have less homes for sale now than we did last year.Because most people like to move into homes in the summer, now is your chance to sell your Burbank home quickly and for top dollar.

Here are her tips:Explore the neighborhood(s) you are considering â drive around at various times of day; research the schools, shopping, city management, parks and recreation and amenities. Do they suit your lifestyle?Get pre-approved by a local lender â this will help you pinpoint a price range so you can narrow down your search for what you are looking for and what you can afford.Identify which features of a home are important â so you can be able to differentiate quality features from cosmetic ones. Simple fixes may not cost too much to resolve whereas you can recover a much more significant return on your investment with some features.Donât expect perfection â rather be realistic and keep an open mind. Small fixes are easy to manage and as long as you can overlook them you can find a great deal on a good home!Sometimes it takes more than one try â at times the first home you make an offer on is not the perfect home.

        "content": "Hi folks, and welcome back to my video blog.Today I wanted to go over the topsy-turvy topic of interest rates in the housing market. Iâve had a lot of people ask me about the state of interest rates; what happened to them previously, whatâs happening now, and what I think will happen in the future? Iâd like to take the time now to basically give you the quick overall of what I tell clients face-to-face.First off, about 6 months ago interest rates were hovering around 3.5%. This unprecedented low rate for the buyers was like taking candy from a baby. Buyers were buying in force and sellers were enjoying the vast number of buyers. This caused an increase in bidding wars, houses shot above list price, and buyers were pulling out all the stops to buy property. But once the government decided the market was getting overheated, they began buying mortgage-backed securities (spending around $85 billion a month). This is important, because the government will most likely stop purchasing mortgage-backed securities early next year, so buyers need to be aware that the rates will go up soon!Right now, we are sitting around 4.5%. But we feel, given the decision by the government, that interest rates will go up soon. Based on our knowledge of the situation, it looks like interest rates will jump into the 5 percentile next year. Once again, now is the time to buy! Get that cheap mortgage plan while the interest rates are still down in the 4 percentile and reap the benefits of a buyerâs market!Any other questions or comments? Let me know.",

        "title": "Should You Sell During the Holiday Season?",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Traditional school of thought dictates that selling a home during the holidays is a bad idea. People are busy celebrating with their families and will hardly go shopping for a home, right? Not so! There are numerous advantages to listing a home during this season and below are ten great reasons to put a home on the market now.More serious buyers â Less time wastedThese are people who are interested in buying so there is a far greater chance of actually selling the property.  Nothing is more promising to a seller than a motivated and qualified buyer that knows what they want and is actively seeking to get it.Fewer Homes On the MarketThe less competition there is, the higher the chance there is for homes on the market to sell. Where during the peak season sellers might be dealing with some interest from buyers on their home, nonetheless there is more selection for buyers to choose from and they can stray to another property.In January Inventory Increases â Chances of Selling DecreasesWith so many homeowners assuming the holidays is a taboo time to sell there is a plethora of new listings in January, resulting in a diminished chance of your home selling.  Also, there is a risk that the price you may receive on the home can be less.Decked Halls Look Great!Homes are very appealing to prospective buyers when they are decorated for the holidays.  With all the festive dÃ©cor, lights, greenery and added beauty of the season â the home shows very well and attracts buyers faster than if shown during other times of the year.More Time To Browse HomesBuyers have extra time off from work and are on vacation, which translates to a more aggressive buying pattern and more chances of your home being viewed.More Emotional BuyersBecause of the high stress of the holidays, buyers tend to be more emotional during this time than in the summer months. A more emotional buyer will tend to pay more for a new property, so selling your home during the holidays could make you more money.Show The Home With FlexibilitySellers that have their home listed prior to the holidays have the added advantage to be able to âpauseâ the process so they can celebrate the holidays, essentially not showing the home during a period of time during the break.  When the festivities die down, things can pick up again and the seller has not only managed to save potentially lost time but can also jump right back into the market.Transferred EmployeesJanuary is typically the month where employees are transferred into new position. In order to capture this demographic of buyers, your home must be on the market since these buyers cannot wait until the spring to buy.Sell Now For More Money Then Delay ClosingExtended occupancy can be negotiated, leaving both parties the leniency to get through the holiday season and past the New Year so that all sides can rest assured the deal is done but it can follow through at a more convenient time.  For sellers this option is great because they are able to secure a higher selling price on the property before the market is inundated with new listings come January when the selling values drop.Fewer Foreclosures On the MarketMany banks will suspend foreclosure listing during this time of year, especially on properties where there are still families occupying the home.  As a result of this, some of the competition that arises for sellers from low-priced foreclosures can be avoided during the holidays.Keep in mind that the idea of your homeâs value increasing significantly over the next several months is a myth.  The truth is that housing values likely only go up when consumer income rises. Pay rates increase at a rate of three to five percent each year and that is about the maximum yearly increase we can expect to see in a home as well. So if you are wondering whether or not to put your home on the selling market now, or to wait â one important factor is that waiting will not provide much benefit.",

Sellers have the upper hand, especially if the home is in good condition, located in a great neighborhood and priced just right. If youâre at all on the fence about selling, now is the time because sellers are getting top dollar for their homes and they are selling faster than they could have imagined.Since there are fewer homes on the market, thereâs more competition for available homes. Low inventory often translates into multiple bids for homes in good condition, high list-to-sale price ratios and being able to negotiate better terms. Itâs an ideal time for sellers.So when selling your home, if you want to get top dollar for your property, take advantage of the low inventory.

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "For years now, buyers have been able to come in fairly low and actually get away with offers that sellers would never have accepted just a few years prior to that. But now, things are shifting back to a more balanced marketplace and we are noticing some big changes in the way buyers and sellers are interacting. Here are some ways you can gain the upper hand over other buyers vying for the same (few) properties that are scarcely available in our market today.Donât Hold Back When You Find Something You LikeA common mistake made by many buyers in a competitive market is to hold off on making an offer on something they really like. The chance of finding a home that meets every single need is next to impossible, thatâs why it is important to recognize your deal breakers and if you like the home for the most part, go ahead and make an offer on it.If Youâre Serious, Present a Serious Offer â The First TimeNow is not the time to be playing games when it comes to trying to get the home of your dreams. With so few homes on the market and so many buyers, there is a good chance you could lose the home altogether if your offer is not strong enough. Carefully consider your offer and act as if that is your only chance.Engage in the Services of a Local ExpertThere is a lot of merit to working with a local real estate agent that knows the area and knows other agents in the area. At times, when all else fails, a seller may opt for your offer just because their agent also knows your agent. Not to mention, the expert advice you can expect from your REALTORÂ® in being able to recognize a good deal among other things.Structure An Offer That Makes the Seller HappyOne of the strongest signs of a serious buyer is a large deposit. Though the standard varies from area to area, typically at least 1% is put toward earnest money and it shows some level of seriousness on the buyerâs part when they go above that.Other things you can do to make sure sellers pay more attention to your offer and less to others include writing a personal letter to share what you love about the home or be willing to waive contingencies or at least shorten contingencies. Savvy buyers also work to keep their offers simple, clean and easy to read plus they donât hesitate to offer cash if they can do it, shortening the time period between now and closing.If you donât need closing cost assistance, donât ask for it and finally â if you really love the property, do what works best â offer more money.",
