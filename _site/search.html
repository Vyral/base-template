        "content": "Have you thought about starting a career in real estate? Hereâs how to approach it to set yourself up for a prosperous career.Today we want to talk for a minute about a career in real estate.People always ask how the market is and whether now is a good time to get into real estate. A common misconception is that the answer depends on what kind of market weâre in.Hereâs what we have learned from being in real estate for more than 10 years.Itâs not what the market conditions are, but whether you have the right strategies for success. How do we know this? We had a phenomenal year during the worst real estate bubble in history. We did a ton of short sales.âWE ADJUST TO THE MARKET WEâRE IN TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF SUCCESS.âThat is an example of having the right strategyâwe adjusted for the market we were in. In fact, we have been able to grow strategically year over year for the last 10 years.We have what we call a strategically driven business, and not an economically driven business. The difference? Our business does not go up and down with the economy, but rises upward with strategic growth. How do we do that? Come to one of our Career Nights or check out JoinTeamLally.com to learn more. Weâd love to see you there!Thanks and Aloha!",

        "content": "*What does it take to be a leader instead of a manager?You can start by asking questions instead of giving answers.*Today we wanted to give you some helpful information on how to be a leader.Managers give answers â  Leaders asked questionsManagers manage work â  Leaders lead peopleManagers develop subordinates â  Leaders develop other leadersManagers dictate plans â  Leaders cast a visionManagers insist on control â  Leaders inspire collaborationManagers are also accustomed to being the go-to person for answers theyâre used to given direction and giving their opinion it makes them feel valued important and reinforces their position of authority.  Also some managers prefer to deliver answers because they think that it will save precious time.Unfortunately when managers routinely dish out the answers they become enablers that to a dysfunctional cycle.   Which is actually a huge time waster now because team members regular have to seek out the manager for solutions rather than being problem solvers themselves.âStop giving answers and start asking questions.âThis prevents the ability to develop real solutions. Stifles the team member growth and ultimately limits the organizationâs productivity. Additionally when team members are used to going to the manager for answers and direction they actually transfer the ownership of the problem from themselves to the manager. Consequently they can then blame the manager for the goals shortcomings and failures.It is no longer their fault because they didnât provide the solution.  The manager did. Assigning team members with the task of uncovering the reason for their list goal or creating a viable solution to a problem challenge puts the responsibility back where it ultimately belongs.   So how do you do all this by not providing answers.  Instead answer every question with a question. Teach people to think and learn and grow for themselves.Click on this link weâve provided to a Darren Hardy video to learn some awesome concepts from him on how to be a great leader.He mainly talks about training your people to be problem solvers. Darren also talks about how managers give answers while leaders ask questions. He recommends that you stop giving answers because when your team members problem solve on their own, they take ownership of the problem.If you have any questions give us a call or send us an email.
