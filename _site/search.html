We can come to your home and tell you what needs to be updated, what you should keep in the house, and the things you should take out of the house to prepare it for the market. This will help you get the most money you can from your home sale.The other reason to contact a Realtor early is that we want to keep the buyers in mind.âYour homeâs online presence plays a key role in your success.âHow will buyers look at your house? We know that 96% of all buyers look at homes online in the convenience of their own home or office to decide what they want to go see in person. Your homeâs online presence will determine whether a buyer wants to come see it in person. We want to come up with a list of things we can do to make your house look as perfect as possible on the Internet.Both your goal and our goal is the sameâto get the most money possible for your house, and this list will help you do just that. If youâve lived in the house for 35 years, this could take some time, so you want to reach out to us as soon as you know you are selling your home. Itâll maximize your sale and minimize the time and money you put into the house in order to sell it.If you have any questions for me or youâre ready to speak with a Realtor about selling your house, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!",

        "category": "",
        "content": "The latestÂ Existing Home Sales ReportÂ from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) revealed a direct correlation between a lack of inventory and rising prices.We are all familiar with the concept of supply and demand. As the demand for an item increases the supply of that same item goes down, driving prices up.Year-over-year inventory levels have dropped each of the last 18 months, as inventory now stands at a 4.0-month supply, well below the 6.0-month supply needed for a ânormalâ market.The median price of homes sold in November (the latest data available) was $234,900, up 6.8% from last year and marking the 57th consecutive month with year-over-year gains.NARâs Chief Economist, Lawrence Yun had this to say:âExisting housing supply at the beginning of the year was inadequate and is now even worse heading into 2017. Rental units are also seeing this shortage. As a result, both home prices and rents continue to far outstrip incomes in much of the country.âBut there is good news about rising prices. More and more homeowners are recovering from a negative equity situation and learning that they are able to sell their homes and either move up to their dream home or downsize to a property that will better suit their needs. Look for these homes to come to market soon.Bottom LineBuyer demand continues to outpace the supply of homes for sale. Listing your home in the winter attractsÂ serious buyersÂ who are looking to close the transaction quickly.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "We see a wide range of buyers, from those who want homes of a very specific size, style and architectural design, to buyers who simply want four walls, a roof, and electricity for their next home.Most clients are somewhere in the middle - theyâre looking for a home that looks good and has most of the features they want.Youâve probably looked at houses and checked off a few boxes, making sure it has the number of bedrooms and bathrooms you want, but have you ever looked at a home and really thought, âIs this house right for me?âNot many do. Thatâs why I wanted to share a Consumer Reports video with you that I recently found. Itâs a nice checklist to go through in order to make sure the home youâre considering actually fits you and your lifestyle. Here are my favorite items:  Communicate with people at the local coffee shop or any place where locals hang out. Simply ask their thoughts on the area.  You can tell a lot about the sense of community in a neighborhood based on the sidewalks and porches. Seriously!  Proximity to places and amenities you frequent shouldnât be overlooked. Do you want to be close to restaurants and shops, the airport, or parks and trails?  Mortgage cost shouldnât be the only factor when considering affordability. Look at transportation and utility costs too, for example.Remember, the average McLean homeowner will stay in their home for about nine years. Donât ignore the important checklist items when considering the place youâll call home for nearly a decade.Now, this example is pretty broad. Each family has its own unique situation and its own unique checklist. Iâd love to sit down with you and use my experience to help you come up with that all-important checklist of your own to help find the right home for you. Give me a call or send me an email and letâs talk soon.",

        "content": "I recently came across a great video from Consumer Reports about home updates and remodels that I just had to share with you.Did you know that some of the best upgrades to add value to your home are actually some of the smallest ones? Big changes like a new addition wonât always make you all of your money back.This video is all about seeking the help of professionals when you want to make updates, repairs, or remodels on your home. If youâve been in your house for more than a few years, odds are that the value of your house could improve with some upgrading or remodeling.Now, it doesnât always have to be expensive, but itâs important that you do it right. In this market, there is a lot of money to be made with the right upgrades.Whether you want to make your home more valuable because youâre thinking about selling and want to get top dollar, or you just want to add to future resale value, itâs important to avoid falling into a money pit.Start by figuring out what you want to accomplish. For most people, that starts with finding out the value of their home at this time. That will go a long way in determining what kind of investment you should make in order to maximize the value of your home for the least amount of money.For an accurate idea of your homeâs value, use our free home market analysis tool. Send info like the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, along with a few photos of your home - especially the important rooms like the kitchen and master bedroom - and we can quite accurately predict your homeâs selling price, too.The estimate wonât be perfect, but it will be extremely close.We can recommend upgrades or remodels that will bring you the best return on every dollar. As the Consumer Reports video shows, a survey of 300 contractors revealed that homeowners changing their minds in the middle of a job can increase costs by 10%!Similarly, donât waste your time with a contractor who isnât licensed. Accredited contractors are better at keeping the cost to you down when you come across budget overruns. Since many hidden costs come from unseen structural problems, a pre-inspection may be your best bet to help you find out what youâre getting yourself into with a big project.Finally, we see that their survey showed that many contractors are, in fact, willing to haggle on an estimate. Your odds are better if youâre a repeat customer or are having work done on multiple rooms.You can see the full video here.As an expert in the Northern Virginia market, I can also help you pinpoint areas of your home that will maximize your return when it comes to upgrades and remodels.

What I do know, however, is that there is a cost to waiting to buy a property.We have no idea where interest rates are going to go, but we do know that right now they are the lowest theyâve been in a long time. We are currently on the back-end of an 8-year increase in home prices, but weâve never seen a 9- or 10-year period of increases in history. At some point, the market is going to flatten out, and so are home prices. Another sign of an impending market slowdown is the fact that our average days on market is up. More units are being sold, but they are taking longer to sell.If youâre thinking about buying, youâve got to do so before rates go up and if youâve been thinking about selling, now is the time to get your home on the market. Prices are going to flatten out and rates are going to go up. You want to be ahead of that curve. If youâre thinking about making a move, I would be happy to have a conversation with you where we can talk about the options you have right now, and why they are only going to get worse in the future.

        "content": "The first thing a buyer is going to see when they drive up to your house is the outside. Are the shrubs crisp and trim? Do you have fresh mulch and colorful flowers? Make sure you have done these things and that the door is clean and in good condition.Once youâve made a good first impression on the exterior of your home, you need to focus on the inside. Have you decluttered and depersonalized your home? Make sure your home is clear and clean!Another thing you need to do is neutralize paint and carpet colors. Loud colors will scare many buyers away, and neutral colors will appeal to the widest number of buyers. Also, be sure to open up your window shades to let in light and to make your home feel airy and fresh. Let the sun shine through your windows!Finally, a high impact and inexpensive thing you can do is replace faucets, fixtures, and switches. Light switches get very dirty and worn over the years, so think about replacing them. Updating faucets is another way to make your home pop and really draw buyers in.When selling this spring, remember that first impressions matter.

Tally the age of various items Make a list of what you have in your house and the age of the systems, roof, etc. How long items last depends on a lot of factors such as the model and how well itâs been maintained, but you can get a general idea of average life span from the National Association of Home Builders. For example:Wood shingle and shake roof: 15 to 30 yearsCentral air-conditioning unit: 15 yearsElectric water heater: 14 yearsGutters: 30 years        Do your own walk-throughLook for common problem spots:Wood rot around outside door frames, window ledges, and garage doors. Condensation and rain can cause these areas to weaken and rot.Water stains on the ceiling or near doors and windows. This can indicate a leaky roof or rain seeping in from outside.Leaks under sinks or around toilets.Bulges under carpet or discoloration on hardwood floors, which can indicate flooding problems or an uneven foundation.  Next, test whatâs called the âfunctionalityâ in every room. Things like visible cracks in the walls and tile or hardwood floors, doors that donât shut correctly, broken cabinet handles, etc. Essentially, anything that doesnât function well should be fixed. Donât forget to inspect the outside!      Bring in the prosOnce youâve done your own walk-through, you may want to have a pro take a second look. These people can spot flaws you overlooked, because either youâre used to them or you didnât realize they could cause trouble. We can help you to hire a home inspector to do a pre-inspection and find out what potential buyers might find when they do their home inspection.        Decide what needs renovatingFor example, a recent study by the National Association of Realtors found that upgrading hardwood floors reaps an estimated 100% return on investment, essentially paying for itself. Upgrading your insulation can net you a 95% ROI, a new roof a whopping 105%! Because what buyers donât like to know theyâve got a solid roof over their heads?

If you donât have some already, buy some kind of garland to drape over the mantle. Next, use leftover ornaments and candles to add light and texture. When choosing ornaments and candles, ensure they are in the same color-palette. This helps make your mantle a great focal point!Use smaller Christmas trees. Every house has their main Christmas tree. In addition, you can also purchase smaller, inexpensive, eco-friendly trees to place throughout the home. Decorate these trees with strips of fabric from a T-shirt in holiday colors to save money for the main tree.Use what you have. Be resourceful. Adding a plate charge and place mat to your everyday dining set adds some jazz to your table. Fresh-cut flowers and candles will help finish the look.

Today we want to talk about an interesting trend weâve noticed in real estate: millennials are waiting longer to purchase their first homes than their parents did.The typical first-time buyer now rents for an average of 6 years before buying a home, which is up from 2.6 years in the early 1970âs, according to Zillow.We came across this great video from CNBC. I will give you my three biggest takeaways from the article.      Down payments are a huge factorRenters in todayâs market are struggling to save for down payments and qualify for mortgages. Most first-time buyers still depend on personal savings for at least some of their down payments, but rising rental prices have complicated the task of socking away money for a down payment.        Rising rental rates are complicating things as well Rental rates are causing 46% of renters aged 25-34 to spend more than 40% of their income on rent, up from 30% a decade earlier.        Job security is important to millennial buyers The Money Source, a mortgage lender, examined applications from 5,404 millennial buyers and found that these buyers averaged nearly 4.5 years in their field of work and had held their current job for slightly more than three years. Those figures point to how critical career stability is to a younger generation.  Thanks for joining me today. If you want to read the full article, click above.

Itâs essential that when you show your home to buyers, itâs clean, organized, and decluttered. Youâll want to empty out your closets, or at the very least, get them organized.One thing you can do to get organized is put up shoe hangers in your doors, and store everyday items inside them such as cleaning supplies, utensils, or anything else that you can fit in them.Another way to cut down on clutter is to use labels, or pick up storage bins to keep items like cords or wires in.A tip for organizing your closet is to divide your clothes into four different sections: hang, sell, donate, keep, and fold. Once you have something marked out for every category, you can then organize your closet in any way you see fit. Hereâs an extra tip: you can use belt hangers to hang your necklaces and other jewelry.I just thought this video would be useful for organizing your home, whether youâre selling or if you just want to tidy up a bit.If you need any assistance with staging, decluttering, or selling, please donât hesitate to contact me!",

        "content": "If you are looking to sell your home, your goal is to get the most money possible in the shortest amount of time. One of the best ways to add value and appeal to your home is through home staging. Home staging is the art of selling a home faster by making a home more appealing to the right buyer. You have a lot of options for how you want to go about it. You could hire a professional staging company, which could be substantially costly. However, most of the time, a few simple fixes is all it takes to transform a living room.Today we are going to go through some of our most favorite, inexpensive home staging tips for you. We hope these will help you save both time and money when it comes time to sell your home.A fresh coat of paint is always a good idea. Neutral, warm colors work best for highlighting the natural light in your home. This will make it easier to brighten the room with some colorful accessories and pull everything together.A common design problem facing many homeowners is that they have no real entry way, as their front door opens up to the living room. To fix this, you can add a table, some lighting, and a rug to âfake a foyerâ and make it feel like the living room and entryway are two different spaces.A patterned rug, some pillows, or bright curtains add a ton of texture and an eclectic layer to the space, which is essential to a well-designed room.In some cases, a âmake-underâ is just what you need. In the case of most fireplaces, taking some accessories and clutter away enhances the look and feel of the room greatly.You could spend well over a few thousand dollars with a staging company, or you could do these fixes yourself for around $500. Thatâs a small investment considering the value that you add to your home by adding those pieces.If you have any questions for us about staging your home or anything else real estate related, give us a call or send over a quick email.

We hire John from time to time to help us with appraisals for many of our sellers, so we wanted to introduce him to you today and have him answer a few questions you may have about what appraisers do.John has been a licensed appraiser for 12 years and has helped us with many appraisals over the years. Agents hire him because his forte is to help us to determine where the sale price should be set. Heâs an independent appraiser who works for sellers and buyers, which is different from a bank appraiser who works for banks.Below is some of the most common questions people have about the appraisal process.What is an appraiser?An appraiser is a real estate professional who specializes in providing opinions of home value (appraisals). Professional appraisers have taken courses and been supervised during their training period. State licensed and certified appraisers must pass a test and have completed basic education and continuing education. Most states also require a period of supervision, usually 2,000 hours before being able to do appraisals âon your own.âWhat do appraisers really do?When an appraiser inspects a home, the inspection is really the âtip of the icebergâ of the work they do. Before going to the house, they should research public records information, get a plat map, check the zoning and flood data, and print out sales and listings of similar homes. During the inspection, it is important to make a drawing of the home and other improvements such as a swimming pool and make notes on physical characteristics such as floor coverings and built-in appliances.After completing the inspection, an appraiser selects comparable sales and listings and contact the real estate agent for more information on the sales terms, condition of the home, reconcile conflicting information from different data sources, and write up the report.âConsider the purpose of the appraisal and the type of property, and hire an appraiser with experience in the property type, geographic area of the property, and other similar purposes.âWhen do you need your own appraiser?When getting a mortgage loan, the lender selects the appraiser. Property owners, buyers, and sellers, or their attorneys, often hire their own appraisers to determine a fair sales price.What should you look for when hiring an appraiser?Consider the purpose of the appraisal and the type of property, and hire an appraiser with experience in the property type, geographic area of the property, and other similar purposes.Weâd like to give a big thanks to John for joining us today.

The main advantage with a law firm is that they can provide you with personal legal counsel and can interpret many different contracts for you. Many other companies have lawyers on staff while others simply outsource as needed but will remain neutral should a legal dispute arise. At the Gresh Group, we highly recommended those companies with at least 1 full time, employed lawyer on staff that we can connect directly with should an issue arise. (delete - Susanâs office will work to make your settlement much easier and less painful, and they will fill you in on what is happening throughout the entire process.)Susan has been handling settlements and settling real estate disputes for over 35 years. Her goal is to give you a smooth transition from purchase to sale. Susanâs office is just 10 minutes away from ours, and she is always able to help buyer and sellers in Northern Virginia.If you would like to know more about Susan or how she might be able to help you, then please feel free to contact her at 703-506-9440 or SPesner@PesnerKawamoto.com.As always, contact me at 703-636-3588 or Janet@TheGreshGroup.com with any questions or concerns about real estate in Northern Virginia.",

        "content": "The National Association of Realtors says that 90% of home buyers begin their home search online. The same is true for sellers, who try to determine an accurate price for their home by searching for similar homes online. There are a lot of advantages in doing this, but there are also huge disadvantages with using these websites.The most commonly used websites are Zillow, Trulia, and Realtor.com. Have you ever wondered why these websites exist? They exist to make money, and they are making money off of you and your data. When you register for these websites, they take your information, compile it, and then sell it to Realtors who are looking for leads. They sell zip codes to real estate agents all across the country just from the information that you freely provide them.The major disadvantage of these websites to you is that their information is simply inaccurate. Their goal is to show as many homes as possible, and that means that they will post homes that are listed, under contract, and also properties that have already been sold. These websites also estimate the value of homes, and these estimates are wildly inaccurate. Zillow will actually tell you how accurate their home prices are if you scroll down to the bottom of the page. When I did this, Zillow actually told me that their home prices for the Washington DC area were 90% wrong! That is huge.The only way to ensure that youâre getting accurate information is to pick up the phone and call a real estate agent such as myself. We have access to accurate and updated listings that websites cannot offer you. As soon as a property comes onto the market, we can send it to you so that you have the best chance of getting the home that you want.If youâre interested in purchasing a home in Northern Virginia, Maryland, or Washington DC, then please call me at 703-636-3588.

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "I am often asked whether someone should rent or buy when they move here to the Washington, D.C. area. My answer is always to tell people that purchasing a home is the best option, especially if you will be here for more than 3 or 4 years. I have 5 great reasons why itâs more beneficial to purchase rather than to rent.      Mortgages are cheap: Interest rates are historically low right now, and even with the fluctuations in the market they have remained very, very affordable. Instead of pouring money into a rental property, why donât you put it towards a long term investment like a home?        You can Live the Way You Want: When you own your home, you will not need permission to have pets, remodel, or repaint your property. You can live the way that you like, and this is important to us as realtors because we like to help you achieve your goals.        You can Build good Credit: When you rent, the only information that gets reported to a crediting agency is if you missed a payment or not. If youâre looking to build your credit, then renting will only allow your score to stagnate or drop even further. Buying a home will help you bolster your credit.        You can Build Equity: Paying your mortgage is like paying into your savings account for long-term equity. Home values go up and down, but around here in the Washington, D.C. area, home values have increased 3-4% every year, so this is a good area to purchase in.        Tax Advantages: The primary advantage here is that you get to write off the mortgage interest. You would have to talk to an accountant to get all the details, but the tax benefits more than offset what you would be paying in rent.  Be sure to check out this article that further proves my point: http://money.cnn.com/gallery/real_estate/2014/03/03/buy-vs-rent/8.htmlIt is 34% cheaper to buy in Washington, D.C. than to rent, so this statistic alone should help to convince you!Also, donât forget to contact me with any questions, concerns, or comments you might have about real estate in the Washington, D.C. area.

While itâs not fun paying taxes, you should know that these payments go towards funding all of the community services that we love and need most like schools, street maintenance, and having firefighters and policemen.So, what are Tax Assessments?These are assessments carried out on your home by a county assessor to gauge what you should be paying in property taxes. The value of your home will be used to determine your property taxes owed on it, which is calculated by the tax rate.Here in Fairfax, these tax assessments have been:   - 5.8% higher for single family homes   - 8.4% higher for town homes.   - 10.5% higher for condos.   - Tax rates are only allowed to rise a certain amount over a certain period of time, so donât worry if you think your taxes are high this year, they should be around the same amount in coming years.Click here to find out more information regarding tax assessments in the Virginia area!What does this mean for you?This means that you may be paying more in taxes, or it means that you might not be experiencing any increase in taxes, it all depends on your tax base. Also, keep in mind that a tax assessment does not correlate to a true market value for your home. Sometimes assessments are only carried out every few years, so do not rely on a value from a tax assessment to determine the market value of your home.Whether youâre buying or selling a home in Fairfax county, please contact me because I am your #1 resource for real estate.

        "content": "The simple answer is âno.â Putting an ad out and installing signs typically notifies noisy neighbors and unqualified buyers âwho are just curiousâ to tour your home. Agents who like to hold them this way, are going after making relationships with these people to get more business.The reality is, qualified buyers donât typically show during open houses. Most others go through with their agent for a private showing at a different time to avoid the crowd.But that doesnât mean ALL open houses are just a lead generating pool for agents.  A successful open house includes sending invitations to agents along with qualified buyers. Then afterwards, following up with them and asking for offers or feedback. This way targets qualified buyers and their agents by highlighting the best features of your home. This is especially important if your home has some very unique features.Another open house that typically gets less spotlight is a Brokerâs open. Unlike public open houses, this is held on a Tuesday just for brokers and agents to do a preview tour for their clients and is typically held just before or just after going on the market.In our current market of low inventory, this is especially a great idea to get the serious buyerâs agents through before going public. In the Northern Virginia area, Iâve seen more houses sell this way with great, solid deals then with a public open house. On that note, the same invitation and follow up rules apply. A great, active agent outsells the passive agent who just advertises.

Earlier in the year first time homebuyers accounted for 40 percent of the home sales, while now they make up only 28 percent.So what does this mean for you as a seller? Didnât you tell me in your last blog now is a great time to sell? Yes and it still is. We are entering more of a balanced market. What it really comes down to is your location, price, and level of condition â with great pictures and staging (as I mentioned in my home ready tips blog).And if you were one of the buyers who walked away from the market â whether you were frustrated of getting out bid or the lack of inventory, we have the tools to find you the right home because it may not even be on the market yet.But donât take our promises, our numbers prove it.

What are your needs?Selling during the winter months is a great idea. In fact, I have 10 reasons why you can be confident that your home will sell if you list now.      People looking for a home during the Holiday season are usually serious buyers.        Serious buyers have fewer houses to choose from during the Holidays. Less competition means more bargaining power for you!        Since the supply of listings will increase dramatically in January, your home will face more competition after the holidays which means less money for you!        Houses often show better when tastefully decorated for the Holidays.        Buyers are more emotional during the Holidays. They are more likely to pay your price!        Buyers have more time to look for a home during the Holidays than they do during the typical working time of year.        For tax reasons, some people must buy before the end of the year.        January is traditionally the month for employees to begin new jobs. Since they would prefer to buy now rather than wait until the spring, your home has first shot at these new buyers.        If your home sells during the Holidays we can provide a delayed closing and/or a post-settlement occupancy agreement to give you more time in the home if you need it.        By selling during the Holidays you are perfectly positioned to be a fully qualified buyer in Spring, when many more homes are on the market for less money. You actually can sell higher and buy lower by selling over the Holidays and buying in the Spring.  These are just  few good reasons to list your home during the holidays. You can download the 10 Reason to List During the Holidays here.So if you are ready to sell or know anyone else looking to put their home on the market, give me a call.

        "content": "The government shutdown is here. Whether itâs not being able to get a new Social Security card or visit a national park, Americans will immediately feel the effects. But thereâs one bright spot of the economy that stands to be affected as well: housing.One of the biggest questions regarding the shutdown and how it will affect housing has revolved around the mortgage market, specifically prospective buyersâ access to new home loans. After all, more than 90% of all loan activity is underwritten, insured, or owned by the government and its affiliated entities.Initially at least, the mortgage market is likely to be only minimally impacted. New loans will continue to push through most government agency pipelines. What will change is how long the process takes, as many agencies expect to experience delays.Mortgages purchased and securitized by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be unaffected because their operations are paid for by fees charged to lenders. And the Department of Veterans Affairs will continue to guarantee mortgages for Americans that have served in the military since these loans are funded by user fees as well.But if the government shutdown of 1995-1996 is any indicator, the process will take longer than usual. âLoan Guaranty certificates of eligibility and certificates of reasonable value were delayed,â the VA warned in its September 25th contingency plan.Where there has been mounting concern is the Federal Housing Administration, which currently endorses about 15% of the entire single-family mortgage market. Several media outlets recently reported that the FHA would be unable to endorse any single-family loans and that no staff would be available underwrite and approve new loans.That prospect would be somewhat worrisome â if it were actually true. The FHAâs Office of Single Family Housing will indeed remain open for business, albeit with a smaller staff. âFHA will be able to endorse single family loans during the shutdown. A limited number of FHA staff will be available to underwrite and approve new loans,â the report now states. In other words, other lendersâ loans will continue to be insured and some in-house lending will continue to take place at a reduced rate.The reason for that mix-up: the initial draft of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Developmentâs contingency plan mistakenly stated that single-family loan operations would cease. The report was amended over the weekend.The FHAâs single-family loan operations are funded through multi-year appropriations, meaning their budget is not tied to the governmentâs standoff over funding for the new fiscal year that starts in October. On the other hand, what will be more affected is the agencyâs Multifamily Housing Office, which is funded through yearly appropriations.âBecause we are able to endorse loans, we donât expect the impact on the housing market to be significant, as long as the shutdown is brief,â continues the HUD report. âIf the shutdown lasts and our commitment authority runs out, we do expect that potential homeowners will be impacted, as well as home sellers and the entire housing market.âOne government lender that will indeed suspend its home loan activity, however, is the Department of Agriculture. The USDA says that no new housing loans or guarantees will be issued through its Rural Development programs in a shutdown. The department also warns that such a scenario could cause âa setback in construction start-up,â and if the shutdown lasts for an extended period, âa substantial reduction in housing available in rural areas relative to population.ââThe government doesnât generally approve loans, they basically just insure them,â says Don Frommeyer, president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers and a vice president at Amtrust Mortgage Funding. âFor the most part you arenât going to see much of a hit in the mortgage market unless it goes for a long period of time.âIf it does stretch on, he adds, the worry will be what mortgage rates do in a market shrouded in fiscal uncertainty and how that will affect the home buying, especially in light of recent rate spikes.Home lending aside, many economists and real estate experts are keeping a close watch on how Americans will react to this shutdown. âAdministratively everything should keep moving along, but itâs more about the confidence of consumers and whether they perceive that the government shutdown could lead to a recession,â says Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.Moodyâs Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi recently told the Senate Budget Committee that a partial shutdown could shave as much as 1.4 percentage points off of fourth quarter economic growth if it drags on for several weeks.Americansâ confidence in their ability to buy and sell homes hit a record high in May, according to a Fannie Mae survey. Since then, as mortgage rates jumped more than a percentage point, that confidence level has plateaued.  If prospective homebuyers fear that the countryâs economic recovery will stall, or worse slip back into recession, they will pull back on purchases, worries Yun.âHome sales is always the first housing variable that changes so one would see sales declining and that would naturally lead to more inventory on the market and eventually put pressure on prices,â he says. But that would be a worst-case scenario based on a long-term shutdown.Jed Kolko, chief economist at Trulia TRLA +6.43%, notes that if the shutdown lasts longer than a few days, the first places to feel the impact will be local economies with large concentrations of federal government workers. Metro areas like Washington, D.C. and Bethesda, Md., where 19% and 13% respectively of total local wages go to federal employees, would be the feel the negative effects of unpaid furloughs and with them, tightened consumer spending and weakening local economic growth. Though not all will be equally affected, other metro areas like Virginia Beach, Va., Honolulu, Hawaii, and Dayton, Ohio are areas that Kolko is keeping an eye on: âWhether there is a big effect depends on how long the shutdown lasts, how long people think the shutdown lasts, and whether people get back-pay. All those things matter for the impact.âStill others are worrying even more about the next fiscal standoff, in  mid-October, surrounding the debt ceiling debate and its accompanying threat of debt default by the U.S.  âWith the threat of an impending partial government shutdown and yet another battle over the nationâs debt ceiling, in particular, we are really messing with fire right nowâeven if it doesnât seem to bother some legislators,â says Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow.âBut the effects of a government default associated with the impending debt-ceiling deadline would be more pronounced because of its greater impact on domestic and international markets. This will rattle consumers and investors alike, slow down the overall economic recovery and further slow the housing recovery, which is already undergoing a moderation in the pace of home value gains due to rising mortgage rates,â he warns.From: ForbesBy:  Morgan Brennan, Forbes Staff",

In the last part of this two part video series I talk about the last four questions you should ask a listing agent before hiring them.Are you an area specialist?

We want to help everyone and we need to know our entire market.Do you have an assistant or team?Many agents are solo agents. Any agent you hire should have at least one assistant. You need an agent who can focus all their time on getting your home sold, not on paperwork.The Gresh Group has an experienced, trained staff to handle paperwork, office duties and other background noise while the agents focus on getting your home sold.Are you an active or passive agent?There are two types of agents. Some agents just put your home on the MLS and wait for buyers to show up. This is a passive agent.Others, like The Gresh Group, are active. We execute a first class multi-media marketing plan; we actively seek buyers from our own client base and from a large pool of like-minded active agents. We donât wait for it to happen, we make it happen!What is your Brokerâs share of the market?Some agents will tell you this doesnât matter.

The Gresh Group sold 50 homes last year! Over the past 10 years, weâve sold 450 homes and we can provide a list to prove it!In how many of those transactions did you represent the buyer? In how many did you represent the seller?The average agent represents buyers 80 percent of the time and sellers only 20 percent of the time.Because we represent sellers 50 percent of the time and buyers 50 percent of the time, we have the experience and knowledge of how to sell your home more than most agents out there.Plus we have a rental assistant if you are looking to rent a property!Can you give me references for the last 10 clients whose properties you successfully listed and sold? Specifically contact information such as name, location, phone number and date closed?Itâs important for you to check references. Keep in mind that that the average real estate agent has only been in the business for 11 months.Do you currently hold any other occupation(s) besides selling real estate? What other activities are you involved in outside of selling real estate?Selling your home is a huge decision; you want someone who is committed 100% to marketing your home and getting it sold.Most agents are part time and sell real estate as a way to supplement their income. You donât want an agent who fits selling your home into their schedule.

        "content": "Homeowners Insurance is great â it covers a lot of things like fire, theft and vandalism â and in case there is a storm that causes significant damage, the policyâs right there to protect the owner.  But what about a policy that looks after the interests of the property while it listed on the market and one that works to the advantage of both sides of the buying and selling fence?  A home warranty is a perfect supplement to a homeownerâs insurance policy and it broadens the overall coverage in a variety of ways.  Here is a rundown of the variances between the two and how a seller getting a warranty policy on their home for sale is a great tool!The Benefits of a Home Warranty PolicyWhile home insurance largely covers catastrophic incidences and damage, a home warranty policy goes far beyond in that it address the home including wear and tear items.  Also, maintenance and repair is typically includes in a home warranty policy.  As a selling tool, this is fantastic, because during the process â or even after the home is sold â for up to 13 months, the areas of the home covered under the policy are warranted.  Oftentimes, a buyer will come across an issue with something in the home that could become a deal breaker but with the added peace of mind of a warranty, the seller can sit back and relax knowing that most things will likely be covered.  Examples of things that fall into range of coverage on a home warranty are flooring, plumbing systems, electrical systems, and wear and tear of these areas plus also the furnace and in come cases, the roofing or other major components of the home.Home Insurance Policy AdvantagesThe single biggest difference between a home warranty versus a home owners insurance policy is that the latter covers the basic replacement value in general if there is a major catastrophe such as a storm that cause damage, fire, theft or vandalism or personal liability.  There is not personal liability coverage under the home warranty policy, rather it focuses on the âusedâ contents of the home.How a Home Warranty Policy Helps in a Real Estate TransactionHome Warranty of America is a company that provides very good coverage under their policy (for a list of their benefits, click here) including 13-months of free seller coverage, with coverage beginning on the first of their home being listed for sale.  The free coverage period for the seller lasts for up to 180 days and the policy is only paid for upon sale of the home at closing.  The best part of a home warranty policy is that even after the buyer has taken possession of the property, the coverage continues.  That means that as a seller, you will not have to contend with any last minutes issues that can and do come up. When applying for the warranty, be sure to choose coverage that address all potential concerns you may have for the home so that if there were a need for repairs or coverage, you would have it provided as a benefit.An industry association held a study in which it was determined that not only do homes sell up to 50% faster when there is a home warranty policy in place, but also the selling price typically comes within three percent of the list price.  In todayâs real estate market â this is an advantage that any seller would want to avail!",

        "content": "The Federal Housing Agency (FHA) doesnât directly offer loans. Instead, its purpose is to provide mortgage insurance for Americans to purchase or refinance a principal residence.To put it another way, the mortgage loans are funded by private lending institutions (mortgage companies, banks, savings and loan associations, etc.), and those mortgages are then insured by FHA/HUD.The Benefits of FHA LoansIf you qualify as a prospective homeowner, these loans have three great benefits. First of all, your down payments are lower. Second, closing costs are also lower. And, finally, itâs easier to qualify for credit.Who Qualifies?FHA has programs for:â¢ First-home buyersâ¢ Seniorsâ¢ Fixer uppersâ¢ Manufactured housing and mobile homesâ¢ Energy efficiency, etc.If youâre a first-time home buyer, a FHA loan can be a good deal for you. See the eligibility requirements below. Later, Iâll cover the fixer-upper category requirements. Check with the FHA on other programs.First-Home Buyer ProgramsThese programs have the following eligibility requirements:â¢ You must meet standard FHA credit qualifications (judged by the individualâs credit record).â¢ Youâre eligible for approximately 97% financing.â¢ Youâre able to finance the upfront mortgage insurance premium into the mortgage.â¢ Youâre also responsible for paying an annual premium.â¢ Within this category, the eligible properties are one-to-four unit structures. As of this writing, the highest maximum FHA mortgage is $362,790 while the lowest maximum amount is $200,160.The 203(k) Program for Fixer-UppersThe 203(k) program issues loans to allow you to buy or refinance a property. In the loan, you can also include the cost of making the repairs and improvements.The loans are provided through approved mortgage lenders nationwide, and theyâre available to buyers wanting to occupy the home.The down payment requirement for an owner-occupant (or a nonprofit organization or government agency) equals about 3% of the acquisition and repair costs of the property.There are several steps to obtaining such a loan:â¢ You find a fixer-upper and sign a sales contract after doing a feasibility analysis of the property with a realtor.â¢ The contract should state that youâre seeking a 203(k) loan. It should also state the contract is contingent on loan approval based on additional required repairs by the FHA or the lender.â¢ You then select an FHA-approved 203(k) lender and arrange for a detailed proposal showing the scope of work to be done. The proposal should include a detailed cost estimate on each repair or improvement of the project.â¢ The appraisal determines the value of the property after renovation.â¢ If you pass the lenderâs credit-worthiness test, the loan closes for an amount that will cover the purchase or refinance cost of the property, the remodeling costs and the allowable closing costs.â¢ The amount of the loan also includes a contingency reserve of 10% to 20% of the total remodeling costs. Itâs used to cover any extra work not included in the original proposal.â¢ At closing, the seller of the property is paid off and the remaining funds are put in an escrow account to pay for the repairs and improvements during the rehabilitation period.â¢ The mortgage payments and remodeling begin after the loan closes.You can decide to have up to six mortgage payments (PITI) put into the cost of rehabilitation if the property is not going to be occupied during construction, but it cannot exceed the length of time itâs estimated to take to complete the rehab.â¢ Escrowed funds are released to the contractor during construction through a series of draw requests for completed work.â¢ To ensure completion of the job, 10% of each draw is held back; this money is paid after the lender determines there will be no liens on the property.Whew, somewhat complicated, isnât it? Well, weâre dealing with a government program! But, FHA loans can be a good deal for you, and Iâm available to guide you throughout the entire process. Just give me a call today!",

        "content": "There are some common misconceptions floating around about there not being enough money in the bank when it comes to mortgages.  This could not be further from the truth.  Lenders have plenty of money.  Sure, they are being more careful about who they lend it to and yes they are definitely making sure all iâs are dotted and tâs crossed.  But hereâs the thing:  do you want to have to jump through hoops of fire or would you rather sail through the mortgage loan process smoothly?With our special report that shares with you the real estate industryâs insider information on the top reasons loans go awry, you can avoid having to go back to the drawing board over and over again and ultimately risk losing your loan (and your dream house) in the end.Accuracy of Information is KeyAs you sign your loan application you will notice that there is a mountain of paperwork.  One of the most damaging things to a loan app however is when there are discrepancies within the paperwork.  As long as you can vouch for your information, provide accurate and updated data and support it with plenty of documentation â your loan application should not suffer any major delays or cancellation.  This applies to basic information such as names and aliases to employment history to past judgments or other negative financial factors that you need to report.Incomplete forms and less-than-adequate supporting documentation such as W2s or payroll stubs are just one of reasons a loan officer will move on to the next borrowerâs paperwork.  It is important not to be offended if you have to provide a lot of details.  When it comes to things like the source of your extra income, where and from whom you received cash gifts or other sensitive information like that, a lot of homebuyers get squeamish.  In fact, borrowers should be prepared to do a lot of âexplainingâ through what loan officers call Letters of Explanation for things that are not crystal clear or cut and dry.  And there are a lot of things that simply do not add up without an explanation at hand.Processing Makes PerfectAnyone that has gone through the process of applying for a mortgage knows that it takes time.  Even if every single aspect of the app were perfect it would still take time.  Some delays can be avoided, all of which can be done by making sure there are no outstanding liens on the home, providing and being able to confirm the source for all funds used in the transaction and ensuring all necessary repairs are done in advance.One of the most frustrating aspects of going through a mortgage loan process is when a step adds days and days to the timeline.  With each item that needs further clarification, additional investigation or more, more time is added and more frustration ensues.  The single best way to avoid this problem is to provide as much information as possible from the start.(Almost) Everything Can Be FixedBy working with the right Realty and mortgage team you can turn around most of the issues that come up as roadblocks in the process.  It takes time but it can be done.

There are some things that can be placed on the back burner during the move in process.  With these five easy tips on moving into a new home, you can be sure to have your house as safe and cost efficient as possible.Change the LocksAt closing time, the seller of a house turns over the keys to the new owners.  Many times, though, the previous owner will have given a spare key to a friend or neighbor in case of emergency.  Enlist a locksmith to come to the house and change all of the locks and get new keys made.  This final transition from one owner to the next will give the new homeowner peace of mind.Reprogram Your Garage Door RemoteAlong with changing the locks of your home, reprograming your garage door remote will ensure the safety of your house.  Depending on the brand of remote, steps in reprograming it may differ, but the process is simple for nearly all brands.  Most remotes have a âLearnâ button, which you must hold until the indicator light blinks.  While the indicator light blinks, press the button on your remote.  This should reprogram your garage door opener remote.  If this does not work, contact your remote manufacturer or local hardware store for assistance.Change Your Homeâs Air FiltersMost air filter manufacturers recommend that you change the HVAC air filters once every month. Due to the increased amount of activity of moving furniture in and out of the house, a larger concentration of dust will collect in the ventilation system.   In order to improve the air quality in your home and increase heating and cooling efficiency, make sure you change your air filters right when you move in.Install New Batteries in Smoke AlarmsWhen a person is selling their home, there are many different procedures they must do to ensure that it is ready for sale.  Often times, during the stress of the home selling process, the smoke alarms are forgot about.  Ensure the safety of your home and family by changing the batteries in the smoke detectors when you move into a new house.  This cheap and quick home improvement has the potential to save your familyâs life.Replace Toilet Seat CoversWe probably donât need to go into specific details. but most people insist on swapping toilet seats.",

        "content": "âPerform due diligence!â is the one law you should never break in any kind of real estate deal â residential, multi-occupant, or commercial!What is due diligence? Itâs a common phrase for the evaluation of a property and its surrounding environment before you commit to buying it.Due diligence has two objectives. First, you want to reduce or eliminate risk! Needless to say, youâll be assuming a large loan and will want to know exactly whatâs right or wrong with a property before you sink any money into it.Two, due diligence allows you to uncover real bargains, especially for investors. On the surface, one property may look like a âloser,â but a closer inspection may reveal that the building is structurally sound and requires only minor and inexpensive maintenance and repairs.One part of due diligence is what youâd expect â the physical inspection of the property and inspection of all documents and records concerning that specific property. The other part is the inspection of the documents and records concerning that property.In this article, Iâll just talk about the physical inspection portion of due diligence.Physical Inspection of PropertiesBelow, Iâve listed all the inspection tasks which should be performed by a professional inspector. Of course, you should visit the property as well. Many times, a quick âeyeballingâ can reveal any obvious signs or poor maintenance or decay - a leaky roof, wet basement, foundation cracks, cracks in the walls, plumbing leaks, etc.. In those cases, youâll know you donât need to waste any further time on that property.As I mentioned earlier, such an inspection may reveal that youâve actually got a bargain on your hands instead of a âdog.â In such a case, youâll want to purchase or invest in that property quickly.What happens when you find problems in a property and still like it? Well, then, you can require that the seller correct those problems or reduce the price before you sign any contract.In general, defects fall into two categories. One category contains the obvious defects â wet basements, peeling paint, broken windows, leaky plumbing, warped floors, etc.The other category contains the more expensive and dangerous hidden defects. These can include corroded pipes in the walls, roof or window leaks that donât show up until it rains or snows, subtle cracks in the foundation.Obviously, you want to make sure these hazards are spotted before you ever sign a purchase agreement. They can cost you a lot of money in the long run, not to mention the fact that they can send your blood pressure through the roof!What Do Professional Inspectors Look For?Below are the items inspectors examine when they check a property:â¢ Overall structural integrityâ¢ Property drainage/landscapingâ¢ Walks and drivesâ¢ Foundation, footings, crawl space, basements, sub-flooring, decksâ¢ Exterior walls, siding, trimâ¢ Windows, doors, cabinets, countersâ¢ Gutters, downspoutsâ¢ Roof, roof shingles, roof structures. chimneys, atticâ¢ Floors, walls, ceilings, etc.â¢ HVAC systemsâ¢ Plumbing systems, (fixtures, supply lines, drains, water heating devices, etc.)â¢ Electrical system (wiring, service panel, devices, and service capacityâ¢ Energy conservation/safety Itemsâ¢ Insulation &amp; ventilationâ¢ Moisture intrusion/moldAnd, of course, we canât forget the voracious appetites ofâ¦.bugs!Pest Control InspectionDepending on the area of the country in which you live, insects can cause a heckuva lot of damage to a property!Iâm talking about such bugs as termites, carpenter ants, powder post beetles, and any other insect that likes to munch on wood. Then, thereâs fungus, in the form of âdry rot.â It can also cause a lot of destruction.In such cases, youâll need to hire the services of a specialist (pest control inspector) to examine the property.If the operator identifies any problems, he or she should provide you with a diagram that pinpoints the location of the infestations. If serious problems exist, they need to be corrected immediately! The expense is usually paid for by the seller.To protect yourself against any of the problems I mentioned above, ensure that the purchase contract provides for cancellation without penalty or loss of money if the physical condition of the property doesnât meet standards.",

        "content": "Owning a home can be a daunting undertaking for first-time homebuyers. But if you are like countless others right now wanting to get in on the action and move into the home of their dreams, you have to be ready to take on the task.  During the current ideal market conditions that make it a great time for buyers there are a few things you can do make sure your experience is as fruitful as possible.  Here are three insider tips on how you can secure a great place, for a fantastic price â without making any serious mistakes in the process.Make Sure the Price Is RightNothing can be more disheartening than to find out you have overpaid on a home.  With todayâs rollercoaster real estate market the best way to be sure you are not overpaying â is to have a professional appraisal done and to ask your Realtor to do some comps.  By comparing like-kind properties that were recently sold in the same neighborhood, you can get a good idea of what your property should be priced at.  And at the negotiation table, both the homeâs appraisal and comps will work to corroborate your offer.Do Your Home (Inspection) WorkInexperienced homebuyers stand to risk getting more than what they bargained for if they do not take the proper precautions before signing on the dotted line that makes them homeowners.  Even though it may seem tedious and at times feel like an unnecessary expense, the importance of having one or more home inspections done is pivotal to the home purchase process.  The last thing you want to do is to forego an inspection only to learn when it is too late that there were too many serious problems to contend with.  Depending on where you are doing your home search, any number of inspections should be completed prior to going under contract.It is standard procedure to have a regular home inspection completed.  In fact, many lenders require an inspection as part of the lending process before they will grant you a mortgage.  But there are several areas of a home that do not fall within the parameters of a normal home inspection.  Wood infestation, for example, can be a major hazard and if there is a serious problem it can be very costly to manage it.  Radon gas is extremely unsafe, hazardous gas that can wreak havoc on the health occupants of a home or surrounding areas.  Find out from your home inspector what is and what is not covered and after consulting with your Realtor to investigate other potential hazards in the area, it is a good idea to have additional testing conducted as well.Carefully Choose Who You Want To Owe MoneyThere are myriad lending choices out there but only a handful of companies that provide professional, timely and effective lending services.  At a time when mortgage processes are heavily scrutinized, it is important that you find a reputable lender that values you as a client and simultaneously values your time.  Even though some companies may try to lure you with lower interest rates and low fees, at the end of the day they get that money somewhere in the process but the homeowner usually ends up paying the price.~Regardless of where you are searching for your dream home, what your budget is or how you plan on financing the purchase â it is essential to work with an experienced Realtor.  Not only will you benefit from their knowledge but also you will be able to avoid making any major mistakes when fulfilling your dream of homeownership.",

        "title": "Most Frequently Asked Questions About Refinancing Your Home",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Many people tend to oversee the fact that when interest rates are low, they have a significant impact on more than just people buying a home.  Low interest rates, in fact, have a HUGE impact on the overall cost on a mortgage so when people refinance their existing properties under lower rates it translates to thousands and thousands of dollars in savings.  Not only that, if these same homeowners who opt to have their homes refinanced also reduce the term on their mortgage, the savings are unprecedented.To help explain some of the most widely asked aspects of the refinancing process, here is a list of questions and answers that shed light on the issues that will help you in determining whether refinancing is right for you.What Are Some Reasons To Have Your Mortgage Refinanced?The current real estate market today is experiencing all-time low, historic interest rates on mortgages.  For many professionals in the industry, this is the first time they have witnessed rates at this level.  Reasons for obtaining refinancing on a property include reducing interest rates, reducing the overall term on the mortgage i.e. going from a 30-year loan term to a 20-year term and also to be able to leverage equity that is held up in an existing property.How Does A Term Reduction Look On Paper?When the number of years of a mortgage loan is reduced, also called a term reduction, payments may or may not remain the same but the time within which the loan must be paid off is significantly less.  For example, a previous mortgage at 6% for a 30-year term can be refinanced at 3.5% payable in 15 years, which adds up to a savings of hundreds of thousands of dollars and reduces many years off the loan repayment schedule.What Factors Go Into Eligibility For No Closing Costs Refinancing?Many mortgage companies are now crediting closing costs.  Though this is a facility that is scrutinized based on an applicantâs eligibility, the savings add up. Eligibility is determined based on specific criteria including the applicantâs credit report and credit score, plus whether or not there is a second mortgage.  Credit score expectations are within the low to mid 700 range, with the higher score translating to better concessions.How Does A Loan Officer Decide On A Refinance Application?Each borrowerâs situation is different.  Mortgage lenders consider what the loanâs value is, the credit scores, home value and how the market is performing such as in a depreciating market.What Is PMI And Can I Avoid It In A Refinance?Private Mortgage Insurance, or PMI, is required by lenders of most homeowners that borrow at least 80% of the homeâs value.  It works as a protective measure in case of default. In cases where the current mortgage is owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, there is a provision for appraisal relief that can result in exemption from PMI.What Is The Typical Time Frame For A Refinance Process?Most applications take about 4-6 weeks if it is a straightforward case. If there is a second mortgage it involves another bank and entails coordination and additional time for processing.Can I Use Refinancing For Leverage In The Market?Refinancing would unlock any equity in your home, allowing you the leverage to use those funds in a new purchase.  Not only will it boost the sale process on a new home but it could also eliminate the need for PMI if you put at least 20% down.What Documents Are Required For The Initial Consultation?In order to initiate the application process, people applying for a refinance should produce the last two paycheck stubs, W2 statements from the previous two years and the previous two monthsâ bank statements.~Regardless of if you are selling, refinance should be considered to be able to reduce monthly payments on a home.  This is also a good time for investors to cash in on the opportunity. For a customized assessment, it is advisable to consult with your Realtor.",

        "title": "Top Home Improvement Projects; Understanding How Enhancements Impact Your Bottom Line ROI",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Everyone needs to value and protect his or her assets, especially with the current economic situation. One of the best ways to do this is to maintain, manage and make strides toward constant betterment. In a house this can mean any number of things. Whether you choose to enhance an existing bedroom, extend your kitchen, install new flooring in the basement or even replace the garage door â all these and significant others â are excellent ways to strengthen the value of your property. With these home improvement projects, you will enjoy continued returns on the investment that you make in your most cherished asset.How Does ROI Work?In real estate it is the formula that is used to compare the cost of remodeling projects with the value those projects will retain at resale. With a little time, energy and effort, you will undoubtedly get back lasting value, increased enjoyment and an enhanced return on your investment. In terms of home improvements, making adjustments to outdated areas of your home, will not only make the space more enjoyable to live in, but it will also increase the resale value of the property. So while it may seem costly to redo the entire kitchen cabinetry and countertops, the chance that you will recover most of the monies spent on the improvement are very high.Home Improvement Projects Yield Great ReturnsKitchensSince the kitchen is usually the area in a home that gets the most traffic, it is often one of the first aspects of a home that is judged during evaluation by buyers. Updated, modern and functional kitchens are an important selling feature. If yours is lacking in any of these areas, by embarking on a kitchen remodel project you will could see significant ROI. While the cost of improving a kitchen can be relatively high, the returns of as high as 72% make the initial investment bearable.Doors and WindowsOne of the easiest ways to change the look of a home while increasing its value at the same time is to update the doors and windows. Considering the growing penchant for energy-efficiency in homes, the installation of doors and windows with high-end, energy-efficient sealing and construction will be a welcome addition to any home. When you look at the amount of money saved each year on energy bills, that alone makes the decision to update this aspect of your house an easy one.Also with the growing security concerns many people are feeling these days, the confidence level of homeowners (and prospective buyers) will soar with the inclusion of solid, quality entry-exit points and windows. While there is a fluctuation based on the type of doors and windows on costs recouped from the initial expense, in general the returns are significant.A new and improved garage door is a significant change for the better in most homes and one that has seen a ROI of as much as 84%.Systems UpgradesIn many cases the core systems of a house, like the heating/cooling system or plumbing â tend not to be changed until they break down. When considering ways to improve a property, examine the condition of these systems and, if applicable, maintain or manage them to a level of improved function. If possible, replace parts or entire ensembles. The returns on these investments will be impressive.Cosmetic ChangesA fresh coat of paint can do more than just spruce up the look of your home. If you are in the market to sell your house, a simple yet highly impacting project like repainting the walls or installing new flooring in your home, can have an immediate impact on prospective buyers. The additional bargaining power you will get from making such adaptations will be more than worth it.Outdoor ElementsNot surprisingly, many people give great important to the quality and condition of decks and other outdoor spaces in a home. Whether this means your patio and recreation area, the landscaping or even the type and style of boundary fence â an often underestimated aspect of properties is outdoor care. According to Realtor Magazine, a deck addition can yield as much as nearly 73% return on investment.Structural EnhancementsThis is an often overlooked part of a home since itâs not really visible as much as the elements inside the house. As is the case with system-wide functions, the structural aspects are usually tended to when there is a need for major repairs. Prevention is one way to keep a roof, for example, in top condition and ready for any sudden burdens that may arise such as a storm. Siding is also important when determining a homeâs overall condition and one that cannot be ignored, especially when you plan to put your house on the market. The difference between having quality vinyl siding installed versus a less-than-desired state can be significant. With an ROI of as much as 70-80%, there is an excellent financial incentive to improve these areas as well.~No matter which area of your home you decide to improve, the results are unmistakable. Not only will the quality of your life be greatly enhanced but also when it does come time to sell, the value of your home will be significantly increased, giving you an exceptional ROI as a result of those home improvements.",

        "title": "Effectively Selling Your Property Through the Use of Four Winning Marketing Strategies ",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Everyone knows that when a seller puts a property on the market, they expect it to sell quickly and yield the best price possible.  But just how simple is that anyway when youâre dealing with the sort of market we are experiencing these days?  Unless carefully planned and well-thought out marketing techniques are not put into action, the chances of realizing the success you set out to achieve in this endeavor can be very shaky.  In this article, weâve gone through the four âPâsâ of Real Estate Marketing and outline each so you can see how together with your Realtor you can achieve phenomenal results despite the weak market.THE FOUR âPâS OF REAL ESTATE MARKETINGWith these four elements, real estate marketing cannot go wrong â Product preparation, Price, Place and Promotion.  With careful synergy of all four, a property will be attractive prior to sale, it will appeal to buyers as realistically affordable, get ample exposure to the market through relevant channels and be well promoted.Product â Your HouseIf you want to sell any big-ticket item, it has to be attractive to potential buyers.  When it comes to a house, you need to go the extra mile to make sure to accommodate a host of varying tastes and style preferences.  The walls of a bedroom painted very bright may not appeal to every possible buyer, for instance, plus also not everyone may appreciate pets and the accompanying environment that goes along with them.You should work to repair all loose ends, complete any outstanding maintenance that may be needed.  Also fix up the house so that when walk-throughs happen buyers are not distracted.  Clutter, personal items or other things that would get in the way of their ability to see themselves living in the home can be very distracting.Price â How Much Are You Asking?It is essential to price your home appropriately.  In todayâs market especially, buyers have a plethora of choices and if they are put off in the least by your pricing then you stand to risk losing that sale altogether. Instead, have your Realtor conduct a Comparative Market Analysis to determine exactly where your property stands in terms of housing value.  A CMA will also provide you the basis to provide potential buyers with the solid backing of how you arrived at your price and can be especially useful during negotiations.In addition to conducting CMAs, Realtors also perform a thorough analysis of your property, how it relates to other properties in the area, they look at an appreciation schedule and also gain insight on how your property performed overall in the market during your ownership.  This helps to center on a reasonably accurate price to sell your home.Placement â Who Is Being Exposed To Your Property Listing?Buyers hire Realtors to assist them in finding the home that is exactly right for them, based on their formula and expectations.  Agents who represent these buyers rely on being exposed to the properties that are out there.  Aside from their own channels, a sellerâs agent should work to expose the property for sale to any and all available channels so that buyers who may be interested are aware of your property for sale.  If a Realtor shortchanges a client on this aspect of the selling process, it can severely affect the chances of success merely because other homes will be in the forefront of those buyers instead.Promotion â What Are The Most Effective Ways of Promotion?The final step to effective real estate marketing is promotion.  This is not the same as placement, in that promotion works from all sides of the equation.  An experienced listing agent will bombard dozens and dozens of websites with your homeâs details, enticing possible buyers with professional photographs and colorful language.  Highlighting the best features of your home while downplaying less-than-desirable aspects are all tools used by an effective real estate marketer and one who understands the buyersâ market as well.Promotion is not just limited to listing a home on listing services.  Effective promotion, particularly these days utilizes technology like Facebook, real estate websites and more.  Also, word of mouth plays an important role in the success of a sale.~As with anything that entails professional analysis, it is important to select someone who has plenty of experience, is local and familiar with the area on a first-hand basis and someone you trust.  Realtors are not all created equal.  While some have been boasting sales for years and years, they may not have particular expertise in the areas that you need as a seller.  It is important to choose someone you know, trust and has a reputable background that is reliable and proven.",

        "content": "For many homeowners, selling their home is an event that usually only takes place once or maybe twice in their lifetime.  For this reason, the experience is completely foreign to them and they may be carrying old ways of thinking in terms of how to prepare the home for sale.  Where once some things may not have been a turn off to sellers, in the current marketplace there may very well be different standards.  It is highly recommended to consult with a professional prior to having any significant work done on a home â especially if the prospect selling the property is in the near or short-term future.  Here are a few reasons why homeowners should proceed with caution before embarking on any major repairs, renovation or remodeling their homes.New Owners May Not Have The Same TastesThough there are a few âclean slateâ type design looks that are fairly universal, one can never tell how potential buyers might react to particular design elements in a home.  Aside from keeping a fairly neutral color palette and updating kitchens and bathrooms to a modern state, generally less is more.  In some cases, sellers deliberately leave areas in their home that require a lot of work for their future buyers to contend with.  When rolled into negotiations, it can end up saving the sellers a lot of money while sparing buyers a lot of headache at the same time.Housing Values May Already Be Topped OffDepending on the market, your home may already be at the maximum limit in terms of value in the neighborhood.  If your home is already among the ones valued higher than other nearby homes, then putting in any more money toward the property could end up being a waste of money.  It is a good idea to leave some room for a home to increase in value over the years.  If there is a significant amount of investment made to improve the home but it falls outside of the value range for the neighborhood, it could be a huge turnoff to buyers resulting in fewer offers.Hidden Costs Could Surface During The RemodelIf you expect to sell your home soon, the last thing you want to do is to get involved in a lengthy renovation project only to discover that there are hidden issues lurking behind the walls.  Many times unsuspecting homeowners encounter hidden problems that end up costing a lot more money than they ever expected.  Had they spoken to a Realtor in advance, they might have learned that a better strategy would be to allow potential buyers to decide whether they preferred the change.~When you make the decision to incorporate some changes to your home, be sure to sit down and consider all the current and potential factors at hand.  Many homeowners do not realize how beneficial meeting with their real estate agent can prove to be if done prior to beginning any major work.  Before overdoing any of the âredoingâ in your home, set up an appointment with a professional!",

        "content": "âNeighborhood valueâ is the atmosphere of a particular area - the look and feel of the homes and yards and so forth. But, more importantly, itâs the âvibeâ you receive from the neighbors.Letâs be honest: You can buy the finest home on the planet, but obnoxious neighbors can spoil the whole living experience for you.Or, it could be the opposite - the neighbors arenât obnoxious; the current owners are. They may have had disputes with their neighbors and created an unhappy climate.Depending on the nature of the disputes, the neighbors may be glad to see you, or they may be so negative toward the current owners that their attitude may spill over onto you, even though you had nothing to do with the situation! If thatâs true, then you may want to look at homes in a different area.But thereâs also another important reason for you to talk with neighbors; good neighbors can alert you to problems you may not be aware of; for example, basement flooding, termites, leaky roofs, etc.When that happens, you can either look at a different house or negotiate with the seller to lower the price of the property!The Best Way to Evaluate a Neighborhood and Its ValueThe best way to evaluate a particular neighborhood is write up a checklist of desirable aspects before you ever enter that neighborhood!Below, I provide you with typical features (in alphabetical order) to check out. However, you should add as much detail as possible to that list since everyone has different needs and wants.â¢ Association fees (if applicable)â¢ Closeness to parks and recreation for the kidsâ¢ Crime rateâ¢ Length of commute to workâ¢ Noisy pets (barking dogs, etc.)â¢ Property taxes.â¢ Proximity to busy streets or main thoroughfares.â¢ Proximity to mall, shops, restaurants, etc.â¢ Reputation of school districtâ¢ Sidewalks and running trails throughout the neighborhood.â¢ Type of families in the neighborhood, etc.The list above has all the âobjectiveâ features of a neighborhood; that is, you can measure them, for the most part, by facts and figures.Assuming a neighborhood meets these objective criteria, then itâs time to analyze the âsubjectiveâ features by visiting the area.Drive through the neighborhood to get an initial look. Do this at different times and on several different days to get a real feel for the area.Assuming you like what you see, you should also get out and walk the neighborhood. You may well see things you missed from the car.As I suggested earlier, talk to the neighbors to get their opinions of the neighborhood and the property youâre considering.Iâd recommend you select a time when theyâre likely to be outside walking or in their yards (gardening, watering, mowing, etc.). That way, you donât have to knock on their doors and interrupt their personal time.Since buying a home is such an important decision, you can see that itâs vitally important to check both the objective and subjective features of a neighborhood. And, since itâs my business to know every one of those aspects, I encourage you to contact me so I can fill you in on the âneighborhood valueâ of an area youâre interested in!

        "content": "Weâve all seen them â homes that are on the market and priced so high that one wonders what decade the owners were comparing their home value to.  But if you think about it â the goal of these people is to end up with more money in their pocket at the end of the day.  The truth is that when sellers price their home for more than what the market dictates it is worth, there are some pretty dire circumstances.  Here are three reasons why you should shy away from pricing your home too high, instead making a strong effort to price it effectively.Buyers Donât Like to Deviate Too Much From the Asking PriceWhether because of perceived rigidness on the part of the sellers or to save themselves the embarrassment of their offer being rejected, many buyers shy away from bidding on homes that are overpriced.  They have no idea of the reason you may have priced your property so high and the last thing they want to do is get tangled in a bidding tug of war only to be the loser at the end of the day â so they donât make an offer in the first place.There is a Misconception That Sellers Knows Their Home is OverpricedThinking that the sellers deliberately have overpriced their home, many buyers feel that if the seller is willing to accept a lower value then they just priced the home accordingly.  This is a turn off to serious buyers so rather than mess with it they move on to other properties and an offer for the overpriced home never makes it to the table.Buyers Assume That Previous Offers Have Been Rejected By the SellerA home that is priced higher than it should be makes the impression that the seller is not willing to budge.  Buyers take one look at such properties and assume that other offers were probably made based on the propertyâs fair market value but the seller likely leaves no room to negotiate.  In actuality, these homes almost never receive offers, leaving the seller in the dark and buyers to move on to other properties.~The single biggest financial disadvantage of listing a home too high is that it wonât sell and the seller will either have to channel more money into the home to get some offers on the table or they will have to reduce the price to get it sold.  The interesting thing is that the reduced price is often lower than what would have been the asking price had the home been priced effectively in the first place.Homeowners that end up pricing their home too high usually spend thousands of dollars more than they were trying to save in the first place.  By practicing our tips and remaining aware of the reasons that overpricing is the worst thing you can do, you can sell your home for a great price instead of being one of the last houses on the block yet to sell.  To learn more about great pricing strategies visit your Realtor to get customized, professional consultation.  Nothing beats working with those that know the industry well!~~TIPS ON HOW TO PRICE A HOME      Do your homework to find the current home value of your home.  A Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) is best done by a professional Realtor and also you can get an appraisal done â something that will help in the lending process plus as you try to justify your selling price)        Give your home the TLC it needs so it is an attractive catch to potential buyers.  Thatâs a great way to justify your price.  If you canât get to the items that need fixing or if you would rather leave the aesthetics to your buyersâ so they can cater to their own tastes once they move in, be sure to reflect that in your price.        Donât get caught up in old prices that are no longer relevant in todayâs buyerâs market.  Price your home based on todayâs statistics and be prepared to corroborate the figure with current market data that supports your number.  ",

        "content": "No, you donât need the fictional detective inspector. However, you do need a home inspector! Think of this as a âpre-emptive strikeâ to maintain or increase your homeâs value before you put it on the market. Here are the benefits an inspector provides you:Benefit 1: The inspector can uncover any problems that need fixing, and you can correct them before any potential buyers enter your home. Such an inspection can prevent your sale from falling through!Benefit 2: With an inspection, you can show prospective buyers receipts to prove the work has been done. Buyers love proof! In reality and in their eyes, it underpins the value of your home and the asking price.Benefit 3: You may be able to factor the cost of the inspection into the asking price for your home!Benefit 4: When you have a pre-sale home inspection completed, youâre able to estimate if the discount the prospective buyer is asking is reasonable. In other words, you can refuse unreasonably low offers if you know the value of your house, including the degree of its defects.So, How Do I Find a Qualified Home Inspector?I can recommend a certified home inspector who will do a great job for you. However, if you decide you want to do it on your own, make sure he or she is qualified!Con artists sometimes pose as home inspectors, taking your money and giving you nothing but grief in return. Hereâs how to know if an inspector is the real deal:Ask your friends for referrals. If theyâve had a good experience, go with that home inspector. Iâd recommend you interview a minimum of two or three inspectors before choosing one. Make sure theyâre full-time professionals conducting several inspections a year.If possible, select a home inspector whoâs a member of The American Society of Home Inspectors or the National Association of Home Inspectors.These association members follow a stated code of ethics. In addition, theyâre prohibited from having a professional interest in the sale, repair or maintenance of a property they inspect. Theyâre also forbidden from using their inspection business as a way to find customers for a handyman service that they âhappenâ to own. You may want to go on the Internet and use ASHIâs âFind a Home Inspectorâ link to identify potential candidates in our locality.As part of the interview process, ask for samples of comprehensive reports (about 20-50 pages in length). The samples should be painstakingly done and backed up with complete details, including photos and diagrams. If an âinspectorâ refuses to give you a report or provides only a sloppily written 2-to-5 page sample, run the other way!What Does a Home Inspector Cost?Frankly, the rates vary. On a national level, the rates fall in the range of $200 to $400. As part of the interview process, I recommend you ask several inspectors for their rates so you can get an idea of the price range. In the end, keep in mind that while the cost of an inspection may seem high, it can actually add several thousand dollars to the value of your home! So, donât think of it as a cost; think of it as an investment!What Exactly Does a Home Inspector Evaluate?In general, he or she will look at the following areas:- Electrical System Wiring, Service Panel and Service Capacity- Energy Conservation/Safety Items- Exterior Walls, Siding, Trim- Floor, Wall, Ceiling, Roof Structures- Foundation, Footings, Crawl Space, Basements, Sub-flooring, Decks- Gutters, Downspouts- Heating &amp; Cooling Systems- Insulation &amp; Ventilation- Interior Floors, Walls, Ceilings- Moisture Intrusion/Mold- Overall Structural Integrity- Plumbing Systems- Property Drainage/Landscaping- Roof &amp; Shingles, Chimneys, Attic- Walks and Drives- Windows, Doors, Cabinets, Counters, etc.Should I Be Present During a Home Inspection?You bet! A typical inspection takes three hours or more, so I recommend that you be present for at least the first 30 minutes to make sure the job is being done thoroughly. At the end of the inspection, the home inspector should give you a point-by-point summary of what needs to be corrected in order to add value to your home!Hope you enjoyed this very useful information about home inspection!

Get Pre-Approved for a Home LoanIâve known sellers who signed a contract to sell their house before they knew if they were qualified to buy another. Either their financial circumstances had changed since their last purchase, and they could no longer qualify for a loan, or they werenât able to sell at a price that allowed them to buy the type of replacement house they wanted. They ended up renting or buying something that was far from ideal.Before you decide to sell the house, get pre-approved by a lender you trust and research the housing market in the area where you wish to live so that you have a good idea how much it will take to buy a replacement.      Check Your Mortgage PayoffCall your lender to check the payoff for your current home mortgage. Youâll need the figure to complete Step 6.        Determine How Much the House Is WorthDetermine your homeâs fair market value. Real estate agents will usually help you determine value as a courtesy, but you might take it a step further and order an appraisal.        Estimate Your Costs to Sellâ¢ Real estate commission if you use an agency to sell.â¢ Advertising costs, signs, other fees if you plan to sell by owner.â¢ Attorney, closing agent and other professional fees.â¢ Excise tax for the sale.â¢ Prorated costs for your share of annual expenses, such as property taxes, home owner association fees, and fuel tank rentals.â¢ Any other fees typically paid by the seller in your area (surveys, inspections, etc.).â¢ Real estate agents deal with transactions every day and can give you a very close estimate of seller closing costs.        Determine Your Costs to Acquire a New Homeâ¢ Total your costs to acquire a new home: moving expenses, loan costs, down payment, home inspections, title work and policy, paying for a new hazard insurance policyâall expenses related to buying a home. Your lender should give you a disclosure of estimated costs when you apply for pre-approval.    Calculate Your Estimated Proceeds  Deduct your mortgage payoff from your homeâs fair market value.      Deduct your costs to sell from the remainder to get an estimate of the proceeds you will be paid at closing.Will your closing proceeds cover your costs to acquire a new home? If not, do you have cash or other funding to make up the difference?    Make Necessary RepairsMake all needed repairs unless you want the house to be regarded as a fixer-upper. Iâm not referring to cosmetic updates, but to items in need of repair. Anything thatâs obviously broken gives potential buyers a reason to submit a lower offer.For a preview of several repair hot spots that worry buyers the most, read Passing Your Home Inspection.  Get the House Ready to ShowMost houses need at least a little spiffing up before they are shown to potential buyers. Great curb appeal, fresh paint indoors (and sometimes out), organized closets and cabinets, sparkling clean windows and appliances, and a clutter-free atmosphere are essential if you want the house to appeal to buyers.Read: The Importance of Curb Appeal and Getting the House Ready for Showings for more prep advice.  Get Psyched Up to Let People InIf youâre listing with a real estate agent, sheâll no doubt ask you to leave when the house is shown. Why? Because lurking sellers make buyers nervousâthey donât feel comfortable inspecting the house when they feel they are intruding.Unless thereâs a real reason for it, donât ask your agent to be present for all showings. Thatâs the kiss of death for showing activity. Other agents want privacy with their buyers and they donât usually have time to work around your agentâs schedule.",

        "content": "No one wants their home to be on the market for months while generating no interest from buyers.  If you have a home that just wonât sell, do you know the reason?  One of the most prevalent reasons for a home not selling is that it has been overpriced according to its value and the surrounding market.  How do most homeowners arrive at their listing sale price?  Unfortunately, so many sellers use less than reliable methods of deciding the list price and as a result, they end up wasting time without selling their home at all.Here are the six things that inexperienced sellers use to gauge their selling price, plus a list that explains what you can do to make sure your home is priced perfectly to sell.What Not To Consider When Determining the Value of Your HomeTHE AMOUNT PAID TO PURCHASE THE HOMEJust because you might have paid a certain amount for the home does not have anything to do with the current market value of the home.  Many homeowners falsely believe they will be able to recover the same amount (or more) as they paid initially, regardless of how the market and economy is performing today.THE MINIMUM PRICE SELLERS NEEDIn a market clearly controlled by buyers when sellers do list their home it is often because they cannot avoid it.  Either relocating for a job, no longer able to afford the house or they need the money and plan to use the equity of the home. Often sellers feel that they can set their price according to their need rather than what the current real estate market dictates.WHAT HOMEOWNERS WANTEveryone wants to get the maximum amount possible when they sell their home.  Many times homeowners self-evaluate the homeâs value based on what they see as years of upgrades, maintenance and care.HEARSAY FROM NEIGHBORSWhen others in the same neighborhood talk about the value of their homes, they too are often misguided in how they came to the value.  Still it is common for homeowners to want to believe that if the neighborsâ home is valued at a certain level, theirs should be too.THE COST OF REBUILDING IN TODAYâS MARKETInflation is a factor affecting how a home is maintained over the years after purchased.  This does not, however, carry over to the homeâs value.  Often sellers try to incorporate the inflated cost of rebuilding in todayâs market â a formula that simply doesnât work.THE HOMEâS VALUE ACCORDING TO ANOTHER AGENTThere is no shortage of agents and when they are competing with each other one thing that can and does occur is false claims of yielding a much higher sale price on a home.  Though it may seem attractive at first, the result is often an unsold home that rarely receives any offers.How To Price Your Property Perfectly to SellEXAMINE COMPARABLE SALESThe best way to determine the price of a home is to evaluate comparable properties in the same area.  Not only does this include location, lot size, property type and square footage, but a Comparative Market Analysis also looks at amenities in the home, types of flooring or other structural aspects as well as the amount of remodeling or renovation that may have been done on the home.HAVE A PROFESSIONAL APPRAISAL DONE ON THE PROPERTYPrior to approving a mortgage many lenders require an appraisal performed on the home. A great selling strategy is to order an appraisal independent of the buyerâs requirement for a lender.  Not only does this provide valuable insight as to what the maximum valuation of the home will be per the lender but it also allows the sellers to corroborate the price with potential buyers.EVALUATE OFFERS RECEIVED ON THE PROPERTYIf the home is already on the market, one way to consider whether you have overpriced the home is to take a closer look at any offers that have been made on the property.  Do they align with the current fair market value?  Are other similar homes in the neighborhood also selling within the same price range? It is important to answer these questions to find out whether buyers perceive your list price as realistic or over the top.HIRE AN AGENT WITH A PROVEN TRACK RECORDQualified, experienced agents are paramount to helping you determine the right price to set when selling your home.  If you choose a Realtor that is well versed in the area and specializes in the vicinity where you are located they will be able to assess your price range based on other like kind property sales through CMAs.  Through direct experience, their knowledge and insight almost always results in accuracy and in turn, quick results.",

        "content": "So youâve saved your down payment, picked the perfect home and you have a closing date.  Youâve probably received a statement from your lender in advance outlining the closing costs and fees youâll need to bring along with you to the closing.Many times buyers have no idea what is included in this expense â seemingly the second largest chunk of change they need to fork over, next to the down payment.  To help clarify what all is entailed in the fees charged by your lender and paid toward the purchase of your home we spoke to an industry professional to get the details.What Fees Are Included in Closing Costs?Mainly lenders charge underwriting fees and processing â which together are considered âlending feesâ.  In addition to those charges there are a few more routine but necessary steps adding to the closing costs.  These include the cost of having an appraisal done on the new home, pulling a credit report on the borrower, obtaining a flood certification as well as closing title fees on the closing date.  Additionally, prepaid interest and post-paid property tax are also items we see incorporated in closing costs.Do These Fees Vary From Lender To Lender?This is one of the main areas, in addition to minor fluctuations in current interest rates that lenders compete with each other for new loans.  We caution against paying any origination fees and discount points, which add to a percentage of your loan amount.  Each lender will charge varying underwriting processing fees but appraisals usually cost within the typical range of $325 and up.How Much Can a Seller Contribute to Closing Costs?The maximum amount a seller can pay in closing costs is about 6% and with the market being controlled largely by buyers, many sellers offer concessions in the way of paying all or a portion of closing costs.  In fact, savvy buyers know this going in to the deal and put this condition as part of their offer. Saving as much as several thousand dollars or more, this is a huge plus-point for buyers in todayâs market and one that is regularly being utilized.  Since closing costs can be incorporated into the loan this can also affect the interest rate buyers end up getting by a nominal amount.~It is a good idea to check with your lender or potential lenders if you are still shopping around to find out exactly what is included in their closing costs.  Be sure to consult with your Realtor to compare the numbers and confirm whether you are getting the best deal.  Also, it might be more beneficial to work with lenders in your Realtorâs preferred network of vendors.",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "The Internet can be a great resource for a host of things centered on buying or selling your home but in some cases, the most you can expect to gain is a basic understanding of things.  For something as serious and important as pricing your home to either value it or sell it, relying on the Internet can only go so far.  Here weâve outlined some key differences between the figures you will yield from online sources versus those that have been compiled by your local Realtor.ACCURACY IS VITALIn todayâs market especially, accurately pricing your home to sell is essential.  With it being a buyersâ market, you will have to gain a solid understanding of all factors that contribute toward your propertyâs value.  There can be negative repercussions of pricing a home either too low or too high.  One such scenario is if there was a seasoned buyer who had taken the time to research in advance of searching for homes.  That buyerâs knowing what to expect in the local market seeing your overpriced home could result in a turn-off and you could lose the sale.  By the same token, you stand to get the shorter end of the stick in case of not knowing what you could have charged.  Spending a little more time and/or expense can make a huge difference in the end outcome.ONLINE TOOLS AND CALCULATORSThere are more than several websites where anyone can log on, put in their zip code and be given an instant âanalysisâ of their real estate value. The figures that appear as results from searches made through online resources stem from a conglomeration of several weeks and sometimes months of data collected from a particular region.Websites such as www.zillow.com, www.realtytrac.com or www.trulia.com offer a great way to get a generic idea of the value that homes in your region are going for or have gone for recently.  As an added resource to other services also offered on these sites, the goal is not to assist homeowners in assigning a selling price on their property based on the data, rather to offer a snapshot on sales and pricing data for the area.  In fact, for many people it is the perfect tool to add an extra edge when determining the fair market value of your home, along with other factors.PROFESSIONAL COMPARABLE MARKET ANALYSISWhile online real estate tools are a great way to get a preliminary idea, they are only going to yield a figure that will show you where to start.  To get an accurate assessment, you will need to avail the professional services of a Realtor.  The only way to get an accurate âreadingâ of what the market rates are for homes in your vicinity and your neighborhood in particular, is to have a comparative market analysis conducted by a Realtor who understands your neighborhood.  There is a good chance that they have dealt with properties in the area on a first-hand basis, regularly interact with the agencies and organizations that deal with very homes in your neighborhood and are familiar with the people in various facets that you will end up needing to interact with yourself, as the seller of your home.Realtors conduct a detailed Comparable Market Analysis (sometimes also called Competitive Market Analysis) through a series of data compilation of area homes and properties, considering factors such as amount of land, the square footage and number of bedrooms or typical amenities in the neighborhood.  But homeowners can also opt to delve into accurate detail about their propertyâs value by relying on an independent appraiser.  Also, through the use of CMA data the County Tax Assessor determines the value of your property taxes.~When you are pricing your home to sell, it is vital that you use all available resources.  At first, it makes sense to âshop aroundâ and get to know the generalities before you head for the specifics.  And as with most transactions dealing with your real estate world, it is always best to rely on your Realtor for quality, effective and accurate information that is relevant to you and YOUR market.",

        "title": "Moving Out? In Todayâs Real Estate Market, Which is Better, Renting or Selling?",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Contrary to what many experts, news media or analysts may have you believe, market conditions are not as bad as they are portrayed.  In some areas inventory is down, prices are up and the general consensus is a positive one, moving up in a positive outlook for the future.  But the question does arise when one is moving from a home â whether selling it now or renting it to hold out for a better selling price makes more sense.  Here weâve put together some considerations that will help you discern which is the better choice for you.Real Estate Is Always a Gamble, Nowâs Not Any DifferentThere is no real way to tell exactly how the market will behave at any given time in the future but currently all trends reasonably point to both options being equally as viable.  If you opt to keep your home and rent it out, say for the next couple years or so, then there is a chance that prices will hit rock bottom and then begin to climb up again during that period.  However, there is also a chance that prices continue to plunge â in which case you would have been better off selling while a bit ahead of the game.The main thing to keep in mind here is that even though things go up and down in the short term, real estate is a great long term investment and itâs fair to say that ultimately there will be a gain on your property value.Buyersâ Market Today, Who Knows What Happens TomorrowSo many indications of it being a strong buyersâ market these days make it seem that the opportunities on the buying end of things are endless.  However anything can change and it can change fairly quickly.  Take our current interest rates.  Though buyers have been used to seeing such historically low interest rates for some time now, if the government decides to raise the rates it will instantaneously change things.  Since buyerâs ability to purchase will be affected in a major way, prices will concurrently come down.Heavy Foreclosure Inventory Appears to Dominate The Coming PathNationwide there are literally millions of foreclosure properties out there that need to go through the system.  As foreclosure and short sales flood the market, prices will plummet as a result of these distress sales.  In some markets this trend has crept into the upper-end niche of the real estate industry.Why Renting Can Be RiskyIf a homeowner rents out their property and while it is on rent the condition of the property suffers some damage â then they have negatively impacted the value of the home during a time when they had hoped for an increase in value.  This is the single biggest gamble when it comes to choosing to rent your home rather than selling it.Also, there is no way to tell what the condition of the selling market may be when it comes time for you to decide to sell.Consult With Your Realtor To Assess Your OptionsRealtors deal with myriad situations on a regular basis and they also intimately know the statistics of your neighborhood and surrounding areas.  By consulting with a trusted and reputable Realtor in your neighborhood, you can gain ample perspective on exactly how your property might fare in todayâs market conditions.  An informed decision would be made, given the factors at hand so you can be assured that your choice is the best as per your own situation.",

        "content": "The news spread like wildfire.  No, itâs not another politicianâs sex scandal or the latest (definitely not greatest) gas prices.  It is the monumental statement made by Warren Buffett that he would buy up âa couple hundred thousandâ single-family homes.  The catch is that he would do that if it were something he could practically manage. He may not be able to practically manage it but individuals certainly can.Think about that.  For months, if not more than that, countless Realtors have been urging their clients and potential clients that now is the perfect time to buy.  Now that it comes from one of the biggest investors of our time, it brings new light to the subject for many investors and has generated widespread industry buzz from the moment the billionaire uttered those words.In an interview where he discussed several topics, soon into the discussion with Becky Quick of CNBCâs Squawk Box, he said that in addition to equities, single-family homes are probably the most attractive investment there is out there right now.  With the low rates that seem to be heading further down still, he suggests buying at these low interest rates and then for homeowners to refinance if and when the rates dip even more.He cited that the only reason he has not purchased as many homes as he would have liked is because of the practicality of managing the transactions and properties.  Apartment units might have been more manageable and in his words, he said he would âload up on themâ had that been the case. But for the everyday investor it makes perfect sense to seize this opportunity and Warren Buffett highlights this repeatedly in his most recent discussion on CNBC.Mr. Buffett shared his perspective on the idea of buying homes at distressed prices, fixing them up and renting them out as an ideal way to get a solid return on investment.  Referring to the changing trends and attitudes within the housing market, he also said this is the perfect way to âshort the dollarâ because with a 30-year fixed rate mortgage it can go two ways; either the interest rate is too high down the line after which you can go and refinance or if itâs too low the other guyâs stuck with it for 30 years.  Could this be the return of the house-flipping craze that we saw boom in the mid 2000s?Mr. Buffettâs statement brings new light to something that so many agents and mortgage consultants have been saying all along.  Buy now.  At a time when stocks are just now rebounding after four years of inching their way back up, he says that consumers should acquire 30-year fixed rate mortgages and then refinance when rates go down further.If homeowners can hold on to their property for a long time after purchasing it at the lowest rates the industry has to offer they are sitting on the best investment possible of our time.  Of course equities are still very strong but they have come up quite a bit and Warren Buffett says owning a home is a âleveraged way of owning a very cheap assetâ, making it quite possibly the most attractive investment that you can make.",

This means that words and phrases used in contracts are given their ordinary, everyday meaning.  The phrase âas-isâ will generally be construed as meaning  that you are buying the house in its present condition without modification.As the purchaser of real estate, the use of âas isâ in your sales contract means that you should be diligent in observing and discovering  as much about the property as is possible both prior to contract and during contingency periods.  This means performing your âdue diligenceâ, such as:Â· Looking carefully at the house prior to entering into a contract (like kicking the tires on a car)Â· Hiring a reputable and licensed home inspector and maybe one that offers insurance/guaranteeÂ· Researching the propertyâs history with the local municipalityâs departments such as taxation, public works, zoning, building and/or health and sanitationÂ· Engaging your insurance agent to ascertain the propertyâs claims history.As your settlement agent we will have the title searched to check for any defects of title and have a survey performed discussing with you any problems or concerns disclosed thereby.  We will confirm that the Sellers are neither in bankruptcy nor on the Terrorist List as required by law.

Mortgage protection life insuranceâ now itâs getting confusing?Before I go too far, letâs take just a moment to review what insurance is.  My favorite definition of insurance is: The substitution of a small known cost for a large uncertain costThe small know cost is, of course, your insurance premium.  A large uncertain cost is usually the result of some unexpected, unfortunate event such as a health issue, a car crash, a house fire, death or disability.  To mitigate the financial impact of these events, we buy insurance.For most people, buying a home is the biggest transaction and financial commitment they will ever make.  Meeting that commitment is usually possible on a long-term basis because of our income producing abilities. However, should the wage-earner no longer be able to work because of illness, injury or death, the family could lose their home.  This is an unacceptable consequence that, in most cases must be covered with insurance.Letâs look at the kinds of insurance you may want to consider.Mortgage Protection Life InsuranceIf you have recently bought a new home or refinanced, chances are your mailbox has been flooded with offers to insure your home. Before you decide to buy it or not, letâs find out what it exactly is. Mortgage life insurance is insurance that is typically bought through the financial institution that has your mortgage (like your bank). The amount of coverage that is purchased is the amount of your loan where if something happened to you the bank would be the beneficiary and pay off the loan. In most cases, the policy benefit decreases as the outstanding loan amount although the premium you pay stays the same.In most cases, Mortgage Protection Life Insurance is easier to get than traditional life insurance.  However, because of the convenience and relaxed underwriting practices, it tends to be more expensive.  If convenience and speed are your top priorities, consider mortgage life insurance policies along with other simplified issue policies. If other things like price, company quality, and so on are more important to you, another life insurance option might work better. Weâre all different â thereâs no one right answer for everyone.Individually Owned Life InsuranceThere are many different types of life insurance available to individuals.  They differ from Mortgage Protection Life Insurance in a number of important ways.  The beneficiary can be your spouse, your kids or other heirs rather than the bank.  The amount can exceed the amount owed on the house.  This extra money can provide for other needs such as living expenses, college tuition for the children and savings for retirement.  In some cases, it can be structured so that it never expires or that you get your premiums back in the event that you do not die during the term.  Flexibility â as the owner of a life policy, you can change beneficiaries (often necessary after a divorce, for example), you can direct the funds to a trust for minor children, you can reduce the face amount and corresponding premiums and you can eliminate riders that are no longer needed.A good agent should be able to help you think through the options.Disability Income InsuranceDisability Income Insurance (DI) is designed to give you cash to replace part of your income in the event you become unable to work because of sickness or injury.  These policies typically have many âmoving partsâ and are not often well understood.  The amount of coverage one can get is limited by, among other thing, their current income.  When buying a DI policy, you must make a number of important decisions.  A good understanding of the contracts and how they work is extremely important.  Different companies define âdisabledâ differently.   This is important because you must meet their definition before they will pay a benefit.  Some companies use a definition something like âbecause of illness or injury, unable to perform the substantial duties of your jobâ.  Others may use âcompletely incapacitatedâ. To my mind, the latter is virtually useless.  A good broker will:â¢ Understand the various contractsâ¢ Know which companies offer products that work well with your professionâ¢ Know how mental &amp; nervous disorders are coveredâ¢ Understand how the various companies will (or will not) penalize you for any given health condition.â¢ Help you understand how much coverage you need for your situationThese are complex policies and should be bought only with professional guidance.To learn more about disability insurance go to http://www.halfapaycheck.com/an824na/Default.aspx.",

        "content": "Itâs the job of the real estate appraiser. His or her job is to evaluate a property and tell you, the buyer, what condition it is in and the value. Of course, as a seller, you can also have your home appraised so you get an objective âthird partyâ view of your property.Real estate appraisers are licensed by the state. Regulations vary, however, so I recommend you contact either me or a bank for information on qualified and ethical appraisers (more on this later). Often, they are independent contractors associated with appraisal firms headed by a Certified Appraiser or the equivalent.What are the Benefits of Using an Appraiserâs Services?When you are a buyer, appraisers can provide you with two great benefits:First of all, they can uncover hidden problems that could end up costing you a lot of money down the line. Their appraisal can help you to either avoid the property all together or negotiate a lower price to compensate for future costs.Second, appraisers can do the opposite â uncover hidden opportunities for you! For example, you might be considering a home that doesnât look all that wonderful on the outside, but is actually in solid shape as far as its structure is concerned. So, through an appraiserâs efforts, you may end up with an outstanding bargain.From the sellerâs viewpointâ¦ an appraisal can uncover items that need to be fixed before you put your home on the market. This ensures that your property is in the best shape possible before prospective buyers ever look at it.What Kind of Report Will I Receive from an Appraiser?A certified appraiser should provide you with a written report. These reports generally consist of the following nine items:1. A description of the property and its location based on a visit to the property by the appraiser. The appraiser evaluates the condition, overall livability based on design, layout, and appeal to the market, and other external factors).      An evaluation of the âhighest and best useâ of the land; that is, the use for a piece of land, or property in general, that maximizes its net present value.        An evaluation of sales of comparable properties (usually three) as similar to the appraised property as possible.        Information regarding current real estate activity and/or market area trends.        An evaluation of the overall real estate market in the area.        Statements about items the appraiser feels are detrimental to the propertyâs value, such as poor access to the property.        Notations about seriously flawed items, such as a crumbling foundation, leaking roof, etc.        An estimate of the average sales time for the property.        What type of area the home is in (a development, stand alone acreage, etc.).  How Do I Find a Certified Real Estate Appraiser?I can direct you to very qualified appraisers, or you can find one through your bank, as it too should have a list of approved appraisers. If you decide to find an appraiser on your own, check his or her background carefully. As with any profession, there are always a few scam artists who inflate appraisal amounts in order to make more money.Check with the Better Business Bureau and the Washington D. C. State Appraisal Board. You can also check with your bank to make sure an appraiser is not blacklisted.How Much Does An Appraisal Cost?Generally speaking, an appraisal runs from $300 to $500. However, fees do vary with location.If you need more information on real estate appraisers or any other real estate topic, be sure to call me.",

        "title": "What Determines The Value of Your Home?",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Basically, a homeâs worth is determined by its market value. How is âmarket valueâ determined? Most often, itâs figured by a comparison (âcompâ) with homes similar to yours in the surrounding area. So, if the homes in your neighborhood average, say, $250,000, then itâs likely that the value of your property will fall in the same range. But market value is also determined by a number of factors including the following:External FactorsThere can be several external factors influencing the value of your home. One is âcurb appealâ, or the first impression your property makes upon prospective buyers. A home thatâs in excellent condition on the outside will make a great first impression; a home in poor repair instantly loses its appeal to buyers. Other factors can include lot size, popularity of an architectural style of property, water/sewage systems, paved roads, sidewalks, etc.Internal FactorsThe condition of a homeâs interior also has a huge influence on prospective buyers. When youâve demonstrated âpride of ownershipâ and kept up the maintenance (quality paint, trim, molding, etc.), a buyerâs interest will immediately perk up for the simple reason that they know your care and concern will result in less cost and maintenance for them. Other internal factors include construction quality, condition of appliances, size and number of rooms, heating/cooling type, energy efficiency, etc.Supply and DemandâSupply and demandâ simply refers to the number of homes for sale versus the number of buyers. When there are more homes than there are buyers, prices tend to be lower. When there are a lot of buyers chasing few homes, then prices tend to rise. In effect, supply and demand affects how quickly your home will sell. Location More than likely, you already know the old saying, âThere are three main factors in real estate - location, location, location.â While thatâs not the whole story, desirability is a big factor for home buyers. They may want to live in particular school district known for its education excellenceâ¦a great and safe neighborhood with rising property valuesâ¦etc.But I Know My Home Is More Valuable Than a Lot of Comparable Homes in My NeighborhoodArenât Allowances Made for This? Definitely! Sometimes, it can be difficult to find homes exactly comparable to your own. So, dollar adjustments are made for the differences between your home and comparable properties.Where Do I Find Sales Comparison Information?The easiest source to access is your Realtor. After all, itâs his or her business to know such information! But, there are also other sources you can tap into in order to get a complete picture of your homeâs value in comparison to others in your neighborhood. Hereâs an overview of them:1) The Local Assessorâs OfficeItâs very likely that your local assessor will be able to provide the sales history of a particular house, neighborhood, or style of architecture. Many assessors also provide lists of recent sales which you can browse and compare to the assessment roll. Today, many municipalities provide local sales and assessment information online making it very easy to access. Check with your local government agency to find out if they provide this service.2) Online Private CompaniesYou can search for these companies using the Google search engine and the keywords âcomparable home salesâ or âcomparable sales.â Some companies offer free information; others charge a nominal fee. If you wish to get more specific, you can Google âreal estate databaseâ and type in the name of your particular state to get additional property information.3) Your Local NewspaperItâs likely that your local newspaper is a great source of specific real estate information. Look for quarterly sales reports in the real estate or business sections.The Key to Getting the Price You Want (or Close To It) for Your HomeThe key to getting the best value is finding and matching the right buyer to your home. And thatâs the job of the Realtor! He or she should work hard to qualify those buyers upfront so the right people are viewing your property! In other words, the Realtor should weed out âlookersâ and other unsuitable buyers as a first step in working with you. See how I do that for you by calling me today!",
