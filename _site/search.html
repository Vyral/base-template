Justin also helps translate any confusing mortgage jargon that could otherwise leave clients feeling lost.âTHROUGHOUT THE PROCESS, OVER 20 PEOPLE WILL WORK ON YOUR LOAN.ââWhat I enjoy most about being a mortgage partner is being able to call people and tell them they are clear to close,â says Justin. âWho doesnât like new things, and whatâs better than a new house?âOne thing people tend not to think about when it comes to mortgages is the number of people behind the scenes who work on their loans. Throughout the entire process, there are over 20 people who may touch an individual loan. These people will check and recheck everything to help you get into your house as quickly as possible.âIâd like to add that you will not see me at the closing table. They donât let me out very often,â Justin jokes.If you have any other questions for Justin about the loan process, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!",

Prior to joining us, she worked with a law firm negotiating short sales. Her role in the loan process is to collect documents from borrowers and make the process as painless as possible for them from beginning to end.When it comes to her job, what she enjoys most is that not every day is the same. âItâs always different,â she says. âItâs fast-paced and it keeps me focused.â She also enjoys the different people she gets to work with every day and helping them achieve their goal of owning a home.âI ENJOY HELPING PEOPLE ACHIEVE THEIR DREAM OF OWNING A HOME.ââWeâre kind of like a family here.

Today weâll answer both of these questions.Check out the next Agent MastermindApply OnlineIn the final installment of our series where we answer agentsâ questions, today weâre fielding a two-parter from Allison Wheatley of First Realty.First, she asks, âSomeone said that the FHA loan limit in Lake County is $274,850; however, one of my buyers has a loan amount of $285,000. How does that work?âSecondly, she asks, âCan the seller hold a small note for an FHA, like a second mortgage?âTo answer her first question, the FHA does set loan limits per county, and theyâll change based on what county you live in. The FHA loan limit in Lake County is $274,850, but thatâs not the purchase price limit. People can purchase homes for however much they want, but the FHA has stated that they will not lend any more than the $274,850 limit in that county.âFHA LOAN LIMITS CHANGE BASED ON WHAT COUNTY YOU LIVE IN.âFor example, if somebody wants to buy a house that costs $300,000, thatâs perfectly OK; however, theyâre going to have to put down the extra $25,150 to bring the base loan amount down to the FHA loan limit in our county.To answer her second question, the FHA doesnât allow interested party contributions such as seller-held second mortgages into the transaction. The only thing the sellers can do, per FHA guidelines, is help pay up to 6% in closing costs into the transaction.If you or your buyers have any other questions in regard to FHA loans or their requirements, please donât hesitate to give us a call.

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "FHA 203K loans and conventional renovation loans actually have a lot in common. You should, however, know the two main differences if youâre considering a loan with rehab costs built in.Check out the next Agent MastermindApply OnlineWe had another question from an agent that we wanted to address today. The question was, âWhen dealing with a repair loan, I have made it through an FHA 203K; however, is there a conventional product as well, and what are some of the differences?âThis is a great question. Yes, conventional does have a repair loan like FHAâs 203K, and itâs called the Fannie Mae HomeStyle Renovation loan. One of the biggest differences between a 203K loan and a conventional renovation loan is the same difference between an FHA loan and a conventional loan. With FHA, the private mortgage insurance lasts for the life of the loan, no matter what your down payment is, as opposed to a conventional loan, where PMI will drop off when your loan balance reaches 78% of the purchase price. This is just one of the benefits of a conventional loan over an FHA loan.Additionally, FHA 203K loans only let you make repairs to the property itself; you couldnât add a pool or a fence since the repairs must be within the structure of the home. Conventional home renovation loans allow you to do pretty much whatever you want with the property, so you could install a pool or fence or update the landscaping.âOTHER THAN TWO BIG DIFFERENCES, BOTH LOANS BASICALLY PARALLEL EACH OTHER.âOther than these main differences, both loan types basically parallel each other in terms of their guidelines. Both loan programs will lend on the total price of the project, meaning the price of the home itself and the cost of the repairs.With these two loan packages, some people get confused about the involvement of an HUD consultant. With the FHA 203K loan, an HUD consultant will only be required when the total cost of the rehab exceeds $35,000. This actually parallels the Fannie Mae HomeStyle Renovation loan in that if the total cost of the rehab project is more than $35,000, we are going to require an HUD consultant to oversee the project along with the general contractor making the repairs.Now, this is just a general breakdown of Fannie Mae HomeStyle Renovation loans in a nutshell. Feel free to share this information with your clients or anyone you know who is interested in a home renovation loan! A lot of different factors come into play with this type of loan, so if you have any questions at all about them, give me a call or send me an email. I would be more than happy to help you out.",

        "title": "How Do You Qualify for a USDA Loan?",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Qualifying for a USDA loan is different than qualifying for other loan packages since itâs 100% financing. These are the basic requirements youâll need to meet to qualify for this loan.Check out the next Agent MastermindApply OnlineI recently had a Realtor ask for some clarification on USDA guidelines and how buyers can obtain approval for a USDA mortgage.There are three basic requirements for a USDA mortgage:1. The buyer has to buy in a USDA eligible area. Fortunately, Lake County and all surrounding counties are eligible.2. They have to meet household income requirements. Itâs not just the buyerâs income, itâs the householdâs income. If the buyer has children older than 18 living in the home, their income is considered, too, as well as a spouse thatâs not included on the loan. An easy example is that a family of one to four canât make more than $75,850 in our county, and a family of more than four canât make more than $98,000. Things can be deducted from this income, though, like child care or disability expenses for older adults.3. At Success Mortgage Partners, we require a credit score of at least 620. Since itâs on the lower end, itâs not crazy for people to qualify for, but we do need them to meet that benchmark. USDA allows financing for those with no credit score, but that doesnât mean a bad credit score. Some people have simply never used credit, and thatâs OK. You can do this by confirming things like rent and insurance payments. USDA looks over the last 12 months. If you have a 620 credit score but still have some derogatory credit like collections or late payments popping up, it can disqualify you.USDA is also very strict on their debt-to-income requirements. Since it is a 100% financing loan, they want to make sure the buyer can afford the payments, so they are more strict than some other loan programs. They will only allow us to use 29% of their income for their housing expenses and 41% total income for all of their other expenses. This helps prevent buyers from becoming house rich and dirt poor.The other potential deal killer for a USDA loan is if you own another house. With a USDA loan, you canât have two mortgages. However, there are some exceptions to the rule, like relocation from out of state that leaves you unable to sell your other house prior to your move, in some cases.Other than that, a USDA loan is just a conventional loan with FHA appraisal requirements; there canât be health or safety concerns with the home as far as the appraisal is concerned.If you have any more questions about USDA loans or the guidelines surrounding them, please donât hesitate to call or email me.

We are going to talk about a few of them today.Check out the next Agent MastermindApply OnlineWeâve been getting some great questions from our viewers about mortgages lately, and we wanted to answer one of them today. This one comes from Ron who asks, âWhich programs are out there for first-time home buyers?âThe first thing we should mention is that all of the loan programs weâve previously talked about, including VA, USDA, FHA, and conventional loans can all be used by first-time buyers. However, there are some additional programs out there that you can combine with your loan if youâre a first-time buyer.What we like to do with our first-time buyers is pair our USDA 100% financing loan with the MCC tax credit program, which is for first-time buyers as well as buyers who havenât owned a home in three years or longer.The MCC tax credit program provides those buyers with up to 50% of their mortgage interest paid on their tax return each year they live in and own the house as a primary residence. The value of this credit can be up to $2,000, which could equate to a few mortgage payments that will be covered just by agreeing to own a home.âTHIS PROGRAM HELPS SWING THE PENDULUM IN FAVOR OF FIRST-TIME BUYERS.âOne reason this tool is beneficial to our buyers is because, from an underwriting standpoint, it allows us to use the credit as income to offset your debt-to-income ratio. Salaries arenât increasing at the same rate as home prices are, so a lot of our buyers are being priced out of the market. This program helps swing the pendulum in favor of first-time buyers.I hope this answers your question, Ron. If you have any other questions, donât hesitate to reach out to us via phone or email.

This is done for a few different reasons.The first is that this is how we mortgage bankers make money in our industry. We sell your loan with hundreds of other loans that month. Thatâs how we get paid, but the benefit for you as the buyer, the borrower, is that you get access to the bigger banks and their interest rates. The second reason is that it allows us to keep our fees very low compared to our competition because weâre not having to charge origination fees or discount points to make money on your loan.âAFTER YOUR LOAN CLOSES, IT GETS SOLD ON THE SECONDARY MARKET.âDoes this change my payment or loan in any way? When your loan gets sold on the secondary market, the only thing that changes is where you make the payment to. Your interest rate, the loan balance, and the term of your loan has to stay exactly the same.Do you sell my loan to a bank of my choosing? Unfortunately, no. When we sell the loan on a secondary market, we have a group of investors that we at Success Mortgage Partners sell to. It may end up with your financial institution, but that institution may be one weâre either not approved to sell to or not actually involved in mortgage loan servicing, to begin with. From a lending standpoint, it depends on who we can package your loan with and who we can make the most money with.We understand that the post-closing process can sometimes be a little confusing, so if you ever have any questions about it, donât hesitate to reach out.

Letâs walk through whatâs going to happen on closing day step-by-step.On your way to the closing table, you will wire your funds to the title company. Once you get to the title company, thatâs where you will re-sign everything that you have previously signed. You may have done e-signatures all the way through, but we need your physical signature on every single document. Bring an ice pack for your hand if need be.You should also bring two forms of identification with you. One should be your driverâs license, and the other can be something that verifies your name or identity, like a social security card. The closing agent is going to review all the paperwork with you as you sign it. Once you are done signing the documents, they are going to take a few select documents and send them back to our closing department to get funding authorization. We as the lender will then have to review those documents before we release the money to the seller.âYOU HAVE ACHIEVED THE DREAM OF HOMEOWNERSHIP.âIf youâve been issued funding authorization and the buyer and seller documents are all signed, you can leave the closing table and go directly to your new house to celebrate.
