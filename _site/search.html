        "content": "There are a few factors that can affect your homeowners insurance policy in ways you might not expect, which is why you should discuss these things with your insurance agent.Looking to buy a home? Get a Full Home SearchLooking to sell your home?  Free Home Price EvaluationNow more than ever in our Southern California region, itâs important that you talk with your insurance agent about how much coverage you have in case disaster strikes.For Zachary Schneiderman of Schneiderman Insurance Agency, most people he works with or who call him for a quote just end up asking him to match their current coverage. The problem with this, though, is your current coverage isnât always correct, and a lot of people donât know how much insurance they really need to rebuild their home.According to Zach, the purpose of having a homeowners insurance policy is based on the idea that if something was to happen, how can an agent such as himself replace your home as it was and get you back to normal? As time goes by and you make upgrades and renovations to your home, those changes change the value of what it would cost to rebuild that home. Thatâs why itâs never a bad time to call your agent and ask them to give you an updated cost estimation of your home and verify that you have the right amount of coverage.Another issue to consider is how long youâll be out of your home because of how long it takes to rebuild. Depending on the size of your loss, you can be out of your home longer than expected. It doesnât seem like it would take that long to rebuild a home, but for a large loss, youâre looking at a rebuild of anywhere from 18 to 24 months.âITâS NEVER A BAD TIME TO CALL YOUR AGENT AND ASK THEM TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATED COST ESTIMATION OF YOUR HOME.âAnother problem is a lot of insurance carriers out there only offer 12-month loss of use coverage. If you have to move your whole family, that might not be enough to rent the kind of home you need while your original home is being rebuilt. Oftentimes in this case, people end up paying out of pocket. Also keep in mind that when you have a loss, youâre still paying the mortgage on your homeâthe insurance company just pays for the additional expenses you wouldnât normally incur.If your home is older, building code changes can also affect your insurance policy. The standard coverage of a homeowners insurance policy is meant to rebuild the home in the manner it was built. If you donât have a policy with sufficient code upgrade coverage, youâll have to pay out of pocket to make certain changes. The costs of these changes can be substantial, so make sure you have coverage that allows you to get by without paying more than what your deductible was in the first place.If you have any other insurance questions or youâd like to have your policy reviewed, you can give the Schneiderman Insurance Agency a call at (818) 322-4744.If you have any real estate needs, feel free to give us a call or shoot us an email anytime. Weâd be glad to help you.",

Get a Full Home SearchLooking to sell your home?  Free Home Price EvaluationOne of the most common questions weâre getting right now is how interest rates are affecting buyers and sellers in our market, so Iâve once again brought in our preferred lender Brandon Moss to shed some light on this topic.Interest rates have gone up by roughly 0.5% since the start of 2018, and theyâre still sitting in the mid-4% range for 30-year fixed mortgages. Stocks have also continued to hit all-time highs, and the 10-year yield nearly reached 3%, which is the highest point itâs been in four years.According to Brandon, this means itâs a great time for buyers and sellers to get off the fence while affordability is at an all-time high. If youâre a seller, you can get top dollar now while buyers can still qualify for higher-priced homes and afford low interest rate payments.There have been some notable changes to conforming loans that are advantageous to buyers. Their guidelines have become more flexible, and their limit was raised from $634,000 to $679,000. This helps buyers qualify for higher loan amounts with less of a down payment and, due to rising prices in LA County, increases their purchasing power.âITâS A GREAT TIME FOR BUYERS AND SELLERS TO GET OFF THE FENCE.âIf youâre a buyer, Fairway Mortgage is offering some new programs this year that you might be interested in, including programs designed for self-employed buyers who canât show enough income to qualify, reduced documentation programs, and reduced down payment programs.Though interest rates have gone up, the introduction of these new programs and the loosening of lending guidelines has opened up more doors for buyers and made now a great time to get a loan and buy a house.âYouâd be surprised what you might qualify for nowadays and how easy it might be to get a loan,â Brandon says.If you have any lending questions for Brandon, you can call him at (818) 256-4330.

        "content": "Today, I want to share a list of the top 10 terms that all first-time homebuyers should understand.Looking to buy a home? Get a Full Home SearchLooking to sell your home?  Free Home Price EvaluationIf you are buying a home for the first time, there are 10 important terms that you need to know:1. Fixed-rate mortgage: This is a mortgage with a fixed-rate term. If you have an interest rate of 4.5%, you typically have a five-, 10-, 15-, or 30-year time period on your mortgage, and your interest rate wonât change unless you refinance.2. Adjustable rate mortgage: This is the opposite of a fixed-rate mortgage. With the adjustable-rate mortgage, youâll have a shorter term for your loan, maybe five to 10 years. Once that term concludes, your interest rate will adjust according to other interest rates charged by the bank. This can get confusing, so I always recommend that you talk to a lender if you want more clarification.3. Pre-approval: This is different from a pre-qualification. When youâre pre-approved, that means youâve talked to a lender and given them all of your paperwork, including tax documents, bank statements, your W-2, and other documents the lender may require so they can verify whether or not you are qualified to buy. If you make $10 an hour, youâre probably not qualified to buy a $1 million home. If you earn $1,000 an hour, then you probably are.4. Conventional loans: These loans typically carry a 15- or 30-year time period. You generally need a 650 FICO score to qualify for a conventional loan and a 20% down payment. The average down payment for a first-time buyer is only about 5%, so if you donât have 20% down or a high credit score, there are a lot of other loan programs out there.5. FHA loan: This is a great loan for anyone who has gone through some credit dings. FHA stands for Federal Housing Administration, and with this loan, you can put down a minimum of 3.5%. You will have to carry mortgage insurance, but you can take that off later down the road.âCLOSING COSTS ARE USUALLY 2% TO 5% OF THE PURCHASE PRICE.â6. Appraisal: An appraisal is when a third-party company, working on behalf of the bank, analyzes your property and compares it to comparable properties within a certain radius. The homeâs condition, style of the property, and lot size are just a few of the factors taken into consideration. If you offer $500,000 for the home and the appraisal comes in at $475,000, either the purchase price has to come down or you have to bring another $25,000 in cash to make the deal work.7. Mortgage insurance: This type of insurance exists to protect the bank. If you donât want mortgage insurance, you have to put at least 20% down. If you donât put 20% down, you will get anywhere from 0.03% to 1.15% mortgage insurance tacked onto your rate. There are always ways around it and plenty of programs out there that donât require mortgage insurance, so again, make sure you talk to your lender.8. Closing costs: What you pay in closing costs depends on you and what third-party vendors you may have brought in for expenses such as escrow, title, lender fees, and inspections. Whatever it may be, you can expect closing costs to be between 2% to 5% of the purchase price.9. Buying down the rate: If your credit score isnât great or itâs not where you want it to be and you have a lot of cash on hand, then you have the opportunity to take a high interest rate and reduce it. You are literally paying to buy a better interest rate.10. Escrow: This means that you are at the table and signing away. An escrow account is a locked account that holds the buyerâs deposit so the seller canât pull it out and the buyer canât spend it. Itâs kept safe through non-conflicting instructions regarding the buyer and seller releasing that cash, and thatâs usually when the deal ends.I hope you found this top 10 list helpful.

Issam Aljaber is here to discuss this and other concerns about tax reform.Looking to buy a home? Get a Full Home SearchLooking to sell your home?  Free Home Price EvaluationToday Iâm joined by C.P.A. Issam Aljaber to discuss some of the concerns weâre hearing from home sellers about the new tax reform act.Do buyers really want to buy a home right now after the tax reform act?Issam believes that buyers will still want to buy a home regardless. Although there may not be as much of a tax incentive to buy a home, homeownership is still exciting. We havenât seen any less buyer demand in our market. The tax deduction was more of an incentive rather than a dealbreaker for people planning on buying a house.That said, there are a few points in the tax reform act that buyers and sellers in California should know about.One of them is the mortgage interest deduction. Under the previous tax law, up to $1 million of mortgage interest was deductible for the personal income tax. The new limit is $750,000.If you are buying in the $1 million range and putting 20% down, Issam believes you are still safe in that range and able to deduct mortgage interest. Once you are over that price point, a lot of the homes sold in that price point are often cash transactions anyway.âALTHOUGH THERE IS LESS OF A TAX INCENTIVE TO BUY, PEOPLE STILL WANT TO BECOME HOMEOWNERS.âPrice points under $900,000 are not affected that much by this change. People used to feel more of a tax savings when they bought a $200,000 or $400,000, so there is not much of an incentive there anymore. Like we mentioned earlier, though, tax incentives are not necessarily make-or-break for those planning to buy a home.Finally, sellers have also been asking if the capital gains exemption was affected by the tax reform.Although there were talks in earlier versions of the bill about changing the capital gains tax exemption, no changes were made in the final bill. If you are thinking of selling your house, single taxpayers can still get up to $250,000 in capital gains tax-free, and married couples can still get up to $500,000 in capital gains tax-free.If you have any other questions about the tax reform act, you can contact Issam Aljaber at (818) 383-8029.

        "content": "What can you expect from the 2018 real estate market? Letâs take a look at the 2017 market recap and see which market trends may continue this year.Looking to buy a home? Get a Full Home SearchLooking to sell your home?  Free Home Price EvaluationItâs time to recap what happened in the 2017 real estate market. I also have a forecast of what you might be able to expect in 2018 for Porter Ranch and the San Fernando Valley.2017 started off with very low inventory. There were only about 47 properties for sale out of 11,600 single-family units. We ended the year with slightly less inventory. That low inventory really fueled the marketânot just here in Porter Ranch but all over Southern California.When you look at the inventory in 2017, it stayed very low the first half of the year. In June, as spring transitioned into summer, inventory doubled from what it was at the beginning of the year. Still, it just wasnât enough to satisfy buyer demand. Even though inventory increased in the summer, that inventory got gobbled up.From the beginning of 2017 to the end of 2017, inventory decreased by 24% and the average price in San Fernando Valley went up 13% in most neighborhoods.In most neighborhoods, there is only two to two and a half months of inventory in most areas. As a result, most prices are going up.âLOW INVENTORY REALLY FUELED THE 2017 REAL ESTATE MARKET.âIn order to have a healthy market, there need to be about 7,500 homes for sale in the San Fernando Valley. If you look at the total amount of inventory at the end of 2017, we only had about 1,700 homes for sale. That is down from the 2,200 homes for sale at the end of 2016.You can see more details about the 2017 real estate market in these charts.So, what can you expect in 2018?I think the 2018 market will be more of the same. There is very little inventory and economic growth in the San Fernando Valley as a whole economically. A lot of people are priced out of areas like the West Side, Pasadena, Glendale, and the South Side of the Valley. As a result, more people are moving up to the North Side of the Valley, where they can get more house for their dollar. Homes are moving quickly in this area because they are more affordable and there is a lot of competition. I predict that we will see about 5% to 9% growth in both neighborhoods.If interest rates go up, that could have an impact on our market. Weâre also keeping an eye on how the new tax reform bill will impact real estate here in the San Fernando Valley. Weâll have more information about that in our next video.Do you want to know how much your home is worth in the 2018 market?

Get a Full Home SearchLooking to sell your home?  Free Home Price EvaluationI hope you all had a happy holiday season. Today, Iâm joined by Keith Morgan from Property Inspection Consultants to discuss the California Pool Safety Act and how it affects buyers and sellers.These changes were made on October 11, 2011, when Governor Brown signed Senate Bill 442 into law. This law modifies the business professionals code as it applies to the home inspection profession.At this point, any time a home inspector conducts an inspection of a single-family residence that has a pool on the property, that inspector has to identify a certain number of pool safety access provisions. It doesnât matter whether the home inspector conducts an investigation of the pool in addition to the home inspection or not. A minimum of two safety items must be included on the home inspection report in order to pass the general home inspection.âTHIS LAW IS IN PLACE TO PREVENT AS MANY CHILD DROWNING DEATHS AS POSSIBLE.âHere are seven possible safety items that could be included in the home inspection report:1. An enclosure that isolates the swimming pool or spa from the private single-family home, i.e., a fence or wall.2. Removable mesh fencing.3. An approved safety pool cover that prevents someone from entering the water. These are not the same as pool heating covers, which offer no safety protection.4. Exit alarms on the private single-family homeâs doors that provide direct access to the swimming pool or spa. A typical home security system does satisfy this requirement.5. A self-closing, self-latching device with a release mechanism placed no lower than 54 inches above the floor on the doors providing direct access to the swimming pool or spa.6. An alarm that, when placed in a swimming pool or spa, will sound upon detection of an accidental or unauthorized entrance into the water.7. Other means of protection verified by ASTM or the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).It is the inspectorâs job to point out these items and let you know which safety features are available for the pool.If you are a homebuyer looking at properties with pools, make sure that you work with an inspector who is aware of and conversant with the new requirements. This law does not require you to make corrections or upgrades. You simply need to be aware of the poolâs safety features.At the end of the day, the California Pool Safety Act is there to prevent as many child-drowning deaths as possible.Thank you to Keith for stopping by today. If you have any questions for him, you can give him a call at (818) 363-6670.As always, if you have any real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

Get a Full Home SearchLooking to sell your home?  Free Home Price EvaluationIs it better to buy or build a house? Or is it better to buy a new or existing home?One of the pros of building a house from scratch is that youâre allowed to pick out the details of the home, such as the floor plan and other certain amenities.Personally, however, I always think itâs a little more expensive to build a home, and I wouldnât look forward to picking out the thousands of details necessary to build a house. These include all the building codes and regulations from the city that you have to deal with.More importantly, with all the recent natural disasters in Florida, Texas, and California, I believe that hiring people to build a home will be more expensive than normal. Due to the shortage of supplies created by these natural disasters, the cost of materials will be more expensive as well.âI WOULDNâT LOOK FORWARD TO PICKING OUT THE THOUSANDS OF DETAILS NECESSARY TO BUILD A HOUSE.âWhen it comes to buying a new or existing home, buying new construction is like buying a new car because itâs a brand-new property. No one has ever lived in it before, and projects like landscaping will need to be done after the fact. If you can find a similar home thatâs maybe three to 10 years old in a similar neighborhood, youâll find that projects like that have been taken care of.When buying a brand-new property, landscaping can cost anywhere from $25,000 to $75,000. Adding upgrades to the home itself can also cost you thousands of dollars. If you buy a resale property, thereâs a good chance those upgrades will already have been done. Because that resale home isnât brand new, the list price will also be lower too.There are a lot of variables to consider, so whatâs best for you depends on what your specific needs are and what youâre willing to do and pay for.If youâre trying to weigh the options of each of these scenarios or you have any other real estate questions, feel free to give us a call or shoot us an email. Until then, have a happy new year and we look forward to seeing you again in 2018!",

This tiny nation finds itself at ground zero of climate change.The sea level has risen almost a quarter inch each year.  El NiÃ±oâs warmer sea patterns are killing the coral, which usually prevents beach erosion.However, one local organization is trying to make a difference.Today, Iâm joined by Hannah Harris, a Marine Educator at WiseOceans.A lot of people donât know this, but 70% to 90% of the worldâs coral reefs have been destroyed over the past year thanks to climate change and El NiÃ±o.El NiÃ±o is a global weather event which occurs every two to seven years. It causes a shift in temperature patterns in the equatorial Pacific, which has global repercussions. El NiÃ±o is the warm phase of the cycle. Higher-than-average sea temperatures are bad news for corals.â70% TO 90% OF THE WORLDâS CORAL REEFS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.âWiseOceans is working hard to reverse the damage done to the coral.WiseOceans has been based in the Seychelles for five years now. They are dedicated to raising awareness about the fantastic marine life in the area. Getting people up close to the fish is an important step in getting them to care about the environment.About two years ago, WiseOceans launched their Reef Restoration Project. The aim of the project is to restore an area of reef within the bay. Guests at the Four Seasons hotel can come out and snorkel in the bay to see the wildlife, and WiseOceans educates them about restoring the reef.WiseOceans has a coral nursery to grow new coral. They take corals that have broken off naturally from the reef (âWe call them corals of opportunity,â says Hannah) and place them in the coral nursery. There, the coral can grow and thrive in a protected area. After a few months, the coral will reach a healthy, reasonable size. From there, they are transplanted straight onto the rock.People can sponsor their own corals in the nursery and sponsor the reef.This process is very time consuming, which is why a project director is there to look after the coral day in and day out.&lt;figcaption&gt;Sign in the capital Victoria says in Creole, âClimate change is already here.â&lt;/figcaption&gt;Sign in the capital Victoria says in Creole, âClimate change is already here.âGuests can get involved in the Reef Restoration Project, as can the local community. The education provided by WiseOceans helps people understand how vital the reefs are to us as human beings.WiseOceans gets everyone they can involved. Hannah says, âWe have workshops, talk at the local schools, run youth groups, take people snorkelingâthe more local people we can get to care about the environment, the better.âI would like to thank Hannah Harries for taking the time to educate us all about the Reef Restoration Project.

Get a Full Home SearchLooking to sell your home?

Weâve seen them hover just above historic lows the entire year. 30-year fixed rates are still right around 4%, and fixed-rate adjustable-rate mortgages (or ARMs) are in the mid-to-lower 3% range.However, the Federal Reserve is scheduled to meet this December, and there is a very good chance theyâll hike up interest rates. Because of this, Brandon suggests that all buyers and sellers get out there and take advantage of these rates while you still can.Right now is a great time to be a seller,  because more and more buyers are jumping off the fence and entering the market. Itâs also a great time to be a buyer because you wonât face as much competition due to the season.âYOU DONâT NEED A LARGE DOWN PAYMENT TO GET INTO A PROPERTY THESE DAYS.âAnother question we often get from buyers is, âDo I really have to come in with 20% down?âNo, you do not. There are a lot of great mortgage programs out there that donât require you to put 20% down. If youâre a first-time homebuyer, you can put as little as 3% down. If youâre a move-up buyer buying a jumbo property, you can put down just 5% or 10%. Even investors can get in with just 15%. You donât need a large down payment to get into a property these days.If you have any more questions about loan programs, feel free to give Brandon a call at (818) 256-4330.

Get a Full Home SearchLooking to sell your home?  Free Home Price EvaluationToday, Iâd like to give you an overview of the top reasons to buy or sell in the fall or winter months.First, Iâd like to start with some of the advantages of selling at this time of year:1. Less competition on the market. During this time of year, the inventory is down. This contributes to less competition, putting you in a better position by default.2. The house is show-ready. Because kids are in school during these later months, houses tend to be a little cleaner. In turn, this means that houses require a lot less preparation before a home showing.3. Vacations are over. With people having returned from their trips and outings during the warmer months, more buyers are back in town.4. Buyers are more serious. Buyers who are on the market at this time of year arenât just looking for fun. These buyers are genuinely committed to finding and purchasing a home.5. The appeal of fall decor. Who doesnât love fall decor? The change of colors adds some natural beauty to any property, and fall decorations on the interior of a home can make buyers feel cozy and warm.6. Itâs cooler outside. Why would anyone want to move when itâs hot out? The colder weather is perfect for the moving process.âSOME OF THE BEST DEALS OF THE YEAR ARE DONE IN THE FALL AND WINTER MONTHS.âNow, Iâd like to move on to the advantages of buying during fall and winter:1. Good deals are available. Some of the best deals of the year are done in the fall and winter months, especially for properties that have been sitting on the market for quite some time.2. Itâs a lot easier to look at houses during school season. When the kids are in school, itâs easier for people to go out and browse the market freely.3. Fewer multiple offer situations. Since many of the homes on the market have been sitting for awhile, there is less competition for certain types of properties.4. Year-end sales for furniture. The later months of the year are a great time to take advantage of sales, which will aid you in furnishing your new home.5. Itâs easier to contract necessary services. Since there tends to be less activity on the market at this time of year, booking contractors wonât be as difficult.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Get a Full Home SearchLooking to sell your home?  Free Home Price EvaluationToday, I have the pleasure of being joined by Heidi Marshall with First American Home Warranty as we discuss the most important things you should know about home warranties.Hereâs what Heidi has to say:One of the biggest benefits of having a home warranty is the peace of mind. You donât have to do research to find, for example, a plumber or an AC company. With a home warranty, it covers your major appliancesâthe air conditioner, electrical, plumbing, and so on. If there is a claim that needs to be placed, you just call the number and can have any questions about repairs answered.Another great thing about having home warranties is that there is no charge for replacement refrigerant or freon if your AC unit isnât functioning properly. Normally that can be very pricey.It can also be a great option for rentals, which includes all parties. Landlords wonât need to worry about a phone call in the middle of the night about a leak in the bathroom. Tenants can call the warranty company 24/7, place the claim, and the landlord wonât have to worry about finding an emergency plumber.âONE OF THE BIGGEST BENEFITS OF HAVING A HOME WARRANTY IS THE PEACE OF MIND.âAnd weâre all overâif you have a rental in Los Angeles, Orange County, or Nevada, you can place your claim in any of those areas. It makes life easier both on you, and on your pocketbook.Many clients over the years have been able to take advantage of their home warranties, whether it be for replacing a water heater or other important home appliance.Itâs very important that when your agent writes the contract, they put in the proper coverage. Make sure that those things that are important to you are covered, such as an air conditioner or a pool. Personal appliances that you bring in the home should also be covered.If you have any questions about home warranties, please contact Heidi by phone or email and if you have any real estate questions, please contact us at the Scott Himelstein Group.

Get a Full Home SearchLooking to sell your home?  Free Home Price EvaluationIn light of the recent natural disasters in our country, I wanted to talk today about how you can be prepared for these kinds of happenings.To help me cover this subject, I recently met with Zachary Schneiderman of Schneiderman Insurance. Having insurance coverage is just one of the many ways you can prepare for potential disasters.Something Zachary suggests to everyone is to ask for an annual review. To do this, call your insurance agent and make sure that your home is insured to its current replacement value.This is especially important given the fact that a study recently revealed a high percentage of homes to be uninsured based on their current replacement values.âMAKE SURE YOU ARE PROPERLY INSURING YOUR HOME AND ITS CONTENTS.âIf you are underinsured by over 20%, certain insurance policies will carry clauses stating that they may only insure you for a percentage of the loss.Making sure you are properly insuring your home and its contents is critical. Itâs also always a good idea to review your other insurance policies, as well. It is much better to be safe than sorry.Even small, preventative measures can make a big difference. For example, you should absolutely save your insurance agentâs number into your phone. Also, store your policy number somewhere that is easily accessible.Being able to contact your agent at a momentâs notice will become greatly helpful in the event of an emergency. However, remember to talk to your agent before filing a claim. An insurance agent will help you determine whether the claim is appropriate to file.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

Get a Full Home SearchLooking to sell your home?  Free Home Price EvaluationRecently I had the opportunity to speak with Karilyn Thibodeau from the social networking website Nextdoor.If you arenât already familiar with Nextdoor, the main thing you need to know is that itâs a networking site for neighborhoods.Since the trend of introducing yourself to the neighbors in person has become less and less prevalent, Nextdoorâs goal is to connect communities.The thing that sets Nextdoor apart is that everyone must be verified. If someone is shown as living in a home on Nextdoor, that information is verified by the site to ensure that you know who youâre really connecting with.Additionally, everyone must upload their real name and photo. Putting a face and name to your neighbors can make a big difference.Nextdoor has also recently added a new Pet Directory feature. In fact, one major use people have found for Nextdoor is communicating with their neighbors to find lost pets.âPUTTING A FACE AND NAME TO YOUR NEIGHBORS CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE.âWhen you upload your petâs information on Nextdoor youâre not only taking preemptive steps in case theyâre ever loss, youâre also letting your neighbors get to know you a little better.Many people have been in a situation where theyâve approached a neighbor on a walk to ask their dogâs name. With Nextdoorâs Pet Directory feature, youâll already know.Karilyn was also excited to let me know about another exciting feature coming soon to Nextdoorâa real estate section. Homeowners understand that listings in their neighborhood directly affect the value of their own homes.When you live in a neighborhood, itâs natural to be curious about whatâs going on in the world of real estate as it relates to your community.The real estate section in Nextdoor is different because, as with everything else on the site, what you are able to see is always specific to your neighborhood. Youâll be able to see what listings are priced at, what agents are working with those listings, and more.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Pocket listings can relieve a great deal of stress from the seller. However, there are several things to consider before listing in this way.Looking to buy a home? Get a Full Home SearchLooking to sell your home?  Free Home Price EvaluationToday I wanted to talk to you a little bit about pocket listings. A pocket listing is one that the seller intends to sell but hasnât yet officially listed or put into the MLS.Therefore, these listings wonât be found anywhere online. When it comes to a listing like this, the seller has often met with an agent who theyâve asked to find them a buyer.Pocket listings have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. One of the biggest advantages is that you can maintain your privacy throughout the sale.Since pocket listings arenât readily available to just anyone in the public, you have a lot more control over who sees your property and who sees your home.âPOCKET LISTINGS CAN WORK VERY WELL DEPENDING ON YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES.âThis also means you have fewer buyers and fewer showings to deal with. Days on market is much less of an issue for this kind of listing since they arenât on the MLS.When my team and I work with these kinds of properties, we put them on something called the off-market property list. As soon as a person tells us theyâre interested, we do our best to match the listing with homebuyers who weâre working with.This has been very successful for us and many of our sellers. However, there are clear disadvantages to pocket listings. While fewer buyers do mean less stress, it also means that certain benefits associated with higher exposure are greatly reduced.With pocket listings, our full, aggressive marketing package doesnât work. These kind of listings naturally see less activity and foot traffic.Ultimately, pocket listings can work very well depending on your circumstances. The decision whether or not to list in this way is really up to the sellerâas only they can truly know and understand their individual situation.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Today weâre going to talk about their new website.The Valley Relics Museum began over 30 years ago when Tommy Gelinas, the founder and curator of the museum, began collecting artifacts from iconic places in the Valley area. As places began to close down, he went out and grabbed these artifacts himself so that they could be enjoyed by generations to come. This museum is open to the public every Saturday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. with free admission.The museumâs new website, MyValleyPass.com, was created to bring you a curated list of all the arts and entertainment events happening in the San Fernando Valley. The website now has some of those events posted, so be sure to check it out to plan your weeks ahead.Whatâs so great about this website is that it puts all the events on one page so that you donât miss ones you wouldnât have known about because you live in a different part of the Valley.âTHE VALLEY RELICS MUSEUM IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC EVERY SATURDAY.âThe Valley Relics Museum also has their own events planned in the coming weeks, including the San Fernando Valley Summer Drive-In Nights, where they will be showing locally-filmed movies including âE.T.â and âThe Karate Kid.â Youâll be able to listen to the movie through your car stereo when you drive up, and there will be a live band performance before each movieâso be sure to show up early.The museum has also set up a new historical film bus tour that will be starting in September, where participants will be taken to historic film locations around the San Fernando Valley. There will be two tours available for you to choose from, so look out for news of those tickets going on sale as well.If you have any other questions about MyValleyPass.com, you can contact Oscar at 818-678-4934 or through their website.If you have any questions for me or youâre looking to buy or sell a home in the area, give me a call.

Get a Full Home SearchLooking to sell your home?  Free Home Price EvaluationYouâve probably heard of the property website Airbnb before. You may have even stayed in an Airbnb property before. My own family has stayed in Airbnb properties all over the world. Itâs a great way for homeowners and investors to make a little bit of extra money, and more buyers are purchasing properties lately to use for this sole purpose.If youâre thinking of listing your current home on Airbnb or buying a rental property to use as a rental property for Airbnb, there are a few questions you should ask yourself to know if youâre making the right choice.First, have you picked a good location? As the first rule of real estate goes: location, location, location. In order to be a successful investment, demand for lodging has to exist in your specified area. It wouldnât make sense to have an Airbnb property in a place that has very little tourism. Your property should be close to attractions and transportation. A good view helps, as well.âFOR YOUR AIRBNB TO BE A SUCCESSFUL INVESTMENT, IT HAS TO BE IN THE RIGHT AREA.âSecond, how much time and energy are you willing to invest? Airbnb properties donât rent themselves. Youâre expected to provide a clean space, and guests will expect certain things like clean towels, tourist information, and a way to reach you in case they have any problems. Hosting can be difficult and time consuming. You can hire a service to remove some of that burden, but that doesnât come cheap.Third, are you hosting Airbnb by the book? In places like New York and San Diego, theyâre cracking down on properties because theyâre greatly affecting the hospitality industry. Laws and regulations are always changing, so you need to make sure youâre following all of the rules and paying all necessary taxes in your area.Renting out your place on Airbnb may not be a full-time business endeavor, but make no mistakeâit requires effort and attention to detail. Consider that before buying or renting a property on Airbnb.If you have any questions about Airbnb properties or want to take a look at some Airbnb properties on the market, feel free to give us a call or shoot us an email.

Get a Full Home SearchLooking to sell your home?  Free Home Price EvaluationWeâve all seen those shows on HGTV where a lovable team of construction-savvy husbands and wives, fathers and sons, or siblings and business partners buy a rundown house and in 30 minutes of TV time turn it into a masterpiece and create tens of thousands of dollars of instant equity.While that scenario is certainly possible, these shows gloss over some of the most stressful parts of actually buying a fixer upper. Lots of people overlook the expenses that are involved and the expertise needed to handle so many different facets of the process. In the end, though, the allure of a fixer upper can be irresistible. If you budget your renovations right, you can get a steal of a deal on a rundown house and customize it in any way you desire.âDO YOUR HOMEWORK BEFORE EMBARKING ON A FIXER UPPER.âHere are some tips to be mindful of if youâre going down the fixer upper path so you can be prepared for whatâs ahead:1. Get a home inspection. This will help you find out what youâre in for behind the scenes, such as the plumbing system, electrical framework, and the HVAC units. You may have been able to turn on the water and flip on the lights when you made the offer, but the electrical system could be a recall, or the HVAC might be on its last leg. Older homes might not be up to code with electrical systems and could have dangerous materials in them. If you donât know about these things up front and deal with them, it can come back to bite you.2. Bring in an architect and/or contractor. Many buyers of fixer uppers want to make big structural changes, and an architect or contractor can help you with this kind of thing. They can estimate the cost involved and help with design elements. Do your research when hiring contractorsâthe cheapest is rarely the best option. A good contractor can give you an honest estimate for your projects and help you stay on schedule.3. Check the zoning. This isnât the most fun process, and you rarely see it on TV, but zoning can go a long way in determining what is and what isnât permitted to do on a property. Zoning laws vary from city to city, but you can do a lot of research about it online.4. Look into some tax incentives. Depending on the area you live in, you might be eligible for a tax abatement or a tax credit for improving a propertyâs value.A fixer upper can be a long and stressful project, but if you have the patience to research what you need to research, you can find yourself in your own custom dream home with a good amount of free instant equity.If youâre considering buying a fixer upper or have any other questions, donât hesitate give us a call.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Even though interest rates have shot up considerably since December, we are still in a strong sellerâs market. Homes in the San Fernando Valley and Porter Ranch are selling quickly and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future.Looking to buy a home? Get a Full Home SearchLooking to sell your home?  Free Home Price EvaluationOne question that weâve been getting bombarded with on pretty much a daily basis is, âWhy are we still in a sellerâs market if the rates have gone up dramatically since December?âThere are several reasons why the San Fernando Valley and Porter Ranch areas are still in a sellerâs market. A few of them stand out in particular.First, we have extremely low inventory. Right now, we have just 1.5 to 1.7 months of available inventory in most neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley. In Porter Ranch, there are just about 60 properties for sale out of the 11,409 single-family units that are in the area. For comparison, there were over 300 properties for sale during the foreclosure crisis in 2008.Secondly, you are seeing a situation where homeowners are moving up but not selling. They were able to secure such a low rate when they bought the property originally that it makes sense for them to keep it, rent it out, and qualify for a new home. As a result, there is less inventory coming on the market.âTHE LACK OF NEW CONSTRUCTION AT ENTRY-LEVEL PRICE POINTS IS DISAPPOINTING.âThere isnât a lot of new construction taking place right now, either. Part of it is because of zoning laws, part of it is because there isnât any more space to build out in the San Fernando Valley. The homes that are being built donât cater to the largest pool of buyers in the entry-level market. This includes buyers who are coming back into the market after a past foreclosure and buyers who are coming from other areas in the market like Pasadena, Burbank, and Glendale. The latter group is getting a lot more bang for their buck in areas like Porter Ranch and Granada Hills.Donât anticipate anything changing in the near future. We should be in a strong sellerâs market for a while now. Despite the fact that rates have gone up a bit, we are still seeing more and more buyers come to the market in order to lock in rates before they go up even more.If you have any questions for us, donât hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Have you considered an umbrella policy as a homeowner? Iâm joined by an expert to help me explain what you get with this type of coverage.Looking to buy a home? Get a Full Home SearchLooking to sell your home?  Free Home Price EvaluationUmbrella policies are extremely important if you own a home or rental property. To help me explain why, Iâm joined today by Zachary Schneiderman of Schneiderman Insurance Agency.An umbrella policy adds liability coverage on top of underlying policies. So if you have auto and homeowners insurance, they each have their standard liability limits. The umbrella policy requires a certain minimum amount of liability underlying it. It usually adds on in $1 million increments over your home and auto. Itâs about $300 a year for two cars and a home, which isnât that much money to spend for a lot of liability coverage.If you have an auto accident or an accident at home, that liability you carry isnât always enough when you think about the catastrophes that can happen. Any sort of accident in your home can bring liability against you as the homeowner. An example would be someone getting hurt on the diving board if you have a pool. Thatâs why you want to be sure you have enough protection to hopefully settle the matter with the other party.âAN UMBRELLA POLICY ADDS LIABILITY COVERAGE ON TOP OF UNDERLYING POLICIES.âAnother reason an umbrella policy is so important is for things like getting sued after an auto accident.If you donât have enough insurance and someone is severely injured in an accident, the medical costs and pain and suffering costs awarded by the court can be well above the $250,000 you have as your limit of your auto policy. An umbrella policy provides you that extra money for a very cheap price and gives you the ability to have an insurance company step in and defend you and settle the matter so that nobody comes after your assets. If you donât have enough money on your auto policy in this example, theyâre going to go somewhere else to find  the rest or if.If youâre a landlord and have rental property, the umbrella policy is really a no-brainer. Anything you own as a personal liability policyâhome, auto, motorcycle, boat, jet skis, etc.âyou can have under your umbrella policy. You can have a rental property under it as long as itâs four units or fewer. It becomes a little bit more expensive for every unit you add on, but you add that liability with one policy over all of those other elements you own and give yourself a lot more protection. Remember, when youâre in those positions, you likely have more assets.Itâs not a lot of money to add that liability. Itâs a simple solution to giving you peace of mind no matter what instance comes up. As Zachary says, they donât know what claims will be brought against you, they just know that thereâs always the potential.If you have any questions about these policies, you can reach Zachary at (818) 322-4744 or visit his website.As always, if you have any real estate questions, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

Today, Ryan La Fleur at the Four Seasons Nursery is going to share some tips on the best ways to spruce up your landscaping.The plants you should choose to add a little pizzaz to your home have to do with timing. Right now is the best time to plant pretty much anything. If you get plants from a nursery, you need to keep in mind that they have been babied. Keeping up with the care of those plants is going to take some time and energy.The good news is, spring allows plants to adapt to their surroundings. Instead of experiencing a major climate change, the weather gradually increases. Spring is like a training period for summer, which means if you plant them now, your plants will thrive in the hotter weather.âPLANTING IN THE SPRING ALLOWS PLANTS TO ADAPT TO THEIR SURROUNDINGS BEFORE SUMMER HITS.âIf youâre selling a home, your plant selection is a little more focused. Although flowers can add a great pop of color for home showings, they will die very quickly and need to be replaced if the home doesnât sell that particular weekend. Itâs better to buy a plant that offsets the color of your pre-existing landscaping. For example, if you have green bushes, get a few plants with red or gold in them that will stay that color. You wonât have to replace them as often, and you still get a great pop of color.If you have any questions for Ryan, you can reach him at 818-700-0092.As always, if you have any questions about real estate, please donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

Buyers want to be able to walk into a house and visualize themselves there, which means itâs time to start decluttering and stowing away items you donât need either in the garage or in a storage unit. You donât need to take down every personal photo, but toning down the personal items is a must.Next, now is a good time to replace any flooring or touch up any areas that need new paint. A fresh coat of paint goes a long way in making your home feel move-in ready. Remember to stick with neutral paint colors!âREMEMBER TO STICK WITH NEUTRAL PAINT COLORS!âYou also need to to make sure you clean up the outside of your home. The outside is going to give off the first impression, which means you need to cut back the shrubs and put away any lawn decorations.It would also be a good idea to power wash your exterior and give your front door a fresh coat of paint!If you have any questions about the market or real estate in general, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email.
