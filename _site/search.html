        "content": "The March stats for our market showed some pretty interesting numbers, especially in terms of our available inventory. What is âmonths of inventoryâ and what does it mean for our market?If there were no new listings put on the MLS, the months of inventory is the amount of time it would take to sell everything currently on the market. As we expected, the months of inventory for March 2017 was very low at only 1.3 months. Thatâs the second lowest inventory has been in the last three years. So what does that mean for you?âBoth buyers and sellers should hire a pro before entering the market.âItâs a sellerâs market, which means if you are thinking about selling, now is the time. However, that doesnât mean you can just stick a âfor saleâ sign in your yard and expect a super successful sale. Youâll need to contact a professional real estate agent to help you position your property to get multiple offers and sell for top dollar.If youâre a buyer in this market, you might be getting frustrated. Multiple offers are commonplace in our market and youâll need a professional to help guide you through getting your offer accepted and beating out the fierce competition.If youâre looking to buy or sell a home or if you have any other questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. Iâm always happy to help and look forward to hearing from you!",

        "category": "",
        "content": "If youâre selling your house and buying a new one, youâll probably be faced with the challenge of juggling the two acts at once. Many people need to sell their current home to be able to buy the next one, especially if youâre moving up into a bigger home. Sometimes, these homeowners are fortunate enough to be pre-approved to buy a new home without selling their current home.No matter your situation, though, we need to sit down and come up with a strategy. Just because youâre pre-approved to buy a home without selling your current house doesnât necessarily mean itâs the right way to go. Both options have their pros and cons.By buying your next home first, you maximize your convenience by moving in, getting settled, and then prepping your existing home for sale without having to worry about living in the home youâre trying to sell. You wonât have to constantly make your beds, do all the dishes, and live through home showings. Thatâs what I call the maximum convenience option.âBuying your next home before selling the old one provides maximum convenience.âBy selling your current house first, you have the advantage of knowing exactly how much money you net. Then, once you have cash in hand, you can go shopping for your next home. In this situation, you maximize your dollar because you donât have any uncertainty about how long youâll have double mortgage payments and you know exactly where your financials will be.While you might know your financial picture, since weâre in a market with low inventory, you might be sort of a slave to the market. If your dream house isnât on the market, you might have to resort to renting in the interim or settling for a home thatâs on the market.Both strategies have pros and cons, but the best way to figure out whatâs best for you and your situation is to talk to your real estate agent. Weâll sit down and talk it through and examine how sellable your property is, as well as where youâre going. Weâll also look at things from a risk management point of view.If you have any questions about buying and selling a home here in the Portland area, give me a call or send me an email. Iâd be happy to help you!",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Are smart homes making us stupid?I was recently at an event called Hacker Connect Inman where a prevalent topic of discussion was smart technology and the privacy implications that come with products like Amazonâs Echo being able to listen to the conversations we have inside our homes. There was even mention of a murder trial where one side was trying to subpoena Alexa because she overheard a key conversation and could reasonably have incriminating data stored in her database.This experience got me thinking. Iâm a technology junkie and I love innovation. Whenever I look at my phone Iâm reminded of all the things it controls in my home and the things I want it to control. You can control pretty much everything these days. You can even have your smart fridge manage your diet by monitoring when you open the door.âHomes are getting smarter, but at what cost?âWith that it mind, I came across this article in The Huffington Post that argues that smart homes really are making us stupid.What do I think? In my opinion, innovation is amazing, but only if we use it to solve a problem that we really needed to solve. If itâs used to make a cool thing to solve something that didnât need to be solved, then thatâs not really innovation.I highly recommend you read this article. Do you agree with the author? Are smart homes really making us stupid? I invite you to share your thoughts by leaving a comment below.As always, if you have any questions or are thinking about buying or selling a home, please feel free to reach out to me. Iâd love to speak with you!",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",

        "content": "Usually, home sellers are pretty hesitant about the prospect of trying to sell their home in winter.If youâre one of these people, I think you should consider flipping that way of thinking. There are three reasons why selling your home in winter is a good idea:      Buyers are more serious. Anyone braving the cold to look at properties really needs a home, and theyâre ready to write an offer. Whatâs more, you wonât have to deal with any looky-loos or tire-kickers that might waste your time.        Homes look better in the winter. What looks better than a home decorated for the holidays? These same serious buyers are only going to see your home in its best possible light.  âWinter buyers are ready to write you an offer.â  Youâll face less competition from other sellers. As with the buyers, only people who are really serious about selling their home will bother putting theirs on the market during winter.If you have any real estate questions or are looking to buy or sell a home, donât hesitate to call me or visit my website.

        "author": "Vyral Admin",

        "content": "I recently saw on article on Realty Times featuring tips to keep your home safe during the holidays. Many of us travel during the holiday season, and there is nothing worse than coming back to discover that you have been robbed while you were away.Although you can read the full article here, I want to highlight a few of my favorite tips to prevent this nightmare from happening to you.First of all, consider installing a WiFi doorbell or camera. A company called SkyBell makes a doorbell that records video of any visitors that come to your front door. Many of our local cable companies also offer apps that connect to a camera so that you can monitor activity in your house even if you are not there.You should also be smart with your use of lighting. You can use motion-activated lights outside your home or you can get lights that turn on when the sun goes down. Lights with timers are also effective. These lights make it look like someone is home and you donât have to waste electricity by leaving lights on 24/7.âLet your neighbors or local sheriff department know that you will be away.âLet your neighbors know that you will be gone. Tell them that you will be out of town, give them your cell phone number, and tell them to call you (and the police!) if anything goes wrong. I have gone a step further and reached out to the local sheriffâs department. They are very happy to drive by and monitor your home; after all, the police donât want your home to get robbed, either.Make sure you stop deliveries. Cancel your newspaper and your mail. All you have to do is hop online and select a vacation start date and end date. When mail or newspapers pile up, thieves take notice and your home becomes a target.Finally, make sure that all of the doors and windows are closed and locked. Did you know that 30% of break-ins are not forced entry? This means that someone got in through an open door or window. Triple-check everything before you leave and make sure that there is no way to get into your house.Following these tips will help prevent break-ins and allow you to relax during your holiday vacation. If you have any other questions about protecting your home, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

        "title": "4 Ways to Make a Great First Impression on Portland Buyers",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "When youâre selling a home, it needs to look visually appealing to entice buyers to make an offer, even in a market like this where homes are selling quickly and for top dollar. Here are four ways you can create a great first impression with Portland buyers:      Make the exterior of the home enticing. The walk up to your house should be inviting, not forbidding. Stay on top of lawn mowing, driveway maintenance, and keep your landscaping clean and up-to-date. Clean the windows and make sure address numbers are easy to see. You could even add a colorful welcome mat or door wreath to put it over the top.        Shape up the homeâs interior. Once the exterior wows the buyer, youâve got to continue to impress them on the inside. Keep your kitchen and bathroom counters clear, and organize your closets and shelves. Once youâve cleared things out, remove personalized photos or knickknacks that make the home feel like your home. We want buyers to visualize their family living in your home, not your family. Clean the home from top to bottom, washing away smudges from the walls and touching up paint where itâs needed.  âIn a market like ours, you canât just bank on multiple offers.â      Check the outside of the homeâs evening appearance. Even if youâre positive that it looks great during the day, double check to make sure it looks good at night as well. Replace any missing lightbulbs or non-functional outdoor lighting.        Make the necessary repairs. Youâre going to have to make them one way or another, so you might as well do them up front, if not after the inspection. Anything that is a simple, physical fix should be taken care of. Stained carpet or holes in walls should be replaced so the home looks clean, simple, attractive, and problem-free to the buyer.  In a market like ours, you canât just bank on multiple offers. Those that do are shocked that buyers expect a perfect home. We donât want you to be shocked, we want you to be able to get top dollar. Following these tips is the best way to do that.If you have any questions for us, give us a call or send us an email.

On this card in big letters it says âAsk Sarita,â which is my personal brand. I came up with this when I first started in real estate.

Thatâs just how real estate works.However, if you price your home too high, it will likely sit and go stale. Portland is a relatively polite marketplace and people donât often try to low-ball an offer on a home.âPricing too high will ruin your sale.âMy recommendation is to price just below what the home is actually valued. This way you can create excitement and draw in a multiple offer situation. The home must also be positioned correctly, and we can form the correct strategy for you to get top dollar for your home.If you need any assistance selling your home in Portland, please donât hesitate to contact me.
