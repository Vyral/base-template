        "content": "Abbi Gilson discusses her experience with the SOLDwisch team so far.Today weâre pleased to be speaking with Abbi Gilson, a great agent on the SOLDwisch Team. Weâll discuss how she got into real estate, her experience so far, and what drew her to the team.Abbi is from Prairie City, Iowa, so she is very familiar with the Central Iowa area. She played softball in her youth, and she was even on Missouri Stateâs collegiate team while she attended school there. As soon as she graduated, she jumped into real estate, and sheâs been a valuable member of our group for two and a half years.According to Abbi, the reason why most people get into real estate is that theyâre crazy, so she supposes sheâs in the same boat. As a communications major in college, she wasnât sure what she wanted to do after graduation. When she thought real estate might be her path, she knew she didnât want to start off in the business alone. **Mistyâs team approach seemed inviting, so Abbi attended one of her meet and greets, and the rest is history. **âEvery agent on the SOLDwisch team supports each other.âSince she joined the SOLDwisch team, Abbiâs experience has been very different from a solo agent. Instead of juggling different roles at the same time, she has the pleasure of talking to new clients when they call the team about new listings or selling a home. Sheâs at the frontline of our business, which frees up time for our other agents to be out in the field working.When Abbi talks to buyers, especially first-time buyers, she tries to set up a meeting in our office. The process can be overwhelming for buyers, so this gives us a great opportunity to explain what they can expect when looking at properties. Some people may be vaguely aware they need a mortgage, but many buyers donât know exactly what they need or what they can afford.We encourage all our buyer clients to find an agent they can work with one on one. This way, if they have any questions, they have a resource on our team willing to walk them through whatever they need. Everyone on the team relies on one another to provide the best experience for our clients, just like how Abbi worked together with her softball team to compete.Weâd like to thank Abbi once again for taking the time to speak with us; it was great to catch up with her! If you have questions about a career in real estate or anything else, please call or email us. We are always willing to help!",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Rene Soldswitch talks about the real estate industry and our team.Today we want to share a clip from an interview we had with Rene Soldwisch, Mistyâs sister-in-law. Sheâs been in real estate for a little over eight years. Before that, she was in mortgage lending, interior decorating, and even the radio business. Her skills all came together when she started as an agent, contributing to her success. We asked her a few questions about the industry:What do you like most about real estate?The people. I love to help people achieve their goals and find their dream home. Some clients cry tears of joy when they find that perfect house, and being a part of that is a big deal. That home is where theyâre going to live and make memories.âWe have each otherâs back, and we keep each other positive.âWhat are the biggest obstacles for buyers and sellers?They want to make sure theyâre getting a good deal and doing the right thing. I work with all kinds of buyers, and I help guide them toward the right decision and alleviate their concerns. Buying a home is a big investment for most.Whatâs the best part about working on Mistyâs team?Â Weâre very unique. We fit together very well as a team. We have each otherâs back, and we keep each other positive. Misty is a great leader, and many other agents donât have that sort of guidance; theyâre just floundering. If one of us has a question, thereâs a plethora of information at our fingertips.Â If you have any questions about our team or real estate in general, feel free to call or email us. Weâd love to help.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are three books that will spur your real estate journey in 2022.Iâve received a lot of great advice over the years, but what has stuck with me the most are the business and mindset books that put me in the right space to succeed. Thatâs why today I want to share three great books that will help your real estate journey in 2022:1. âAtomic Habitsâ by James Clear. This book dives deep into how habits are the basis of everything else we do. One of my favorite things about James is his weekly three-two-one newsletter, which is always full of exciting ideas. I see him as a big thought leader in business today, and this book is a great introduction to his ideas if you havenât encountered them already.âEach of these books has changed my life for the better.â2. âFanatical Prospectingâ by Jeb Blount. I love this book because most agents overcomplicate prospecting. Jeb breaks down the prospecting mindset and shares some great exercises to get more out of your hours.3. âHow To Win Friends and Influence Peopleâ by Dale Carnegie. This one is old school. It may have been written in the 1930s, but itâs a great resource if you want to understand how to connect with people. It also has a more formal style than weâre used to today, so itâs a nice change of pace.If you have questions about todayâs topic or anything else, please call or email me. I look forward to hearing from you!",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "For some agents, 2021 was a great year. For others, not so much.When you reflect on 2021, do you think that you lived up to your potential and had a satisfying year in real estate? A lot of people did; it was a tremendous market that had a lot of good things come of it. However, I coach many agents from around the country, and not everyone had a spectacular year. These kinds of people fall into two different categories.The first group recognized that the market was hot, but they had trouble connecting with clients and keeping them loyal. They might have struggled with articulating their value propositions. In a busy market, sometimes sellers donât feel that an agent has as big of an impact as they might in a more challenging market.âMany canât imagine maintaining the same pace as they did in 2021.âThe other group may have had the most financially successful year that theyâd had in a while, but they had no work-life balance. Many couldnât imagine maintaining that same pace heading into 2022 and were concerned about burnout.Iâd love to hear what your year has been like so far and what you hope to achieve in 2022. Give me a call or send an email, and Iâd be happy to set up a no-obligation strategy session where I can provide you with three strong action steps to take to help you build your business.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Greg Wallenstein shares his story and what he likes about Mistyâs team.We sat down with one of our agents, Greg Wallenstein, and asked him to share his story and why he likes working on the Misty SOLDwisch Team. Hereâs what he had to say:âI moved here about five and a half to six years ago from Saint Petersburg, Florida, which is just outside of Tampa. I was there for 14 years, and before that, I lived in Brooklyn, New York.I started at a different company where I got my real estate license. Somebody on Mistyâs team reached out to me and said I needed to interview with Misty and Keith. I stepped up to the plate, interviewed with them, and it went very well.âMisty really has seen it all.âI think a lot of the difference comes down to the team atmosphere. When youâre a solo agent, you donât have the backing that we do on our team. We have a client service department that takes inbound and outbound calls all of the time. They not only set and prescreen appointments but also make sure that clients get pre-approved. By the time they meet with an agent, theyâre ready to go see houses.Prior to joining Mistyâs team, I sold four properties. The first year on Mistyâs team, I sold 69 properties, and that number has gone up every year since. I was working another job on top of real estate before joining Mistyâs Team, but after I joined, I gave up that second job. I didnât need it anymore.Misty has shown me how to think outside the box. A lot of other agents get tunnel vision when working on a deal. I can call Misty any time of the day and bounce ideas off of her. Thatâs one of the reasons Iâve stayed on the team and have been so successful; we collaborate well together. If one of us doesnât know how to handle something, we can talk to Misty, and sheâll know what to do. She really has seen it all, and since we do so many transactions a year, we know a lot more than your average brokerage.âIf you want to buy, sell, or have any real estate questions, feel free to give us a call. Weâd love to put you in touch with one of our great agents like Greg.",

        "content": "Hereâs the story of how Emily Burton become our Director of Sales.Emily Burton is originally from Indianola, Iowa, where she graduated from Simpson College. She worked as a bartender for many years before she stumbled into the real estate business. She had just received her degree in public relations and was looking for a job. She initially interviewed to be an agentâs assistant; that agent told her that she would be perfect as an agent and that she should get her license.Â So Emily did; she worked as an individual agent for about seven months. It was a difficult time for her. She wanted real estate to be her career, but she was struggling. Solo agents donât have the support that agents who work on a team do.ââI canât imagine doing this amount of business on my own.ââEventually, in 2017, she received a call from the Misty SOLDwisch Team to schedule an interview, and sheâs been with us ever since. The difference between her life as a solo agent and as a member of our team couldnât be starker. We have multiple departments on our team designed to help our agents succeed, like our client services and transactions departments. Emily also doesnât have to worry about marketing because our team has systems in place to take care of that so she can focus on working with clients.If you have any questions about working with the Misty SOLDwisch Team or are interested in beginning your real estate career, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

        "content": "Hereâs how I like to respond when one of my clients gets multiple offers.When you are a seller and have multiple offers on your home, itâs very common for your agent to say back to all the buyers, âGive me your highest and best offer and weâll make a decision at 5 p.m. tomorrow.âÂ I think the term âhighest and bestâ denotes a finality that is premature in my opinion. Instead, the approach I like to take goes something like this: âYou sent us an offer, and I want you to know we have multiple offers. Let us know if youâd like to make any adjustments to your offer knowing that there are multiple interested parties out there.âI do this because we could counter any of these offers, not just the highest one. A lot of people get caught up on the highest price without understanding the importance of contingencies, financing, and everything else that could cause you to lose more than you gain.If you have any questions for me, donât hesitate to reach out via phone or email.

        "title": "How Can You Win a Bidding War for the Home You Want?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are six tips that will make your offer stand out in a bidding war.Nationally, multiple offers are becoming more and more frequent in the real estate market, and thatâs certainly true in most segments of our Des Moines market.Â When buyers make an offer for the home they want, it has to be presented in a way that will actually win the home. If youâre a buyer and work with an inexperienced agent who doesnât have a strategy, youâll end up making offer after offer with nothing to show for it. The key is to work with the right agent. Additionally, there are six tips to help make your offer stand out in a multiple-offer situation:Â 1. Have a strategy in the presentation. My team and I sell hundreds of listings each year, and I can tell you that your agent isnât doing you any favors by just sharing your offer and not saying anything about it. This leads me to my second tipâ¦2. Share the love. We often have our buyers write a letter or take a picture of themselves to share with sellers because itâs a way of adding a personal touch and showing why they love the home. Many of us have a sentimental connection to our homes, which means sellers will want a buyer who will enjoy their home the way they did.Â 3. Shorten or waive contingencies. You donât want to make it difficult for the seller to like you, and asking for closing costs, or a 21-day inspection period (as opposed to the normal seven-day period), or the walls to be professionally painted is a good way to do just that.4. Pre-inspect the home. This is somewhat of a continuation of the previous tip, since getting a pre-inspection allows you to waive the inspection contingency in your offer. Plus, it will help you uncover any potential problems with the home.Â 5. Make your best offer. In other words, donât test the seller by offering less than what youâre able. In a multiple-offer situation, it behooves you to put your cards on the table. You donât want to miss out on the home you want over $500 or $1,000.Â 6. Make it easy for the seller. For example, they may have to wait to take possession of their next home, so give them extended possession of your home after closing to make the moving process easier.Â Rememberâwin the bidding war for the home you want before worrying about the appraisal, inspection, etc. Have a strategy to win and donât try offering less than the list price. If a homeâs hit the market in the last week and it has multiple offers, that means itâs priced or underpriced for the market, which means youâre underpaying by paying the asking price.Â If youâd like to know more about how to win the home you want or thereâs anything else I can assist you with, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd love to help you.",

        "content": "Showing homes to clients only makes up about 5% of what an agent does, but you can make it 100%.For the latest episode of my podcast with Van and Bonnie, I have exciting news to share: The Misty SOLDwisch Home Selling Team is looking for showing agents to show houses for our team. Â Itâs no secret that I love real estate. There are so many different aspects of it, and weâre making a difference in peopleâs lives. Being in real estate also means you have to be good at many different things. Itâs not just about showing a houseâyou have to do paperwork, handle inspections, etc.Â Thatâs the advantage our team brings to the table. We have people who fill specialized roles, and this new role weâre launching is designed for people who love focusing on the fun part of real estate and donât want to handle the more challenging aspects of it.Â A lot of people tell me they want to sell real estate because they love looking at houses, but the reality is that showing houses is only about 5% of what a full-time agent does. This new role makes showing homes 100% of what you do.âThis position is a great fit for anyone that loves spending time with people and helping them find their dream home.âÂ The agents in this new role will set their own schedule to show houses for our clients. Instead of working on commission, youâll earn an hourly rate for simply being there for our clients during the fun part of real estate. Having a real estate license is a requirement for the job, but your schedule can be very flexible.Â This position is a great fit for anyone that loves spending time with people and helping them find their dream home. You can work as many hours as you want. The right candidate can be part-time or full-time, depending on what your needs are.Â No one else in the industry offers this role to the same degree that we do, but Iâm excited about it because I know there are some great people out there whoâd love to be in the business on a more expanded level. If they have a real estate license and arenât putting it to good use or their career hasnât turned out exactly how they wanted it, this could be their solution.So if you want to get paid to show a bunch of brand-new houses to families looking for their dream home, give me a call today or visit www.SOLDinCentralIowa.com. Iâd love to hear from you.Â ",

Heâs here today to share some insight about whatâs in and whatâs out in terms of home decor.Max informs me that butterflies, bugs, and insects are increasingly popular decorating motifs. This includes things like stylized dragonflies on dinnerware and/or butterflies on pillows.Additionally, textures are a huge trend right now, and manufacturers are coming up with unique ways to tap into it. For example, Max showed me a butterfly pillow where the butterfly itself was printed onto the fabric, but then an embroidery overlay was added to give the image some texture and depth.âA decorative motif that brings the outdoors inward can definitely give your home a warm, inviting, and comfortable feel.âNext, realistic bird motifs are gaining popularity. In the past, more whimsical bird motifs were popular, but the market has circled back around to realism, including things such as lifelike illustrations of native birds on dinnerware, fabric patterns, clocks, and more.Continuing in the vein of bringing the outdoors into the home, botanical prints are also coming back to the market. Whether theyâre stylized and monochrome or theyâre detailed and lifelike, these motifs are a classic, beautiful addition to a home that can give it an upscale feel. They would look great in a modern loft or an industrial farmhouse.Finally, given how bold, natural motifs are surging forward in the market, it follows that furniture, light fixtures, accessories, and decorative pieces made from rattan, bamboo, and reeds are becoming popular, too.Especially here in Iowa, where the winter gets bitter and everything outside is buried in snow, having a decorative motif that brings the outdoors inward can definitely give your home a warm, inviting, and comfortable feel.If you have any questions about this or other real estate topics, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

        "content": "Today Iâll bust a few real estate myths that persist in our market. Stay tuned.In my experience, Iâve heard a lot of misconceptions about how the real estate industry works. Iâll take some time to bust three key myths that can cause agents to falter in their careers.âWhen you specialize on an aspect youâre good at, youâre focusing on the thing that best connects with your personality and skill setâthat helps make your clients happier and helps you stay in the business longer.â  Promoting yourself is better than working with a team. The truth is that itâs very difficult for brand-new agents to compete with the marketing power that larger brokerages have, as the review culture that we emphasize today. Having marketing range and good reviews on your side all help you to brand yourself and get your name out there. Itâs such an advantage to join a team with brand recognition and a long list of happy clients.  Itâs better to be a âJack of all tradesâ than it is to specialize. Many agents think, âWhy learn just one aspect of real estate when you can learn all of it?â On my team, our agents have specialized roles, including buyer specialists, seller specialists, transaction coordinators, marketing specialists, client services agents, and more. The truth is that real estate is very complicated, and over time, Iâve learned that most people are really good at different aspects of it, but theyâre not fantastic at all of it. When you specialize in an aspect youâre good at, youâre focusing on the thing that best connects with your personality and skill setâthat helps make your clients happier and helps you stay in the business longer.  Youâll make less money by working with a team. Time and time again, I see individual agents struggling to connect with clients and find business. You could charge a 100% commission, but if you donât sell anything, you get zero commission. When you work with a team, youâre able to get in front of lots of clients and you can make more money. Our team has multiple people involved with each client, and the commission is divided that way, as well. Still, we have multiple agents who make well over $100,000 a year.There are so many positive things about working on a real estate team. If you have any more questions about the differences between working as a solo agent and on a team, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd love to hear from you.",

The best part is that itâs free.Weâve been casually using Trello since the beginning of the year, but hit it full force on August 1 and weâre now using it for managing all of our transactions, open house schedules, and any listings that hit the market. We are always carrying around 120 active and pending listings at a time, so there are a lot of moving parts.For several years, we used Top Producer and Google Spreadsheets to manage things, but after being introduced to Trello by other teams, I found that the more you use it, the more you find reasons to use it. When you love managing things and organizing information, Trello is an amazing visual tool that could work for you at any stage of your business.You can organize clients by lists, upload files and attachments, and manage the listing process from start to finish. You can import checklists and move projects and listings along the pipeline into different lists and boards.âI encourage you to check out Trello today.âFinally,Trello is a great place to organize your ideas. A lot of times we hear about things that we want to implement down the road, but then we forget about. Making a card on a Trello board as a placeholder for this idea is a great way to keep those thoughts organized so you wonât forget about them.There are plenty of ways you can use software to organize your business, but a lot of them require you to fork out cash to make it happen. Itâs rare that an amazing program like this is free. I encourage you to check out Trello today and see if it could help you out in your business. Weâd be happy to pass along some information on how we set up our boards on Trello.Learn more about Trello here: https://trello.com/mistysoldwisch/recommendIn the meantime, if you want to attend any of our business planning workshops or you have any other questions, donât hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email.

        "title": "Using the LPMAMA Technique With Potential Clients",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "At Be Better DSM, we like to use a technique called LPMAMA when talking with potential clients. LPMAMA stands for location, price, motivation, agent, mortgage, and appointment. Today Iâll walk you through some great questions to ask using the LPMAMA technique when discussing future plans with a potential client:âBeing open-ended with your questions helps you get as much information as possible.â  Location. âThis property is located in [X]âwhat other areas are you looking in for your real estate search?â Many agents will simply confirm the area the property in question is located, but no more. This shuts down other possibilities for the buyer, as well as the agent. Being open-ended with your questions helps you get as much information as possible.  Price. âThis property is listed for [X amount]; what is the budget you have in mind?â If they say theyâre not sure, try a follow-up question: âThis one is about [X amount]. Have you ready any payment calculations or anything that helped you have an idea of whatâs comfortable for your family?â  Motivation. âWhy are you interested in making a move? What has you interested in this particular home right now?â Digging deeper into their drive to move instead of taking their answers at face value will help you be more successful.  Agent. We prefer the technique of not simply asking if theyâve been working with an agent. We find that consumers have a reflexive response to that question, often saying they had gone to an open house and spoken with an agent, or else they had called a brokerage with a question and then were set up on an automailer list. When they donât know or trust you yet, thatâs when they give the reflexive responses.  Instead, we like to frame the question as, âHave you been looking inside any home so far in your search?â And then we follow up by asking more questions about how that works. People will contact you, even if theyâve been working with another agent, often because they havenât been told how the process works, or that agent wasnât available when they needed them. Itâs important for us to collaborate with our clients. Ask them if theyâve done any research about how agencies differ and if theyâd be open-minded to a consultation to compare your services to other agentâs theyâve spoken with.  Mortgage. âWill you be paying cash for your next home, or will you be using financing?â After that, follow up by asking which lender theyâve been talking to, and let them know that you can give them referrals to lenders you know and trust. We always suggest that people weâre working with get a second opinion.  Appointment. This is the step in which you set up a consultation or a showing. We love to structure things, since we know the highest quality clients will be the ones who feel a connection and feel the value proposition enough to sit down in our office to do a buyer consultation before they look at homes. We also know that in todayâs internet-reliant society, everyone wants everything quickly, so weâll need to be flexible with our own goals as agents in order to customize the process to suit the clients and connect with them.When you hit all six points of LPMAMA in conversation, youâll have a total picture of who these people are, what their knowledge is, and what their timeline is like. This helps you be more successful in getting them to the next step.If you like tips like these, this a topic we cover in-depth at my business planning workshops, where agents from all types of companies in Des Moines collaborate and talking about the various keys to building our businesses.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today Iâd like to illuminate some key points of the sales funnel philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of creating a strong pipeline of clients to work with.Specifically, I want to share the approach of using âseeds, nets, and spearsâ to attract business. You probably realize Iâm not speaking about these items in a literal sense, so allow me to elaborate. Each of these things refers to a different method for acquiring and moving business through your sales pipeline.To begin, âseedsâ are clients and opportunities that can be grown into future business. Because, obviously, youâve got to plant something in order for it to grow. Referral business and business from your sphere of influence constitute prime examples of âseedâ clients. This provides a great base for your business, but focusing solely on âseedsâ can cause some major issues. It will likely be a long time before any of these clients have a real estate need, so itâs best to divide your attention between different kinds of clients.âFocusing on all three methods is the key to creating a balanced and steady business.âThe second way of capturing business is with ânets.â Casting a ânetâ for your business is when you put out a wide message in order to capture and draw in as wide a range of clients as possible. The advantage of using a ânetâ is that youâll likely reach people who are ready to enter the market immediately. However, using this method can be expensive, as putting out marketing materials does not come cheaply. Buying leads and sending out advertisements can quickly add up.Finally, the last way to acquire clients for your business pipeline is with âspears.â Â Sometimes gaining leads will require you to take on the role of a hunter. In other words, youâll need to proactively search for clients active in the real estate market. Getting clients with âspearsâ means going to them instead of bringing them to you. Contacting sellers with expired listings and for sale by owner sellers are both examples of this strategy. However, this can be a painful approach. It can lead to a lot of rejection. But if you are confident in presenting your message, you will find success.Overall, I tend to find that agents may be good at pursuing one of these methods but have a weak performance with the other two. Focusing on all three, though, is the key to creating a balanced and steady business.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "When I train a new Home Selling Specialist on the process of working with a seller, we work through a three-step listing process. Today I would like to share this process with you.1. The Pre-Listing Package.Â This package includes a seller questionnaire, a sample sellerâs disclosure, and the assessorâs records for the home, which we ask the seller to go through. When they do, we ask them to write down any pertinent information, such as that about family, pets, neighborhood, and anything else that may be helpful to know. We also mark up any errors on the assessorâs records and use all of the information to help prepare their home for market.2. The âPCW.âÂ This is a Pre-Consultation Walkthrough. We take about 15 to 30 minutes to do a walkthrough of a home and have them explain the improvements that they have done. This gives us a chance to get to know exactly what they have in their home as opposed to just looking at the assessorâs records and MLS information.3. The âHSC.âÂ This is our Home Selling Consultation. We prefer to do our consultations in our office with a PowerPoint presentation. We even have a video you can watch that talks about our history and our branding testimonials from clients.At the home selling consultation, we ask questions about the clientâs needs and expectations. We also talk about our unique selling proposition and what we do to market homes differently. Finally, we talk about the valuation of their home and which strategy will help them successfully meet their goals.âWe prefer to do our consultations in our office with a PowerPoint presentation.âWe have found that this process shows professionalism as well as preparation. It helps get clients excited about making the large investment of hiring us as their seller.If you have any questions about our process, please feel free to contact us.

        "title": "The True Benefits of Backup Offers",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Most of the agents Iâve spoken to have expressed a common frustration: They donât like showing clients properties that have already received offers. It can be disheartening to see how quickly opportunities can pass.Â Something other markets see often that isnât as common in our Des Moines area is active backup offers. Today, I want to talk to you about how to make this kind of offer, as well as the benefits of doing so.Â An active backup offer is a fully executed offer that is clearly stated as being second to an offer the seller has already accepted. If, for any reason, something were to cause that first offer to fall through, the active backup offer would automatically be accepted and move forward toward closing.This kind of offer poses a number of advantages for your client. It can help them get their foot in the door instead of having to wait around for another opportunity.Â âBackup offers are uncommon in our Des Moines market, but donât let this discourage you from pursuing them as an option for your buyers.âThere are many reasons a deal can fall through, so it isnât unrealistic to believe a backup offer may end up being accepted after all. Beyond that, the first buyer will have a lot less leverage during inspection situations if the seller knows there is another interested buyer waiting for the opportunity to secure the home.Â One concern I often hear about backup offers is that agents donât want to lock their buyers into a hopeless situation. However, putting clear terms in a backup offer can alleviate this issue. You can always stipulate within the offer that your buyer can cancel at any point after a certain amount of time has passed.Â This type of offer may be a little more work for us as agents, but it will absolutely show your client that youâre on their side. If your buyer truly loves a home, then I definitely recommend considering this type of offer.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "title": "3 Ways to Use Zillow Leads to Your Advantage",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "A few days ago, we had a fantastic new agent mastermind where we collaborated with agents from different companies in the Des Moines market that had been in the business for 18 months or less. We talked about which things have been successful for them, what kind of challenges they are facing, and then we had a great question and answer session about whatâs brought me success in my 18 years in real estate.One thing that really surprised me was the number of agents who said that their brokers had discouraged them from buying any sort of internet leads, particularly from Zillow. They asked me if I bought Zillow leads and, if so, how do I work with them?âIf youâve paid to find out that a lead is a serious buyer, donât give up on the first try.âWe all know that agents love to hate Zillow, but the truth is that Zillow is an extremely consumer friendly tool. You need to decide if you are going to collaborate with them or work against them. I think itâs important to collaborate with a tool that consumers love. Just make sure that you know as much about it as possible so that if you do decide to play Zillowâs game, you are playing to win.There are three important things that you need to know about working with Zillow leads.The first is that the rules are always changing. Constantly follow how they are selling and distributing leads, because it could change. They do give notice somehow, but itâs in a very subtle way, so itâs up to you to understand how the lead flow process works and how they are showcasing your listings so that you know whatâs going on.With Zillow, if you get a lead, youâre likely not the only person who got that lead. Being quick, friendly, and effective is the key to converting that lead into something. Follow up with that Zillow lead is just as important as being quick with your initial response.Many agents fall into the trap of getting a lead, calling them, and maybe not being the first one to call them. The person says, âNo thanks! Iâve already been helped.â The agent then gives up, thinking the opportunity is gone.The truth is that they are still not obligated to anyone. Where youâre going to shine as an agent is in following up, so check in with them. Say, âHey, I saw another home in that neighborhood pop up on the market. Would you like that information?â or even a simple, âHow is your home search going?âDonât just follow up with them once or twice; follow up with them again and again.If you know that they are a real buyer and youâve paid to get the information that they are a buyer, donât give up on the first try. Be consistent.The third thing you need to do really well is to leverage the effectiveness of reviews. Zillow reviews are special in that they are moderated by actual people. Looking at the reviews, they check the IP address and other information submitted to determine if it really is a genuine review. Having a good number of reviews can set you apart from other agents very quickly. The number of reviews you have also affects the algorithm for who pops up in different areas and how agent searches are sorted. Having a large number of great reviews can really set you apart.If you have any other questions about Zillow leads or would like more tips about how to be effective as a real estate agent, just give me a call or send me an email. Let us know if you would like to attend our next Be Better Des Moines mastermind. We look forward to hearing from you!",

The amazing fact is that 33% of those 793 homes sold in the month of Decemberâthatâs 262 homes that sold in December alone.The average days on market for those homes that sold was five days on the market before they got an offer. Homes coming on the market that are priced right are selling right away, which is great news for our sellers.âHomes coming on the market that are priced right are selling right away, which is great news for our sellers.âAs of January 1, there are 3,201 homes for sale in the Des Moines MLS. Thatâs down by about 185 homes from December 1 of last year, which is normal this time of year. Weâll see the inventory ramp back up as we hit the springtime.Letâs take a look at the new construction home sales for 2017. Here are the top five home builders in our Des Moines MLS as of January 1:  Genesis Homes. They sold 126 new homes, including pending sales, closings, and offers made in 2017.  Greenland Homes. Greenland sold 182 homes, including condos, townhomes, and single-family homes.  Hubbell Homes. Theyâve been in the area for over 150 years, and last year, they sold 203 homes.  Jerryâs Homes. Theyâve been in the metro area for over 50 years and came out of 2017 with 207 closings and pending sales.  Classic Builders. Located up in Ankeny, they sold 346 new homes.These are big numbers for all these builders individually, but in terms of the entire market, we sold 2,455 new homes. Thatâs a great number; weâre finally starting to come back from the pre-recession levels of new home sales.We had 262 builders build at least one house in our metro area in the past year. This is an increase of 60 homes from four years prior.If you want to know more about the market or any real estate topic, you can always feel free to give us a call, send an email, or message us on Facebook.
