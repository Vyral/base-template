        "content": "How did the 2017 real estate market do and what can you expect from our market in 2018?Merry Christmas and happy New Year! As 2017 draws to a close, weâre looking back to see how the real estate market did this year and what to expect next year.In our local area, the number of sales for vacant land, condos, and single-family homes increased by 17% over 2016. The average sales price is up 8%, and the total dollar amount of sales is up 26%. Inventory is down 3% compared to 2016. We simply need more properties to sell.Despite the low inventory, pending contracts are up 18% over 2016, so this is the best market we have seen since 2005.Looking forward to 2018, many anticipate that housing costs will go up as a result of the hurricanes in Florida and Texas and the fires in California. These natural disasters impact the whole country, and they have affected the cost of housing a little bit.My husband is a local builder and he says that he has seen price increases from different vendors he works with in the area.In addition, interest rates are still low right now but they may go up a little bit in the future.Overall, the market looks good for 2018.I want to thank my coworkers for their work in 2017 and my friends and clients for their support. 2017 was a good year, and 2018 certainly looks promising.â2018 looks like another good year for real estate.âIf you have any questions about real estate, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you.Have a happy holiday season!",

        "content": "We want to share a few client testimonials we recorded from a viewing party of our guest feature on HGTVâs âBeachfront Bargain Hunt.âWe recently had the pleasure of working with HGTV to film an episode of âBeachfront Bargain Huntâ right here in Atlantic Beach. We had a great time filming the show, and weâd love for you to tune into episode 13 of season 15 to see us on TV.Here are a few client testimonials from our recent viewing party of this experience:From Bill and Fossie Latham:âLugean closed three properties with us in the course of about 60 daysâone we bought, and two we sold. The thing I appreciated the most was, you know, whether youâre buying or selling can be a bit frustrating and emotional. I mean, thereâs a lot of money involved, and Lugean, through the whole process, was very calm. She didnât let you get too optimistic; she didnât let you get too pessimistic. She kept everything on an even keel and things worked out wonderfully. We really appreciate what she did for us.âFrom Mahilda Barbee:âI worked with Lugean to buy my house when I was transferred here to open the state police credit union four years ago. She was so gracious to sell me a house in her neighborhood that not only did she sell me a house, but now Iâm her neighbor.âFrom Dale and Norma Coley:âLugean helped us find the absolute perfect condo in Atlantic Beach. She showed us at least 40 different condos and was very patient with us, and we ended up with the perfect condo. Lugean is the best.âFrom Sharon Pietzrak:âMy husband and I met Lugean in August of 2014. She helped us buy our home, which was a foreclosure and was the first one she had done. She was just tenacious and got it done. Even after we lost it in an auction, she put in a backup bid, which we didnât know she did, but it was a good thing because the deal fell through and she saved the day with that backup bid, and weâre so happy.ââIt was great having the support of our friends, family, and many of my clients.âTo see a few clips and photos from this viewing party, watch the video above.

This is currently a category 4 storm and potentially one of the worst storms ever recorded.I just wanted to offer some reminders to help you get ready for anything Mother Nature might throw at us.1. Stay tuned to the local weather station. Theyâre going to keep you updated on the critical info from the National Weather Service.2. Check your disaster supply now. Your supply kit should be ready to go with a gallon of water per person, non-perishable food for three days, flashlights, batteries, and candles.3. Remove or tie down objects in the yard. Make sure things like patio furniture are stowed away or secured so they canât blow away or cause damage.4. Take inventory of your property. We havenât had a ton of hurricane wind damage in a long time here on the Crystal Coast, but weâre very susceptible to flooding. Take pictures, do a walkthrough, and write down everything. That way, if you ever have a flood or wind insurance claim to make, youâll have something to fall back on.5. Itâs a good idea to turn the fridge and freezer all the way down. Setting the fridge and freezer to the coldest setting will help you keep it cool if the power goes out, and your food will stay fresh longer. Keep the doors closed as much as possible if you lose power.6. Donât forget to turn off the gas. If you have propane or other small appliances, make sure theyâre turned off.7. Keep your gasoline tank in your vehicles full. If thereâs flooding and you need to get out of town, be prepared to exit with a full tank.âHave an evacuation plan in place.â8. Have an evacuation plan in place. This way everyone in your family will know what to do and you wonât be scrambling at the last minute.As always, if you have any more questions, donât hesitate to reach out to us at the Star Team.

The Zestimate is their version of an estimated value for a property.A recent development in the real estate industry illustrates why you canât quite trust Zestimates. A woman in Illinois has filed a lawsuit against Zillow, claiming that her Zestimate undervalued her house and created a roadblock for its sale. Despite Zillowâs denial that they offer appraisals, the fact that theyâre promoted as a tool for potential buyers to use in assessing the market value of a property shows that the definition of an appraisal under Illinois state law was met.The lawsuit argues that Zillow should be licensed to perform appraisals and that they should also obtain the consent of a homeowner before they go online. The Zestimate in question is for a townhome that was bought for $626,000 in 2009 and recently listed on the market for roughly what it was bought. However, the homeâs most recent Zestimate was only $562,000. The homeowner is suing Zillow to either remove the Zestimate or amend it.âZestimates supposedly have a median error rate of 5%.âZillow has a different take on the situation. They donât see their Zestimates as an appraisal, but rather as a tool that utilizes a proprietary algorithm to assess value. According to some, they have a median error rate of over 5%. That can mean a lot of money on the table. Zillow is now offering a $1 million prize to anyone who can improve their algorithm.Until the Zestimate can be improved, my advice to you is to not allow Zillow to dictate your buying or selling choices. If youâre curious what your home is really worth, give me a call or send me an email and Iâd be happy to perform a real analysis on it.In the meantime, if you have any other questions about this or any other real estate topic, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "Home selling is a complicated process. Here are six things you need to avoid doing.Selling your home can be a stressful process, but avoiding these six common mistakes will make that process a lot easier and smoother:1. Picking the wrong agent. Itâs really easy to pick the wrong agent if you donât do your research on them. The right agent is going to answer the phone when you call, get back to you in a timely manner, and be a market expert. They will be honest and straightforward with you rather than agreeing with everything you say and telling you what you want to hear.2. Overpricing your home. Price is everything when marketing your home. Even a well-priced home with a bad marketing plan will sell. It will just take a little longer.3. Failing to make simple repairs. If the dog chewed something up or there are minor dents or scratches in the paint, buyers will notice that. Itâs better to get these things fixed before listing the home.âAvoiding these mistakes will make sure your home sells for the most money possible.â4. Neglecting the decluttering. Buyers start their home searches online these days and if the pictures of your home show off your stuff instead of the home itself, thereâs a good chance buyers wonât even come out to look at the home in person. Store your excess âstuffâ in the garage or a storage pod so it doesnât get in the way.5. Not allowing adequate access to your home. Your home should be show-ready at all times and you should be able to accommodate agents and their buyers when they want to see it. If a seller tells a buyer or their agent they canât see a home at a certain time or they have to reschedule, most wonât come back.6. Getting too emotional about your house. Sellers can be very attached to their homes, which is understandable. However, when you are selling your home you have to look at it as an investment, not as your home. If you get a lowball offer or someone wants to remodel a part of the home, donât take it personally as long as they pay the price you want them to.Avoiding these mistakes will make sure your home sells for the most amount of money possible in the least amount of time. If you have any questions in the meantime, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.",

        "content": "What is an appraisal and why is it important? Iâll answer those questions for you today.Appraisals have become a hot topic in todayâs market. An appraisal is what the bank uses to determine what they consider the true value of a home thatâs being bought and sold. Itâs done by a certified home appraiser who is an independent third party in the transaction.Essentially, the appraiser will take the property youâre buying or selling and look at homes in the area with similar amenities, features, and square footage in order to compare them. They will use that information, based on recent past sales, to validate the price of the property.Appraisals have become more relevant recently because we have seen some appreciation in the market. However, we frequently see homes that fail to appraise at what we expect, which is not good. If an appraiser takes information from a home that sold six months ago, the home might not appraise at the price itâs listed for today.If youâre a buyer, an appraisal is meant to protect you so you donât overpay for a home. However, it can also have a negative effect on buyers. If you fall in love with a house and agree to a certain price, your bank will only lend you money based on the appraisal. If the home doesnât appraise, youâd have to come up with the cash to make up the difference between the appraised value and the list price of the home or walk away if the seller wonât renegotiate.âAs a seller, if your home doesnât appraise, you may have to lower the price or risk losing your buyer.âAs a seller, the appraisal may affect you more than anything else in the selling process. If your home doesnât appraise, you may have to lower your price or risk your buyer walking away.At the Star Team, we provide our friends and clients with a comprehensive market analysis, or CMA. It uses a similar approach to determining a homeâs value that an appraiser does.If you have any questions about this topic or any other real estate topics, please give us a call or send us an email.

She gave him the rest of the socks, patted him on the head, and said, âNo doubt you will be more comfortable now.âAs she turned to leave, the boy grabbed her hand, and with tears in his eyes, he asked her, âAre you Godâs wife?âWith that in mind, from our team to your family, we wish you a very merry Christmas and a prosperous, happy New , happy New Year.",

I can recommend several reputable inspectors that I have used in the past that will do a good job for you.Home inspections are intended to point out adverse conditions in a home, not cosmetic flaws. At the end of the inspection, you should meet with the inspector so they can review a summary of their findings in the home. There will be flaws in every home, but itâs important to pay special attention to health and safety issues.âHome inspectors are only looking for adverse conditions.âA home inspection report just includes the basics. During an average inspection, the inspector will consider hundreds of items in and around the interior and exterior of the home. The foundation, purchases, deck, chimney, and roof will all be inspected. So will the electrical, plumbing, heating and air, attic, and garage inside the home. Having a detailed report will help make you more comfortable with the home youâre buying.The buyer hires and pays for the home inspection because you want the inspector to be working for you and alerting you to any potential problems in the home.If you have any questions about home inspections or are looking to buy or sell a home, give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "Selling a home when you have pets can be a bit of challenge, but these steps will make it markedly easier.Selling a home with pets doesnât have to be a challenge. Just make sure you take the right steps before you sell your home to ensure a smooth transaction.First, check with your insurance. You know your pet would never hurt anyone on purpose, but you may be liable if they mistake a buyer for an intruder and attack. Next, you want to prepare your yard. Buyers will walk around the yard and you donât want them to step in anything or roll an ankle in a hole your dog dug out. Check the lawn before each showing. If you canât seed for new grass to cover bare patches in time, you can cover ugly patches with new sod.Removing odors left by pets is one of the biggest challenges you need to take care of. Itâs easy to store a litter box, but itâs not easy to cover up years of accidents on rugs or hardwood floors. If a bacteria-eating cleaner doesnât help, you might want to hire a professional cleaner. If the smell persists, you may need to replace the carpet.If you have fish tanks, make them sparkle with a daily swipe of an eraser sponge.Next, make sure you clean all pet hair. Pet hair not only makes a home look messy, it can trigger allergies and send buyers wheezing out the door. Vacuum and dust before each showing or consider buying a Roomba vacuuming robot. If you have a pet that sheds, brush them frequently outside to avoid getting fur in the house.Since petsâlike kidsâtend to accumulate lots of stuff, you want to hide evidence like leashes, toys, water bowls, and food. Store away everything you can and wash pet beds to remove odors, dirt, and hair. Only keep them out if theyâre attractive.You should also consider keeping your pets in a crate or a confined area of the house while youâre out or during showings, and make sure your agent knows where they are. Keep them busy with toys or long-lasting treats. The best option is to find a play date for your pet before a showing.Remember that pets have emotions, too. When you do things like store their food and toys, crate them, and bring strangers into your home, some pets may get confused and anxious. Before you make any major changes in their life, talk to your vet.âRemember, pets have emotions too.âIf you have any more questions about the best way to sell a home with pets, give us a call or send us an email soon.

As a result, there is less competition, particularly when you consider the NEW label and the fewer days on the market that your listing will boast.Also, home buyers in the fall are more serious. They have been looking at listings for months, and they are eager to conclude their search and move in comfortably before the holidays.When you put those two things together, you get that homes listed in the fall sell more quickly and often command a higher price. In fact, fall is the season with the highest percentage of sold listings, beating out summer by 1%.Now, if you are thinking of selling your home this fall, there are a few things you have to do differently.First, you have to prepare your home to account for the particular fall conditions.For example, you need to check the HVAC system and replace your furnace filter so your home will be warm and smell fresh. Also, make sure to turn on all the lights; youâve got to compensate for the shorter, cloudier days. Cleaning up the yard is also a must.The second thing you need to do is price your home appropriately.To get started, check out the value calculator I created that takes intoaccount recent sales to give you an idea of what your home is worth right now.Enter your home address here to find out what your home is currently worth.Once you have an idea of what your home is worth, how should you price it?On the one hand, the fall is not a good time to start with a sky-high price. If you donât sell right away, you might not have time to adjust the price because of the smaller number of buyers and the shorter selling period (nobody wants to move over Christmas).On the other hand, those serious buyers I mentioned earlier might be willing to pay more simply because theyâve been looking longer and are more eager to buy.Itâs a balancing act. Itâs also something I can definitely help you with.Give me a call at 252-727-5656  if you are considering selling this fall, and Iâll give you my recommendations on how to price your home based on current conditions in the Crystal Coast.Have a great day!",
