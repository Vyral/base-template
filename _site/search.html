        "content": "Today weâre going to talk a little bit about property taxes. The big question people have is, âHow are they calculated?â Weâre going to answer that for you right now.The county you live in assesses the value of your property every year, typically in late spring/early summer. There are also taxing entities that are associated with your property, such as the school district, community hospital, community college, and sometimes a water district. Each of these entities taxes at its own rate.âThe county assesses your propertyâs value each year.âTo determine which entity taxes your property or a property you want to buy, you can go to your countyâs assessorâs website (ex. Dcad.org or dentoncad.com). This will help you figure out what the taxes will be on your current property or on the property you are thinking of buying.If you have any other questions about this topic or anything else related to the real estate or mortgage worlds, donât hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae fund virtually all of the traditional mortgage loans in the United States.They sell securities to investors such as private investors, corporate investors, insurance funds, and even foreign governments to fund loans that we write. These places buy these securities because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. What causes the rates to go up and down is the demand for those securities.If investors are buying the securities, then the yields that they pay are going down. This would mean that your interest rates decrease.âFannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae fund virtually all of the traditional mortgage loans in the United States.âMeanwhile, if the demand for those securities decreases, then they raise the yield to encourage them to buy more. This, then, would increase the interest rates.Thinking about it in terms of the stock market, if your 401(k) is going well, then interest rates are probably going up. If your 401(k) is not doing well, interest rates are probably going down.If you have any additional questions about this or anything else that is mortgage related, please feel free to give us a call.

Escrow accounts are also required whenever you use an FHA or VA loan to purchase a home.âWhen you use a mortgage loan to buy a home and you put down less than 20%, federal law requires that there be an escrow account involved in the transaction.âEssentially, you âescrowâ the future tax and insurance payments of that home. One-twelfth of your tax bill is added to your monthly mortgage payment and held in the escrow account so that when your tax bill is due, the mortgage company has enough funds to pay it. The same goes for your insurance bill.The due dates for each payment donât always alignâyour insurance payment is typically due on the anniversary of your mortgage, and your property tax payment is typically due in December.If you have any other questions about escrow accounts and how they function, donât hesitate to get in touch with me.

A down payment is a deposit made toward the cost of the home, and usually amounts to a specific percentage of the total list price.âThe amount of money that you bring to closing will vary based on several factors.âNext, closing costs are one-time fees associatedwith the home purchase. This includes the appraisal fees, the survey fees, the lender costs, and the cost of title insurance.Finally, prepaid items are recurring charges. These are things which you will pay continually as a homeowner, such as homeowners insurance, property taxes, or mortgage insurance.The amount of money that you bring to closing will vary based on the price of the house, your down payment, and your creditworthiness.If you have further questions about this or anything else real estate related, please give me a call.

Your kitchen. Kitchen remodeling can be as simple or as elaborate as you like. However, to maximize your return, keep your investment to under 20% of the value of your homeâas is recommended by surveyed real estate professionals. The outcome? A whopping 85% return on your investment.2. Your bathroom. A thorough bath remodeling project can cost up to $20,000. However, not only will it pay for itself, it should give you an added 80% return.3. Your deck. Replacing your deck can cost you anywhere from a few thousand dollars to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the size. The expected benefit will be similar to a bathroom remodeling projectâaround an 80% return for a fresh, new deck.4. Your siding. Fading or worn-out siding can turn off potential buyers before they even step foot in your home. Replacing old siding will make it much easier to sell your home, and in addition, it should give you an 80% return on an investment of around $10,000.5. Your windows. New windows can mean greater energy efficiency, increased thermal and acoustic comfort, and a more modern look. Homebuyers are well aware of this, and they are willing to pay accordingly. Thatâs why a typical window replacement should yield at least a 70% return on your investment.âSome will make more sense for your home than others.âClearly, some of them will make more sense for your home than others.

        "content": "The Fedâs recent rate hike shouldnât have any significant impact on our market. In fact, it might actually stimulate it.On June 14th, the Federal Reserve increased its federal funds interest rate by 0.25%. Theyâre also widely expected to raise rates once or twice more over the course of 2017. What does this mean for the real estate market?While any action by the Fed always garners a lot of attention, I believe these increases will not have any significant impact on our market.First of all, mortgage rates have actually trended lower in the wake of the Fedâs recent announcement. The 30-year mortgage rate recently hit 3.9%, the lowest level in 2017. In fact, itâs a common pattern for the mortgage rate and the Fed rate to move in opposite directions, and the same thing has happened the last two times the Fed raised rates.Second, the economy continues to do well. The Fed decided to increase its rate because unemployment and inflation are low, household spending is picking up, and weâve seen steady growth for the past nine years. This is good news for the real estate market. As expected, we continue to see strong demand and a corresponding increase in home prices.âThese increases will not have any significant impact on our market.âThird, while the Fedâs rate increase is normally meant to cool off the economy, it might actually stimulate it in this case. Because interest rates were so low for such a long period of time, experts believe the recent increases might ease pressure on the financial system and encourage lending.Case in point: since the Fed started raising its rate in December 2016, total mortgages are up 2.5% year over year.In conclusion, while any move by the Fed is likely to lead to a lot of hand-wringing, I believe the real estate market will not be affected and will continue on its own healthy course. Nonetheless, itâs clear that right now is a uniquely good moment for everyone in the real estate market. Todayâs low mortgage rates are good for homebuyers because they make homes more affordable.If you have any questions about our market or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home, give me a call or send me an email.

This can drastically lower your debt-to-income ratio and give you a much better chance of qualifying for a mortgage.Some folks are lucky enough to have their student debt paid by their parents or even by their employer. The thing is, Fannie Mae didnât take this into account when calculating the debt-to-income ratio. Thatâs the second new change.If your employer or your parents have been paying off your student debt and you can show evidence of this for the past 12 months, then this debt wonât be counted in your debt-to-income ratio. This makes it more likely you will qualify for a mortgage.âIf you can qualify for a mortgage right now, you definitely should.âIf you can qualify for a mortgage right now, you definitely should. Rates are still at a historical low, and lots of great houses have recently come on the McKinney market.Fannie Mae also makes it possible to refinance your mortgage for more than the value of your home. Normally, there is a 0.25% fee that applies to any cash you take out in this way.The third big change is that Fannie Mae will now waive that fee when you use this cash to pay off a student loan.This applies whether the loan is yours, or youâre a cosigner. If the mortgage rate is significantly lower than the student loan rate, it can make sense to refinance in this way, and the new rule makes it cheaper to do so.If you need help understanding these new guidelines to see whether theyâre right for you, or you have questions about putting them into practice, get in touch with me.

A whopping 55% of prospective homebuyers cited this as their main stumbling block.And with the continuing growth of home prices, things arenât getting any easier. In fact, homeownership rates reached a 20-year low last November.It wasnât always like this.A decade ago, many lenders were offering easy, no-money-down mortgages.However, after the financial crisis, mortgage standards have become more restrictive. A typical mortgage now requires a 20% down payment.â55% cited the lack of a down payment as their main stumbling block.âHereâs the good news.If you have decent credit and a steady income, you might be qualified for a number of specialized programs that require no or very little down payment. Here are a few of the top options.First, thereâs the USDA loan, which is valid for homes in certain regions, such as rural and suburban areas.With zero money down and lenient credit requirements, the USDA loan can be a great choice for many homeowners.Second, thereâs the VA loan, which you can apply for if you or your spouse served in a branch of the military.Itâs possibly the most generous zero-money-down mortgage because of low interest rates and low closing costs.Third, thereâs the FHA loan. It does require a 3.5% down payment â still drastically more achievable than the 20% required for a conventional mortgage.Finally, there are a number of credit unions and first-time homebuyer programs that might apply to your particular situation.Thereâs one important thing you should know.If you get one of these no-money-down mortgages, chances are good you will be required to pay private mortgage insurance, which can drive up your monthly payments.Fortunately, private mortgage insurance will disappear after your mortgage balance is under 80%. Also, the money you do pay will be tax deductible in most cases.In short, there are lots of options to make owning a home a reality for you, even if you havenât saved up tens of thousands of dollars.If youâre considering buying a home, give me a call and we can discuss your options.Buying a McKinney Home?

That means that one out of every four deals falls through, or 25% of the people end up having to put down earnest money, lose their inspection costs, and possibly lose their appraisal fee.âDonât end up as a cautionary statistic.âWhat can you do to make sure you donât end up becoming one of these statistics?If youâre a home buyer, start the pre-qualification process as early as possible. Get your documentation in order and choose a lender that has a track record of success.If youâre a seller, do what you can to verify the pre-approval. Check out things like what kind of lender the buyer is using, how much theyâre putting down, and how many days they need for the financing contingency.If you or anyone you know has questions about the mortgage process or about real estate in general, please donât hesitate to call us or visit our website. We look forward to hearing from you!",

Itâs very important that you know who your insurance agent is early on! We can help with that if you need some referrals.The next step is to send it to underwriting, which only takes a couple of days.

        "content": "Today and I wanted to talk about the home renovation program, which helps homeowners finance improvements, repairs, and upgrades into their mortgage so they donât have to pay for these things out of pocket.For this loan, you can finance up to 95% of the cost of the house and the improvements, or the total improved value (whichever is less). This can also apply to refinance customers, who can refinance their current mortgage plus the cost of the improvements for up to 95% of the improved value.âStart with your ideal location and use this loan to create your ideal home.âIf youâre in the market to buy but you just canât seem to find the perfect house in the perfect location, this loan program is perfect. Start with the perfect location, and you can use this program to buy a fixer-upper to turn into your perfect home.If you already own a home and are dreaming of repairs, you can still take advantage of this program, depending on the equity you have in your home.This program allows for all kinds of renovations. The only requirement is that the upgrades are affixed to the home and that they increase its value. This could mean a kitchen remodel, new fixtures, or even a pool.If you have questions about this program, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email today. Iâd love to hear from you.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "As a homeowner, there are many ways you can save money without refinancing.First, you can have your conventional mortgage insurance removed. If you bought a house in the last five years, there is a good chance you can remove mortgage insurance because home values have gone up 8% to 10%.You should also check on your home insurance. Insurance rates change all the time. For instance, if a company with higher exposure in certain areas gets hit by a storm, their rates will go up. A company with less exposure would probably keep the same rates despite the storm, giving you good coverage for less money. Switching insurance companies could save you a lot of money in the long run.âHome Insurance rates change all the time, so shop around for a better one.âIf youâre happy with your insurance, consider checking your utility rates. You donât have much choice when it comes to things like gas, water, and trash. However, you can save money on your electricity, phone, cable, or internet bill. You can research different rates on your own by checking PowerToChoose.org or we can hook you up with a free concierge service that will shop the rates and get you the best program.Finally, file that homestead exemption to save 15% to 20% on your property taxes. You have to be the owner of record on January 1st and you have three months to file the exemption. Once that exemption has been filed, itâs good for that year and all the other years you spend in that house.As you can see, refinancing is not the only way you can save money on your house. If you have any questions for me, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

Hereâs how we differentiate ourselves from the pack:      Knowledge. We know the business, including all the guidelines and how to make things work in an ever-changing mortgage world.        Flexibility. We have home loans for everyone. Whether you need to buy a mansion with a super jumbo loan, or youâre a first-time buyer who needs down payment assistance, we can help you. We have loans for those with great credit, and those who have some hiccups. We even have loans for people who have gone through bankruptcy or a foreclosure last week.        Communication. We work really hard at it. The level of communication between Realtor, lender, and customer in this industry is horrible. We donât accept that. Our process is fine-tuned so that no Realtor or customer will ever be in the dark. If you ever have questions for us, weâll get right back to you.  Finally, we have our $10,000 closing insurance program. We are so proud of our process that if we fail to perform on our commitment to a customer, we will pay them $10,000. If thatâs not different, we donât know what is.âWe have home loans for everyone.âIf you have any questions for us, please give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you!",

			<p>Hello, My name is Rob Spring with the Spring Mortgage Team at AmeriFirst Financial of Texas. I am a License Loan Originator and we are a local Mortgage Lender and Broker. Our office is just off the Historic Downtown Square in McKinney, Texas.
I have been in Mortgage and Real Estate for 15 years. Iâve seen the ups and downs â The Mortgage World has changed quite a bit over the years. Iâve worked for the big bank, the Mom and Pop, ran branches and teams - Iâve found my forever home with AmeriFirst.</p>
