Search All Homes on the MLSToday weâre going to discuss some of the unexpected costs you may run into when purchasing a home, specifically regarding closing costs.Closing costs are different from the cost to close. A lot of people think closing costs are everything theyâll need to close on a home.âTHE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPECIFIC CLOSING COSTS AND THE TOTAL COST TO CLOSE COULD BE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.âIn our area, however, closing costs are strictly defined in the contract, so the difference between specific closing costs and the total cost to close could be thousands of dollars.Your annual homeowners insurance is not a closing costâit is a cost to close, as are property taxes. Things like that can run up your cost to close very quickly, so when youâre getting a quote for closing costs, make sure itâs not just for closing costs, but how much money you will actually need in total to be able to close on the home.If you need any information about this or other topics, please feel free to contact us.",

Get the Value of Your Central or Southwest Virginia HomeLooking to Buy a Home? Search All Homes on the MLSIf a prospective buyer zips in and out of your house, theyâre probably not a serious buyerâat least not for your house.There are a variety of reasons why a buyer would make a speedy visit. Maybe when they drove up to your home, they didnât like the landscaping, the exterior, or just the neighborhood in general. Perhaps when they walked into the house there was a smell or odor they didnât like. Maybe it just wasnât the right house for them.âA SPEEDY VISIT MEANS THAT BUYER PROBABLY ISNâT INTERESTED IN YOUR HOUSE.âA serious buyer, on the other hand, will stop and envision themselves in your house. Theyâll take the time to imagine where their furniture would go and mentally pick out rooms for their children.Itâs very rare that a buyer zips in and out of your house and then comes back to make an offer on it.

Search All Homes on the MLSThere are two types of loans that you can get to help fund your renovation project: the FHA loan and conventional loan.The conventional loan is the more difficult of the two to get approved for. You need more money down than the other one, and we donât use that one very often for renovation projects.The FHA 203K loan has two different options, depending on the size of your renovation project. Thereâs a streamlined loan that is for repairs that are $30,000 or less and a full FHA 203k that is for as much as you need, as long as the house appraises as repaired.âON A FULL FHA LOAN, YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WOULD LIKE TO THE HOME, AS LONG AS IT APPRAISES.âWhen you apply for the loan, you need to have two separate contractors come out to the house and write a bid for the repairs that they see that need to be done. These two bids need to matchânot on the dollar amount but on what needs to be done to the home. Those bids are then sent to the lender so they can approach for the requested amount.For the streamlined FHA loan, those repairs can only go up to $30,000 and canât be on anything structural, so no walls can be knocked out or rooms added. On a full FHA loan, you can do whatever you would like to the homeâadd or take out walls, add a new master bedroom or bathroomâas long as the house appraises with those items included and itâs under the lending limit, which in our area is $271,000.If you have any questions about renovation loans, feel free to give me a call.

Search All Homes on the MLSA question my team and I often get is, âWhat happens when my agent meets a buyer at my open house?âThe first thing to know is that nationally, less than 7% of open houses sell. In fact, the purpose of an open house is not typically to sell. The point is to acquire buyers.To tell the truth, open houses donât work as well now as they used to for one simple reason: the internet. Most people find a large portion of their information about a given home online.With things like the floor plan, 3D images, and videos available, physically visiting the home often doesnât come until the point where a buyer is fairly serious about making an offer.âDONâT PUT TOO MUCH STOCK IN THE BUYERS WHO SHOW UP TO AN OPEN HOUSE.âBut where they lack in successful selling power, open houses are still effective in attracting buyers.Along with those buyers, though, an open house can also draw out a lot of nosy neighbors.So if your agent does do an open house, donât put too much stock in the buyers who show up there.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.
