        "content": "Thereâs a lot going on in the Northwest Arkansas market this year.The market is booming and there are a lot of great things happening. According to the Northwest Arkansas Council, there are 31 people moving in every day and research from the University of Arkansas shows that the average age of residents here is 33.As for market activity, I wanted to look at things in terms of Benton County and Washington County.There are currently about 1,500 homes for sale in Benton County and roughly a quarter are new builds. In Washington County, there are 738 homes for sale with 149 being new builds. Through the first five months of the year in Benton County, 2,375 homes have sold compared to 2,279 during the same period last year. In Washington County, 1,406 homes sold in the first five months of 2017. That number last year was 1,341.âPrices are definitely up.âInterestingly, prices are definitely up. In Benton County, price per square foot rose about $8. The number of days it takes to sell a home on average has held steady in Benton County, but in Washington County, homes are selling in an average of about 30 days faster than last year. Prices in Washington County are also up by about $7 per square foot.New construction home sales are up by about 80 this year in Benton County and up by about 60 in Washington County. Prices are also up about $8 a square foot for such homes. If you thought about buying a home last year but waited until this year, it will cost you about $20,000 more on average.Interest rates are still low for homes, making it still a great time to buy. March marked the 31st consecutive quarter of incline in the economy, tying for third-longest in the history of the U.S. economy.If youâre interested in buying a home or you have any other questions, donât hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "At the Limbird Real Estate Group, we are proud to always be on the cutting edge of technology. This is why we are thrilled to announce our adoption of 3-D home tours. Buying a home can be a taxing process, especially for out-of-town buyers. Typically, Realtors use still photos and some use video to market their homes to buyers. This is only a 2-D experience, however.We are investing in a three-dimensional experience for our buyers and sellers. Open houses are usually only held for a few hours each week. With our easy-to-navigate 3-D tours, however, your home can be open 24/7, 365 days a year.âWith these tours, you have a 360-degree view of each room.âWe take you beyond the real world with a complete digital scan that gives buyers an unprecedented insight into your home like never before. With the use of lasers and high-tech cameras, potential buyers can select any room to view and instantly place themselves inside that space with the ability to maneuver inside the room and view it in 360 degrees. Buyers will be able to virtually walk through your home, get a feel for its layout, and notice details and features that they typically wouldnât with still images.When you combine the fact that the majority of homebuyers start their search online with the power of photos being shared on social media, this is an amazing tool for a seller like yourself to take advantage of. Our team currently advertises on more than 100 websites and weâre ready to put our state-of-the-art technology to work for you.If you have any questions for us, donât hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.",

        "author": "Alyssa Sisco",
        "category": "",
        "content": "This time of year, we get a lot of people telling us they are going to wait to sell until spring or summer because there will be more buyers. While itâs true that there are a larger number of buyers in spring and summer, there is also a lot more inventory for buyers to choose from.In our market, we have a large relocation of clients that move in and out of the area each year. These people usually make their moves toward the end or beginning of the year. We also have a situation where sellers who took their homes off the market during the holidays are mostly waiting until spring to list.âYou have a window of opportunity right now.âThis gives you a window of opportunity now in which there isnât a lot of inventory, but you also have a ton of buyers looking and a time of year where people are getting their tax refunds or bonus checks. When buyers have extra money burning a hole in their pocket, they are ready to spend.There arenât a whole lot of homes for them to look at right now. The chances of selling your home more quickly and for a higher price are very good right now. It all depends on your situation, but things look good overall. Interest rates are also expected to go up three separate times this next year. That will further affect the number of buyers that look at your house.If you have any questions for us or want to sell your home, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to help you out and give you the straight answer. We look forward to hearing from you!",

        "content": "If youâre selling your home, there are four things that you can do to sell your home faster than anybody else in your neighborhood.      Update the landscaping. Curb appeal is huge. If buyers donât like what they see on the outside, they may never come in and see the inside. Trim your shrubs, pick your weeds, and put a layer of fresh mulch down to make your landscape look new again.        Paint. Nothing will make a home feel brand new like new paint on the walls. In the grand scheme of things, paint is relatively inexpensive but can pay huge dividends when itâs time for buyers to make an offer.        Move out of the house. Make it appear as though youâve moved out. If youâre still living in your home, get rid of as much as you can. Like we always say, âClutter eats equity.â Clutter can make buyers think that the house is smaller than it is or has less storage than it does. The more you can get rid of, the easier it will be to get the home ready for showings, and homes that show well tend to get more offers.        Price your home correctly the first time. We analyze price changes and days on market for homes that have sold recently, and most of the time weâve found that the homes that were priced right the first time sold quicker and for more money than the homes that reduced their price. Even if youâre not in a hurry to sell your home, a home that is priced correctly will net you more money on the bottom line in the end, so itâs important to get out onto the market with the right price the first time.  âHomes that sell faster sell for more money.âFollow these four tips, and youâll sell your home faster than anybody else on your block. If you have any other questions about buying or selling a home in the Northwest Arkansas market, give me a call or send me an email. Iâd be happy to help you!",

        "content": "How can technology attract high-end buyers to your home? HGTV actually said that 46% of consumers think technology is very important for their current or future residencies. In fact, Digital Interior said that 94% of buyers surveyed would sacrifice 1,000 square feet of living space for new technology in their new home.Obviously, technology is important to home buyers. One of the latest trends in home technology that will draw high-end buyers is the smart thermostat. Smart thermostats allow you to control the temperature in your home from your smartphone. You can change the temperature from your couch or your car while going to work.Home surveillance technology is also very important. Cameras can be mounted discreetly on the walls and ceilings. Buyers will appreciate that they can check in on their home even if they are at work or on vacation. Not only that, you will feel more secure knowing that you can see what is going on in your home.âAbout 94% of buyers would sacrifice 1,000 sq ft of living space for new technology.âYou should also pay attention to technological developments in the kitchen. There are touchless water faucets that come on with just a hand motion, and there are also smart refrigerators. Smart refrigerators will alert you when youâre running low on groceries so that you know when itâs time to head to the store. You can also get a Bluetooth thermostat so that your meals will be perfectly cooked all the time.Finally, luxury entertainment is always a big draw for home buyers. Flat screen TVs and home theaters are fantastic. Not only that, you can control your entertainment system, your security system, and your thermostat from one remote control by Savant!If you have any questions about the latest trends in home technology or want to know more ways to prepare your home for the market, give me a call or send me an email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "As you may have heard, the real estate market is incredibly busy. A lot of our buyers are running into multiple offer situations. How do you win?First, make sure you are pre-approved and that you have a letter in hand. If a seller receives two offers and only one has a pre-approval letter, they will obviously go with the pre-approved buyer.Letâs say you have two offers and both have been pre-approved. One buyer got pre-approved through a local bank, and the other worked with an out-of-town bank. Any Realtor will tell you that working with a local lender is incredibly important.Our team works with several lenders on a daily basis, and we definitely trust them. It is much easier to get things done when you work with someone local. Local lenders close loans faster, and there arenât as many headaches during the closing process. Why complicate the biggest purchase you will ever make by working with someone from out of town?âMake sure you are pre-approvedâAnother tip for buyers in multiple offer situations is to be flexible. Sellers donât necessarily go for the offer with the best price. Other factors often come into play. Some sellers might not want to move until school is out, so if you can be flexible with your closing date, you will have the advantage over other buyers.The main thing you can do to win in a multiple offer situation is work with a professional real estate agent. There are a lot of new agents in the market and selling real estate can be a complicated process. Last year, our team sold over 500 homes, so we have lots of experience negotiating the right deal and helping buyers get the keys to their brand new home.If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email.

Itâs a big promise to make, and Iâd like to explain how we manage to keep this promise for our clients who qualify for this program.Most sellers are often uneasy about the selling price of their home and if a buyer will be found for it. However, with our Guaranteed Sale Program, we agree on a price and a time frame immediately. In the last two years, we have only had to buy one property from our clients using this program.We have used this program with many of our clients, and itâs worked very well for almost all of them. As you can see, these two people that we helped in the past also thought that the Guaranteed Sold Program was too good to be true. However, their home did sell and they walked away very happy and willing to recommend us to their friends.Keep in mind that the Guaranteed Sale Program is only available in Benton and Washington Counties, but that covers a majority of Northwest Arkansas.If youâre selling your home, you owe it to yourself to come down and meet us.

        "content": "Choosing to buy a home is an important decision, and one you shouldnât make without doing proper research. Today, weâve got some tips for you on the types of questions you should be asking the homeowner or your Realtor about a potential home purchase. Proper preparation is the key to getting what you want in a home. Hereâs where you should narrow your focus:The NeighborhoodThe location of your home is very important. How close are you to different stores, gas stations, or other amenities? Would you rather be in a bustling area or a quieter part of town? Is there any new construction going on in your neighborhood? If so, how will this affect your homeâs value? These are all different questions you should be asking when determining where you want to live.SchoolsAnother equally important topic to learn about is your potential homeâs proximity to different schools. Find out what district your home is in. Even if you donât have any kids, being in a good school district increases your homeâs value when it comes time to sell.The Little thingsThere are a ton of different, little things you need to check up on when researching potential homes. Ask about the little things like electric and utility bills, the age of the roof, hot water heater, and other appliances. If you have a lot of maintenance to do on a home, that will impact the kind of offer you make on it.These are just a few of the questions you should be asking when researching homes. If you have any questions for us, or want to learn some more of the questions you should be asking when looking for a home, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to help!",

        "content": "Living in a For Sale home is often a very stressful experience, but it doesnât have to be. I have a few tips to help make the selling process go as smoothly as possible in this situation:      Start packing now. The nice thing about starting the packing process soon than later is it gets rid of the clutter. One thing to remember is that clutter eats equity, so this is a crucial thing to do when selling.        Clean up your home. Make sure everything from your baseboards to your ceiling fans are clean. If clutter eats equity, clean means green, which means more money in your pocket when you sell.        Store valuables in a safe place. Weâve never had anything go missing from one of our listings, but it does happen! Make sure your valuables are in a safe place, away from anywhere a buyer might be looking.        Get your kids involved. Getting your kids involved in the selling process will take a lot of the stress off. Have the kids help you get the home ready for showtime!  If youâre living in your home while itâs on the market, these things should make a huge difference!
