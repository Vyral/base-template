It’s important to all of us at The Wolek Group that we connect with our friends, family, and community to make sure you’re safe and that we’re providing you with all the resources we possibly can. If you need anything at all, please reach out to us. We’ve already sent you helpful resources, but we want to be doubly sure you have everything you need. We have a Facebook page called Tulsa Looks Good on You, which was created to share all the wonderful things Tulsa has to offer, and during this time we’re being extremely deliberate about adding helpful things to it to assist our community. We look forward to seeing you soon and giving you a real hug or handshake—for now, it’s virtual. “With interest rates still low, there is plenty of activity.”We do want you to know we’re still doing business. People are still buying and selling homes. We’re watching the numbers every day, and believe it or not, with interest rates still low, there is plenty of activity. For those that need to buy or sell, we’re taking extra steps to be cautious during this health crisis. For example, we’re conducting tons of virtual open houses, home tours, and appointments via Zoom and FaceTime. Still seeing each other sometimes is critical during this distancing period.If you have questions or need anything, please contact us via phone or email. We look forward to seeing and talking with you soon.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "We love Tulsa, we love food, and we really love new bars in town! We’re so excited to introduce you to Niki and Andrew Layson, the owners of Bar 473 here in Kendall Whittier district. The bar’s name is an homage to the building it occupies, which was once a nationally registered historic place: Phillips 66 gas station No. 473, one of the early businesses in the first suburban development of Tulsa. According to Andrew, the location was also unique in that it allowed for more patio space, creating a more organic social atmosphere. Beyond being nestled in a lovely neighborhood, 473 draws in patrons with well-crafted, affordable cocktails. Providing a venue for local acts—comedy, music, poetry, etc.—also means that 473 is truly a community gathering space. Niki and Andrew were able to accent the neutral colors of the World War II-era building and create a clean, inviting space. The bar’s minimalist approach to decor ensures that the smaller inside area never feels too overcrowded. “Beyond being nestled in a lovely neighborhood, 473 draws patrons in with well-crafted, affordable cocktails.”Right across the way from American Slayer and Cabin Boys Brewery, 473 is yet another testament to the increasing vibrancy of our Tulsa community! Though the many bars and breweries in this district cooperate more than compete, 473 aims to separate itself from the pack by having a deeper commitment to the city’s blossoming music scene. As Andrew put it, “We need to pay more attention to those local artists that are creating real, raw music and who are trying to put themselves out there as artists.” Follow 473 on Instagram (@four.seven.three) and Facebook (@bar473), or visit their website: www.bar473.com.If you have any questions about the wonderful ways in which Tulsa is growing, or you’re interested in buying or selling soon, give us a call. We’d love to talk with you.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Each year, our team has the privilege of helping hundreds of families make their real estate dreams come true. We know buying and selling a home can be stressful, but if you work with us, we make it easy on you. Through these incredible experiences, we create friendships and memories that last a lifetime.With that in mind, I want to share a testimonial from one of our clients that speaks to our mission in this business. “We know buying and selling a home can be stressful, but if you work with us, we make it easy on you.”We helped the Garman family sell their old home and buy a new one. They interviewed three Realtors before reaching out to us, but once they did, they described it as “a dream come true.”At the time, they already had enough stress they could handle, so they wanted the buying and selling process to be as stress-free as possible.

        "content": "Today I sat down for a chat with Nate Araskog, an agent here at The Wolek Group. He’s here to share his experiences as an agent on our team.Before coming to The Wolek Group, Nate Araskog had obtained his real estate license and worked with Daniel Sprik, a Realtor and good friend of his who had encouraged him to get into the industry in the first place. I helped him to sell a couple of his properties before, so one day Nate and I met for coffee. It was supposed to have been a short introduction, but it ended up becoming a two-and-half-hour meeting. During that conversation, Nate saw my experience and the opportunities that lay in the foundation of my team’s structure and he decided he wanted to be a part of it.For my part, the conversation over coffee had originally been about real estate in general, but toward the end, something clicked within me. I asked him, “Are you asking me all these questions to join Keller Williams or to join my team?”“It’s fun to be on the front end of change within the real estate industry at large.” With a smile on his face, Nate responded, “I don’t know—maybe both.”With that, I recommended that he and I set up another time to get back together. We did, and the rest is history.We’ve grown so much since then, and his experience with our team and with Keller Williams has been fabulous overall. It’s fun to be on the front end of change within the real estate industry at large.By the time Nate and I met for that fateful coffee meeting, he was already a go-getter who found success as a single agent. What was he missing that helped him see the value of joining a team?For him, the biggest factor was the opportunity to learn from someone who had experience. He knew that our team would provide the ability to help people as a part of an organization, not just a single agent. He knew from the first time we met that the partnership we could create by being in business together was going to be hugely successful for all of us.If you have any questions about starting career in real estate or would like to contact us about joining The Wolek Group yourself, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to hear from you and discuss why making the switch to Keller Williams and The Wolek Group would be a great decision for the trajectory of your career.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "If you have a craving for wood-fired pizza, I have just the place to introduce you to on the latest episode of “Tulsa Foodie.”On the latest episode of “Tulsa Foodie,” I want to introduce you to one of my favorite restaurants: the East Village Bohemian Pizzeria. Joining me for a quick sit-down is Amy McMillin, who co-owns the restaurant with her brother. Amy and her brother have been involved in the food industry since they were teenagers, and they share a special love of Italian food. Amy got her first taste of wood-fired pizza 15 years ago when she got the chance to visit Naples, and after she did, she decided that she had to recreate the same taste back home. The secret to their pizza’s amazing taste, according to Amy, is their dedication to cooking everything fresh and authentic, just like they do in Italy. “I learned the hard way that you need a reservation on most nights if you want to get a table here.”“Every morning,” she says, “we come in and light the fire in our wood-fired oven, which has no gas—we’re stacking the wood and making the fire—and we’re roasting all the fresh vegetables every day. All the meats are getting roasted. We make our dough from scratch. We import our flour from Italy. And we’re doing that fresh every single day.”In addition to the great food, they have a fun, cool vibe inside their restaurant. Their five-year anniversary at their current location in downtown Tulsa is coming up on December 19, and in those five years, they’ve built a wine room and a second kitchen which makes handmade pasta daily. They also have an amazing patio (which I’m a big fan of), where guests are known to wine and dine year-round—even when the temperature is nearly freezing. I learned the hard way that you need a reservation on most nights if you want to get a table here, and I can’t wait to try my next Bohemian pizza. If you’d like to know more about the East Village Bohemian Pizzeria, visit their website atwww.eastvillagebohemian.com or check out their Instagram feed @bohemianpizzatulsa.As always, if you have any questions for me or there’s anything I can help you with, give me a call or shoot me an email.",

        "title": "The Story Behind My Career in Real Estate",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": " People often ask me how I got into real estate, and so I’d like to share that story with all of you today.I’m originally from Tulsa and attended the University of Oklahoma just a couple hours away from there (Boomer Sooner!). I spent a lot of those years in school being average and only just barely getting by. I think that’s because, like a lot of college-aged kids, I didn’t know my passion or purpose in life. Finally, I got into classes that I cared about and I realized that I was a good student after all. I went on to get my master’s degree in Human Relations.During that time, I was still waiting tables at the mall in Norman. I really think that a lot of the best real estate agents are those who have been servers. A friend of mine from high school who had just gotten into real estate reached out to me, asking if I needed to buy a house. At the time, I didn’t have any money, so how was I supposed to buy a house? To that, he responded, “You should get into real estate; a friend in my office just made $100,000 last month.”The flexibility and lucrative nature of the real estate industry was very appealing to me at that age. After a while, though, I realized that there was a lot more hard work necessary than just selling lots of houses and raking in the money. I realized that my work ethic, which I somehow just had in me, was starting to pay off.I began working for a small brokerage with just five people in the office. I was learning how to be a property manager and how to be an office manager; I partnered with a broker and got to go on listing appointments and worked with homebuyers. After four years of working in real estate in Norman I knew that I was getting to the age where I wanted to be able to get back home to my family. I sold the two houses that I had bought in those four years and moved back home to Tulsa.“We’re always looking for more people to come into our world so that we can help more families, have fun, give back to the community, and live large.”Once I did, I signed on with a local, traditional real estate company. I was doing well at the time, but I didn’t know how to be anything other than a lead receiver, which means that I would show up to open houses and smile and be nice to people—over time, they would open up and let me help them.Then, I discovered a company called Keller Williams. That’s when everything changed for me in my business and my personal life. Once I signed on with Keller Williams, I just ate up all of the available training, coaching, and mentoring that I could get my hands on. That really opened my mind; I started to dream big and realized that with Keller Williams, I could achieve those dreams.However, as a single agent, I was starting to get overwhelmed. I was working all kinds of crazy hours, and when I reached a breaking point, I knew that I needed help. That’s when the idea of building a team entered my mind. I didn’t want to build a team to crush the faces off the Tulsa, Oklahoma real estate market, but rather because I wanted to hold on to my sanity! I wanted to be a good wife, mother, and agent, and building a team allowed me to do that.What’s fun about growing a team is that you get to help others do the same. It’s such an amazing experience. We’re always looking for more people to come into our world so that we can help more families, have fun, give back to the community, and live large.If you’ve ever thought about starting a career in real estate, or if you’re currently in the business but you’re not finding the success that you want, reach out to me. I’d love to chat with you about an amazing opportunity to join our team.",

        "content": "Why does Katherine Fondren recommend The Wolek Group to anyone interested in buying or selling real estate? Today, she can tell you herself:“I had a home that I needed to sell. I had known Jennie Wolek over the years through mutual friends, and I was definitely looking for something different… something outside of the box. I was a Realtor in Louisiana when I lived there, so I thought I knew everything about the real estate business, but that was a long time ago, before the age of social media and all kinds of new marketing things.“That’s why I loved about Jennie and what her company was doing: They were doing some outside-the-box marketing. Jennie would come over; we sat at my kitchen table and discussed what our goals were. She asked me what I liked best about my home and what prospective buyers should know about it. I was happy to share that information and she definitely used it in her marketing.“I felt she really wanted to do what was best for me and my family, as well as the people buying my home.”“Then we immediately started the buying process. I met with one of her buyer’s agents and we discussed what we were looking for and needed in a home. And throughout the process, there was a lot of feedback, which I really value; being a former Realtor, I know that’s really important. A lot of my friends who are looking for Realtors always want feedback. If someone looked at your house, what did they think? How can we improve? What do they like? What do they not like?“When we finally did get a buyer, I was really excited. Jennie did everything she could to walk us through the process. She was great from beginning to end, and I felt she really wanted to do what was best for me and my family, as well as the people buying my home.“We found this beautiful house that we’re standing in right now in a neighborhood we didn’t even know about. It’s a new home from a builder I didn’t know; Jennie’s team had the knowledge of the market, so they knew what was going on even in new construction. “I’m thankful to The Wolek Group for helping steer us in the right direction and helping us find our dream home. It’s a wonderful process from beginning to end, very stress-free with a lot of communication, and I definitely, definitely recommend them!”If you, like Katherine, ever need any help with your real estate needs, please feel free to reach out to us here at The Wolek Group.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I’m excited to introduce you to my friend Luke Frazier with INSPiRE Financial Group. I met Luke at a Tulsa Chamber of Commerce event and I was so inspired by him and how he runs his business as a financial planner.Luke started this firm three years ago with what he calls “uncommon knowledge.” He felt that the industry as a whole was going in one direction, but not enough people were asking why. We’ve taken that knowledge and applied strategies and recommendations behind it to better our clients. As opposed to the stock market, they tend to focus on cash flow.Products and services can only get you so far if you don’t have a strong “why.” For Luke, he believes that there are five core areas in which everyone is trying to improve: relationships with family and friends, career, finances, spiritual well-being, and physical well-being. Luke and INSPiRE feel like the financial aspect too often adds stress or negatively affect the other five areas. Their goal with their clients is to put strategies in place to turn the financial aspect into a positive and positively affects the other areas.“Everybody has a different personality and mindset about finances.”Way too many people are relying on Wall Street and big banks for their finances. Luke and his team promote investing in themselves instead of Wall Street or big banks. They work with a lot of small business owners and even real estate investors to produce cash flow instead of just putting money away and not ever seeing it for 30 years.Their program is based on what the truly wealthy people in our country do. They go to work and make money, put their money to work for them, and use other people’s money to make even more money. They finance their own deals and use their own leverage, and Luke uses a lot of these types of strategies with his clients. As opposed to paying a lump sum for a boat, for example, you can take that amount and put it towards a rental property, for example. The income on the property can pay that mortgage and the loan on the boat. If we repeat that process over and over, it will create wealth.Everybody has a different personality and mindset about finances. Where Luke and his team shine are with the clients with abundant mindsets who want to get wealthy now and not wait for it for later.To learn more about Luke and what he does at INSPiRE, visit their website at www.planwithinspire.com or call Luke at (918) 500-2931.Thanks so much to Luke for joining me. If you have any other questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon. ",

Whether you’re preparing to sell your home and move or you just want to simplify, Blue Jay’s owner Britt Greenwood says that decluttering is the way to go. This is especially important if you’re planning to sell your home. Look at your countertops in the kitchen—a good rule of thumb is to have no more than two or three appliances on them.“A good rule of thumb is to have no more than two or three appliances on your countertops.”In the bathroom, try not to have more than a handful of items on your surfaces, including your shower. When you sell your home, you need to live in it differently than you would if you weren’t planning to move.As you’re decluttering the home, pack things in moving boxes to help speed up the moving process. When filled, these boxes can be stored in the garage or in an out-of-the-way storage area.It’s also a good idea to make a list of things that need to be done in your home regarding renovations, repairs, and touch-ups. Be sure to have all those things done before you have a professional house cleaner visit your home, since trade workers can sometimes leave a mess.If you’d like to contact Britt for an estimate, reach out to her by phone at (918) 277-3378, visit her website at www.BlueJayCleaning.com, or visit her Facebook page. One-time cleanings can be discussed over the phone, but if you have need of a recurring service, she or one of her staff members can come visit your home to see what needs to be done.For any questions you have for me or the Wolek Group at large, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

Having been in business for almost 22 years, Revitalize T-Town (formerly Rebuilding Together Tulsa) is an incredible force for good in our community. “Revitalize T-Town, or ‘RTT’ as we call it, makes homes safe, secure, and weather-proof for homeowners within the Tulsa city limits,” says Jennifer. The majority of RTT’s clients are seniors or individuals with disabilities, and these people generally find out about the organization through word of mouth. The more people RTT helps, the more their reputation grows in our community. And the more their reputation grows, the more effectively they’re able to achieve their mission: revitalizing Tulsa.“The more their reputation grows, the more effectively they’re able to achieve their mission: revitalizing Tulsa.”The first step RTT takes after receiving and reviewing an application is to assess the person’s home and determine what must be done to improve its condition. After that, the various improvement projects a given home needs are ranked by priority so that local contractors can handle the most urgent areas first. You can check out the video above at 1:13 for a slideshow of some before and after photos from RTT’s previous projects. Even more impressively, the money that funds RTT comes straight from our community. That said, monetary donations are always welcome. Still, there are many other ways to give back. If you’re a local contractor like an electrician or plumber, RTT would be happy to connect you with projects that fit your skill set. If you’re interested in helping out or learning more, please visit https://revitalizettown.org/. And, as always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "What are we seeing from the spring market so far? How are mortgage rates affecting buyers and sellers? Today I’ve invited Chris Padley of the Gateway Mortgage Group to join me for a quick chat so he can help answer these questions. Chris has been in the lending business for 16 years, and he’s one of the trusted lenders we work with here in the Tulsa area.According to him, what we’re seeing from the market right now can be described as the normal springtime explosion. “Every single week is a new rush of pre-qualifications and contracts,” he says. “Every year it’s exciting, and I’m loving it.”“If you’re a buyer and you’ve been on the fence the past few months, now’s a great time to take advantage of these conditions.”The ups and downs of the real estate business can get crazy, so for Chris, staying positive when things get really busy means sticking to the systems he’s put in place—his scripts, daily phone calls, etc. He knows that letting the day in, day out craziness change his routine can cause everything else to fall apart. Every day, he’s on the phone and lead generating with potential clients and Realtors, and each day has its own theme.“Mondays are my top 40, Tuesdays are my Tuesday update calls, Wednesday I’m following up with anybody who’s pre-qualified to make sure they’re taken care of, and Thursdays and Fridays I’m following up with miscellaneous—builders, leads that haven’t applied yet, and whatnot. Every single day, there’s work to be done.”What are mortgage rates like right now? Chris says that they’re, in a word, awesome. In fact, the 30-year fixed rate is as low as 4.125%. This means if you’re a buyer and you’ve been on the fence the past few months, now’s a great time to take advantage of these conditions. We don’t know what’s going to happen in the future, but we do know that you can lock in a low rate right now. Since so many buyers will be getting into the market, now is also a great time to sell. If you’d like to get pre-qualified and start your home buying journey or you have any mortgage questions for Chris, you can message him at his website ThePadleyTeam.com. If you have any other real estate questions for me, feel free to give me a call.

They’re celebrating their 50-year anniversary this year.The agency works with teenagers and young adults, and they’re the only organization in the area that focuses on these age groups. They offer a full continuum of care to end youth homelessness.Brian sees a lot of runaway and homeless youth end up in their facilities. They offer safe places to stay and hold outreach programs during the day where youth can have their basic needs met.They have 20 beds in their facility and have helped 300 different individuals in their shelter within the last year.“They helped 300 different individuals in their shelter within the last year.”Many come to Youth Services of Tulsa through their safe place program, which is advertised throughout the area. If an adolescent is going through a crisis and needs immediate help, a volunteer can pick them up and bring them to the shelter.A common misconception is that youth become homeless through some fault of their own. The vast majority are simply going through hard times. A third of the homeless youth population, for example, is made up of 18-year-olds who aged out of foster care and don’t know how to make it on their own.You can help support Youth Services of Tulsa through donations or volunteer work. They rely on both in order to operate, and they also need items such as underwear and socks. To see how to donate and learn more about the organization, visit www.YST.org.I’d like to thank Brian for giving us an insightful look at this wonderful organization.

In Tim’s own words, they “have a little bit of everything to offer everybody.”“SMOKE. has existed on Cherry Street for close to eight years, where it has built up its reputation as a preeminent restaurant in Tulsa.”Some of Tim’s personal menu favorites come from their steak selections, but he was excited to share some other novel choices that give SMOKE. its signature feel. Many people don’t realize that, as Tim points out, beyond the meat and potatoes cookery, they offer some great vegan dishes including their vegan cauliflower steak. From the moment you walk into SMOKE., you’ll notice a delightfully smoky smell. This permeates from their Aztec grill from which their chefs cook over an open fire. This really draws out an unmatchable amount of flavor in the food they serve, Tim says. Now, we’re going to take a look around and get to know SMOKE. inside and out as well as check out their recent remodel. You can begin viewing our brief tour at 3:53 in the video.  For more information about SMOKE., you can visit their website at SmokeTulsa.com or go ahead and stop in today to find out all that it has to offer! And for any real estate-related questions you have, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me by phone at 918-706-9845.

I also had the opportunity to pick his brain for his advice to those thinking about doing a kitchen remodel.Right out of high school, Brandon began his trade as a carpenter. From there, he transitioned into finished carpentry, and then to building cabinets in the modern, European-style that Elite Cabinets specializes in today.Since he began his business four years ago, Brandon has been very busy due to the popularity of his cabinets. In that time, he’s noticed that the market in Tulsa has trended toward modern, clean, simple lines. What’s really cool about Elite Cabinets is that Brandon’s products can also blend into more rustic, traditional, or craftsman-style homes, depending on the finishes and wood grain colors.“Think about the layout of the cabinets and how that will interact with the way you use your kitchen in terms of storage and access.”If you’re planning to remodel your kitchen, Brandon has some advice to offer: Keep the finishes of the products in mind so that they tie into the aesthetic of your home, and also think about the layout of the cabinets and how that will interact with the way you use your kitchen in terms of storage and access (e.g., if you’re right-handed or left-handed).To make an appointment with Brandon and to learn more about his excellent products, he can be reached at (918) 794-0757 or you can visit his website at www.EliteCabinetsTulsa.com.For any other questions regarding real estate, you are, as always, encouraged to reach out to me.

        "content": "Based on the market statistics that just came in for December 2018, we’re seeing that compared to December 2017, home sales were down 13%. Speaking truthfully, our team definitely felt that drop; it was slower than what we’ve experienced in recent years.  It’s also useful to note that the number of new homes that came on the market was down 8% to 1,380 homes. Though fewer homes were coming on the market and fewer were selling, homes that were in great condition did sell pretty quickly. Some of you may have noticed that as well.“We fully expect more sellers to place their homes on the market this year, especially as we draw closer to the prime time of the spring market.”In Tulsa, the average sales price was $189,325. Within that price point, our average days on market was 47 days. Now, if your home was listed at a price higher than that, it would have taken a little longer to sell. That’s why it’s so important to work with a professional—they can look at your area market to come up with a detailed pricing strategy appropriate for your home. We monitor whether a market is a buyer’s, seller’s, or balanced market by looking at the absorption rate, otherwise known as our months’ supply of inventory. The market is always in a state of flux between those market types, so we look at where it’s been to help us understand where it’s going. In December 2017, there were 5.49 months of inventory available. As of last month, there were 4.35 month’s worth of homes on the market. We fully expect more sellers to place their homes on the market this year, especially as we draw closer to the prime time of the spring market.These stats are important to have on hand when you’re thinking about real estate, no matter if you’re buying, selling, or both. Whatever the case is, we can help and guide you through the process so that you can make smart decisions regarding when it’s a good time to buy or sell. If you have any questions or need any guidance, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

His father was a structural engineer too, and he’s the one who started FEI. Their company handles all kinds of inspections, but their primary focus is structural inspections. According to Jahan, the biggest home inspection issue he deals with in Tulsa is the foundation and floor slab problems. “Unfortunately, we have uniquely bad soil and uniquely relaxed building standards in Tulsa,” he says.“A great way for sellers to lay a foundation for a successful home sale is to get a pre-inspection done on their house before they list it.”Becoming a certified engineer requires a lot of schooling and a long apprenticeship, so inspectors like Jahan are the main authority on whether a home is safe and secure. Jahan and his father don’t see eye to eye on every single home, but between the two of them, they’ve done about 50,000 inspections. A great way for sellers to lay a foundation for a successful home sale is to get a pre-inspection done on their house before they list it. That way, you won’t have to deal with any unwelcome surprises when the buyer does their own inspection and you give them peace of mind that they’re getting a quality house. If you have any more home inspection questions for Jahan, you can visit www.FEIinspections.com or give their office a call at (918) 865-2593. As always, if you have any questions for me about our Tulsa market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, feel free to reach out to me.

They open at 7 a.m. every weekday and serve breakfast all throughout the day. Once nighttime hits, they switch over to their dinner menu, and on weekends they also serve brunch. Moving forward, they plan to make a few exciting menu changes while retaining their core products.“Moving forward, they plan to make a few exciting menu changes while retaining their core products.”“We always wanted to be a bar with really good food,” Noah says.

Now, Kitchen Concepts has its own design team and in-house construction staff, which work together on kitchen and bathroom remodel, additions, parties, and more. According to Jim, Kitchen Concepts is “all about you.” And as far as price goes, Jim and his team prefer to work within their clients’ budgets. From super high-end products to more modest options, there’s something for every price range.“Jim and his team at Kitchen Concepts are more than happy to work around your schedule, budget, wants, and needs.”In general, though, Jim says a full kitchen remodel will tend to cost between $50,000 and $70,000. That said, Jim is more than willing to find solutions for clients who can’t afford quite that much. Their showroom is conveniently located in the London South Shopping Center at 5936 S Lewis Avenue. Walk-ins are welcome during the week, or you can visit by appointment on Saturdays. Of course, if you aren’t quite sure what you’re looking for, they would be happy to guide you. Not only does the team at Kitchen Concepts stay on top of current trends, but they also like to focus on functionality. Often, this means opening things up to create more space. The bottom line is that Jim and his team at Kitchen Concepts are more than happy to work around your schedule, budget, wants, and needs.

To give us a better idea about what this great restaurant is all about, we decided to meet up with its founders: Piper Kacere and Amy Murray. The idea for Ediblend Superfood Cafe began years ago when Piper and Amy, who are sisters, decided to do a juice cleanse. They got off to a rocky start, but shortly after beginning their second attempt, Piper and Amy began to attract the interest of people around them. Eventually, they started making cleanses for these people and, before they knew it, they started receiving text messages and calls from total strangers who were interested in their product. So they bought up all the mason jars and shower caddies they could find, then started making and packaging cleanses from a playroom in Piper’s home that they had converted into a kitchen.“Though these juice blends are where they got their start, the Ediblend Superfood Cafe has a lot more to offer.”That coming summer, they moved their operation into a test kitchen they had rented out, and, lo and behold, they completely sold out for the season. Their satisfied customers couldn’t stop raving about their experience, so Piper and Amy knew it was time to open a permanent location. Now, since opening in 2014, the Ediblend Superfood Cafe has two locations and a massive fan base here in Tulsa.Looking at their wide range of healthy and delicious blends, like the Sweet Green, 1717, and Sexy Yowza, it’s no wonder why. And though these juice blends are where they got their start, the Ediblend Superfood Cafe has a lot more to offer. When you visit their restaurant, you can also enjoy great salads or one of their customizable açaí bowls. Best of all, everything in the cafe is made fresh every single day. In the future, Amy and Piper are looking forward to expanding their business, and its menu, even wider. If you’re as interested as we are in seeing what’s on the horizon for Ediblend Superfood Cafe, or you’re curious about their hours, locations, or menu, be sure to follow them on Facebook or visit their website: https://ediblend.com/If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "There are five deal-breakers sellers must prepare for and avoid if they want to sell their home quickly and for top dollar:1. Structural problems. Here in Oklahoma, our houses move over time. Depending on how old your home is, you might be able to notice a few settlement cracks here and there. Sometimes these are the normal effects of settling, while other times they can be more serious and may require the installation of a few piers. A single pier costs around $500, so if you see some cracks around your house that look a little more extreme than normal settling, you’ll want to get that checked out. 2. The roof. Is your roof insurable and do you have proper coverage on it? If the buyer’s insurance company isn’t able to insure your roof, many times the only other solution is to replace it. 3. The HVAC system. It’s a good idea to schedule regular maintenance checks for your HVAC system with a local heating and air company. When the appointment is finished, make sure to ask for a receipt or to have a sticker placed on your system. This way, you can prove to buyers that the system has been checked.“Termites aren’t prejudiced—they love all types of wood and all types of houses.”4. Termites. Termites aren’t prejudiced—they love all types of wood and all types of houses. If there’s termite activity in your house, treatment costs anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000. If your home had termite problems in the past, it may have been damaged, so get a visual inspection to see if that’s the case. If past termite damage is apparent and it isn’t fixed, termite inspectors will have to declare that your home needs termite treatment. Wood rot is another item that gets checked during a termite inspection, and if your home has this problem too, you need to get it cleaned up. 5. Low appraisals. This is a prevalent deal-breaker we’re seeing in our market right now. Appraisals are based on the current market, and appraisers have to look back in time at recent sales to make sure your home is priced correctly. There are always ups and downs in the market, though, so even though your appraisal might not be up to date with current trends, you have to go with what the appraiser says. A low appraisal hurts both sellers and buyers because when a buyer’s obtaining a mortgage, they can’t pay more than the price the appraiser sets. We love helping sellers plan their move in advance, so if you’re thinking of selling your home any time soon, give us a call so we can help you get it ready for the market and have buyers wanting to pay full price for it. If you have any other real estate questions or you’re thinking of buying a home in our Tulsa market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us as well. We’d love to help you.",

Of course, another way we love to help all of you is by providing key insight into what’s happening in our market. At this point in the year, real estate tends to slow down a little bit. With school starting up, buyers with families are mostly done shopping for homes by this point. This lull in our market is nothing out of the ordinary, but those looking to sell should be aware that it might take a little longer now than in recent months to find a buyer. Not to worry, though.“It’s not the time to throw in the towel, but it is time to be realistic about how you’re presenting your listing to the market.”After school is back in full swing and labor day is over, market activity will likely pick back up. Seasonal market changes are normal, and there is still plenty of time and opportunity to sell your home before 2019. If your home is already on the market and you’re feeling discouraged by current conditions, though, a price adjustment may be just the thing to jumpstart buyer interest. Buyer activity may be down, but it is not stagnant. There are still people out there looking for homes, and, with the right strategy, your property could be the one they choose. It’s not the time to throw in the towel, but it is time to be realistic about how you’re presenting your listing to the market. If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are curious how we can help you achieve your real estate goals, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

Juniper offers standout entrees such as seared duck, fried chicken curry, and a refreshing seared ahi salad. Of course, Juniper’s menu is always changing. New dishes are released each week to fit the restaurant’s ever-shifting themes, as well as the seasons. It’s no wonder why Juniper’s growth comes from its kitchen, where head chef Neil Trumpy works his culinary magic. “Whether you’re in the mood for a savory meal or a sweet, tasty drink, you can find what you’re craving at Juniper.”Chef Trumpy received his education from the Oregon Culinary Institute, where he developed a skill set based around sustainability and the use of local ingredients. As you’ll see in today’s episode, watching him work is an amazing sight to behold. But delectable dishes aren’t the only thing there is to enjoy at Juniper. Diners can also enjoy any of the many refreshing signature cocktails they offer. So whether you’re in the mood for a savory meal or a sweet, tasty drink, you can find what you’re craving at Juniper. Dining at Juniper is an amazing experience, so be sure to come check it out yourself. Juniper (located at 324 East 3rd Street in downtown Tulsa)  is open for lunch Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., and for dinner from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Monday through Saturday. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "We all know that it’s important for a homebuyer to use a licensed real estate agent when buying a home. But do you know why? Today I will share three of the top reasons. 1. We have the inventory. As real estate professionals, we have access to the multiple listing service (MLS), which is a database for Realtors. Of course, there are other websites out there that list houses for sale, but we all know that the MLS is the most up-to-date database for listings. Buyers who look for homes on other websites will only to be disappointed to find out they’re not available.And, if we do not have the inventory, we have the tools and technologies and databases to help find you a home that fits all of your needs.“When a seller lists their home on the market, they have already agreed to pay the buyer agent’s compensation.”2. We have the negotiation skills. As a homebuyer, you may be hesitant to speak your mind on certain points, for fear of offending the seller.With an agent on your side, you will get the best deal and terms, you will know what is normal, and you will know what to expect. We will keep you up to date on timelines to make sure that you do not miss out on an opportunity for inspections or appraisals.3. A buyer agent is free. When a seller lists their home on the market, they have already agreed to pay the buyer agent’s compensation. There is no reason for you to do all of the work when you can use us. We can help you negotiate your best terms, hold the deal together to get you to closing on time, and provide you with all of our years of experience for free!If you have any additional questions or are interested in buying, please feel free to call me.

According to Eileen, about one in every four children goes to bed hungry at night. And, as we can all agree, this is unacceptable. “It’s part of our job just to make sure [these children] get what they need,” says Eileen.It was truly amazing to get a behind-the-scenes look at operations here at the Community Food Bank. Especially because at the time of my visit, they were preparing for “Summer Feeding.” The Summer Feeding program is one way that they are able to continue providing for kids who rely on school meals at other times of the year. On day one of this program, they fed an estimated 1,100 children.“Approximately one in every four children goes to bed hungry at night, so the work the Community Food Bank is doing is critical.”The workers at the Food Bank are also delegating more resources to their partner programs, as they know that their lines grow longer in the summer months, as well. So, with as much as this organization does for our community, how can we give back and help them make a difference? Well, for every dollar donated, the Food Bank is able to produce four meals. Obviously, financial gifts are always welcomed. Of course, volunteering your time and donating food are also great ways to help.So, if you want to get in touch with Eileen, you can give her a call at (918) 585-2800, or visit www.okfoodbank.org. ",

Beyond that, raised beds also keep animals from getting to your garden. They also allow you to plant earlier, since the loose soil you fill the bed with will be warmer than the ground itself.“The decision as to whether a raised bed is right for you depends on your preferences and circumstances.”Now, let’s take a look at some of the downsides. First, they’re pricey. You’re going to have to invest in the bed, the materials, soil, and fertilizer to get started. Raised beds also aren’t as sustainable as simply planting your garden in the ground.Ultimately, the decision as to whether a raised bed is right for you depends on your preferences and circumstances. And if you’re unsure, my friends over at Grogg’s Green Barn can help you decide what gardening solutions may work best for you.As always, if you have any other questions for me or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Today I’m coming to you live from the downtown office of Emergency Infant Services (EIS) here in Tulsa to tell you a little bit about this great organization and what they do for our community. Joining me is EIS Executive Director Bill Andoe. For the last 40 years, the mission of EIS has been to serve families who are experiencing financial hardship and have children under the age of five. They provide clothing, diapers, groceries, formula, and other essential needs these families have. All these families have to do is meet with an EIS interviewer to assess their needs so they can determine which services they can provide and which community services might be available to them—even if their children are over five. Aside from their downtown location, they also have a location on the east side of Tulsa and two satellite locations on the north and south sides of town. Right now they’re in the middle of a capital campaign, so a year from this summer, they’ll be moving to 11th and Denver. This move will help them provide more resources for families, centralize their warehouse, and stockpile more supplies.“Anyone is welcome at EIS.”One thing in particular I love to share about EIS is anyone is welcome there. They provide their services with love and without judgement—it’s one of their founding principles. According to Bill, they average about 18,000 visits per year, and they expect that number to reach 20,000 in the near future. To help carry the loan, they have church groups, school groups, and a number of other regular volunteers who help them on a weekly basis. “We’re in this because we want to help,” Bill says. “That’s what attracts employees and volunteers to EIS. We often talk about the people who come in—we talk about professionally mentioning them statistically as clients, but they’re really more than just clients. They’re members of our community. They go to our churches. We see them at public events. They’re Tulsans just like us. We’re here to help them.”EIS relies on the generosity of donors and the Tulsa community at large, so if you’d like to help them in their mission, they always welcome financial donations. They also accept diapers, wipes, car seats, strollers, and anything else a family with a young child might need. If you’d like to get in touch with EIS or you’d like more information on how to donate, you can visit their website at www.EISTulsa.org. As always, if you have any questions for me or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "Decluttering is so important in getting your home ready to sell as well as just cleaning up for spring. Whatever your motivation, thinning out your home is a great way to feel good. Today let’s go through the seven steps it takes to declutter your home.1. Make sure the front of your home is welcoming and encourages buyers to come inside. First impressions are everything. Buyers are probably going to find your home online first, and then they might even drive around the neighborhood to check it out. You’ll want to clear out any dead leaves and put some fresh mulch down. Be sure that there are no mud daubers or bird’s nests in your eaves. Pretend you’re a buyer and walk up to your front porch. What would you think? 2. Take it one room at a time. Decluttering can be really overwhelming, so just start small. Thin out the things in your room and closet; think about what your room would look like in a photograph. What isn’t needed? Pictures will amplify those extra things on countertops and other areas. 3. Decide what furniture you really need in the home. To make your property look like a model home, get rid of extra furniture and end tables.4. Clean off countertops. These are common places for us to pile things up, but kitchens are very important rooms to make a good impression with. Put your toaster, blender, and other similar appliances away in a cabinet, and clear away other extraneous papers and tidbits.“Think about what your room would look like in a photograph. What isn’t needed?”5. Clean your shower. When we come to preview your home, we’re going to pull back the shower curtain. Be sure the grout is clean and that tiles or paint aren’t peeling. Your shower will tell buyers a lot about how you take care of your home.6. Take away your collectibles. It’s great that you care about and collect things that are dear to your heart, but that can become a distraction to buyers. Go ahead and box it up and put it away.7. Declutter the garage and storage sheds. If there are things in there that you need to keep on hand, put them in boxes or storage bins that are neat and organized.All these things sound crazy, however, they make a lot of difference. A decluttered home will help you get the most money for your home in the shortest amount of time.If you need any help with decluttering your home or have other questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

Today, I’m talking to Maryann Donahue from Global Gardens.Global Gardens was created by a teacher from Tulsa named Heather Oakley [spelling?] in 2007. Heather had a background in urban science education and peace education. She also had a bachelors degree in botany. She combined all of those things to create Global Gardens.The purpose of Global Gardens is to help fight the cycle of poverty and empower kids from high-poverty communities to be agents of change in their own lives and in their communities.When Heather came back to Tulsa in 2007, she started the first program at Eugene Field. She offered during and after-school programs. At that time, there was an empty lot next to Eugene Field that was bare, empty, and forgotten. She and that first group of students turned it into a beautiful, bountiful garden, and that’s what Global Gardens has done ever since.Since then, Global Gardens has added three more sites in addition to Eugene Field, including the one Maryann and I are filming from today. This field services Union Middle School and Union High School. There are two other elementary schools in the program as well: Rosa Parks Elementary and McAuliffe Elementary in East Tulsa.“THE PURPOSE OF GLOBAL GARDENS IS TO HELP FIGHT THE CYCLE OF POVERTY AND EMPOWER KIDS.”“We serve over 1,800 kids every week in this program,” says Maryann. “We’re helping about 2,500 people a year.”Global Gardens uses gardening as a vehicle for empowerment. They also use gardening to teach science and how to be peaceful. “In the during-school program, they have a class garden. They get to decide what to plant, and they have a harvest party at the end of the year,” says Maryann. “They do all of that together. It’s very intentional.”These programs teach science that addresses state science standards while also teaching teamwork. The students don’t have many opportunities outside of Global Gardens to do hands-on, real-world things and have to do them as a team.We really believe that Global Gardens is doing a great thing. How can you help? Go to Global-Gardens.org to make an online donation. All of their funding is raised from community donations; they don’t have state contracts or charge fees.Maryann says that Global Gardens hopes to add a fifth site at Jackson Elementary School in North Tulsa by 2019. This has been in the works for a while, so please consider helping them reach their goal.I would like to thank Maryann for taking the time to talk to me today. You can learn more details about Global Gardens at Global-Gardens.org.If you have any real estate questions or know another local nonprofit you think we should spotlight, give me a call or send me an email.

Click here to browse Tulsa homes for saleToday, I want to talk about an incredible home cleaning business here in our town: Cleansing Rain.When I asked how she got the idea to begin her business, owner Lacie Partney told me she wasn’t always such a neat and organized person.According to Lacie, it all began when she returned to Tulsa after two years on the mission field. At that point in time, she was searching for something to do.Since then, she’s found cleaning homes to be very fulfilling. She says it really helps her build relationships. On top of that, Lacie herself makes all of the natural cleaning products she uses.“FROM YOUR ATTIC TO YOUR JUNK DRAWER, LACIE IS HAPPY TO HELP ANYONE DECLUTTER.”This is just one of the things that help her stand out from other cleaning companies in town. She also loves to help people get more organized. From your attic to your junk drawer, Lacie is happy to help anyone declutter.But, it doesn’t stop there. Once she helps her clients declutter their spaces, Lacie also helps them develop an organizational system that can be implemented into their specific lifestyle.One thing Lacie highly recommends is to make use of vertical space. Instead of buying new furniture that takes up floor space, she suggests that people try to utilize their walls for storage, instead.To learn more about Lacie and her business, you can visit her website at www.CleansingRain918.com.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "John Carter from John Carter Bathrooms is here today to answer a few questions about his business and some of the latest trends in bathroom remodels.Looking to sell your Tulsa area home? Get a free home value reportLooking to buy a Tulsa area home? Click here to browse Tulsa homes for saleToday, I’m here with John Carter from John Carter Bathrooms. John has graciously agreed to answer some questions about his business.How did you get into this business?It started way back. I’m from Namibia and my father did remodeling. He taught me everything I know. I learned everything from scratch and got to love remodeling, which made me decide to make it a business.I moved to the United States a couple of years ago and got a job like everybody else. Then I realized that I wouldn’t be able to work on my dreams, so I decided to start a remodeling business. I can do kitchens, bathrooms, and even build homes, but I wanted to focus on something special, so I learned how to specialize in bathrooms.I love your story and that you are doing something you are passionate about, which is important to me as well. What makes you stand out from the competition?There are a couple of things that make us different. First, we complete all projects on time and on budget. It is a top priority for us to work around your schedule and your finances. Second, all of our projects are designed to fit your size and your style. We don’t ask you to cut corners on the perfect remodel. Finally, we are the most available and we provide daily progress reports on what’s done, so you’re never left wondering what we did all day.“YOU WILL GET DAILY PROGRESS REPORTS SO YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH WORK HAS BEEN DONE.”What’s a new style or trend that you have noticed lately?In kitchens, soapstone has been popular lately. We’ve been using it in bathrooms for a little bit. People do want to use quartz for their surfaces these days. There are a lot of new materials out there. People like wooden countertops as well.For bathrooms, people stick to light, neutral colors. Those will last a long time. Back in the 80s, people made pink, green, and purple bathrooms. That doesn’t work. My job is to come into somebody’s home and put something in there with tile that will last. Technology has improved with tile and cement, so we can build up bathrooms that are mold-free and 100% waterproof, which is great.How can someone get in touch with you about a remodel or to ask any questions?My phone number is 918-574-4610 or look at my website, JohnCarterBathrooms.com. You can enter your information and get a free 3-D model of what your bathroom could look like at no cost to you.Thank you to John for answering my questions. As always, if you have any real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

The designers went to school to learn the skill and have spent their entire career honing the craft. They love what they do, and they’re very good at it.When somebody walks through the door with a need, what does the process of helping them look like?It could be anything from one of the designers helping the client navigate the store to identify their wants and needs to schedule a house call where someone isn’t quite sure what they’re looking for or they have a larger project they don’t know how to start.“THE HELP OF A DESIGNER CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE.”Our designers make complimentary house calls out to your home. They’ll do all the measuring, look at your paint colors, work with what pieces you already have, give guidance on space planning, give direction for new pieces, and more. It could be something as simple as window treatments, but whatever it is, the help of a designer can make all the difference.We do a lot in stages. It may just be planning for the big picture—doing a few changes now and a little bit more down the road to ultimately get the look that you want.What are you seeing in terms of design trends?Clean lines are still key here in Tulsa. It’s becoming a transitional market, but neutrals are still very popular, and a lot of the taupes of years past are coming back. Adding in a little bit of fun with texture or a pop of color is a good way to brighten up your space.How can people get in touch with you?You can find us in our showroom at 9922 Riverside Parkway in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in the King’s Landing Shopping Center.

Get a free home value reportLooking to buy a Tulsa area home? Click here to browse Tulsa homes for saleToday I’m excited to be joined by special guest Carey Baker. I had the opportunity to ask Carey some questions about her involvement with The Parent Child Center of Tulsa. Her and her husband, Brett Baker, are Co-chairs for Toyland Ball 2018.The Toyland Ball, held every January, is The Parent Child Center of Tulsa’s annual signature fundraising event. This black tie gala featuring a whimsical theme offers an elegant evening of dinner and dancing, with a live auction.I caught up with Carey at the Toyland Ball Stock the Bar Party where attendees bring a bottle of wine valued at $50 or more to be auctioned off at the Toyland Ball 2018 in January. In past years, the wine auctioned off at the event in January has raised between $8,000 and $10,000 for The Parent Child Center of Tulsa. That is just the money raised from auctioning the wine. There are other items that are auctioned off that raise even more money for the cause.For those of you who may not know, the mission of The Parent Child Center of Tulsa is to prevent child abuse and neglect through education, treatment, and advocacy. People who have been victims of abuse or neglect are given education and counseling so that they are able to end the cycle. Many people only know what they’ve been taught, so The Parent Child Center of Tulsa aims to reverse this.If you’re interested in attending, the Toyland Ball auction will take place on January 20th, 2018 at the Cox Business Center. For tickets, visit www.ParentChildCenter.org. You can also become a patron sponsor by donating $1,000 for two people.At the event, there will be raffles, an auction, and a live band. Also, all of the proceeds go directly to the counseling funds for The Parent Child Center of Tulsa.We hope you have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "When you encounter an offer that is lower than asking price, it’s common to negotiate.Do not take the low offer personally.Looking to sell your Tulsa area home? Get a free home value reportLooking to buy a Tulsa area home? Click here to browse Tulsa homes for saleToday, I’m going to give my two cents on a topic that keeps coming up in our business. I know if you’ve watched my videos in the past, I say the same things over and over again. That just because we sell lots and lots of houses and we get to help lots and lots of people. We have a lot of experience with this.I am still primarily the listing agent for our team, so I mostly work with sellers. I receive offers from agents that are working with buyers, and so many times these offers come in lower than the listing price, and sometimes with other concessions built in, such as closing costs and warranties.I will admit that sometimes, I’m a little shocked at some of the offers we get.Then I remember that in a buyer’s mind, they are doing the best that they can for their family. Of course they want to make a lower offer, because they feel like it’s their job to negotiate.Well, as an agent, that’s also part of our job: to best prepare our clients and to explain the market to them.When we receive these lower offers or offers that have different contingencies built in, it’s our job to settle the client (the seller) and explain to them that these are expected—low offers like these are the norm.“I WILL ADMIT THAT SOMETIMES, I’M A LITTLE SHOCKED AT SOME OF THE OFFERS WE GET.”I’ll admit it: I forget that you guys don’t do this every day like I do. I do need to slow down and understand where you’re coming from, because as a seller, you are working to get your best deal and to put the most money in your pocket. That is my goal for you, too.However, I do know that I’m studying the market all the time and monitoring the average list-to-sales price of the MLS, how we can put the most money in your pocket and at the same time, get your home sold.An offer early on may be a little lower than you were planning on, and yet, if it doesn’t sell, how much longer will you have it?Remember that the process of selling is a negotiation. Please do not ever reject an offer; you have to do a little bit of negotiating to show that you want to sell your house. The buyer is working to get their best number, and you’re working to get your best number, so sometimes you have to get together in the middle somewhere.That’s our goal: to get you the most money, and for the buyers to get the best deal. At the same time, we have to work together to achieve your real estate dreams.Let me know if this was helpful to you, and if you have any questions, give me call! I’d love to speak with you.",

Typically during this time of year, our market experiences a slight downturn before encountering another uptick in early fall. This is a seasonal trend that happens every year—the real estate market always works in cycles, after all.We don’t know what’s going to happen beyond this cycle, but I do know there are buyers and sellers in the market all the time looking to make a move. I also know from years of experience that it’s always about price.This means if you’re a seller, it’s still an ideal time to sell—you just have to price your home correctly. This will give you your best chance at attracting a buyer early on, getting the most money in your pocket, and moving onto where you want to go. Pricing right from the start is everything, and we call this “pricing ahead of the market.” When we get together and examine the numbers, we analyze what’s happened with sales in the recent past and what’s happening currently with your competition.“REAL ESTATE IS A CONTEST—ARE YOU GOING TO WIN?”Real estate is a contest—are you going to win?

I know that some people might have a little fear about that word, but we are always seeing shifts in this market throughout the year.

You’ve heard me talk about home sales above $200,000 slowing down. Homes in the $100,000 to $200,000 price range which have been selling within days over the last few months have also seen a slowdown in sales as well.We have put great homes on the market in the last month in the $150,000 to $185,000 price range that I thought for sure would be easy sellers, and they haven’t sold as quickly as we thought.If you’re a consumer, just know that the market is always changing. You should always pay attention to what’s happening locally, and pay less attention to what’s happening on a national scale. There are other markets in different parts of the country that aren’t seeing the same type of shift that we’re seeing locally.“BASED ON THE LAST FEW MONTHS, WE’RE SEEING A BIT OF A CHANGE IN THE MARKET.”Here at the Wolek Group, we make sure to pay attention to those local trends and statistics.

        "content": "The moving and real estate industries have a lot in common. I recently spoke with Julie Woolslayer about some tips and tricks of the moving process.Looking to sell your Tulsa area home? Get a free home value reportLooking to buy a Tulsa area home? Click here to browse Tulsa homes for saleI was recently joined by Julie Woolslayer of Great Day Moving, who you may remember from past conversations we’ve had.She and her husband have a great business that I’ve used personally and also that I’ve referred to multiple clients.The moving industry is very much related to the business of real estate, so I wanted to give Julie the chance to present some tips and tricks for moving.First of all, Julie recommends that you should always start early in the process. If you think you’re moving, decluttering will help you for a number of reasons. Not only does it prepare a home for showing but it also makes it easier on you when it comes time to move your belongings.Get as much help as you can from friends and family members when you undertake the task of organizing and decluttering your home. One tip that Julie recommended on the matter was to read the book “It’s All Too Much” by Peter Walsh. It’s full of great tips on how to organize and get rid of items in your home.You may even want to enlist the help of professional organizers. The bottom line is that there is a lot of help available—you just need to get motivated and get started.“THERE IS A LOT OF HELP AVAILABLE—YOU JUST NEED TO GET MOTIVATED AND GET STARTED.”This process is especially helpful for sellers who are downsizing. Julie and her team are more than happy to talk to people undergoing the downsizing process in order to assess what kind of help will be most useful to them. She also mentioned Settled In—a company she’s worked with in the past that helps clients decide what to take and what to leave in a move.Julie also has a plan for people who are unable to move into their new home right away but need to move their items out of their old home.In situations like these, Great Day Moving partners with another Tulsa business: Premier Logistics. Premier Logistics has trucks and trailers available for rent, which Great Day Moving then loads and stores at their 24-hour secured lot for as long as the seller might need.Then, once it is time to move, Great Day Moving brings the truck on site to the new home and unloads it as they would during any other moving process.Overall, Julie works hard to offer moving solutions. In fact, if you call and tell our scheduler Kelsey that you saw this video, you can save $75 off on any move over two hours.If you’d like to reach out to Julie you can contact her by calling (918) 877-1971 or by visiting GreatDayMoving.com.If I can answer any other questions or you’d like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Get a free home value reportLooking to buy a Tulsa area home? Click here to browse Tulsa homes for saleIf you’re a homeowner and you haven’t already, you need to download our Homekeepr app. It’s got so many different uses, but I wanted to highlight some of its best features today.One is maintenance reminders for your home. Whether you need to have your furnace filter changed or it’s time to clean out your gutters, this app will remind you at regular intervals to do those things. There are so many things that we can forget to do around the house, but this app stays on top of things for you.Another awesome feature is our directory. Within it, you’ll find all of our preferred service providers. These are people we have vetted, people we have worked with, and people we trust to give you fair prices and great customer service. All of their contact information is located right here within the app.“OUR DIRECTORY IS FULL OF REPUTABLE, VETTED SERVICE PROVIDERS.”Finally, it can be stressful trying to keep or remember where you put certain receipts, manuals, and home improvement plans. If your phone has a camera, you can just take a picture of these documents and save them right in the app. You can then access the documents from any device or desktop.If you’re a small business owner or service provider who’s interested in being one of our partners, give us a call or send us an email today.If you have any other questions for us or you’re looking to buy or sell in Tulsa anytime soon, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.",
