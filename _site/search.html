        "content": "There are a lot of real estate agents out there, but that doesnât mean theyâre all able to serve your needs effectively. In fact, there are some key differences that set the best agents apart from the rest.The average real estate agent with the Salt Lake Board of Realtors only sells four homes per year. 50% of agents sold no homes in 2018. Itâs very important to make sure the agent you choose isnât one of these low producers.âTo find out how good of an agent they are, you need to look at their track record.âTo find out how good of an agent they are, you need to look at their track record. Donât just focus on years of experienceâyou need to know how many homes they sell in a year. Here are a few questions you can ask in order to gain a better understanding:1. âHow many homes did you sell last year?â This shows how productive and experienced they are.2. âWhat is your list-to-sale price ratio?â For example, if they list a $300,000 home and sell it for $300,000, they have a 100% list-to-sale price ratio. However, the average agent only has a 95% ratio, so itâs important to know your agentâs ratio. Mine, for example, is 99.3%.3. âDo you work alone or with a team?â If theyâre a solo agent, they have to manage everything on their own. Thereâs so much to keep track of, so itâs much better to have an entire real estate team at your service. However, you may not want to work with a very large team that may not give you personalized service.If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "At the beginning of this year, economists predicted that, along the Wasatch Front, we were going to see a very flat or even a declining market. Interest rates were predicted to go up a couple times this year, as well.Well, those predictions have been called off. In fact, in February, when interest rates were expected to go up, they actually came down. Due to our economy, interest rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage are currently at 4.25%, which is quite a drop from the 4.75% to 5% range they were in.Not only can owner-occupied buyers afford more, but investors can also buy now. Doing so makes better sense financially, even with the home prices going up as they are.That spurred the market onânot only are we seeing far more competitive offers in the market, but weâre also seeing properties in the lower price points sell above list price! Overall, the market for homes under $500,000 has been seeing a lot of traffic.âIf youâre thinking of selling a home, I encourage you to act before June, just in case the market does flatten out.âAbove the $500,000 price point, homes that are properly marketed, fairly priced, and that are in great condition are selling as well.Right now, inventory along the Wasatch Front is again going down, reaching an all-time low in all price ranges. There are currently 1.5 months of supply, meaning that if no other homes came on the market today, it would take 1.5 months to sell all the homes currently available.Given that an inventory of four to five months is a balanced market and an inventory of six months or more constitutes a buyerâs market, we can clearly see that this is a fantastic sellerâs market.In the spring of 2018, we noticed these trends occurring, as well. We were in a great sellerâs market until June came along, when things flattened out. We can reasonably expect something similar to happen again in 2019, but who really knows what the future will bring?If youâre thinking of selling a home, I encourage you to act before that time, just in case the market does flatten out. For specific questions related to your property, feel free to reach out to me. Iâd love to help.",

        "content": "Today weâre excited to talk about a brand-new loan program that allows buyers to use the rent on an investment property to help them qualify for more home.âThis program lets you buy and invest at the same time.âUtah Housing has been around for a long time. They have a ton of different loan programs, from the traditional 20% down mortgage loans to zero-down loan programs. Recently, theyâve introduced a new program that allows buyers to purchase different kinds of properties, such as a duplex or a home with a mother-in-law apartment, and use the projected rent from those accessory dwellings to add into their income in order to purchase more real estate.This is a great opportunity for a buyer to buy a new home while also getting a great asset. If you or someone you know is interested in this brand-new program, donât hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Now that 2018 is in the books, what should buyers and sellers know about this past yearâs market? What do the market trends from 2018 tell us about 2019?The final numbers arenât out yet, but we estimate that homes appreciated by 8% over the course of the entire year. Most of that increase happened during the first half of the year; after that, prices generally flattened out.Interest rates started the year at 4%, but now theyâre around 4.75%, and we expect them to continue to rise in 2019. Of course, the higher interest rates rise, the more expensive homes become for buyers. For example, getting a $300,000 mortgage would cost $133 per month more at todayâs rate than it would have a year ago.âAs inventory levels have risen, homes have stayed on the market longer.âBuilding costs are extremely high right now, but thatâs not stopping builders from building and buyers from buying. There are some fabulous communities being built right now along the Wasatch Front, so make sure you contact a knowledgeable local agent before you walk into any of these properties so you know what youâre getting into and you get the best deal possible.Nationwide, weâve seen a general market slowdown. As interest rates have risen, inventory has increased as well. In many places, inventory is at a five-year high. Here in Utah, weâre starting to see this same trend. As inventory levels have risen, homes have stayed on the market longer. This is good news for buyers, who now have more homes to pick from.Weâre looking forward to a fantastic 2019, so if you have any other questions about our market or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home soon, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "category": "",
        "content": "There are new and not very well known opportunities in the market called Opportunity Zones.They were created by Congress last year and put into place beginning this year. There are certain census tracts in every state in the U.S.â46 in Utah, in factâthat are lower income areas in need of redevelopment. Opportunity Zones allow for states to nominate the areas as they would like to see increased investing in real estate.When you invest in these Opportunity Zones, you are allowed to defer, reduce, or eliminate your capital gains entirely. This includes single-family homes and commercial real estate. If you hold the property for five to seven years, youâll get a 10% reduction on your federal capital gains; for seven to 10 years, youâll get a 15% reduction; and if you hold it longer than 10 years, youâll pay no capital gains tax on the gains of this property.As I mentioned, there are 46 Opportunity Zones here in Utah right now, including 15 in Salt Lake County, three in Davis County, and five in Weber County.âWhen you invest in these Opportunity Zones, you are allowed to defer, reduce, or eliminate entirely your capital gains.âHereâs how it works: Imagine that you have enough savings to allow you to invest in real estate; maybe youâll end up selling another investment property of yours specifically so that you can invest in this Opportunity Zone. If thereâs a capital gain from that previous sale, you can defer those gains, reinvest into this property, and then look to pay zero capital gains later on.The big key is that you have to hold it for 10 years or more to be able to eliminate these capital gains altogether. Hypothetically, if you were to normally pay 25% in federal capital gains tax, eliminating the capital gains would allow you to have a 25% gain compared to investing in areas outside of an Opportunity Zone.If you or someone you know is interested in investing in an Opportunity Zone, Iâve created automated emails that alert me and my clients about opportunities in these areas. Simply reach out to me and let me know in which areas youâre interested in searching.Mind you, Iâm a licensed real estate agent, NOT an accountant or a financial planner, so it is very important to consult those people on your team as you look at these opportunities.I hope to hear from you soon!",

        "content": "Iâm Doug Cary, Real Estate Agent with Century 21 Everest. Iâm going to tell you how to get rid of mortgage insurance.If youâve bought a home and put less than a 20% down payment down, youâre familiar with mortgage insurance. Â Itâs that added amount on your statement every month you wish you could get rid of. The good news is you might be able to. Â Homes with less than 20% equity in it are more risky for lenders and the lender requires that you pay for insurance. This goes to another company that will pay back the lender if you were to foreclose on the home.If you get a conventional loan, your lender will set up what is called Private mortgage insurance (PMI) and the rates vary by down payment and credit score but are generally cheaper than FHA rates for borrowers with good credit. Private mortgage insurance is typically paid monthly with your principal and interest payment. Once you hit 20% equity in your home you can request an appraisal from your mortgage company and drop this payment altogether. This will naturally drop off when youâve made enough payments and it getâs to 78% loan-to-value.âOnce you have at least 20% equity on the property, you can also request that your lender drop that mortgage insurance altogether.âIf you get an FHA loan now the mortgage insurance cost is the same no matter your credit score and you are not allowed to drop the mortgage insurance premium when you hit 20% equity. You will either stick with it or refinance to a conventional loan. It wasnât always this way. If you got your FHA loan before June 2, 2013, you can drop it at 20% just like a conventional loan.VA loans have the VA guarantee which replaces mortgage insurance and works the same. There is an up-front funding fee that varies based on many things that your lender can go over with you. Sometimes this is all paid up front and sometimes itâs calculated into the monthly payment.Many people are in a much stronger equity position today with prices having increased so much over the last few years. You might be surprised to find out that you could drop your mortgage insurance and save all that money every month.Iâm offering a free mortgage insurance review to see if you should request from your lender to drop mortgage insurance from your payment. Just call me and have your monthly mortgage statement available.Iâm here to help you with anything regarding real estate. Forward this to others making real estate decisions so they can be the best informed. Thanks for watching, Iâm Doug Cary, your Utah Real Estate agent.",

In Utah, we are already seeing our inventory increase.

If youâre happy in your home, absolutely nothing.However, if you are thinking about selling, now is absolutely the best time to do so.âThe fact that we saw a 15% increase in the number of homes on the market in just 45 days is pretty significant.âFor those of you thinking about buying, it is also a great time for you because there are more homes on the market to look at.If you think that waiting for the price to increase again is a good idea, you are taking a pretty big gamble.

Things are going to start changing quickly and we are going to start seeing some deals just around the corner.The reality is that our economy here is strong. Our unemployment rate is only 3.3%, and we are ranked No. 1 in job growth in the nation. But, homes are 15% less affordable than they were this time last year and wages havenât increased.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Are you worried about not being able to pay your childâs college tuition one day? If so, today weâll discuss one way you can pay for it using real estate.The average college tuition is $100,000 for a four-year degree. Itâs estimated that in 15 years, this number will rise to over $207,000.Further to that, studies show that the average college graduate earns 89% more than a worker with only a high school diploma. Each year of school adds 5% to 15% on their annual earnings later in life.âItâs estimated that in 15 years, cost of college tuition will rise to over $207,000.âWith this information in mind, there are four ways people typically pay for college:1. Parents pay for it with their regular income. Parents are taxed on their income, so the average degree will end up costing more like $130,000.2. The student works through college to pay for it. This typically extends how long the student is in college and increases the likelihood of them dropping out.3. Student loans. Students today are burdened with incredible amounts of debt.4. Owning assets. Through the passive income of owning such assets as real estate, the parent can pay for college in part or in full.This last method is what I want to discuss in more detail.Imagine that your child will go to college in 15 years. Suppose also that you bought a rental property for $200,000, with a 20% down payment of $40,000. With the typical mortgage today, youâll probably be making some cash flow, but suppose you put all of that back into the house for those 15 years. By that time, the house will have been completely paid for.At that 15-year mark, that house could be worth $300,000 to $400,000. This asset would more than allow you to pay for your childâs education.There are many ways in which we can work to make this happen for our clients. I know some people who will buy one property for each child, knowing that they will easily pay for tuition.If this is of interest to you as a parent or grandparent, or if you know of someone who would benefit from this information, please reach out to me anytime. I would be glad to walk you through these concepts in greater detail and give you advice about how real estate investing can improve your or your childâs life.",

Itâs in a green and white envelope, and it shows you what the county thinks your property is worth and how much they will tax you based on that.In Utah, every county assesses properties differently. They will come up with a valuation based on previous sales from the prior year. They do this in lump sums, and they know that with this method they wonât get it perfect. Their goal is to undervalue a property, but 15% to 20% of the time, they will overvalue it instead.If your taxes are too high, you can petition the county to bring them down. A commonly perpetuated myth says that the value they assess your property for is how much itâs actually worth.âIf you feel your taxes are too high, you can petition the county to bring them down.âThatâs not true at all. Iâve never seen a buyer willing to pay more or less on a home because of how a home is taxed. The most important thing is getting your assessed value as low as possible so you donât have to pay as much in taxes.Our assessors know that theyâre not perfect and never will claim to be. However, they have given us a way to appeal our property taxes if you believe your property is overvalued.The first thing they say to do is contact a Realtor, like myself, who is willing to help. Iâd be happy to do a market analysis on your property to determine what itâs actually worth. Iâll write up the letter, youâll submit it to the county assessorâs office, and thatâs it.

Homes over that price are taking a bit longer on average, but it all depends on the area, the age of the home, and its condition.For the past three years, weâve had an inventory shortage in all price ranges. Builders are building as fast as they can right now, but they just arenât able to keep up with the demand out there.

These tips have been proven to attract multiple offers, so allow me to share them with you today.First, take your time getting your home ready for the market. Donât be in a rush to list your homeâmake sure everything about it that needs to be touched up is touched up before photos are taken and before any buyers walk into the house.Second, let your neighbors know about your impending home sale. For every person who hires me to sell their home, I am out door-knocking and calling over 100 people on their behalf. We have found that over 10% of homes sell primarily because of a neighborhood referral.âWhen I hear someone say that they sold their house in under an hour, what that really means is they could have gotten more for it.âThere are thousands of homes for sale along the Wasatch Front, so do not assume that all real estate agents will see your home. Call or email the top 50 real estate agents in your area and notify them that you are putting your home on the market. If you sit back and assume they will see your listing, you will miss out on getting top dollar for it.Lastly, do not just accept the first offer. This is a mistake I see a lot of people making right now. Selling your home is a numbers game. When I hear someone say that they sold their house in under an hour, what that really means is they could have gotten more for it. I market all my sellersâ homes for at least four or five days once they are listed before I start reviewing offers. You want to make sure 100% of the buying pool gets to see your home. That is how you can get as many as three, five, or even 18 offers for your home.If you have any more questions about how to generate multiple offers for your home sale or you have any other real estate needs, please feel free to reach out to me.

        "content": "What happens if you cannot find another home after you sell your current one?It seems like every week I sit down with a family that asks me this same question. Here are a few ways you can successfully buy and sell a home at the same time.First, you can buy your next home without selling your current one. This option does not apply to everyone, but you could refinance your current home or pull out an equity line on it in order to buy your next home. A family member could also provide a short-term loan, which would make your home sale more comfortable and put you in a better position to buy your next home.âYouâll find a houseâall my clients have.âSecond, you could negotiate a rent-back agreement with your homeâs buyer that will allow you to stay in your home for a short period after it is sold. This will give you time to find a new one. You will have the normal 30-day escrow period and another 30 to 45 days after the home is sold to find and close on your next house.If you are upgrading from a red-hot price range to one that is not as hot, you can make an offer thatâs contingent on your home selling. I just did this for a couple clients of mine. They were selling their home for $300,000 and moving up to a higher price range. During this process, we were able to get the seller to accept their offer before they listed their original home. Once they did, they got 18 offers for it.Lastly, you could have another place set aside to live in between selling and buying, like a short-term rental or a family memberâs basement. This is an option a lot of people prefer to avoid.My recommendation is to go on faith. You will find a houseâall my clients have. On that note, stay tuned for my next video where Iâll talk about how we find homes that arenât on the market that our clients get the first look at.In the meantime, if you have any other questions about how to buy and sell at the same time or you have any other real estate needs, please reach out to me.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today, I want to talk about the top myths of real estate in a hot sellerâs market.1. All agents are the same. Some of you may have seen me discussing this myth on âGood Things Utahâ. Imagine that you had $500,000 to invest in the stock market. Would you go and hire a stockbroker just because you knew them, or would you get out there, investigate, and find the absolute best stockbroker who will protect and increase your money?Hiring a real estate is just like that. You need to hire the best real estate agent. On average, I get 3% to 4% more on the sale of a home than most other real estate agents, and there are a lot of great agents out there that youâll want to interview.2. I can list my home as For Sale By Owner and get the same results as an agent in this market. I donât doubt that you can sell your home on your own in this sellerâs market. However, we often see a For Sale By Owner property sell for less than a property in the same neighborhood thatâs represented by an agent. Real estate agents are better able to capitalize on your homeâs exposure to buyers. In this market, weâre also seeing a lot of homes sell above list price and above the appraised value. Most people donât think itâs possible, but it isâespecially if you work with an agent.Â Â âIf you overprice your home, it will sit on the market and go through multiple price reductions.â3. Buyers only come out on the weekends. The hottest buyers are out there all the time. They are taking time off work and taking a whole day during the week to look at homes, so make sure that you open your home up to all buyers possible. Oftentimes, the weekend buyers can really just be looky-loos, which you donât really want.4. You can overprice the house and get the right buyer. Even in this market, there is still the idea of the fantasyland buyer who will overpay for your home. However, buyers really arenât paying more than what everyone else will pay for your home. The value of your home is based on what the buyer and seller will agree upon. Look at where the market is. You may be able to go 2%, 3%, or 5% above recent sales, but if you overprice the home, it will sit on the market and go through a lot of price reductions.5. You can take advantage of a property thatâs gone through multiple price reductions. Sometimes people think, âHey, this seller is desperateâIâll be able to get a great deal.â In reality, the seller is just someone who didnât know where the market was and is just adjusting down to try and find the market. Â Oftentimes, theyâre not desperate sellers. In some cases, they may be the oppositeâthese sellers might get so stuck on their price that if they donât get that price, they wonât sell at all.I hope you found this information helpful. If you have any other questions about buying or selling in our current market, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

        "content": "What do you need to do to get your home ready for the spring market? Here are six tips you can follow:1. Pressure-wash your homeâs exterior. If you donât have a pressure-washer, you can buy or rent one and spray off the winter grime around the outside of your home.2. Brighten up the inside. Make sure your light bulbs are working, your windows and screens are as clean as possible, and there arenât any shrubs or bushes outside that are keeping light from shining inside your house.3. Get rid of any signs that you have a pet (if you have one). Clean up any winter damage your pet(s) may have caused. If youâre trying to sell your home, you donât want buyers to know that you keep a pet inside it.âSmall investments can pay big dividends when selling your home.â4. Depersonalize your home. Youâre about to move anyway, so you might as well start packing things up. I would start with the gallery wall of family photos. Your house should look like a model home, so clean up wherever you can so that when a buyer walks through it, they can picture themselves living there.5. Update your kitchen. A little investment can go a long way, and your kitchen is the most important place to do it. You can try painting the walls a neutral color, adding a shiny new faucet, or installing some new cabinetry.6. Amp up your homeâs curb appeal. Now that the season has changed, there are a few things you can do to make the front of your home more inviting, like spreading some weed killer around your yard, laying down some fresh bark, and planting some flowers. If itâs not warm enough yet to plant flowers in the ground, you can also set out potted flowers. These will add some nice color to your homeâs exterior.If you have any questions about how to prepare your home for the spring market or youâre thinking of buying a home in our market, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd love to help you.",

        "content": "Today, Iâm here with the second and final video in our series about the seven benefits of buying rental real estate. You can find the first installment here.Last time, we talked about cash flow, appreciation, and depreciation. Now, itâs time to learn about:4. Leverage. When you purchase rental real estate, you are able to leverage other peopleâs money to buy the property. For example, if you buy a $200,000 rental property at 20% down, youâre putting $40,000 of your own money into the property. You will gain appreciation in that property and get cash flow while someone else pays down your mortgage.âWith real estate, you always have options.â5. Write-offs. When you own a rental property, itâs like owning a business, which means you get a lot of write-offs that you can use to your benefit. You can write off things like repairs, HOA fees, and management fees. If you and your family like to travel to Hawaii or St. George, you can buy a rental property there and write off your travel expenses. Talk to your accountant; there are a lot of things you can do with write-offs. There are many ways you can manage your rental property to benefit you and your family and get the lifestyle you want.6. Real estate is a tangible asset. Unlike stocks and bonds, which can change quickly, real estate will always be there. In 2008, 2009, and 2010, the stock market changed drastically. Real estate was still there. In fact, rental real estate was in even higher demand at the time.7. Real estate gives you options. You can always sell your rental property, use seller financing, purchase another investment through a 1031 exchange, and defer your capital gains taxes so you can use that profit to buy something bigger. In the worst-case scenario, you can always live in your rental property.As you can see, real estate is a great investment option.If you are thinking about starting to invest in real estate or would like to add more properties to your portfolio, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you.",

        "content": "Today, Iâm bringing you the first installment in a two-part series on real estate investing. For this part, Iâll be going over some of the advantages of investing in real estate.The first benefit of investing in real estate is cash flow. But what does this mean? Essentially, your cash flow is the return you get on your property at the end of the year after all expenses have been paid.When looking at cash flow, itâs important to examine how much you have invested in the property. A lot of my clients ask, âHow much should I really make?â My answer is this: If you make less than 6% in the equity off of your property, you should sell immediately. However, most of my clients are making a return of more than 10%.âMost of my clients are making a return of more than 10% by investing in real estate.âThe second benefit is appreciation.Slow and steady appreciation adds to the benefit of owning rental real estate. Last year, we actually saw an 8% appreciation rate across the Wasatch Front.The third and final benefit I want to go over is depreciation. Specifically, depreciation will bring advantages in terms of your taxes, since it provides opportunities for write-offs.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "New construction is booming right now. In fact, if you live anywhere near open farmland, youâre probably seeing big developments being built. If youâre considering buying new construction, you need an agent by your side to guide you through the transaction.Over the 12 years Iâve been selling real estate, Iâve seen and worked with a lot of great builders, but that doesnât mean problems donât usually arise during the new construction process. As long as there are problems to overcome when building new construction, youâll need an agent to help you work through them.Itâs important to work side by side with an agent who knows your area, knows the schools in your area, and knows the builder so you and your family get what youâre looking for.Â A good agent will also familiarize you with whatâs going on in the market. As market conditions change, what we can negotiate with builders changes as well. Iâve seen many buyers try to buy new construction homes over the years without an agent, mostly because they didnât understand what could and couldnât be negotiated.âAs long as there are problems to overcome in the new construction process, youâll need an agent by your side to help you with them.âAn agent can also walk you through the lengthy contracts builders put together. They work extensively with their own attorneys to draft contracts that work for them, so you need someone with you whoâs looking out for your best interests as well.Work with your agent to make sure you also get a third-party inspector to look at the property. If youâre not already a contractor or youâre not familiar with the new construction process, why not hire someone to check everything out for you? An extra eye will benefit you greatly. In fact, I recently heard a story from a client of mine about someone who bought a new construction home in their neighborhood and flooded their garage the first time they turned on the bathtub in the bathroom on top of it. Nobody noticed this flaw, even after both the builder and the city inspector inspected the property.Lastly, take your agent with you the first time you look at your new construction home or make sure the agent calls and registers you beforehand so that agent can get paid. If they donât, they might not be able to represent you.The best part is, when you work with a builder, you wonât pay anything extra to have an agent there looking out for your best interests.If you have any further questions about buying new construction or you have any other real estate needs I can help you with, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

If you plan on being in a home for a very long time, adding solar panels is probably a great idea.However, if you arenât going to be in your current home for very much time at all, you may want to wait until youâre settled somewhere else.âThe decision on whether to add solar panels really depends on how long you plan on living in a home.âI personally think solar panels are great. Itâs wonderful to be self-reliant. The challenge, though, is that when it comes to selling a home, solar panels are not always appraised for their full value.Additionally, not all buyers will want solar panels. Sometimes, theyâll even request for them to be removed before they close.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.
