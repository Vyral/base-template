I knew the market was hot but I didnât expect to get what I got and I think itâs due in large part to the agents I picked, Heidi and Billy. They really negotiated and marketed the house well. For my floor plan and model I got the highest selling price ever, so that was awesome. Their responsiveness is top notch, first of all. They answered all of my questions, they responded to every email and text I sent them. As far as going above and beyond that, I know they marketed the property in every place imaginable, they conducted the open house very well from what I saw. Yeah, a just overall great experience.â",

Today Iâll give you the steps of buying a home so you can be better prepared to jump into the market:  Consult a real estate agent. Make sure the agent you hire knows your wants, needs, and time frame.  Apply for a loan. By doing this, youâll see how much you can get approved for and what sort of rate youâll get. You want to make sure the monthly payment will be comfortable for your family.  Look at the available homes that match your criteria. This step is when youâll determine exactly what sort of home and neighborhood you want to be in.  Submit an offer. Once you have found your dream home, your agent will submit an offer and negotiate your terms.  Do your due diligence. Once your offer is accepted, youâll need to do a variety of home inspections. An appraiser will also come out during this step to make sure the home is selling at fair market value.  Send your loan package into the underwriters to get approved for your loan.  Do a final walkthrough. Youâll want to make sure all the repairs have been done that the seller agreed to do. Itâs your last chance to verify the condition of the property.  Sign the documents.  Pay the down payment and closing costs.  Get the keys!If you have any other questions about buying a home, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!",

        "content": "âIt was really good working with them. Our real estate agent Chia Vang, he was really good, very professional. Whenever we had a question, he was always there to answer them. He was really quick with his response. And for us, because we work during the day until 5, Chia knew that we were getting nervous during the house search and so he worked with our schedule. When we would email him he would respond right away, call he would always answer, text message he would reply back very soon. We were fairly young, itâs our first time purchasing a home, we didnât know the process to it and so, like example, when we really liked a house, and we told him we were interested in it he helped us through the process and he explained to us exactly what was going to happen. And then when we saw a few things wrong with the house that needed to be fixed he made sure to tell us, donât worry Iâll make sure that the seller will address it and Iâll make sure to address it with the sellerâs agent. We were very happy because we got a new roof. They didnât just fix the roof, the shingles were replaced three times so they put in a brand new roof. Things around the house that we saw were fixed right away. When we did notice [something] after the final walk-through Chia was able to push for the seller to give us money towards our closing costs so I was very happy with that. Chia, our Realtor, is actually my cousin. Heâs like my older brother. One thing thatâs really special about him is that he never let family come into it. He didnât push me to do things just because he was my cousin. I remember asking him about, I think the house inspection, I was like should we do all of it or what do you think? And he was just like, this is what I suggest, but I would never tell what to do exactly. This is the outcome if you do it this way or if you donât. That was one thing I really appreciated from him was when I didnât know something he would explain it to me from both perspectives and I was like, alright, that gives we a better understanding of what we need to do for the house.â",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Why is a pre-approval so important? What all goes into the pre-approval process?First off, you need to get pre-approved so you know what kind of home you are able to buy. Your pre-approval number is generally referred to as your purchasing power.How does your lender calculate this amount? By going through your credit, looking at your income, and determining your debt-to-income ratio, your lender will help you determine what mortgage payment youâre comfortable making.The interest rate you qualify for is a big factor in determining your purchasing power. For example, if you qualified for an interest rate of 3.25%, your mortgage payment for a $250,000 home would be roughly $1,088 per month. If you donât qualify for that 3.25% rate and instead qualify for a rate as high as 4.75%, your mortgage payment for that same $250,000 home would increase to $1,300 per month.âThe interest rate you qualify for plays a big role in your purchasing power.âSee why itâs so important to know what interest rate youâre able to qualify for and lock in? That extra $212 could mean a lot. By saying yes to that increased payment, youâre saying no to eating out more often with your family. A higher mortgage rate means more sacrifices.Many times, I have to explain this process to my clients in more detail, so if you want to dive further into this subject matter, donât hesitate to ask your own loan officer. Theyâll be able to give you the answers you need before buying your first home.If you have any questions or are looking to buy or sell a home, feel free to reach out to us.

        "content": "Lately, Iâve had a lot of buyers wondering how Iâm able to show them homes that I donât personally have listed. If my picture isnât on the âfor saleâ sign, how can I show the home?When a homeowner decides to sell their home with the help of an agent, theyâre working with a listing agent. The listing agent puts the home on a service called the MLS (multiple listing service), which basically advertises that home to every agent who has access to the MLS. Why would you want your home advertised to these agents, though? When a home is put on the market, thereâs a certain commission thatâs agreed upon by the seller to pay the listing agent and the agent who brings them a willing buyer. The agent who brings a buyer is known as a buyerâs agent.âLockboxes let any agent show a home to their buyer, no matter who the listing agent is.âThe Realtor who shows the home represents the buyerâs side of the transaction, whereas the listing agent represents the sellerâs side of the transaction. Every agent who has access to the MLS also has access to a lockbox, which they can log into for access to the keys to the home. Every time a buyerâs agent logs into a lockbox, their ID and license verification get sent to the seller to notify them who is looking at their home and how much traffic is coming in.This will give sellers an idea of whether their home is priced right and attractive to buyers. So thatâs how weâre able to show homes to our clients that arenât our listings.I hope this helps you understand the MLS and how showings work, no matter who the listing agent is. If you have any other questions or youâre looking to buy or sell a Sacramento home, give us a call or send us an email. Weâd love to help you!",

Sadly, theyâre no longer hovering around their all-time low average of 3%. The good news? Itâs still a good time to buy. Why?To answer that, letâs turn back the clock a little bit. In the 1970s, interest rates were averaging around 8%. In the 80s, that average rose to 12%. Then, in the 90s, it shrunk back down to 8%. In the 2000s, it shrunk down a little further to 6%.âYou can still lock in an ultra-low rate by buying now.âNow that weâre almost into 2017, our interest rates are averaging 4%. So, as you see, even as theyâve risen, theyâre still incredibly low from a historical perspective. You may have missed out on the apex, but we canât go back in time. Compared to previous decades, our rates are still historically low, so if you wanted to buy a home, youâd still be locking in a better rate than your parents ever could have.If youâre looking to buy or sell a home, donât hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email.

        "content": "One of my clients recently ask me, âShould I buy now and own a home, or should I keep renting and save for a bigger down payment?âThis is an important question. Everybodyâs situation is a little bit different, but if you find that youâre asking yourself the same question, I can tell you that there are three reasons you should stop renting and go ahead and buy.The first reason is that when you write rent checks to a landlord, youâre paying themânot you. Youâre not building any equity for yourselfâyouâre building equity for your landlord. If youâre renting to try and save for a bigger down payment and prevent PMI being added onto your mortgage, youâre not doing yourself any favors. In all that time, you couldâve been lowering your mortgage and building equity for yourself.The second reason is that when you own a home, you can do whatever you want to it. When you rent, if you want to change anything substantial about the property, you need permission from the landlord. Even if the landlord does give you permission, youâre only upgrading their propertyânot yours.âOwning a home means building long-tern equity.âThe third reason is if you do buy a home and the experience is too overwhelming, after five years, you have the option of turning the property into a rental home and becoming a landlord, yourself.Do you want to be able to do whatever you want to the house youâre living in? Do you want to be able to pay yourself first and build equity in the long run? Do you want the freedom to be able to become a landlord in the future? If you answer âyesâ to any of these questions, you probably have your answer.If you have any questions about this topic, please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email.

Today, I wanted to share three reasons why:  A mortgage is fixed, but rent is not. It depends on the landlord as to how much, but your rent will go up over time. A mortgage payment will stay the same throughout the lifetime of your loan.  A mortgage acts as a forced savings account. Down the road, as you pay your mortgage and reduce the balance on your loan, you also increase your equity in the mortgage. If an emergency occurs or you want to make upgrades to your home, you can pull equity out of your mortgage because it acts like a savings account from the beginning.  You can rent out your home if you need to move, and they can pay down your mortgage. You can even potentially earn income from that renter.âA mortgage acts as a forced savings account.âThese are just three reasons why owning a home is beneficial to your finances.

You donât want the seller to pay for the inspection because if they do, they will choose the inspector. As a result, the inspector will look out for the sellerâs best interests instead of yours. You want the inspector to be working for you so that he or she can give you an unbiased opinion of the home.Secondly, you will get some recommendations for inspectors from the agent that is helping you buy the home, but youâre not obligated to choose any of them. Feel free to do your own research on a home inspector that fits your needs.âYou want to be able to choose your own inspector.âFinally, donât expect the home inspection report to be very detailed; it will only cover the basics. An inspector is not going to break down walls and look at plumbing or wires. They will only cover the cosmetics of the home to make sure it looks decent, that the water is turned on, the gas works, the power outlets work, and whether the roof looks good. We still recommend having a roofing professional come out to do a detailed roof inspection to find out whether itâs certifiable.Hopefully, this gives you a better idea of what to expect when it comes to home inspections. Remember that you can be present during the inspection. That way, the inspector can address any specific concerns you have.If you have any more questions about home inspections or youâre thinking about buying or selling a home in the Sacramento area, give me a call or send me an email.

People will come to me wanting to look at homes in a certain price range and then proceed to get pre-approved. Many times, these buyers end up qualifying for more than they thought and have more options for buying a home. You wonât have to cap yourself because youâll know what you can afford.  You wonât know what interest rates will be until you lock them in. If you look for a home first and then get pre-approved, you wonât have a good idea of what your payment is. You might find out that payments are more than you can afford on a monthly basis, and we have to reduce the purchase price. Interest affects more than just the price, so you want to lock in your rate before shopping.âGetting pre-approved tells toy exactly what you can afford.â  You can provide the seller with the pre-approval letter. This is huge if you find yourself up against other offers. If you donât have a pre-approval letter and the offer youâre competing against does, the seller will most likely go with the offer with the pre-approval. Why? All the lender information is there to verify that the buyer has the necessary funds. Sometimes sellers who go under contract with buyers who arenât pre-approved will cancel the deal within a week when they find out about their pre-approval status.Donât underestimate any of these three points about getting pre-approved for a loan before you look at homes.

Your offer may look stronger if you shorten up your contingency period to perhaps 15 or 10 days.This makes you appear to be more serious about your offer. The seller might be willing to take your offer over other offers that are higher just because your contingency period and your terms make more sense for them.âShorten the contingency period in your offer.âThe second strategy you can use is writing a personal letter to the seller letting them know why they should choose your offer over everyone elseâs. That letter could mean the world to them because it makes your offer more personal.The third strategy is to include your lenderâs information in your offer. This includes their cell number, email, and the name of their company. In this case, if the seller is looking to do their due diligence on the offer to make sure that youâre approved or have the amount ready for the down payment, they have all the information they need in order to do so.If youâre looking to buy our sell a home, donât hesitate to get in contact with us.

To put that in perspective, a balanced market has four to six months of inventory. Anything below that is considered a sellerâs market.With only a little over a month of inventory available, houses that are priced correctly are flying off the market in as little as 10 days. Demand is incredibly high right now, and if a buyer finds the right home, they are moving quickly to make sure they get it.Part of the reason why demand is so high is because interest rates are at an all-time low. The buyer I spoke with was able to get a 30-year fixed rate of 3.6% by working with our preferred lender. If youâre like me and you have a 5% interest rate on your home, now is a good time to look into refinancing your mortgage.

In fact, to find out what the right answer is for a particular clientâs situation,I ask the following questions:  What are your plans for the next 2-5 years? You need to think about your relationships and your job before you make the leap into homeownership. If you may be relocating in coming years, locking in a mortgage may not be the best option.  How much are you paying in rent? If rent is, say, $1,600 a month, you have options out there where you would be paying the same amount of money in monthly mortgage and principal payments.  What are the benefits of homeownership? If you own your home, you can write off some of your expenses when tax season comes around and, historically, home prices increase over time, so owning a home becomes a type of forced savings. With rates at historic lows, owning a home is more affordable than it usually is!  What are the disadvantages of homeownership? When you become a homeowner, you are responsible when things break. If youâre not someone who is willing or able to fix things or find someone who will, homeownership may not be for you.âWhether you should buy or rent really depends on how you react to these questions.âWhether you should buy or rent really depends on how you react to these questions.

We should not forget that our homes will be in line with the spring fashion line!No need to repaint your house. The colors of spring suit well with almost all shades. Throw in some citrus colored accessories in your home. Match it with brightly colored vases and spunky patterned rugs and throw pillows. This will create a casual living room that sings âspringâ.Revamp your bedroom by adding more floral prints. Liven up your plain headboard by adding or just by simply draping over a floral printed fabric. If you have a bare wall in your room, you can make simple spring decoration by cutting out floral prints that goes along well with your roomâs color palette. Frame it using simple old picture frames or if you want to buy cheap ones itâs ok. The simplicity will complement the beautiful pattern of your cut outs. Then add a little vase with a real or plastic flower on your beside table. Waking up to these will guarantee you a good mood to start your day.If you want your walls to have that spring feel, but you donât want to repaint it. Then use removable wallpaper with spring time vibe. Use little floral patterns or a color thatâs light and fresh, like pastel yellow and orange.You know those ready-made ceiling rosettes? Who says theyâre only for ceilings? With a little creativity it could add life and style to your living room. Just paint them with different shades of yellow and hang the discs on the wall. Since they are lightweight, they are pretty easy to hang and they are available at most home centers.If you have egg cups in your home and you donât really use it. You may improvise by using these cups as storage for your little office knickknacks, put paper clips, stamps and such. Or you may also put little candies on it and put it on your side tables for visitors.Flowers are not the only thing that blooms in spring. New leaves also blossom out of those trees and shrubs. So add a simple green centerpiece on your living room table, use a bundle of fern leaves an put it in a vase. It doesnât have to be flowers all the time.Spring means good sunlight. Let those rays grace your room by putting up simple sheer panels. It lets the sunlight in and because itâs light, it moves easily with the breeze, making your room look fresher and brighter.New life, new beginnings, and renewed hope; these are the things that Spring Season gives each and every one of us.

Spring is the season to stay outside and surely you will have friends over to hang out.  You may scrub the tracks with a dry, old toothbrush to loosen the debris first, and then use a vacuum hose to remove the debris. Finish the cleaning with a wet sponge.Third, do not take for granted the hidden areas. Clean under furniture and appliances. Move your heavy sofas and couches roll up the rugs, vacuum the floors. These hidden areas are most likely the reason why your house gets dusty so fast even if youâve just cleaned the house.Fourth, refresh your window treatments. If your curtains and draperies are not dirty enough to have them laundered, you may simply clean them by using the upholstery attachment on your vacuum. If you have sheer curtains, you may remove the dust by putting them in the dryer on low with a fabric softener sheet.Fifth, dust your light fixtures. Use a lint-free or microfiber cloth to dust fixtures and bulbs that you can reach. Include your ceiling fans in the list, clean them by using a skip ladder or an extendable duster. For grimy bulbs, the solution is to dampen your cloth with a small amount of vinegar. But before you do this, make sure that the lights has long been turned off so it wonât be too hot to the touch.Sixth and probably the most important is to get your home organized. Declutter your home by eliminating unnecessary stuff in your room before cleaning it. Try using different containers when decluttering, this will help you get organized in which to throw, to keep or to give. After decluttering, look around the room and double check if all the things that you have decided to keep is in their right places.These are just some of the things that you can do to make your home feel refreshing this spring. Make a note to yourself though that you should also change your wardrobe since the winter season is over!",

        "content": "Have you ever wondered why some homes fail to sell? Typically, there are four reasons for this:  Poor marketing. Gone are the days when an agent simply puts up a yard sign, enters your home on the MLS, and waits for a buyer to come along. These days, savvy buyers are cruising the web for homes. In fact, according to the NAR, over 90% of buyers find homes online before they go out looking. We invest over six figures to get our listings  seen by the highest number of buyers!  Bad photos. You canât take photos of your home with an iPhone and expect it to sell. The first showing is online, and if you donât have professional photographs, buyers wonât even waste their time clicking on the listing. We send out a professional photographer to all of our listings and create a virtual tour for them as well.  Incompetent agent. Homes often fail to sell based solely on the agent. There are great agents, in-between ones, and horrible ones. A bad agent will price the home incorrectly and fail to return phone calls. You need an agent who is going to be with you every step of the way!  Pricing. Many sellers think they can price their home high and just negotiate down if necessary. However, putting the right price on the home from the start is crucial if you want to sell quickly and for top dollar. Itâs not an exact science, but our team has mastered the pricing process!âThere are a handful of things that will prevent your home from selling, the key is avoiding them!âIf your home failed to sell for one of these reasons, or if you want to avoid the same fate as other buyers, please donât hesitate to reach out to us.

        "content": "We all agree that staging is a big part of selling your house.  You have to make sure that it will leave a mark to your buyers. Giving your buyers a wow factor will definitely remind them of your house when itâs time for them to choose among the open houses that theyâve attended. Of course, itâs not enough to just stage your house for it to look good. You have to stage your house according to the current season. And since it is spring, here are some tips on how to stage your house during this season.Spring Staging Tip # 1:Curb appeal alone sometimes sells a house. Take advantage of the blooming flowers, plant colorful plants in your yard. But before you do that, make sure you already got rid of the winter debris that was left from the winter season. You may use frost-resistant plants that will not be affected by late cold spells that may hit your area. If you want a more convenient way, you may use silk flowers so you donât have to worry about watering them.Spring Staging Tip # 2:Spring cleaning is a must when this season comes, so itâs just natural for you to do some cleaningfirst and spruce up your home so it will be more pleasant and appealing to your buyers.Spring Staging Tip # 3:Some buyers will open your dressers and closets to check how much storage they can get when they buy your home. To avoid having a tight closet, remove those bulky winter clothes from the past season. Replace them with the light and airy clothes that you have for spring. It doesnât only bring out vivid colors to your closets and room; it will also make your closet look more spacious.Spring Staging Tip # 4:We seldom forget to change our door mats after winter because itâs one the least of our worries. If your welcome mat in your doorway is filled with winter dirt, provide a new one. Remember, you want your buyers to feel that they are welcome to view your house; a clean and pretty entry way will make them feel exactly like that.Spring Staging Tip # 5:A nice smelling home will make your buyers feel refreshed. It will also let them know that you have a clean and well maintained home. Bring the aroma of blooming flowers indoors. Use a scented candle or scented oil, fresh flowers, and or incense. This will make your house smell clean and fresh and at the same time it will set the mood for your open house.Spring Staging Tip # 6:Keep those dark and warm flannel comforters in storage and bring out your colorful and crisp linens. Add bright floral patterns or colorful solids for a touch of the spring season. Your buyers will surely feel fresh and cheerful with all the bright colors in your house.You donât have to spend a lot just to stage your home. A simple flower vase with fresh cut colorful flowers can already brighten up a dull table. So donât restrict yourself, let your creative juices flow, mix and match different patterns and color. Spring is about life and flowers and colors, make your house look bright, cheerful and welcoming by staging it for spring!More seller tips at: www.heidiphonghomes.com",

Designer Angelo Surmelis shares several great ideas to spread holiday cheer throughout the home. Here are some of our favorites.  Pay attention to the mantle. If you donât have some already, buy some kind of garland to drape over the mantle. Next, use leftover ornaments and candles to add light and texture. When choosing ornaments and candles, ensure they are in the same color-palette. This helps make your mantle a great focal point!  Use smaller Christmas trees. Every house has their main Christmas tree. In addition, you can also purchase smaller, inexpensive, eco-friendly trees to place throughout the home. Decorate these trees with strips of fabric from a T-shirt in holiday colors to save money for the main tree.  Use what you have. Be resourceful. Adding a plate charge and place mat to your everyday dining set adds some jazz to your table. Fresh-cut flowers and candles will help finish the look. You donât need grand, expensive candles â a little candlelight goes a long way!âMake the mantle a beautiful focal point.âAs you can see, it doesnât take much to make your home feel more festive.

Today we want to talk about an interesting trend weâve noticed in real estate: millennials are waiting longer to purchase their first homes than their parents did.The typical first-time buyer now rents for an average of 6 years before buying a home, which is up from 2.6 years in the early 1970âs, according to Zillow.âJob security is important to millennial buyersâWe came across a great video on the topic from CNBC. To save you some time, I will give you my three biggest takeaways from the video.  Down payments are a huge factorRenters in todayâs market are struggling to save for down payments and qualify for mortgages. Most first-time buyers still depend on personal savings for at least some of their down payments, but rising rental prices have complicated the task of socking away money for a down payment.  Rising rental rates are complicating things as wellRental rates are causing 46% of renters aged 25-354, to spend more than 30 percent of their incomes on rent, up from 40 percent a decade earlier.  Job security is important to millennial buyersThe Money Source, a mortgage lender, examined applications from 5,404 millennial buyers and found that these buyers averaged nearly 4.5 years in their field of work and had held their current job for slightly more than three years. Those figures point to how critical career stability is to a younger generation.Thanks for joining me today. Talk to you soon!",

A real estate agent can represent you and your best interests, so here are four reasons why you should hire one to sell your home.  Agents outsell FSBOâs: A FSBO is a for sale by owner property. A Realtor can get you up to 6% more for your home, and that can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars in a sale. Studies show that homes priced correctly will sell faster and for more money.  You have a negotiator on your side: There are a lot of different people to negotiate with throughout the process of selling a home, and it pays dividends to know how to speak with these people and get their attention. Realtors already have relationships with these people, and youâll find it much easier for them to negotiate than doing so on your own.  Realtors have professional marketing experience: Real estate agents have the ability to display your home on hundreds of different websites and this is important because over 90% of buyers look online when they begin a home search.  More guidelines in the lending world: With all the rules and regulations in place in the lending world, itâs increasingly difficult to sell your own home.
