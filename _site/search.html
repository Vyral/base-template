        "category": "",
        "content": "Over the last 15 years, weâve tried just about everything related to client appreciation events. Some of them have crashed and burned. Others have been home runs.Two examples of client appreciation events that have worked for us are our client appreciation cookout and our Thanksgiving pie and pumpkin roll giveaway. We throw both of these events annually and theyâre definitely worth the effort.To pull off events like these, we break them down into five manageable steps that you can use as a guide for setting up your own client appreciation event:1) Make a list of preferred attendees. We recommend this list be comprised of past clients that have remained local and your local sphere of influence.âMost of our clients really appreciate these events and look forward to them annually.â2) Contact the vendors you need to support this event and confirm the dates. For example, the client appreciation cookout typically requires a caterer and a band. The Thanksgiving pie and pumpkin roll giveaway typically requires a bakery.3) Have a print shop print out potential mail invite proofs. Make sure whichever you choose looks professional and has your logo on it. Also include an RSVP date on them.4) Send the invites out to your preferred list and schedule a four- to five-hour prospecting time block so you can get on the phone and contact all of your invites personally. You can make sure they got their invite or you can just ask them if they want to RSVP right then and there. This is a critical point most agents forget about, but sometimes people just get too much mail and forget about invites like this. Attendance will be low if you donât follow up your invites with a phone call. This is also a great opportunity to reconnect with your database.5) Make connects with all of your attendees at your event and enjoy your time. Youâll get about two to three hours to connect with people you wonât get a chance to connect with any other time of the year.When done correctly and with consistency, these events can be invaluable to your business. They allow you to connect personally with people youâve worked with in the past or those who you like and trust. Truthfully, these events also give your clients a great opportunity to make connections they otherwise wouldnât have a chance to make.Most of our clients really appreciate these events and look forward to them annually. If you have any other questions about this topic, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd love to chat with you soon.",

        "title": "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Real Estate Agents",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "What are the seven habits of highly effective real estate agents? According to Stephen Covey and Brandon Doyle, these are the habits every agent should follow:1. Be proactive. If you spend your day reacting to everyone elseâs whims, your business will run you instead of the other way around. Make sure that you have time blocks and set boundaries around your time. Be proactive about communicating with your clients so they hear from you every week, instead of waiting to touch base after a problem comes up.2. Begin with the end in mind. Create a plan for your life and your business. What do you want your life to look like 10, five, or three years from now? What about one year down the road? Figure out where you want to be and map out a strategy to meet these goals. Break that strategy down into bite-sized chunks so you donât feel overwhelmed.âCommunicate with clients proactively instead of waiting for a problem to arise.â3. Put first things first each day. There are important activities that need to be done. Since they are not urgent matters that need to be done right now, many agents tend to skip important activities like prospecting to grow their business. Spend two hours each morning getting those things accomplished before you get pulled into urgent reactive activities, like replying to emails or handling social media.4. Think win-win. Take a collaborative approach to the real estate business in general. Think how you can create a win-win situation that will benefit your client as well as the other agent and their client. If you can do that effectively transaction after transaction, it goes a long way toward making everyone happy at the settlement table.5. Seek to understand before being understood. Empathize with people. Put yourself in their shoes. Understand their needs first. Again, it may seem like more work up front, but it goes a long way to make everything go smoother.6. Synergize. Even if youâre not on a team, there are a lot of people around you.

When we contact them, we cover these four things:1.) Here is what we did last week.2.) Here is what the results were.3.) Here is what weâre doing next week.4.) What can we do differently or better?If you can ask those four things every seven days, you will be a proactive agent rather than a reactive agent. By being proactive, you will run your business instead of allowing your business to run you.Communicating with your clients this way creates happier relationships, happier customers, and more referrals for you and your business down the road.If you have any other questions or if you would like to share something that you do to grow your business, just give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Welcome back to our business-building blog for high-producing agents on fast-growing teams. Today weâre here to answer the question, âHow do you have a for-profit business with a nonprofit purpose?âIf youâve been selling homes for a while like I have, youâve probably been wondering about how you can have a bigger impact on your community. After about a decade in the business, I wasnât sure if this is what I wanted to do with my life and I was questioning what I wanted to do.After talking with my wife and a few other close friends and family members, I came to the realization that Iâm uniquely positioned in real estate to learn about peopleâs needs and serve them on a really deep level.I decided to start a new referral program. I always ask my clients if they know of anybody who is thinking about buying or selling, but I never ask them if they know anyone who might be going through a tough time that we could serve in an anonymous way.âThis referral program has brought joy to many people.âThat idea led me to developing the Community Appreciation Program that allows us to serve others in the community by using our database as leverage to find them. Hereâs how we did it, in five easy steps:  Open up a separate checking account.  Put a percentage of every commission check in there.  Ask every client this question: âWho do you know in the community with a random, urgent need whom we might be able to serve?â  Have the client enter the personâs information in a Google survey or spreadsheet.  Once youâve picked someone, call the person who gave you the referral and ask them to partner with you to give the gift. Ask them how it went afterwards.This is just one easy way to bring purpose back into your real estate business. If you have any questions, or if you have an example of another way you or your team is giving back, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.",

        "content": "Are you interested in doubling your business?Today, Iâve got two questions you can ask that can help you do just that. When done at the right time with a genuine attitude, asking these questions can go a long way in developing deep relationships with your customers. It will also help you with future referrals.First, as a buyer consultation is coming to a close, ask your buyer the following before either of you leave: âWhat are your biggest fears or concerns in the upcoming transaction?â In this sometimes intimidating process, people want to feel understood and reassured.There is a common belief that being a good listener is the best sales skill you can have. Personally, I believe that having empathy is a close second to that.As professionals, we deal with the stress and uncertainties that come along with real estate transactions every dayâbut this likely isnât the case for your client.âPut yourself in your clientâs shoes.âBeing able to genuinely listen and take a sincere interest in their concerns will not only help to assuage your clientâs fears, but also build a better relationship between you in general.Put yourself in your clientâs shoesâdoing so will make a huge difference.The second question you should ask should also be posed at the end of a buyer consultation. That question is: âIs there anything unrelated to real estate that I can help you with?â By asking your client this, you are showing a level of service that extends beyond what they likely expect of you.While itâs true that an agentâs job is not to be a therapist, the reality is that going out of your way to do something nice for your client can really make an impact.After posing this question, listen to their response and consider taking notes. Empathizing with and caring for your clients will foster strong relationships and build a strong referral business for the future.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "When it comes down to it, we are all independent contractors and like small business owners in many ways. I run into a lot of agents who only focus on gross volume, income, and commission splits as financial indicators of their career. In reality, there are seven key variables to consider that will affect your bottom line when it comes down to deciding where you will practice real estate. Here are those seven things to pay attention to when looking at brokerages:1. Commission splits.Â This is a fairly obvious one. Different brokerages have different splits.2. Occupancy cost. Some brokerages charge expensive desk fees, some have cheap fees, and some have no fees at all. Neither is right or wrong, but itâs important that you understand what kind of support youâre looking for.3. Brand recognition.Â This is a little less tangible, but still very important. A company with strong brand recognition in your market will make it easier for you to do more business.âDo a thorough job at researching and vetting brokerages.â4. Administrative support. A brokerage could have compliance officials, service coordinators, or even full-time transactional support. When you have a brokerage who focuses on the basics, you can spend more time on the dollar-producing activities that will grow your business.5. Lead generation. Do they provide leads or not? Do they offer scripts? Both are important questions to ask.6. Technology. Some charge for the best tech, some provide it for you, and some donât provide it at all.7. Leadership and accountability.Â It has been proven that coaching programs affect an agentâs bottom line as much as anything else. Some brokers provide this kind of support on their own, while others will point you to a coach and still others wonât offer anything at all.The answers to each of these questions will affect where you practice. Make sure you do a thorough job at researching and vetting brokerages before you make your decision. If you have any other questions about any of these variables or how it could affect your bottom line, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.",

Write down their names and contact information, including email and phone number. This list should have anywhere from 50 to 300 people.2. Highlight the top 10 to 20 contacts that are most likely to refer you business.

Be sure to contact everyone on that list at least 30 times a year. They should hear your voice through either a phone call, an image through direct mail or email, and/or a handwritten note.4. Meet in person with those highlighted as âA+â over lunch or coffee three to four times a year.5. When you touch in with anyone on your list, make sure you bring them an item of value.

Make sure theyâre aware that youâre in real estate and youâd love to hear from anyone they know who might be buying or selling in the next year.If you have any questions about this topic or youâre looking to buy or sell a home, please give me a call or send me an email.

Iâm here to tell you that if you can improve that control, you can double your productivity.To do this, you need to focus on the actions and tasks that give you the highest return on the investment of your time. These are activities like following up with leads and prospecting. They are very important, but we often donât treat them that way. We tend to procrastinate on them.âI have time set aside each day for money-producing activities.âTo manage your time more wisely, I recommend using activity blocking to make sure you have specific times set aside in your calendar each day where you can focus on those money-making activities. As you can see in my calendar in the video above, I have time set aside each day for specific tasks and time set aside for focusing on things other than work. Here are my three steps to doubling your productivity:1. Block time out in your schedule each day where you are specifically not working.2. Block time out in the morning for a specific task, whether it be prospecting, business building, or something else.3. Protect those time blocks with a vengeance.By following these three steps, you can use the remaining time in your schedule to accomplish the rest of the things you need to do.

So, whether Iâm providing the service or someone else is, the client will receive the exact same level of service.For example, in the video above, we have listing plans that have specific action items for specific people. If you were to click on that action item, youâd also see specific notes weâve typed up explaining how that person is supposed to complete that action item. We also set a timer so every action item listed is completed at the exact same time in the transaction right up until the property goes under contract.âAction items are there to make our processes repeatable.âIf one of our buyers or sellers goes under contract, we also have a closing plan for them. This breaks down the entire closing process so each client gets the exact same treatment, whether theyâre working with me directly or someone else on our team.You can do all sorts of action itemsâboth for business and personal use. Again, theyâre there to make sure the process is repeatable.

        "content": "As an agent, Iâm a big advocate of not getting distracted by shiny objects. Think of all the things presented to us real estate agents that we could easily go after and spend our money on. With that in mind, here are five critical technologies to grow your business that are tried and tested for solo agents, small teams, and teams with as many as 30 agents handling 1,000 transactions:1. Google Apps for Work. The Google suite provides a collaborative office suite with Gmail, Google Calendars, and shared calendars with all sorts of notifications settings and appointment tracking for your team members. Also included is Google Docs, which offers sharing settings, storage, and collaboration within Google Sheets and Google Docs. Thereâs a whole other suite of applications within the Google Apps for Work suite. Itâs a great piece of technology thatâs essential for any team in the real estate world.2. Top Producer. Top Producer has a reputation for being clunky, but the truth is that itâs great to use as a CRM as well as for listing and closing plans. There is no better way to ensure that all your clients are treated the exact same way and theyâre treated up to the service standard they have come to expect from you.3. Buyer side CRM. In a world of Internet technology and website leads, itâs important youâre able to both create a funnel for prospects coming into your world and organize those prospects so a system can prompt you to follow up with them.4. A call recording and tracking system. Itâs important that you track your business as you grow it so you can decide whatâs worth spending money on and whatâs not. A call recording and tracking system can help you improve quality control for training purposes and ensure that your team members treat your clients in the most effective and personable way possible. It can also track where youâre getting your leads from.5. A business tracking system. There are all kinds of business tracking systems out there in the real estate world, but something on an Excel spreadsheet works as well as anything. Make sure that every lead source that brings a prospect into your world has a tracking code on it and every appointment thatâs set contains that tracking code. At the end of that month, do a reconciliation to figure out where your business is coming from and what the return on each of those advertising investments has been.âThese five technologies will help your business immensely.âIf you have any questions about any of these technologies, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "At some point, the time may come when your best move will be to hire a real estate assistant. If youâre doing 15 to 20 transactions without an assistant, youâre probably having trouble finding balance in life. An assistant can not only give you an opportunity to find that balance, but increase your productivity at the same time.How will you know itâs time to hire an assistant? There are three qualifiers we look for before making a hire:1. Your transaction count: If youâre looking to do 25 or more transactions, your count is probably at or over capacity.2. Your income: If youâre in the $4.5 million to $6 million annual production range, it might equate to about $130,000 to $150,000 GCI. If youâre at that level or more, you should consider hiring an assistant because you likely have the financial capacity.3. Your savings: The conservative in me thinks itâs important to have an emergency fund. If you have between three and six months of an assistantâs potential income saved in a separate account, then you have the financial reserves to be able to afford an assistant. That way, if you have a slow period, youâll have a bucket of reserves you can pull from without getting too stressed. We all know we can have slow times of a month or two at a time, so this is really valuable to have.âYour transaction count can be a good indicator that itâs time to hire an assistant.âIf any or all three of these qualifiers relate to you, it might be time to really think about whether you should hire an assistant. I can say with certainty that every time weâve hired an assistant or agent to help us grow our business, weâve never regretted it.If youâd like to discuss these qualifiers further, Iâd love to sit down and speak with you about your best course of action.

Thereâs a lot of talk in the industry about these kinds of leads and whether theyâre worth your while. A lot of teams have success with Internet leads, but the question is whether itâs worth your while for you specifically. Two years ago, an NAR study showed that referral business was still the No. 1 source of real estate business in the United States, but also that 20% of real estate business was generated by Internet leads. Keep in mind that an MIT response study found that if you canât follow up with an Internet lead in five minutes or less, itâs probably not worth your while. Do you have the technology, systems, and capacity to follow up with them that quickly? The average agent last year took 61 hours to follow up with an Internet lead, so consider that before you decide to invest your time and money in them. Secondly, be aware that it takes seven to eight follow-ups to build a rapport with a lead. Do you have that kind of time and capacity?âOverall, it takes a lot of money, time, systems, and technology to do it well.âThird, remember that the money generated from Internet leads are often generated in long-term follow-up. Most Internet leads are six to 12 months from their buy-in window at the time that they inquire. Not only do you have to follow up quickly and often, you have to follow up for a long time. Overall, it takes a lot of money, time, systems, and technology to do it well. If youâre at a point in your business where youâve leveraged help from other people and you have the time and money to spend on systems and technology to pursue Internet leads, it might be a great decision for your business.

Implement these three strategies to run your business.*Join The Team&gt;How do you make sure that you are running your business instead of letting your business run you? I use three strategies in my day-to-day business that work really well.First of all, set a daily voicemail. It only takes about 30 seconds. Say something along the lines of, âThis is Dave Hooke. Today is Wednesday, February such-and-such. I will be available from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. today. Your call is important to me and will be returned as soon as possible. If you call after 5:30, I will call you back tomorrow. Thank you and have a great day.âThat voicemail gives me peace of mind because it lets my customers know right away when they will hear back from me depending on when they call.Weâve all gotten a call at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. from a customer. I used to feel guilty or like I was slacking off if I didnât answer the call. Now, thanks to the voicemail, there are boundaries. The customer knows that I am on top of things and that they will get a call back tomorrow. After you use the voicemail for a couple of months, your customers will start any calls after 5:30 p.m. with an apology.Secondly, make sure to include an office hours page in each and every buyer and seller presentation. This sheet summarizes when your team is open for business. Ask your team to abide by those hours as much as they can. The office hours sheet sets expectations with the buyer or seller before they sign with you.When you explain that, like any other business, yours has business hours, your clients will respect that. Let them know that if there is an emergency, youâll get back to them as soon as possible. The office hours sheet combined with the daily voicemail will make a big difference in your business.âSet expectations and boundaries with your clients.âFinally, make sure that you time block your important, but not urgent, tasks. We know what those are because these are tasks we like to procrastinate on. Those tasks really drive our lives and businesses forward. Whether itâs managing your database or sending handwritten notes to clients, block out an hour or two every day to take care of those tasks.I like to go a step further and time block for exercising and family time. After 5:30 p.m., my rule is no work, no exceptions. If you have kids, add a note in your calendar that says, âWe are counting on you, Mom!â or âWe are counting on you, Dad!â It might feel like you are missing out on some things at work for the first couple of weeks but after a month or so, things will fall into place. Keep those time blocks in place, no exceptions.Implementing these three strategies will help you run your business instead of allowing your business to run you. If you have any questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",
