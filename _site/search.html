        "content": "Here are the two best upgrades a property owner can make.If youâre a homeowner looking to spruce up your unit a bit, what updates offer the best bang for your buck? The average home in Hawaii is usually anywhere from 40 to 60 years oldâwow, thatâs my age; I need an update!Â Jokes aside, you canât just take your 60-year-old unit and put it on the market for rent. It wonât rent, and if it does, it wonât rent for a lot of money. So where should you invest your time and money?Â 1. Flooring. Always put some vinyl product down in your house (tile is also an option, but itâs a little more expensive). If your carpet is weathered or your laminate is old, put down some vinyl; itâs not that costly and has a 25-year shelf life.Â 2. Air conditioning. People that come from the mainland cannot take our humidity. Trust me, I know this from experience: I lived on the mainland for a while, and when I moved back home, I simply couldnât sleep without air conditioning. Here in Hawaii, thereâs a roughly 50/50 shot that youâll find a home equipped with air conditioning. In my experience, the houses without air conditioning rent last.Â If you have questions on these two updates, or would like us to put in contact with some of our talented in-house handymen or trusted contractors, give us a call or send an email. Weâre happy to help!",

This states that if you choose to put a tenant we approve of in your unit and they later need to be evicted, we will pay for the legal eviction costs. Weâre the only property management group that offers this guarantee. I stand by our work, and we do such a great job with background checks that weâve only had to use this guarantee once.Â Weâve been in business for 10 years, have tons of units, and all we do is property management. Yes, even with all that, weâve only had to pay for an eviction once. In fact, we offer three guarantees to owners: eviction, rent, and communication guarantees, which you can read more about on our website.Give us a call or send an email if you have any questions about the eviction guarantee or property management. We would love to speak with you.",

When I do walk-throughs, Iâm looking for damage, illegal tenants, and abuse. Iâm looking for all these things in about a 10-minute walk-through with your tenants twice a year. If you allow pets in the house, weâll walk through it three times per year.Â Walk-throughs are crucial because we can tell if the tenant is living according to the rules, if theyâre overly dirty, if thereâs drug use, illegal alterations, and more. These are great times to catch whether any of these things are happening and protect your property. You will get a report from us with pictures stating how the property is doing, how it looks, and what we saw from the tenants.If you have any questions about walk-throughs or property management in general, please call or email me.

My answer to these questions is always yes.Â âThe average life of carpet is two to three tenants.âCarpet has gone out of style over the last decade. Many tenants with children ask if we have houses available without carpet because they canât be sure of what kind of care was taken with the carpet before they moved into the house. Also, children will usually be much harder on carpet than adults. A lot of owners will have damage or wear and tear, and the average life of carpet is two to three tenants.Â Today many floor products are being made harder, water-resistant, or waterproof. I believe vinyl is the best flooring for rental properties; it has the most variation, a 25-year warranty, and itâs often waterproof. You can have a huge water spill in your house and have no damage or wood issues like bowing of the edges. Tile is also great, but itâs very expensive to lay, though it has a shelf life of about 50 years.Â My recommendation is to switch to waterproof vinyl if itâs time to change the flooring in your house. There are many products out there, so you can choose whatâs best for your property.Â If you have questions about flooring or property management, please call or email us.

Another problem is, many people try to put off termite treatment and then end up having widespread damage to their homes.Â âTermites can eat up to five pounds of wood per week!âI always try to tell homeowners the bad news myself, as itâs the right thing to do.Â If you have a termite situation, or you know of one in a house, feel free to call or email me.

An email gets sent to me and the property manager before being directed to the maintenance department, which is on-call daily from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Property managers are free to handle the problem however they want, but 99% of the time, they ask us to take care of it.

The answer is no. Itâs totally up to you what kind of pets, if any, you will allow in your home.However, keep in mind that eight out of 10 people in todayâs market have pets. Especially when rent is up a little higher and families are out there looking. Most families have one or two children and one or two pets. It just comes with the territory.If you do choose to allow pets in your home, our addendum helps protect you.

That said, our addendum states that pest control is covered by the tenant.Pest control includes rodent control. The owner has no control if tenants leave out food, which attracts pestsâso they should not be held responsible. If rodent control is an ongoing problem mentioned in the ownerâs interview, I would recommend that you continue to carry rodent control in your house.âTHE OWNER IS NOT THE ONE WHO ATTRACTED THE PESTS, SO THE OWNER DOES NOT INCUR THE COSTS OF PEST CONTROL.âRodents are brought in by food not being stored properly in the home. So, as I mentioned, since the tenant is the one who attracts the rodents, they are the ones responsible for the costs of rodent control.Although pest control is important, I would say that 90% of my homes do not have a rodent problem.If you have any other questions about pest control or would like to learn more about how we take care of your investment properties, just give me a call or send me an email.

Hereâs how we handle it.Find Out How Much Your Home Will Rent For in Todayâs Market Learn More About Guaranteed RentHow do you discern wear and tear versus damage in a rental property? Getting a property condition form filled out correctly is one of the biggest problems I face in my business.The standard property condition form is four pages and itâs very extensive. We require tenants to fill out this form on their way in within the first 10 days of living in a unit. We then go back in on a 10-day walkthrough to remove your lock box and collect the property condition form. During that time, we walkthrough each item on the form thatâs listed as damaged or not working properly.âGETTING A PROPERLY FILLED OUT CONDITION FORM IS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST PARTS OF PROPERTY MANAGEMENT.âIf we commit to the repairs during the 10-day walkthrough, theyâll be repaired at the ownerâs cost.Wear and tear means things like scratches and scuff marks on the stairs, walls, and bathtub, dirty mirrors, and yellowing on the toilet. We have to determine whether itâs wear and tear from living in the unit or damage from negligence by the tenant. Our job is to make that determination for our owners upon move out.We also do a six-month walkthrough to make sure the home is cared for, four months if the unit allows pets. We provide pictures of the walkthrough, guaranteed.If you have any questions about assessing wear and tear or damage in a unit or youâre interested in our property management services, donât hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

We will look at your propertyâs area, present you with a market rent, and guarantee your rent at a certain amount. For example, letâs say your houseâs recommended rent is $3,000; weâll guarantee your rent at $2,400 or $2,600.There are many factors that go into renting your home. Until we actually look at the property, we donât know how renting will go. We donât know if the people who lived there used to bully the neighborhood, what the parking situation is, or if the house has pets.When we arrive at the house, we will look at all of those factors to determine whether or not we can rent your home. If we can, then you sign a contract that states that we will do everything in our power to rent your home. The contract also offers a rent guarantee, an eviction guarantee, and a communication guarantee.Many property management companies do not offer an eviction guarantee, even though they put the tenant in the property! If we have to go to eviction with a tenant, we will pay for that. We will also do a four and six-month walkthrough to make sure that your tenants are holding the line as far as your lease goes.âWE ARE HERE TO MAKE YOU MONEY AND PROTECT YOUR PROPERTY.âOur communication guarantee is extremely important. Many other property management companies can take a while to call you back if they call you back at all.

        "content": "We recommend that our owners carry certain types of insurance coverage so they can maximize their investment propertyâs value.Find Out How Much Your Home Will Rent For in Todayâs Market Learn More About Guaranteed RentFree Insurance QuoteOne of the questions we get asked a lot by our owners is, âHow much insurance should we carry on our home while we donât live in it?â Today I want to delve into this topic to give you an idea of what owners and tenants can expect.The first thing you must do as an owner is notify your current insurance company that youâre not using the property as your primary residence. This is an important detail for insurance companies because that makes the property an investment property.After thatâs done, we first recommend you take out a renterâs insurance policy that covers at least $10,000 in personal property. This is primarily to cover your appliances. This sum wonât be enough to cover a disaster like a wind storm blowing off your roof, but weâve been fortunate enough in Hawaii to mostly avoid hurricanes and other storms capable of that kind of damage in the past 100 years. Your liability coverage will be $100,000, which is in place in case an accident happens on the property.The other thing we recommend for owners is to get loss of rent coverage. This is important because if thereâs a leak or your home incurs some type of water damage, the tenants probably wonât be able to reside in it and pay rent. The loss of rent coverage makes sure you are compensated for the lost rent on your investment.âAS AN OWNER, YOUR LIABILITY COVERAGE WILL BE $100,000.âWhat do we ask on the tenantâs side? We require all tenants to carry a renterâs policy, which is a simple renterâs policy to cover a minimum of $10,000 on their property, $50,000 in liability, and more if they have a dangerous pet. If they happen to have what we consider a dangerous pet, we ask them to cover $100,000. We also ask them to have loss of rent coverage in their policy so that policy will kick in if something happens to them and prevents them from paying rent.If your house has wood floors and experiences a water leak and the tenants can still live there but arenât happy about it, the tenantâs coverage will take care of what they can cover, and the ownerâs coverage will take care of the rest. We often see this situation happen with condos and townhouses.Depending on the insurance company, this will cost an owner anywhere from $100 to $300 and a tenant anywhere from $100 to $200. Itâs a minimal cost, and we require it of both our tenants before they move in and our owners before they have a tenant reside in their unit.If you have any questions about this topic, please feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you!",

Here are all the things we do for owners to help them protect their investments.Find Out How Much Your Home Will Rent For in Todayâs Market Learn More About Guaranteed RentThis year has been great so far. Interest rates have gone up, so I commend those of you who have invested in property and chose us to help make your property more valuable. It was a smart move.A lot of people want to know about our owner fees and how we earn them when it comes to maintenance and finding tenants. We put a lot of work into these areas so that our owners and their investments are protected.Before we take over a property to manage, we first look at the appliances. If they need to be serviced, we take care of them. However, once the tenant gets in there, all bets on maintenance are off. People handle day-to-day living differently. Many times weâll see a disposal overload or toilet backup.âDOING THE HARD WORK UP FRONT ALLOWS US TO FIND GREAT TENANTS.âWhenever something goes wrong, our property manager will contact the owner to see how they want to handle the situation. If they have a friend or family member that can take care of the maintenance, we will go to them. If not, we have our in-house vendors that we have approved and worked with in the past. We wonât repair anything for you without your permission, however.Another area of our business where we are really strong is our marketing. We make sure to take pictures and video of our properties each time a tenant moves in or out. We also push our properties to the major websites like apartments.com, Trulia, Zillow, Craigslist, and more. Some of those sites have been very strong for us in finding good tenants.We do background checks, credit checks, and criminal checks on all potential tenants. We believe in doing the hard work up front because once itâs done, we can foresee and chase out all the bad prospects or tenants we may get.Once we have a tenant, we do a four- or six-month walkthrough to ensure proper maintenance in the home. If they have pets, itâs every four months. If they donât, itâs every six.In a nutshell, thatâs how we earn our fees. We think we are more than worth our price, and many of our owners can attest to that. If you have any questions for us or youâre looking to invest in property here in Hawaii, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.",

Even if you pick the most qualified tenant for your property, though, things can go wrong.For example, letâs say your tenant is in the military and they either get injured, have a medical discharge, or get divorced.

How does this work exactly?The Landlord-Tenant Code is very specific on the steps you are required to take when youâre going to evict someone from your property in civil court.As soon as we realize that the rents are going to be late, the first thing we do is post a five-daynotice to terminate the lease. We then take a picture of the five-day lease (which is usually posted on the front door) and submit that photo to civil court.  At the same time, we file for an eviction notice for the tenant to appear in court. That eviction notice to appear in court will normally take 14 to 21 days to get served.Once the eviction notice is served, we get a court date. As soon as the tenant is in court, the first question the judge will ask is, âDo you owe rent on this house and why have you not paid?â The tenants normally answer that question like this: âJudge, we do owe the money, but we have an explanation.âI will go to the court proceedings along with my property manager for the area. We will testify that the rents are not paid. In that case, we do not take any partial rents for you; if we did, then we couldnât file for an eviction.Once the eviction is granted, the judge will ask how many days I will give them to vacate your unit. We will show up on the agreed-upon day with a police officer to accompany them off the property. Once we show up, they have 120 minutes to vacate your home. After they are out, we change the locks, go in with cleaners, and start the re-up process to get your home back on the market.âWE WILL CHOOSE YOUR TENANT AND HANDLE ANY EVICTIONS AT NO CHARGE TO YOU.âRemember now, every time we move a tenant in and out of your home, we take new pictures and videos of your property. All of those pictures and videos are date-stamped just in case we end up in court.That is the eviction process. If you elect to use our eviction guarantee, we will choose your tenant for you. We will find a tenant with a credit score of at least 620, and we guarantee to pay for the eviction process. If you choose to select your own tenant and ignore the eviction guarantee, you will have to pay for me to go to court and evict your tenant.Ultimately, I recommend that you let us choose your tenant. We will look at their credit, criminal, and eviction history, and then check their references from past landlords.
