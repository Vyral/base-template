There is so much pent-up demand from buyers who have been in the marketplace for three to six months and havenât yet seen anything they like. Theyâre just waiting for something new to come on the market.âNow is the time to put your home on the market and take advantage of all this demand from buyers in the marketplace.âA couple weeks ago, we were in a situation where we put a nice 3-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom, colonial starter home with a one-car garage on the market at 9 a.m. on a Friday morning. We had seven requests for showings in just the first 24 hours! In the first 48 hours, we had six offers on the property. We ended up listing it for $329,000, and we ultimately put the property under contract for $350,000. We were able to create a multiple-offer situation that only benefited our seller.The pent-up demand stems from a number of different factors, but one of the main reasons for it is that thereâs been a real shortage of good inventory on the market. With interest rates holding as low as they have been, there are a lot of buyers who are looking to purchase homes right now.So again, now is the time to put your home on the market and take advantage of all this demand from buyers in the marketplace.So, if youâre thinking of selling your home and would like to get top dollar for it, reach out to me. Letâs set up an appointment for us to come down to your house so we can give you an honest, realistic estimate of what your home would sell for, and so we can generate a marketing plan and a time-frame that works for you. I hope to hear from you soon!",

        "content": "To get a visual understanding of all of what Branford, Connecticut, has to offer you, follow along in the video above.Branford is a vibrant shoreline community with about 20 miles of coastline and a dynamic downtown green. Downtown Brandford and the green is really a hub for people who want to hang out at coffee shops, try local foods, purchase flowers, and give patronage to the local businesses. Here, they can walk at the leisure to purchase a cup of coffee and relax on the town green.All that is located on just one side of the green. On the other side, you can find historic buildings like churches, the town hall, and the courthouse. In the summer, the green hosts jazz concerts and other activities. Thereâs just a really cool energy down here.Melanie, a visitor to Branford, says that she and her kids love to come to the town green where itâs safe to play, sit, and relax.Local resident and business owner Nicole says, âItâs really great! I always knew I wanted to open a business, and I knew I wanted it to be on the green because of the foot traffic. If youâre here in the summer, Iâd say you absolutely should visit the beaches, which are great for the kids.âIf youâre looking for something a bit more educational, the Blackstone Library is phenomenalâmy kids love it. The schools are great, and the Recreation Department has so many different programs to offer.ââEven though Branford is considered a beach community, itâs surprisinglyaffordable for first-time homebuyers.âWith just a short walk from the town green, you can reach Indian Neck, which has some great private residences and second homes within walking distance to a private beach.Branford is home to the Owenego Inn Beach &amp; Tennis Club, which was once a popular resort in the early 1900s and is now a popular beach destination for weddings and other events.Just around the corner is Lennyâs restaurant. Overlooking a beautiful marsh setting, itâs very popular with the locals, and people drive from all over to try the steamers and other fresh seafood. You can sit out on the back deck and enjoy both the scenery and their jazz nights, which take place every Thursday.Branford has also jumped on the brewery scene. The Stoney Creek Brewery is right around the corner from the town green; they have a beautiful indoor tasting area, and the brewery is right on an ocean setting. You could sit outside and have a couple of beers while enjoying the view, or even host an office party.Even though Branford is considered a beach community, itâs surprisinglyaffordable for first-time homebuyers. There are many options for condos and single-family homes under $300,000, depending on where youâre looking and the size of the homes. Upgrade buyers looking for a 4-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom with a master bedroom suite will also find an affordable array of choices. Additionally, Branford is in one of the lowest tax brackets compared to the surrounding communities. This fantastic bedroom community is about 10 or 15 minutes from downtown New Haven, and has an accessible train line that leads into Metro North and New York City.If you have any questions about Branfordâs real estate market or other general questions, please reach out to me. I would be happy to speak with you and provide even more reasons to look into this gorgeous community.",

        "content": "Welcome to my town of Wallingford, Connecticut.Since I grew up here, Wallingford is very special to me. Iâm raising a family here, my business is here, and I also think that itâs one of the best-kept secrets in all of Connecticut.I have never been in a community that comes together more than Wallingford does. Weâre probably the largest non-metropolitan chamber in the state, and thatâs because of the businesses and people who live here.Itâs an aesthetically beautiful town. With the historic architecture here, walking around the center of Wallingford is like walking in the park. I believe we have better restaurants in such a close proximity than any other surrounding town.We have a surprising amount of open and rural space available. Yes, we have many thriving shops and restaurants in the downtown area, but when you go to the outskirts of Wallingford, we have so many things: vineyards, open country, hiking trails, and trout fishing stocked by the state of Connecticut.The public school system of Wallingford is fabulous; we have a great superintendent, and theyâre constantly coming up with fresh ideas and bringing the latest, cutting-edge classes to our town.âWelcome to my town of Wallingford, Connecticut.âA little-known fact about Wallingford: We have one of the most prestigious private high schools in whole country, called Choate Rosemary Hall. Itâs larger than most college campuses, and a lot of famous public figures, actors, and past presidents have attended this school.Another draw to our town is our 69,000 square foot public library. You havenât seen a public library and the resources they offer until youâve stepped foot in the Wallingford Public Library.Weâre also drawing in a lot of new businesses, down to mom-and-pop sandwich shops like The Eatery; independent bakeries like Allyssaâs Cakery; and we even have brew houses like Front Porch Brewery, Cliffside Brewing, and the New England Cider Company.Wallingford has not one, but two vineyards: the rolling, 120-acre Gouveia Vineyards, and the smaller Paradise Hills vineyard. Theyâre both unique in their own right, and theyâre even within walking distance of each other.Wallingford is conveniently located Â between New Haven and Hartford. If youâre a professional whose job takes you all over the place, you can get anywhere in the state from our town within 20 minutes, thanks to our brand-new train station with a high-speed line to Hartford, Springfield, and Boston.Thereâs a wide variety of housing for everybody here, from antique homes built in 1776 to large mansions up on Turnberry Road that overlook the vineyard. We have excellent affordability, even for first-time homebuyers, upgrade buyers, and new construction buyers. People are constantly surprised by how much home they can get for their money, compared with surrounding towns.Thank you for taking the time to tour our town. If you have any questions about Wallingford, please reach out to me. Iâd love to discuss what my hometown has to offer.",

        "content": "Today I wanted to give you an update on how the market is doing, and what that means for you as a seller.Today I wanted to talk about how the market is doing, especially here in New Haven and around Wallingford.The median list price in the Wallingford is around $299,900. The demand is actually increasing and the days on the market for properties are trending downward, so weâre actually seeing a lot more multiple offer situations on a lot of these properties, which is great for sellers. The market action index for Wallingford is around 36.2, which is incredible because about six months ago, it was under 30.âWEâRE SEEING A LOT MORE MULTIPLE-OFFER SITUATIONS, WHICH IS GREAT FOR SELLERS.âThe market action index tells us how the market is doing by measuring whatâs for sale versus whatâs actually selling. Any market action index below a 30 implies a buyerâs advantage. Any index of a 30 or above implies a sellerâs advantage.So todayâs value of 36.2 means a sellerâs advantage, and itâs actually trending upward. What that means is if youâre thinking about selling your home, now is the time to put it on the market. There is high demand in Wallingford, New Haven, and Fairfield counties. In most of Connecticut, there is a high demand for homes. Yes, there is a lot of inventory, but there arenât a lot of good homes for sale. Good homes tend to sell a lot quicker.If youâre thinking about selling your home, give us a call and let us come down to take a look at your home. Weâll give you an honest, real estimate of what your home is worth.

Thereâs a way you can ensure your home doesnât suffer the same fate.If youâre a home seller, marketing and positioning your property online in todayâs marketplace is critical.Nobody knows better what buyers are looking for than the buyers themselves. They usually know whether a home is right for them within the first few minutes or even the first 30 to 60 seconds after walking in the front door. The problem is getting them excited enough to actually come see your property in person. If you canât get them to commit to physically seeing your property, theyâll never have a chance fall in love with it.One of the problems weâve been experiencing in the marketplace is gorgeous properties being marketed and positioned all wrong. There are buyers in the marketplace whom these properties are perfect for, but these buyers overlook these properties because of the quality of their photos or videos or they lack professional photography and/or videos altogether.âTHEREâS NEVER BEEN A BETTER TIME TO MARKET YOUR HOME ONLINE.âThere has never been a better time to market your home online, and we can help you do it the right way.

Thatâs not what we do, as Danny points out.âWhen you call that number, I think itâs Jonathanâs cell phone. The first time I called it, he answered the phone. To me, that means a lot.

        "title": "Why HUD Homes Are Hidden Gems in Our Market",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "HUD homes are a great option for buyers. Hereâs why.I know, I sound like a broken record talking about HUD homes. Youâre probably sick of me talking about them, but listen. The reason Iâm continuing to discuss these homes is because I want to get some of you off the fence by seeing the incredible value here.Just this morning, a three bedroom, one bathroom home came on the market in Wallingford. Itâs a 3-bedroom, one-bathroom, and a one-car garage home on a half-acre lot. This home is currently listed for sale at $149,000. Itâs available to owner-occupants first, meaning that if you plan on living in the property, you get the first shot at it.Hereâs the other great news about this HUD home in particular. Itâs marked as insurable. That means is that HUD will sell this property to someone who is going for an FHA mortgage and insure it for only a 3.5% down payment.If youâre a first-time buyer, you would have to be crazy not to consider jumping on these homes. Yes, they might need a paint job or new flooring, but the bones are all there. If an HUD home is marked as insurable, that means the electric, plumbing, and furnace all work, so you donât have to worry about replacing them, unless you find something different at your inspection.âAN INSURED HUD HOME IS IDEAL.âAnother great thing about HUD homes is that you can inspect them. A lot of people think they canât, but theyâre wrong. Itâs true that you do have to buy these properties as-is, but an inspection can be a very useful tool in deciding whether youâre making the right decision. If you have an inspection done and find something wrong with the home you didnât know about before, you have two options. You can either make the decision to go through with the purchase or you can back out of the deal, get your deposit back, and go buy something else.Iâm oversimplifying the process, but the truth is that it is simple for me because Iâve sold and purchased so many of them. Iâve sold and bid on hundreds of HUD homes. If you have any questions about them whatsoever or would like more details about what the process is like, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. We look forward to hearing from you!",

This January has been the busiest start to a new year that weâve seen in awhile, and it looks like the spring market will be extremely busy, too.Here is your market update for Wallingford and New Haven County:The median list price is at $299,900. That is the median list price, not the median sales price. Inventory has been tightening and days on market are decreasing, which is great news for sellers.Personally, Iâve noticed that January of 2017 has been the busiest start to a new year that weâve seen in three years. If thatâs any indication of how the spring market is going to be, things are looking good.âIT LOOKS LIKE THE SPRING MARKET WILL BE AN EXTREMELY BUSY ONE!âIf you are looking to upgrade from your first home, now is one of the best times to do so. You will get the most house for your money because of these low interest rates. Rates are expected to rise as the year goes on, so the sooner you can buy, the better. Remember, as interest rates go up, your buying power goes down.One of the other things I want to point out is the market action index. The market action index tells us how the market is doing by measuring whatâs for sale versus whatâs actually selling. Anything 30 or below means that the buyer has an advantage in the market, while anything over 30 means that sellers have the advantage. Right now, the market action index is at 29.1, so the market is fairly balanced.

        "content": "We recently took a vacant home and had it professionally staged before it hit the market. Today, I wanted to introduce you to Jennifer Napolitano with Design House Interiors, the company that staged the property.Jennifer is a certified home stager. She knows that selling a home can sometimes be very daunting. When people come into your home, they might not know where to put their furniture or how itâs going to look, which makes things very stressful for the buyers as well. Certain layouts and rooms can be difficult to stage, but home stagers are here to help you figure it out.For example, keep in mind that scale is very important. You need the right-sized pieces in each room so that the rooms appear bigger and functional. Having the right furniture in each space also shows buyers the traffic patterns in the home.When you work with Design House Interiors, you also get the benefit of working with professional interior designers. Jennifer and her team can help you make your home look great by choosing fresh, trendy pieces to make your home pop. Your home will be showroom-ready when it hits the real estate market.This particular house had an island in the kitchen, and it is a nice-looking piece of furniture that stands out. When you are working with the bedrooms, it can be difficult to figure out where to put the bed because the bed is the focal point of the room. It needs to make a statement and look beautiful.For this house, Jennifer and her team decided to put the bed a little off-center on the wall. Itâs a great focal point and the buyer can still see that there is plenty of room to add a dresser and still walk around the space.They also created an easy flow in the dining room by using a circular dining room table. As you can see in the video above, home staging is an absolute must to help buyers figure out how they can best utilize the space for their family.âYOUR HOME WILL BE SHOWROOM-READY WHEN IT HITS THE MARKET.âThis home sold three days after it hit the market, so I want to say a huge thank you to Design House Interiors. If you need to stage your home or if you have any questions about interior design, visit their website at designhousect.com or visit their showroom at 6 North Main Street in Wallingford.As always, if you have any real estate questions, please donât hesitate to reach out to me.
