        "category": "",
        "content": "Be sure to avoid these three pitfalls created when you overprice your home.Â Why is it a bad idea to overprice your home when you put it on the market?First, remember that people who browse for homes online can see how long a home has been on the market. When a home is overpriced, it tends to stagnate on the market, and when buyers see that, theyâll probably think that somethingâs wrong with it.Another danger of overpricing your home is getting burnt out. The longer your home is on the market, the more worn down youâll get having to clean your house at a momentâs notice to prepare for a showingâespecially if you have kids and/or pets. Your hopes may get high that each buyer who visits will be the last, but if theyâre aware that your home is overpriced, you might be in for a disappointment.âChances are you wonât be able to fool the buyer about the value of your home.âLastly, itâs worth noting that buyers today have more information at their fingertips than they ever have before. Theyâre both astute and diligent about comparing homes to others theyâve seen in the market. Â Even if they donât have the exact data on your home, they do think about the general cleanliness of the home, what upgrades it has, and what features it has compared to homes that are priced lower than yours. Chances are you wonât be able to fool the buyer about the value of your home.If you have any questions about this topic or real estate in general, reach out to your Colemere Realty specialists.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today, we&rsquo;ll discuss why a home inspection is vitally important to those buying a home.Â What makes an inspection such a necessary part of the real estate transaction for homebuyers?Once you go under contract for the purchase of a home, included in your agreement is a timetable for any due diligence youâd like to conduct. Consider this your opportunity to inspect the property to the fullest extent.When you hire a home inspector, theyâll come with a checklist of items, and theyâll examine those items to ensure sufficient functionality of each.As an aside, you may get swept up in all the excitement of going under contract on your new home, only to have an inspector identify some issues. Thatâs why itâs so important to have a professional inspector come inâtheir preset checklist will be comprised of around 300 items, and theyâll document every problem area they uncover in a thorough fashion. This way, youâre not surprised by the actual condition of the home.âThe inspection is instrumental in letting you know the exact condition of the home and about anything you werenât aware of beforehand.âWith a checklist of this length, an inspector is bound to find flaws or areas that need servicing in the home. Weâve even seen cases where inspectors have found issues in new construction properties.If and when issues arise out of the inspection, as the buyer, youâll need to identify the biggest concerns and ask yourself: If any issues were to go unaddressed, how would it impede my ability to move forward smoothly? From there, youâll essentially renegotiate with the seller to either make those repairs or give you a credit toward the repairs.All in all, the inspection is instrumental in letting you know the exact condition of the home and about anything you werenât aware of beforehand, so youâll be comfortable with what youâre getting into.If you have any questions about todayâs topic or anything else real estate-related, please feel free to reach out to your Colemere Realty specialist.

Here are some of the options you have.Â We get this question a lot: Are there opportunities to buy a home with low or no money down?Various news outlets have claimed that you need a 20% down payment in order to purchase a home, but itâs not trueâyou can certainly buy a home with zero down.There are several loan programs out there, such as the Utah Housing Corporation loan or the USDA loan, that help you buy with either nothing down or a very low amount.

Weâre still in a healthy, strong sellerâs market.Right now, the median price in the single-family home market is up to $355,000 and weâre seeing an appreciation rate of around 8%.âWeâre still in a healthy, strong sellerâs market.âWhat economic factors have led to this? One of them is a bit of a slowdown in terms of job growth. At the same time, weâre not seeing as many people move to the state of Utah, and wage growth isnât necessarily keeping up with how fast real estate is evolving. A wage increase is not expected this year, but itâs something weâd really like to see.What does this mean to you? Well, if youâre thinking about buying or selling this spring, you might want to jump in early and get ahead of the summer rush. If you get in now while prices are still high, inventory is still extremely low, and the rush has yet to enter the fray, you could stand to get a better deal.If you have any questions for us about real estate in the meantime, donât hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

If youâre looking to make some extra money through real estate investing or youâd like to have additional family members (such as in-laws) live on your property, ADUs are a great option.However, today we want to remind you that there are different types of legislation being considered for different cities regarding ADUs, so itâs important that you check with your local municipality before deciding to rent one.The reason we mention this is because companies that specialize in ADUs, such as Airbnb and VRBO, were market disruptors when they first came on the scene. They gave homeowners a platform to rent their ADUs, and as more and more started doing it, state and city governments became concerned that a surplus of ADUs would become a potential neighborhood nuisance. They donât want streets to become overcrowded with cars or households with ADUs to become disruptive, so they stepped in and established some ground rules for renting them.âThere are a lot of great opportunities to be had with ADUs, but you need to make sure that you follow these rules before adding one to your property.âThere are a lot of great opportunities to be had with ADUs, but you need to make sure that you follow these rules before adding one to your property.

Here are a few reasons why that is:1. Interest rates are on the rise. Increased interest rates will negatively affect a buyerâs purchasing power, meaning they wonât be able to afford the same amount of home if they wait until spring to buy.2. Less competition. Because there are fewer buyers in the market during the fall and winter, there is less competition for the ones who are looking during that time. The spring market is a prime season for multiple-offer situations and bidding wars, meaning youâll have to work that much harder for sellers to accept your offer over another buyerâs.âThe spring market is a prime season for multiple-offer situations and bidding wars, meaning youâll have to work that much harder for sellers to accept your offer over another buyerâs.âThe main question you need to ask yourself is whether or not youâre ready to buy a home. Are you qualified? Are you comfortable moving forward with a transaction right now? Are you in a position where it will be feasible to move? If your answers to these questions are yes, then why wait?Yes, people donât typically want to move while itâs cold or while thereâs snow on the ground, but the reality is that, if you prepare for it properly, moving will only take a half a dayâso there shouldnât be much of a barrier.And to be honest, this is our favorite time of year to show homes.

The Fed will take this into consideration when they increase interest rates, which subsequently affects our housing market and available opportunities for homebuyers and sellers.As rates rise, buyers canât qualify for the same homes they previously could. For sellers, this makes it important to sell homes quickly.

But, as the name of todayâs update implies, this only tells half of the story of todayâs market.Unlike their lower-priced counterparts, homes listed above $400,000 have actually been spending longer on the market and seeing lower offers than in the recent past.So what do these two tales of our market mean for sellers?âThe things that are happening in the market on a broad scale donât tell the whole story.âWell, while those with homes in lower price ranges will have an easier time achieving selling success, those listing their home at or above the $400,000 will need to exert a little more effort.For those listed in these less active upper price ranges, staging will be key. You will need to present your home in the best possible light to attract buyer interest and earn the best possible deal.With this in mind, todayâs buyers will also need to strategize according to the price point theyâre searching in. Those looking in lower price ranges, where homes are moving more quickly, shouldnât be afraid to get a little aggressive with their offers. Donât forget to include favorable terms. Price is not the only component to consider when making an offer on a home.Ultimately, buyers and sellers alike should be mindful of how market conditions will impact their success.

Having too many contingencies with the appraisal, the inspection, or anything else will do the same thing.What can speed up the process?

We are nowhere near historic lows in terms of affordability, though we will continue to see the affordability rate drop from about 15% to 20% by yearâs end.So, what does this mean to you? If you are a seller, now is the time to prepare your home and get it on the market.âThe affordability index is a number which is measured by mortgage interest rates and pricing.âIf you are a buyer who is ready to buy, why wait any longer? There should not be any excuse because waiting until next year hoping that prices come down will be a disappointment. Prices will not come down because of the market. Now is the best time.The key is to reach out to us right away if you would like to discuss your buying and selling plans. We would love to help you succeed.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

No matter what you choose, youâre paying a mortgage.Some people are scared of the word âmortgageâ because of the commitment. Even if you donât technically have one, youâre paying for one if youâre renting. Youâre actually paying more than a mortgage would cost and making your landlord money in the process.Renting does have some benefits, but only as a temporary solution. The goal should be to own the roof over your own head. If you donât, youâre just paying for somebody else to own the roof over your head.âRenting has benefits, but itâs only a temporary solution.âThose that own homes tend to have a much higher net worth than those who donât. A mortgage also gives you a fixed rate that you can use to predict what your payments will be now and in the future. The price and payment stay fixed in this case. If youâre renting, youâre at the mercy of the market and the landlordâs decision.

        "content": "Should you keep saving to purchase a home, or should you buy a home now?Â This is a great question, and it all comes down to how much you are saving and whether your savings are outpacing the rate at which the market is appreciating. For example, if youâre saving $1,000 a month and the market is appreciating at $500 a month, it makes sense to save your money to buy a house.Â Unfortunately, our market is growing at a faster rate than most people are able to save right now.Â In our last video, we mentioned that appreciation is going to be anywhere from 6% to 8% in 2018, so keep that in mind.Â If weâre at a pace of 6% appreciation and youâre not able to keep up with your savings, itâs probably wise to buy a home sooner rather than later. That way, youâll end up ahead.Â You should also keep an eye on interest rates. Weâre in an environment where they have been talking about raising interest rates for a long time, and they are starting to do that now. As rates go up, a buyerâs purchasing power is going to be greatly limited.Â âInterest rates are the single greatest factor that can influence your monthly payment.âFor every 1% increase in interest rates, your mortgage payment goes up about $200. Interest rates are the single greatest factor that can influence a monthly payment.Â The good news is that there are some really favorable loan programs right now with low down payments or no down payment at all. In a market thatâs appreciating like ours, itâs a good idea to take advantage of some of these programs to buy a home. There are also some grant programs that provide money for down payments. So, there are some favorable options out there if you donât quite have the money you think you need.Â If you have any questions, please donât hesitate to reach out to us.

Certain price ranges are generating multiple offers for the listings that are out there, so sometimes an appraiser will enter the picture and disagree with the price that is listed on the contract. Â From a buyerâs perspective, the first thing to remember is that you always have the right to cancel the contract if the appraisal comes in low. This is the easy solution, but it doesnât get you the house.Typically when an appraisal comes in low, most people will try to renegotiate. This may mean that the buyer will have to come up with some extra funds or get rid of some closing costs that have been previously negotiated with the seller.Â Usually, there is an attempt by both parties to make it work out for everyone.Â âSometimes an appraiser will enter the picture and disagree with the price that is listed on the contract.âIf it was an FHA appraisal, then the appraisal stays with the property whether the deal works out or not.Â During the process of renegotiating, itâs important that everyone pays attention to the contract deadline. Buyers especially need to realize that you must negotiate within this deadline if you want to get your earnest money back in the event the deal falls through. If you negotiate outside of the deadlines, the earnest money can be lost.Â If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

We want to share our forecast with you today.Â Since the real estate market was strong in Â 2017 and we expect it to continue to be strong in 2018, interest rates should go up. The Fed will probably raise interest rates two or three times in 2018.Â According to what we saw in 2017, you can expect more low inventory in 2018. We will continue in a strong sellerâs market because of strong buyer demand.Â As we continue to add more people to the Wasatch Front through job growth or people having children, we are going to continue to see strong demand going forward, which will also cause prices to continue to go up. Â If you plan on selling your home, you want to make sure that you justify your pricing, even if you are in a strong sellerâs market. Reach out to a real estate professional like us. We can definitely help you with pricing.Â âStrong demand will cause prices to go up in 2018.âWhen you sell your home, chances are your buyer will use financing to purchase the house. That means you are selling your house twice, once to the buyer and once to the appraiser. The home has to appraise, or else nobody wins.Â If you are a first-time buyer in the $200,000 to $300,000 price range, itâs especially important that you are prepared to be very competitive with your offer. You need to be able to move fast. We have a number of different tips that you can help you succeed in this market.Â This is a general forecast for our local real estate market.

This shows that prices are going up. It is important to keep in mind that price per square foot isnât the best way to measure value, but it is an indicator of where values are going.Â We are also seeing what youâd expect when prices per square foot go upâthe median sales price is also up from $268,000 to $299,000.âThe rising price per square foot indicates that home values are on the rise.âInventory remains low, especially in lower price ranges. We see inventories of two months or fewer across the board. When you have lower inventory like weâve seen, it will also reduce the days on market. On average in 2017, the days on market was 20 days. This will vary a bit based on the price point of the home or where itâs located.This is just a snapshot of what we observed over the past year.

Today, we want to go over some of the biggest mistakes people can make when selling their homes.First off is asking too much money for your property. Even in a sellerâs market, this can be a mistake people make.Our market is experiencing a slight shift, so overpricing can become very frustrating for everyone involved in the transaction. Listing your home too high will only lead to price reduction after price reduction.The next mistake sellers commonly make is advertising too little. There tends to be an assumption that just because youâve hired a Realtor, youâre in the clear.âPutting your home on the market and waiting isnât enough to successfully sell.âThe truth is that merely putting your home on the market and waiting isnât enough. You will need a detailed marketing strategy to expose your home to the most buyers possible.The last mistake weâd like to talk about is not preparing your home adequately for sale. Once a home is on the market, it is no longer just a place to live in. A home thatâs listed on the market needs to be ready at a momentâs notice for buyers to view it.

Donât just observe it when you visit the home. Check out what traffic is like during rush hour or after school.2. Pay attention to your daily commute.3. Know your neighborhood codes and restrictions. This is especially important in neighborhoods that have HOAs (homeowners associations).4. Donât overlook the bedroom/bathroom count. If you are looking at a 4-bedroom home, for example, make sure it doesnât have just one bathroom.5. Make note of any specialty inspections. We always recommend a general home inspection but depending on the home youâre looking at, you might want to order a radon inspection, a termite inspection, or a number of other specialty inspections.6. Pay attention to the things that canât be changed about the home. This includes the lot size, the location, and the floor layout.Â 7. Make note of the homeâs resale value. Sometimes buyers can get too excited and forget to pay attention to any barriers that would make the home harder to sell than normal.8. Is there room to grow into the home? This depends on your individual circumstances, obviously, but should be considered no matter what those circumstances are.âDonât buy a 4-bedroom home with one bathroom.âWe hope this list is helpful to you.

We totally understand thatâwe spent a lot of time in our careers as single agents, and we believe that a team is a valuable way to get out of the agent rat race.Â One of the myths itâs easy to talk yourself into if youâre a single agent is that you can do everything and skip paying for things like transaction coordination, communicating with title companies, and other services.Â When it comes to this myth and agent activities, single agents like to believe their time isnât worth what it should be worth. What they end up doing when they meet with a client who tries to beat them up over their commission is offer a discountâthey discount themselves, their service, and their fees. They then stay in the rat race by convincing themselves they only need to work harder and put more time in.Â âWe all only have 24 hours in a day.âThe reality is, we all only have 24 hours in a day. As much as some of us want to think weâre Superman, there is not enough time in the day to increase business volume to what we think weâre capable of doing. This philosophy leads to agent burnout.Â You can spend your time scurrying around, putting up signs, and hanging lock boxes if you want. On a team, though, you have someone else doing those jobs so you can focus on writing purchase agreements, getting contracts signed, and prospecting.Â You can work hard and be effective as a single agent, but you will cap out at a certain volume because you donât have enough time in the day to do it all.Â If you have any questions about our team or are interested in attending some of our training sessions, donât hesitate to contact us.

There are, however, three items you must take into consideration first.Â   The location and zoning of the property: Some cities are disallowing short-term rentals, so you want to make sure the city youâre considering purchasing your Airbnb rental in will support that.Â   Hiring a management company to manage the property: With nightly rentals, there will be a lot of turnover with people going in and out, and many potential issues could arise from day to day. We recommend hiring a third-party management company to handle the essential maintenance tasks so that doesnât become a full-time job for you.  Having an exit strategy in place: Specifically, there are two strategies we want to mention. First, make sure that if short-term rentals become unavailable, the property can still generate cash flow in a long-term rental scenario. Second, if the property doesnât work out and you need to sell quickly, make sure you buy into an area with enough appreciation that you wonât lose money during that quick sale.Â âHire a management company so maintaining your Airbnb property doesnât become a full-time job.âIf you have any questions about investing in real estate, please donât hesitate to give us a call.

        "content": "Inventory has been shrinking recently and a lot of buyers are turning to building new homes instead.When buyers do this, though, they need to ensure they are being well-represented.Â Today, weâd like to share three reasons why that is.Â First of all, when a buyer enters a model home the agent they are greeted by is actually representing the builder. This agent is focused on the builderâs money and best interest as opposed to the buyerâs. Â While they are usually very friendly and donât mean ill will toward the buyer, it is important to be represented nonetheless.Â Next, buyers should remember that many builders use their own purchase agreement. Weâve personally seen these contracts and know that they can be upwards of 30 to 40 pages long.Â âItâs nice to have someone around who is familiar with the ins and outs of the process.âSo having someone who is representing you available to read and interpret these kinds of documents will be very important to the process and your understanding of it.Finally, the purchase of a home is an emotional decision. All else aside, a home is somewhere you are going to put down roots, make memories, and spend time with your family. It can be hard to separate yourself from this emotion, so having someone who will be able to help you do so is greatly helpful.Â Ultimately itâs nice to have someone around who is familiar with the ins and outs of the process and can help you make the many decisions associated with homeownership.If youâd like more information or have any other questions feel free to get in touch by giving us a call or sending an email.

These can get tricky, but we have been able to find consistent success in getting buyers the home they want while competing against other buyers who want the same home. We are here to share some of our best tips with you today.Â The first important thing is to make sure your agent tells the sellers your story. Striking an emotional chord with a seller will go a long way when it comes time for them to accept an offer. A lot of sellers are interested in the buyer who will live in their home next. You want your agent to present your case to the sellers as strongly as possible.Â âMake sure the seller knows your story.âÂ We recently had a buyer who was a nurse at a local hospital and ended up getting her offer accepted because of the sellerâs connection to the nurses at that hospital. Making sure the deadlines on the offer are nice and tight is another good strategy.Â Finally, you need to have a solid pre-qualification letter from a lender that your agent has a relationship with. If they have closed many transactions with that lender, you can rest assured that you wonât be led astray.Â Â If you have any questions for us about real estate or you know anyone who is interested in buying or selling a home, feel free to give us a call or send us an email anytime.

The 1031 can be a little tricky, but there are some basic rules to follow:Â Â First of all, once you close on the property that youâre using the 1031 on, you have 45 days to identify three properties of interest. From there, you have 180 days to close one one of those properties. You can also close on multiple properties.Â Â In the meantime, you canât have any boot. That means you cannot take any money from the sale and put it in your pocket or else you will be taxed on that.âRemember, third parties are necessary.âÂ The last thing to keep in mind is that third parties are necessary. You need to use a third-party intermediary to handle the exchange on your behalf. Remember, you cannot touch the money from the sale of the property going into the exchanged property. That has to be handled by a third-party intermediary.Â Â We have great resources to help you find that third-party and we can answer any other questions you might have about the 1031 exchange.

Next, you have to evaluate that property, and there are three important factors to take into consideration.The first is location. Weâve all heard the saying âlocation, location, location,â and it certainly applies to real estate investment as well. For example, a busy road can be a positive thing when it comes to real estate investment. Whether the property in question is located in an affluent area or one with a high crime rate is an example of the risk versus reward issue you must deal with when considering the location of your investment property.This leads us to the second thing you must factor in: the age and condition of the property. We always advise people in this situation to order a home inspection. From that report, youâll be able to determine what repairs are needed. This can also be a huge negotiating point for driving the price of the property down. You also need to consider the long-term objective of the property. Will the roof need to be replaced in five years? How are the water heater and the furnace?âThe numbers in investment real estate are critical.âThe last thing you want to factor in is how to run the numbers. The numbers in investment real estate are critical. This means things like the analysis of cash on cash, your return on investment, and the cap rate analysis.

Most people buy them for one of four different reasons:  They want an additional monthly cash flow.  They want to buy a property in a very strong area thatâs appreciating in value.  They need a tax shelter for their income.  They need something to do with their time and want one as a hobby.Second, remember that becoming a landlord is a business, not a charity.Make sure youâre using the proper contracts and youâre following them.

You are already under contract, things are rolling along, and suddenly, everything stops because the appraisal didnât meet the purchase price.Â If the home does not appraise, the home will not be able to be sold for the agreed upon purchase price. This is bad news for both the buyer and the seller. However, there are a few things you can do to make it to the closing table:Â First, the buyer can come up with the money to meet the appraisal price. Most buyers donât want to do that. However, we are in a hot sellerâs market right now, and many homes are drawing multiple offers. As a buyer, you might just have to bite the bullet and come up with the money.Â âWe are in a sellerâs market, so buyers may just have to come up with the extra cash.âThe other option is for the seller to come down a bit on the asking price. Again, in this market, that is unlikely.Â The third option is to renegotiate the terms of the contract. As a buyer, go to the lender and see if there is any room for adjustment in the interest rate. If the seller is paying for the closing costs, offer to cover them yourself.

If you have an elaborate chandelier made of glass or deer antlers, replace it with something neutral while youâre in the process of selling.  Textured surfaces. Whether itâs your walls, ceilings, or other surfaces, buyers donât tend to care much for them.  Using the wrong flooring. Replacing your flooring with the cheapest option might actually hurt your value more than it will help it.Â   Too much carpet. Carpeted bedrooms and living areas are normal- carpeted bathrooms and kitchens are not. Most buyers want hardwood or tile floors in those areas.  Bold wall colors may turn buyers off. When in doubt, go neutral with your wall colors.  Pools and hot tubs donât add much value. While they may add value to you while you are living there, most buyers donât necessarily want to take on the cost of owning and maintaining these items and continuing to pay for them.âFollow this advice, and your home will be much more attractive to potential buyers.
