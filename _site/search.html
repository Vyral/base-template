With all of the different options and information, how do you know what to implement into your business? Today, I have three key takeaways to make your next real estate conference successful.  Go to the conference with one thing in mind. You can go in there with many ideas, but focusing on one thing will allow you to get more out of the conference.âGo to the conference with one thing in mind.â      Network smart. Youâll meet many people, and receive many business cards. Year after year, Iâve had to hand off a stack of business cards to my staff, as I didnât have the capacity to follow up. Iâve learned to add people to social media immediately after meeting them, so that we can stay in touch.        Ask yourself these three questions. Before you leave the real estate conference, there are three major questions you need to ask yourself. What is one thing you plan to implement in the next 48 hours? What is one thing you plan to implement in the next two weeks? What is one thing you plan to implement in the next month?  Thinking about these three things at your next real estate conference will allow you to get the most you can from the money youâre investing in your real estate career. If you have any other questions or are interested in furthering your real estate career, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Today, weâre going to discuss my journey from car sales to real estate.When I graduated from George Mason University, I needed a job. At the time, I had a friend in car sales that encouraged me to get into the business. I was definitely hesitant at first, but after I found out how much money I could make, I happily took the interview. The very next day I interviewed, and by the end of the week, I was selling cars!There are many things I learned during my experience as a car salesman, one if which is a dedicated work ethic. If youâre in sales, you already know that you need to dedicate yourself to the customer. This means long days and long nights, no matter what the weather outside may look like. I also learned to swallow my pride. After earning a four-year degree, thereâs a bit of a stigma selling used cars. I used the opportunity to work out my self-confidence.âThere are many things I learned during my experience as a car salesman, one if which is a dedicated work ethic.âI was in car sales for two years and did really well. After speaking with my accountant and my father, I decided to buy a house. The next time my dad came up to visit, we went to a couple of open houses, where I connected with a Realtor. Long story short, she stood me up. As you can imagine, I wasnât very happy. In fact, I took it as a sign to not buy property at all. The very next customer I had at the car dealership was another real estate agent, and thatâs when I knew it was time to buy my first home.Two months later, I was buying a house and taking real estate classes. I knew that if I had issues buying a home, that there were other people in my situation too. Thatâs when I made the decision to get into real estate.Itâs been 17 years since Iâve entered real estate, but there are a few things from my time as a car salesman that I will never forget:Your friends will travel with you. There are so many people that Iâve sold both cars and houses to, and there are many people I still have wonderful relationships with.Your database is extremely important. There are so many people in your life who will follow you into the next steps of your career.Work ethic is important. When youâre selling someone a car, you really need to understand what they need. That lesson also goes for real estate. You canât sell someone what you think is best for them, but what is actually best for them in the long run. Sometimes those conversations are easy, and sometimes they are difficult.Thatâs my journey from car sales to real estate. If you have any other questions or are interested in furthering your real estate career, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "I hear this question at least a few different times per week: âI want to get into real estate. What should I do?â My initial response is to think about the question a little more and then get back to me. However, I want to answer the question once and for all today.There are two ways to âget intoâ the real estate business. The first is real estate sales. Thatâs what we do here every day on the AJ Team. We take clients out, help them find properties, and ultimately, our job is to sell.&lt;a href=âhttps://twitter.com/home/?status=âMost of the time, people arenât talking about getting into the sales business.â%20http://localhost:4000/how-to-choose-the-correct-path-in-real-estate.html%20via%40â target=â_blankâ class=âpullquoteâ&gt;ââMost of the time, people arenât talking about getting into the sales business.ââ&lt;/a&gt;Think of the highest pressure sales job you could ever think of, then add a layer of emotions on top, and multiply it by the fact that Northern Virginia is one of the craziest markets here in the U.S. Iâd say that 99% of time when people say they want to get into real estate, this is not what they are talking about.What most people are talking about when they say they want to get into real estate is actually real estate investing. Thatâs the other side of the ledger. Investors take their money, put it into properties, and watch it grow over time. Traditionally, this is the way that most people are looking to âget intoâ the real estate business.If you want to get into real estate, start to think about which side you want to be on. When youâve decided, we can help you get closer to achieving your goals by offering you advice and/or assistance. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

I didn&rsquo;t intentionally plan on naming this video after the soap opera, but the market is shifting and I need all of you to be prepared for it. We&rsquo;ve been discussing the market shift for the last two years now, but I&rsquo;m starting to have more difficult conversations with sellers about what to do with their property. In some situations, they have to reduce the price, selling at less than what their neighbors sold for a year ago. There a lot of tough decisions that sellers have to make right now. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tÂ \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"There a lot of tough decisions that sellers have to make right now.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;m going to take you through a situation that happened to me personally. Remember, there \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis a big difference between being able to sympathize and empathize. This is one situation in which \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI can truly empathize with sellers that are perhaps a bit worried about selling their property.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn 2005, I bought a property at the top of the market for $323,000. I held onto that property as an\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t investment property for 11 years. At the end of 2016, I ended up having to sell the property for only \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$230,000. Having to write a check for $95,000 wasn&rsquo;t the easiest thing to do, but it was what I chose to do with the remaining money that made a huge difference.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor my property to get back to its original purchase price, it would take two full market cycles. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThat&rsquo;s well over 11 years. I starting thinking about where to put the money instead. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter a conversation with my financial advisor, I decided to pull my chips off the table and relocate \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthem into something that would give me a higher return.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI often have this very same conversation with our sellers.

We went back and forth and got to the point where we were about to accept the offer when another one came on the table.This second offer wasnât necessarily as high as the one we already accepted, but we wanted to make sure that we continued to pay attention to it.So, we almost got to the end of negotiations with the original buyer when they suddenly got flaky. This buyer ultimately bailed on the transaction for whatever reason.An experienced listing agent is taught to negotiate through the deal. My communication with the new offer was consistent and crystal clear. I continued to call them and treat them like they were the beeâs knees so they felt like their offer was the only offer.Had I not done that, our seller would have had to go back on the market and we would have had to find someone else to buy the house.âMy communication with the second buyer got the seller more money in the end.âNot only that, the second offer ended up netting the seller more than the original offer because I continued to negotiate with them.When you hire someone to sell your property, these are the small things that an experienced listing agent should be doing.

Ultimately, you need someone who understands how to negotiate and will put you in a position where you can win.If you are thinking of selling your home or if you have any other questions, just give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "Itâs time for me to tell you the tale of two home inspections.We had a property on the market in Fairfax where the original buyer backed out. The buyer claimed they backed out due to the home inspection, but I know this wasnât the case. The simple truth is that they got cold feet.Only a matter of days later, another buyer came to the property and went under contract. This buyer ordered a home inspection, which gave us the opportunity to see two different inspections on the exact same property within about a five-day period.This is where things got interesting. The two home inspections were both done by professionals, but ended up being completely different. Because they found completely different things to fix within the home, the buyers asked for completely different things following their respective inspections.Itâs because of scenarios like these that we encourage our sellers to negotiate a credit instead of fixing specific items. This just makes more sense, since the likelihood of two home inspections being exactly the same is slim to none.Iâve seen this kind of situation many times in our business. If you arenât careful, you may end up making fixes on home inspection items for a buyer who will ultimately back out, only to be asked about making completely different repairs from the next buyer.Understand that there will always be things within your home that you never noticed or cared about but that will be important to a buyer.Donât make any hasty repairs before you list. There are certain things you should definitely fix, but sometimes those things arenât what you might think. We can help you determine the right repairs, and help you move forward with your listing. The right repairs will make all the difference.Even if you arenât considering selling for another year, my team and I would still love to get in touch. The earlier you call, the more we can do to put you in the position to win.If you have any other questions or would like more information. Feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Online home valuations can give you an idea of what your homeâs worth, but you shouldnât price your home based on their calculations.When selling their home, most people nowadays do their own online research on websites like Zillow so they can get an estimated value of what their home is worth.Â Thatâs a dangerous thing to do, however, and I have some numbers to show you why. Below is a list of homes weâve sold in different areas this year and how wide the difference was between their Zillow Zestimates and their actual sold price:A Clifton property was sold for $610,000, while its Zestimate was $611,000âa $1,000 difference.A Lake Ridge property sold for $330,000, while its Zestimate was $386,000âa $56,000 difference.A Manassas home sold for $485,000, while its Zestimate was $564,000âan $80,000 difference.An Alexandria home sold for $735,000, while its Zestimate was $780,000âa $45,000 difference.A Woodbridge home sold for $360,000, while its Zestimate was $435,000âa $75,000 difference. Why is Zillow a dangerous place to calculate your homeâs value? Let me put it this wayâhas Zillow ever actually been into your house? Have you ever gone to Zillow and informed them about any of your homeâs updates?Â Of course not. Zillowâs Zestimate is based on an algorithm that gives sellers unrealistic expectations of what their home is worth.If youâre thinking about selling a home, give us a call so we can give it a thorough, accurate valuation and you donât leave money on the table once itâs sold.Â If you have any other questions about our market or determining your homeâs value, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

We want to make sure that wherever we are and whatever we do, we come from a standpoint of contribution to those around us.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAwhile back, we held a toy drive in the community and had such an amazing response that we ended up with more toys, school supplies, and other needed school items than we anticipated. I called Lori Williams, who is on our county school board, and asked her what school would benefit most from these items. I got the number of a local school, Featherstone Elementary, and called the principal to ask her if I could come drop off those items.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLater while I was there doing so, I asked her if there was anything else that we could do to help. She told me that they needed mentors, and from there we were able to build a fantastic mentoring program. We had a group of 5th graders that we met with regularly and taught them things they weren&rsquo;t learning in the classroom&mdash;including life skills like conflict resolution, how to tie a tie, how to shake someone&rsquo;s hand, and how to look a person in the eye.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"We taught them things they weren&rsquo;t learning in the classroom.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe really wanted to show these boys how to be cool young men, and give them a space where they could learn from college-educated business owners and other professionals about these life skills.&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe biggest challenge with this mentorship program was the time. We went there every Tuesday for the hour right after school, which cut right through the middle of the work day. We had a few instances where parents were unhappy that we were keeping them after school and confrontations would happen. It helped me remember that what we were doing there was showing the boys that there was a better way to handle situations just like that, which was a huge motivator in bringing us back every week.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;m grateful that I had the chance to serve my community in this way.

As you may recall, we&rsquo;ve already touched on this topic in two previous videos, which you can see here&nbsp;and here. Today, we&rsquo;re focusing on policy and tax changes.

Less regulation tends to be more favorable to real estate development. With this in mind, an overhaul of the Dodd-Frank Act has been a hot topic in the news, lately. It also remains to be seen whether the administration will alter FHA and private mortgage insurance or get rid of those things altogether.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe next thing to keep an eye on is lower capital gains. If President Trump lowers capital gains, how is that going to affect the investor market? Overall, I think you&rsquo;ll see a pause in our local market due to a lot of people waiting on the sidelines. How does this affect you? If you&rsquo;re a buyer, you want to buy during that pause because there will be more inventory and more opportunity for you to get a better deal.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you&rsquo;re a buyer, take advantage of the pause we&rsquo;re about to see.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPersonally, I&rsquo;m not in wait-and-see mode&mdash;I&rsquo;m in buy mode.

It has always been about local real estate. What happens here is very different than what happens in the Midwest. Our economy is greatly influenced by big government and government spending. Donald Trump has talked about spending more money on the department of defense. If he does that, it means the economy is going to benefit in our area. If those things come to fruition, expect local real estate to see a jump.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2. Foreign money. On the flip side, President-elect Trump talked about being tougher on immigration. There are a lot of immigrants here in the area and a lot of international money, too. If foreign investors start to get skittish, they won&rsquo;t be spending as much in the local economy and they may decide to make other investments instead.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThose are two important local real estate factors you should pay attention to.

        "content": "\t\t\t\t\t\tRealtors always talk about how interest rates affect home buyers. Today, however, we&rsquo;re going to focus on how interest rates affect your ability to sell a property.&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFirst of all, you need to know the 1%, 10% rule. If interest rates go up by 1%, home values go down by 10%. On the other hand, if interest rates go down 1%, home values will rise 10%.&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf interest rates go up by 1%, your home value will go down 10%\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRight now, interest rates are at 3.5%. If your home is currently worth $500,000 and rates go up to 4.5%, you will lose 10% off of your home value. In other words, your home value will go down by $50,000. Most people don&rsquo;t talk about the 1%, 10% rule for home sellers, but it&rsquo;s something you need to keep in mind if you are considering selling your home.&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\tÂ \t\t\t\t\t\tHere is a quick history lesson for you: in 2013, interest rates were at 4.5%. During 2008, the bottom of the market, interest rates were at 6%. Now, I don&rsquo;t think that rates will skyrocket and drastically impact the economy in the next 12 months. However, I do think that 3.5% interest rate will look very different at this time next year.&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\tÂ \t\t\t\t\t\tIf you are selling your home, you also need to consider how interest rates will affect your buyer. If interest rates go up, your potential buyer&rsquo;s mortgage payment will go up. Not only that, they may not be able to afford your house if the 3.5% interest rate goes up. If you are looking to sell your property, I recommend selling when rates are low so that more people can afford your home and your home value will go up.&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\tÂ \t\t\t\t\t\tFinally, here in Northern Virginia, there are not many cash buyers in our market. Roughly 95% of people buying homes in our market use some kind of financing, so you need to consider interest rates and the value of your home when deciding whether or not to sell.&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\tÂ \t\t\t\t\t\tIf you have any other questions about interest rates or selling your home in the current market, give me a call or send me an email.

Generally, when competition goes up, home prices tend to go down. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Pay attention to pricing and positioning. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMake sure you price and position your home properly in the market. As far as positioning, it can be beneficial to be on the market when most of your neighbors are not. You should also make sure that your home is priced competitively for the market. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t What kind of home are you selling? \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAre you selling a condo, a single-family home, or a townhome? Depending on what kind of property you are selling, you will be working to attract a different kind of buyer. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor example, if you are selling a single-family home, the buyer you are looking for will probably have kids. The buyer&rsquo;s schedule may be governed by when school is open and when school is closed, so you need to make sure that your home is available when that buyer is able to make a move. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t &nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you are selling a condo or townhome, your buyer may be young and single, or married with kids that are too young to be in school. These buyers move when their leases are up, when they save enough money, or when interest rates are low enough that they can afford the property. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t &nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAs you can see, part of putting your home on the market is considering the buyer&rsquo;s profile. You need to understand your ideal buyer and when they will be able to move. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t &nbsp; &nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSo, when you&rsquo;re thinking about the best time to sell your home, don&rsquo;t just focus on the season.

In Northern Virginia, we kind of live in a bubble; our real estate reality is not the same as the rest of the nation&rsquo;s. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLet&rsquo;s dive into some numbers so \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyou can be proactive about your real estate decisions\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t instead of reactive.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe average days on market right now is 40 days. If you&rsquo;re out in tertiary markets, the suburbs, or Loudoun, that number is a bit higher. If you&rsquo;re in Alexandria, Arlington, or Annandale, that number is a bit lower. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe X factor that determines whether we&rsquo;re in a buyer&rsquo;s or seller&rsquo;s market is actually \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe price of your money. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInterest rates were expected to go a bit higher this year but rates have actually gone down. Right now, rates are hovering around 3.5%. To put that in perspective, the lowest rates ever recorded were low to mid three&rsquo;s in 2012.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
