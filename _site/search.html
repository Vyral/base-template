        "content": "Do you get junk mail from other mortgage companies, insurance agents, credit card companies and car dealers with ads telling you that you have already been pre-approved to do business with them?Well, let me tell you why!Credit bureaus make a ton of money selling “credit profiles” to companies that are looking for a certain type of financial history. While they don’t know your social security number, the company sending you the pre-approved offer goes to the credit bureau and pays for a list based on certain criteria—criteria like minimum credit scores, geographic areas, mortgage or car loans, or outstanding credit card balances.If you read the tiny, tiny print, they must also disclose that you were “pre-screened” and that’s why you were sent the marketing solicitation.Also, in the tiny, tiny print (that you can barely read), they must disclose how to Opt Out so your name and address are not sold, which also eliminates some of your junk mail.Instead of reading the fine print, I want to tell you how to opt out of receiving the pre-screened offers.First, the website to visit is OptOutPrescreen.com/selection. You have a couple of options:  You can opt out from receiving offers for five years. This can be done online but you’ll have to renew every five years.  You can opt out permanently. However, you must download a form and MAIL it to the address provided.  You can also opt back in if you opted out previously.Here’s another link to Frequently Asked Questions that describes what happens when you opt out.If you need help opting out, please feel free to call me.",

        "title": "Nine Things You May Not Have Thought About When Buying Your Next Home",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "You may not be in the market (yet) to buy another home, but when you do, here are nine things to consider.  And if you are selling your home, these things also apply.1. Good View = Higher Price: The view really doesn’t matter. It could be a pond. A view of a mountain or valley.  The rule of thumb is that you can expect to pay a higher price.2. Sold AS IS: Sellers will sometimes negotiate the price or give a dollar concession rather than put the home back on the market and start all over again.3. Gated community: It might have a gate—but what does that really mean?  Can anyone push a button to open the gate?  Or is there a special card or access code to gain entry?  If security is an issue, it pays to find out.4. Curb appeal: If the yard is neglected, the weeds are taking over or the outside paint job is fading, the inside is usually neglected too.  Get a home inspection and be especially careful to look for hidden maintenance items.5. Check the area for crime: It’s still about location, location, location!  You can get crime stats from your local police or sheriff’s department.6. Check out the school system: Same as above.  In addition, use the Internet to do some of your own research to compare it to other schools in your area (including private schools).7. Don’t buy into the “marketing” fluff: Beware of descriptions such as “cozy, cute, fixer-upper, charming,” etc.  Pay more attention to the “facts”!8. Lowest price in the neighborhood: This is a red flag because people usually don’t sell at a lower price because they don’t need the money.  It’s priced low because of some other issue.9. Don’t believe what you read: Remember that the real estate agent is the one who creates the marketing strategies – and it’s all in the way they “perceive” it.  So if you are interested in the home, go ahead and view it, but make your own decision.  (If you are selling, ask to review the listing information before it is published.)",

        "title": "Tweak Your Withholding Taxes – Filing a New W-4 Form with Your Employer",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Remember filling out a W-4 form when you were first hired?  It’s the form that determines how much money your employer withholds from your paycheck to pay federal and state taxes—based upon the number of “allowances” that you claimed.But have you checked to see if it’s still applicable?  Consider adjusting your W-4 form if the following applies:  You owed the IRS money – You may want to have more money withheld from your paycheck. In fact, if you owed too much, the IRS can assess you and add a penalty for not depositing enough money into your account.  You’ve experienced a “life change” like          Marriage      Divorce      Birth or adoption of a child      Purchase of home      Refinance of mortgage      Retirement        You expect to earn money from your home-based business or other source that does not withhold income taxes from the check.

Or, ask your tax preparer to help you adjust your withholding so you don’t owe too much—or get a large refund from the IRS—at the end of the year.",

Utility, Telephone and Cable Bills. Those bills fluctuate from month to month and could be a different total each time. As a result, you might either overpay or underpay.

        "content": "Have you ever walked into a home (either a brand new one or one that’s been around for 25 years or more) and said to yourself, “I wonder what the builder was thinking when they built this house?”Maybe you are thinking of finally building your dream home. Or considering downsizing the one you currently own. Or need to remodel the one you currently live in.Here are 8 things to keep in mind:  Have a vision of what you want your home to look like. The floor plan is just the first step in the process. There a hundreds of thousands of decisions you will need to make. Take just the bathroom – what color tile? What pattern? Will the cabinets match? Faucets? Countertops? The floor? And that’s just one bathroom!  Find the right people – By people, I mean an architect, a builder, sub-contractors, suppliers. Are they licensed and bonded? More importantly, can you get along with them? Do they offer suggestions? Are they difficult to deal with?  Visit the construction site often – Be sure that the home/remodeling is being built to your expectations. Ask questions. Make suggestions. Visiting your home every other day is recommended.  Building too big of a home – Don’t think about what size you need right now—but what you will need 7 to 10 years from now. A well-designed 3,000 sq. ft. home may work just as well as an ill-designed 5,000 sq. ft. home.  Work that you can do to reduce costs – Ask the builder what sweat equity he/she will allow you to do to help reduce costs. Painting the walls or staining the trim. Maybe you have a friend who is a licensed electrician who would charge you less.  Think about the upgrades – When a builder provides you with a price to build your home/remodeling, it’s usually based on “medium grade” materials. Take kitchen cabinets for example. What type, color and grade are included? Or should you pay $8,000 extra for solid maple cabinets instead? It depends on your budget and if you can find something that you like in the medium grade so you can use the money for something else. Other than you loving maple wood, there is very little resale value in upgraded cabinets when it comes time to sell. Consider only adding your MUST HAVE upgrades.  Think about selling your home in the future – Even if you never plan to sell your home, your descendants may have to do so. Build your home so it’s not a nightmare to sell.  Think about monthly mortgage payments – When you have been pre-approved for your mortgage amount there are a few things to consider.          What will the interest rate be when the home is completed?      How much will extra upgrades add to the monthly payment?      How much money will you need after the closing (window coverings, furniture, landscaping)?      ",

        "content": "According to the National Taxpayers Union, roughly 60% of the nation’s taxable property may be over-assessed.  Taxpayers are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars more than they need to.NTU also states that 30% of all people who appeal their property assessments end up with lower taxes.  Your chances are especially good in a time of declining property values.  Assessors use data from the Multiple Listing Service (just like real estate agents do) to determine assessed values.  However, in a slow market, sales data is simply not available and there is a good chance that the assessment is faulty.Here’s what you need to do if you decide to appeal.Don’t Delay – When you receive your assessment notice, you usually have only 30 to 60 days (sometimes an actual date is stated in the fine print) to let city hall know that you plan to appeal.  At this point, it’s ONLY a “notification” that you don’t agree with the dollar amount.They will then provide you with a hearing date, which will give you time to gather your evidence as to why you think the assessment is too high.  They should also provide you with a list of “allowed” documents that you can bring to the hearing.Gather the Evidence – First, go to the assessor’s office to check out the data they have on your property.  There may be mistakes in square footage or lot size, or other data may be inaccurate.  Write down the addresses of homes similar to yours (in the neighborhood) and ask to see their information, too.  Don’t worry, the information is public and others can see what YOUR property taxes are, too.  Next, get sales data from a real estate agent and find out what homes are selling for—both listed and sold transactions.Look for Unique Factors That Could Make a Difference – Are you next to high-tension electrical wires? A drainage ditch?  On an extremely busy street versus your neighbor who lives on a cul-de-sac?  Check to make sure the assessor made adjustments for negative factors.Hire an Appraiser – Refer back to the list of documents that you might be required to present when your hearing is held. You may need an appraisal, which could run $300 or more.Word of Caution – If the appraisal or the comparable sales from the real estate agent comes back HIGHER, cancel your hearing appointment.  They also have the ability to RAISE your property taxes at that hearing.Here’s a link to a handy homeowner’s checklist, “Steps to Take in Appealing Your Assessment”https://www.ntu.org/publications/detail/ntu-in-the-news-kiplinger-how-to-appeal-property-taxes",

        "content": "Do you know the story of Brooke Astor? She was one of the richest women in the world.  She gave her son power of attorney (when she became incapacitated) and he proceeded to spend hundreds of millions of dollars of her money for his personal benefit! When you give someone a Durable Power of Attorney, you are literally giving them total access to your bank accounts, your retirement, and the ability to sell your home, your jewelry and any other assets you might have.  It’s like giving them a second set of keys to your car and saying, “here, take my car whenever you want to.”While a Power of Attorney is a good thing, here are some safeguards to put in place and other things to consider when choosing someone to act on your behalf.  Know what you are giving away.  The designated person you choose is known as an “agent”, and will have control over your finances and assets.  They can write checks against your bank account, sell your stocks, and dip into your retirement account.  You can modify your power of attorney to exclude certain accounts or limit them from certain powers (like selling your house).  Choose your agent carefully.  The majority of legal issues that go to court are power of attorney crimes involving family members or close friends.  Only appoint someone as your agent if you can thoroughly trust them and they are keenly aware of what you want them to do in case you are not able to act on your own behalf.  Consider an ‘oversight agent’.   Creating a plan for your agent to “report” to a third party doesn’t mean that you distrust them.  It means that you want them to keep good records, seek advice, and share them with someone else.  It could be your attorney or banker.  You may also want to share information about your power of attorney with other family members so your agent knows that other people know (about the existence of the power of attorney) and might be watching for any misconduct!  Get legal advice.   While you can create a do-it-yourself power of attorney, you might want to use an attorney if your finances are complicated.  Also, your power of attorney is not written in stone, and can be changed at any time.  As long as you are mentally capable, you can remove or change agents or revoke the power of attorney and start over.  When this happens, it’s best to get legal advice.If you should become incapacitated for any reason, your family will probably have to go to court to get the authority to manage your affairs.  It’s costly and time consuming, and the person the court appoints may not be your first choice.  But by acting now, you can avoid family feuds and have the peace of mind that your financial affairs will be handled in the best interest of your family!",

        "content": "What is delayed financing and how can you benefit from it? Let’s discuss.Every now and then, I meet with a homeowner who chose to make an all-cash purchase on their home. While there’s nothing wrong with buying your home this way, if you ever want to accrue debt on the property, my opinion is it’s best to start at the original point of purchase. Today I’ll tell you why, but I’ll also explain an alternative option: delayed financing.  If, subsequent to your all-cash purchase, you go to a lender to take cash out of the property, your cash-out refinance rate will be a little higher than the original purchase-money rates. What’s more, the IRS will only give you a 90-day window to close on a cash-out refinance from your original purchase and reclassify the debt from equity indebtedness to acquisition indebtedness. The significance of which is your mortgage interest can’t be written off on an equity indebtedness loan.   This is a conversation worth having with your CPA, but I’ll give you the gist: If you ever want to have mortgage debt on your property, start by financing your home from the get-go. However, if you’ve already bought your home in cash, it’s not necessarily too late. Your next best option is to do it immediately thereafter through a delayed financing mortgage, so you have the ability to deduct your mortgage interest come tax time. “The way you structure financing on the front end correlates with your likelihood for success on the back end.”Now, I should point out that delayed financing loans can be tricky. For one thing, lenders have to source the funds from the original cash purchase—by far the most common issue that arises. In other words, the way we handle financing in a specific situation will depend on the source of the funds used to buy the home. For example, say the source was a secured asset like a brokerage line of credit or a home equity line of credit. In that case, the cash-out proceeds for the delayed financing loan must go directly to that particular creditor to pay back what was borrowed.  It’s also fairly common for us to see situations where a third-party person has gifted the money to the original purchaser. Unfortunately, this will disqualify you from receiving a delayed financing loan. Based on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae’s regulatory rules, it’ll be six months before you’re eligible for a cash-out refinance, which is, of course, problematic since you have just 90 days to receive the tax writeoff associated with acquisition indebtedness.     The bottom line is the way you structure financing on the front end correlates with your likelihood for success on the back end. If you have any questions or you’re considering delayed financing for your situation, don’t hesitate to reach out to us first. We’d be happy to help you navigate through the complexities inherent in this type of loan. Talk to you soon!  ",

As a buyer, the answer depends on your loan program.What are the limits of seller concessions?My homebuyer clients often ask me whether the seller can pay for some or all of their closing costs, and the reality is, different loan programs have different limits for what a seller can and can’t do. FHA and USDA programs cap the maximum contribution at 6% of the sales price. Very rarely do the closing costs amount to 6%, but they allow it if those closing costs are there to be paid. VA programs, on the other hand, allow 4% plus closing costs. This is a broad generalization of what can and can’t be done, but if the amounts are large enough, the buyer can pay off their funding fee, non-mortgage debt, etc. Conventional loan limits are capped based on your down payment. If you put down 10% or less, the maximum is 3% of the sales price. If you put down anywhere from 10% to 25%, the limit is 6%. If you put down more than 25%, the limit is 9%. “If you’d like to talk more about how these limits affect your home buying prospects, give me a call and I’d be happy to run the numbers for you.”If you’re thinking of making an offer on a property and using seller contributions as part of your strategy, let your Realtor know up front so they can include that in their negotiating strategy.

As long as the property appraises, that’s a good way to keep a large chunk of money in your pocket. Technically the mortgage payment is slightly higher because you’re borrowing more money, but it’s usually a good tradeoff. If you have any questions about this topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "Today I just wanted to take a moment to outline our newest listing incentive plan. Here’s what you need to know.Oftentimes, we hear from our listing agents that one of their biggest concerns when listing homes is that it’s hard to know the quality of the lender who will represent the buyer.To help combat this uncertainty, we’ve created a listing incentive: giving the buyer a credit. You’ll be able to include this in your listing presentations with sellers and your advertisements on the MLS as well as other marketing materials.Essentially, the amount of the credit depends on the loan amount. If it’s a jumbo mortgage, the credit will be capped at $3,000. If the loan amount is lower than the conforming loan limit, the buyer will be able to get a credit equal to 1% of the loan amount.“This listing incentive is a way for you to obtain certainty in your process.”For example, if the loan amount is $400,000, the credit would equal $4,000. If it’s a $100,000 loan, they’d get a $1,000 credit. Basically, one point of credit equals about a 0.25% interest rate, so they’d be able to get very good mortgage terms, but only by partnering with us on your listing.This listing incentive is a way for you to obtain certainty in your process and ensure that you’ll be able to close the contract on the closing date. It gives you more control over the process, and the buyer gets terms that they wouldn’t have been able to qualify for otherwise. It’s truly a win-win situation.Now, we are realists—we know that we’re not going to get a whole bunch of participants in this program because buyer’s agents aren’t going to be too excited about using a listing agent’s recommended lender. We get that, but we just wanted a way to add value to our listing partners so we can help you sell more homes and help buyers build more wealth and memories with real estate.If you’d like to sit down in person or speak over the phone about this incentive program, please feel free to reach out to me. I’d be honored to visit with you. Thanks so much for your business and trust! I truly appreciate it, and I can’t wait for what the future holds.",

However, there are certain standards you’ll need to meet. “Keeping a property to use as a rental instead of selling it when you move can be a great way to generate extra income.”For one, you must rent out the property using at least a 12-month lease. Also, when you take on a tenant, your lender will need to verify that their security deposit has cleared and is in your account. This helps them to ensure that the lease is legitimate—not just an under-the-table arrangement.Once you’ve met these two qualifications, you’re all set to start reaping the benefits of your new rental property. When executed correctly, this strategy can not only help you to qualify for your next home purchase, but can also eliminate any remaining debt you owe toward your first home’s mortgage. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Let’s say you charge $2,000 and the interest on your credit card is 12%.  If you only make the minimum payment, it will take you approximately 16 years (yes, years) to pay it off.   Getting rid of credit card debt not only increases your credit score, it’s a big relief to eliminate a payment, giving you extra money to spend or save.  Here are 3 strategies to help you:1. Pick just one credit card to pay off first – If you have several credit cards, consider throwing as much money as you can to pay off one of them. There are two options to consider:  Credit Card with the lowest balance – Choosing this option will help boost your credit score because credit bureaus determine scores by the number of outstanding credit cards and the ratio of balances owed to your maximum loan limit.  Credit Card with the highest interest rate – Choosing this option will save you money in the long term. Review how much interest you have paid over the last 12 months compared to your other credit cards and see if this option makes more sense to you.2. Call your credit card company – Sometimes a simple phone call is all it takes to get a lower interest rate. If you are a long-term customer with a good credit score (in the 700 range), and have made your payments on time, you can usually get a couple of percentage points knocked off the rate.  If you’ve gotten an offer of a lower rate from a competitor, mention that to the customer-service rep and there’s a chance they will match their offer.3. Consider Transferring Your Balances – You can save hundreds of dollars by transferring credit card balances from a higher interest rate to a lower one—you can save a lot of money that way. However, it might just be a low, introductory rate that will only last for 12 to 18 months.  Be cautious:  Transfer your balance only if you are committed to paying off that credit card within the “low-rate window”; otherwise you may find yourself paying a higher rate than the one you paid on your old credit card.",

        "content": "In September of 2017, Equifax announced a data breach that exposed the personal information of 147 million people. The company has agreed to a global settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and 50 U.S. states and territories. The settlement includes up to $425 million to help people affected by the data breach.Here’s what you need to do to determine whether your credit data has been compromised and the options that you have if your social security number appears as one of the 147 million credit records.  Use this link to the FTC and enter in the last 6 digits of your social security number. (WARNING:  there are other websites out there that are asking for your information.  Don’t use them—use this one – https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/refunds/equifax-data-breach-settlement )  The website will tell you whether you are eligible to file a claim.  There are 4 claim options:          Cash or Pre-paid credit card of $125      Or, Free credit monitoring for 4 years and $1 million dollars of identity theft insurance      Or, free credit monitoring for 6 years (no insurance)      Or, You incurred loss of money and time due to identity theft. If you claim less than 10 hours, you must describe the actions that you took to fix the issues. If you claim 10 hours or more, you must provide documentation.  Maximum claim is $20,000.      Your claim must be filed by January 22, 2020.Claims will be reviewed starting January 23, 2020 but no date has been set when the money will be sent or the credit monitoring option will begin.One more thing…It used to be that you could ask for one free credit report per year.  Now as part of the settlement, consumers can get up to 6 credit reports per year from Equifax for up to 7 years.",

        "content": "What is the maximum number of properties you can finance? Find out today.I’ve worked with a lot of investors over the years, and they always ask me how many properties they’re allowed to buy using financing.Of course, the answer to that is, “However many you qualify for.”However, different investors in the secondary mortgage market will have different limits on how much exposure they’ll have to a single investor client. That said, the traditional investors will build their rental portfolio using Fannie Mae financing: Fannie Mae allows up to 10 financed properties at once. If you own 15 and eight of them are free and clear, you haven’t yet reached the 10-property limit.“You need to partner with a lender who can grow with you as your investment plans grow and lay out a strategy to help you accomplish your goals.”Fannie Mae is used on the first go-around because they have the best pricing for your real estate investors, but once you get to that tenth financed property, we need to go to a different strategy. Typically, this comes in the form of commercial financing, but even those commercial financiers will have limits to how much exposure they’re going to have to a single individual.Overall, you need to partner with a lender who can grow with you as your investment plans grow and lay out a strategy to help you accomplish your goals. If you or someone you know is looking to grow your investment portfolio and build wealth through real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Credit scores are one of those things that has consumers (and sometimes lenders) scratching their heads and saying, “How did they come up with THAT credit score?”The one you hear about the most are FICO scores (acronym for the Fair Isaac Corporation, the creators of the FICO score). It’s the one that most mortgage lenders use as one of the benchmarks to see if you qualify to refinance or purchase another home.  Usually 3 scores are provided, and the lender uses the middle score as the basis for granting (or denying) a loan. The thing about FICO scores is that the credit score may vary from lender to lender.  Why?  Because over the years, Fair Isaac has updated their credit scoring model software (best estimate, about 85 times), but the credit bureaus who buy the software from Fair Isaac do not always update their own software.  One lender could be using the latest version while another lender’s model is several years old. However, not everyone uses FICO scores as a guide.  Here are some other credit scoring models that are used:Auto Loans – If you apply for an auto loan through a dealer, they have developed their own credit scoring models, which are completely different from those used by lenders. Insurance Companies – Your insurance premium you pay for homeowners or car insurance also depends upon the credit scoring model that insurance companies use.  Oh, and it will vary with different insurance companies. Vantage Scores – If your occupation/employment requires you to be “licensed” (especially in the financial services industry) and to obtain (or maintain) your professional license, Vantage Scoring model software is used. Free Credit Reports – According to law, you are entitled to one free credit report (per bureau) every year.  While it won’t be exactly what lenders see when they order a credit report on your behalf, it will be “in the range” and is a good indicator of what to expect. As I mentioned, you are entitled to one free credit report—PER BUREAU.  Go to AnnualCreditReport.com and you can request one credit report from EACH of the bureaus listed. A word of caution!  Be careful when signing up for offers to provide you with a FREE credit report.  If you are asked to enter your credit card number, what you are really signing up for is a credit monitoring service—that may cost you over $300 per year. Please let me know if you’d like me to review your credit report.  I can make suggestions on how to increase your credit score.  Sometimes it just takes a little tweaking to increase it by 25 to 50 points. ",

Each letter is very specific as to what you need to do to answer the inquiry.  If the notice is about a “correction” on your tax return, compare it with the numbers on your return.  If you agree, nothing further needs to be done. It was just a notice that the IRS changed something.  If you do not agree, it is important that you respond to the request within the time period outlined in the IRS letter.  If you do not agree, respond in writing why you disagree. Tear off the bottom portion of the letter and return it, along with any relevant documents or information.  Keep copies of everything you sent to them.  Mail to the address the IRS provides in the letter.  Allow 30-45 days for a reply.  Most issues should be handled in writing.

        "content": "Down payment assistance is more accessible than some might assume, but is it worth using? Let’s discuss.People ask us from time to time if we offer any down payment assistance programs. To give you a short answer: Yes, every state offers some form of down payment assistance for qualifying homebuyers. Also, while there are first-time homebuyer programs available, you don’t have to be a first-time homebuyer to receive down payment assistance, in general. To qualify for the majority of these programs, you will need a credit score of at least 620. Your specific credit score will also impact the size of the grant you’re eligible for. The downside to these programs is that they tend to carry quite a steep interest rate. “The most important thing is that you’re comfortable with the interest rate you lock in at closing.”So, if you’re able to purchase a home without down payment assistance, it’s generally advisable for you to do so. You can still use gifted money from a family member toward a traditional loan, if necessary.The most important thing is that you’re comfortable with the interest rate you lock in at closing. You may get the opportunity to refinance at a lower rate in the future, but this isn’t guaranteed. Of course, everyone’s circumstances are different.

Many times, the parent(s) will buy the property outright for their child. In that case, the home is considered an investment property, which is markedly different than if the home were treated with non-occupant co-borrower status.   “A home purchase accomplished via a non-occupant co-borrower is a great way to sidestep some of the setbacks to homeownership and get a leg up in life.”But for the sake of this hypothetical, let’s say the parent(s) are the non-occupant co-borrower. They’re treated as such because they don’t reside in the property, yet their income and assets can be used to supplement that of their adult child’s. A home purchase accomplished via a non-occupant co-borrower is a great way to sidestep some of the setbacks to homeownership and get a leg up in life. We at Guardian Mortgage are no strangers to this method of home buying and would be happy to assist you through the process.

But have you checked to see if it’s still applicable?  Consider adjusting your W-4 form if the following applies:1. You owed the IRS money last year – You may want to have more money withheld from your paycheck. In fact, if you owe too much, the IRS can assess you and add a penalty for not depositing enough money into your account.2. You’ve experienced a “life change” like  Marriage  Divorce  Birth or adoption of a child  Purchase of home  Refinance of mortgage  Retirement3. You expect to earn money from your home-based business or other source that does not withhold income taxes from the check.4. Change in itemized deductions  Medical expenses  Gifts to charity  Dependent care expenses  Education credits  Child tax creditTo INCREASE the amount of taxes from your paycheck, you will need to DECREASE the number of dependents. You can also specify a larger dollar amount—like $50 per pay period.  Likewise, to have LESS money deducted, INCREASE the number of dependents or specify a smaller dollar amount per pay period. I recommend that you check your withholding every year—right after you’ve filed your income tax return.  The IRS offers a withholding calculator at www.IRS.gov. You’ll need your most recent tax return and current paycheck stub.  Or, ask your tax preparer to help you adjust your withholding so you don’t owe too much—or get a large refund from the IRS—at the end of the year.",

Good View = Higher Price:  The view really doesn’t matter. It could be a pond. A view of a mountain or valley.  The rule of thumb is that you can expect to pay a higher price.2. Sold AS IS:  Sellers will sometimes negotiate the price or give a dollar concession rather than put the home back on the market and start all over again.3. Gated community:  It might have a gate—but what does that really mean?  Can anyone push a button to open the gate?  Or is there a special card or access code to gain entry?  If security is an issue, it pays to find out.4. Curb appeal:  If the yard is neglected, the weeds are taking over or the outside paint job is fading, the inside is usually neglected too.  Get a home inspection and be especially careful to look for hidden maintenance items. &nbsp;5. Check the area for crime:  It’s still about location, location, location!  You can get crime stats from your local police or sheriff’s department. 6. Check out the school system:  Same as above.  In addition, use the Internet to do some of your own research to compare it to other schools in your area (including private schools).7. Don’t buy into the “marketing” fluff:  Beware of descriptions such as “cozy, cute, fixer-upper, charming,” etc.  Pay more attention to the “facts”!8. Lowest price in the neighborhood:  This is a red flag because people usually don’t sell at a lower price because they don’t need the money.  It’s priced low because of some other issue.Don’t believe what you read:  Remember that the real estate agent is the one who creates the marketing strategies – and it’s all in the way they “perceive” it.  So if you are interested in the home, go ahead and view it, but make your own decision.  (If you are selling, ask to review the listing information before it is published.)",

The situation is usually one in which the parent purchased a home for their adult child, and now they want the adult child to take over the mortgage payments and free up that capacity on their credit.This situation is complicated because there are two options to consider:1. You can do a standard purchase contract that includes a down payment, closing costs, etc.2. You can refinance the loan.“In order for the refinance to even be an option, the parent would have to essentially do a warranty deed to transfer 100% ownership of the property to the adult child who lives there.”Now, in order for the refinance to even be an option, the parent would have to essentially do a warranty deed to transfer 100% ownership of the property to the adult child who lives there. Because there’s no continuity of obligation with Fannie Mae any longer, they will allow that loan to be refinanced right away.Here’s the catch: The former owner of the property (the parent, in my example) won’t be able to get any equity out of the property with this type of structure. This is a rate-and-term refinance only. Now, I’ve had clients who have done a rate-and-term refinance and some renovations at that time, as well, so there’s definitely some flexibility there, but every person’s circumstances are different.If you’ve found yourself in this situation and would like to talk about your options, reach out to me.

The internet is a good way to do your research, but consider it a starting point in your search for a real estate agent that represents your interests.First of all, there are many intangibles that you’ll need to consider:  Is the agent’s personality compatible with yours?  Do you “sense” they are honest and trustworthy?  Does the agent have a clear understanding of your objectives and needs?  Do they have a list of referrals that you can call to get their opinion?Secondly, here are some things for you to verify when shopping for an agent to represent you:Licensing – While a real estate agent must pass certain tests and must be licensed by the state, you should also check to make sure their license is valid and in good standing. Have they had any complaints filed against them?National Association of Realtors® – Not all real estate agents can call themselves Realtors® unless they belong to this association and agree to be bound by their “code of ethics.” It’s an additional layer of protection for consumers.Education &amp; Specialization – It’s important that real estate agents continue their education. They can also take courses if they’d like to “specialize” in certain categories of a real estate practice, like “short sales/foreclosures” or “senior housing.” Ask if the person has any educational designations and what areas of real estate they special in.Local Knowledge – A good agent will have local information at their fingertips, including housing trends, how many houses on the market versus the percent sold, sales price trends, local crime stats, school and shopping information, and a list of professionals that they do business with to help make your real estate transaction as seamless as possible.Experience – While a certain amount of experience is important, it should be only one of the things to consider. I’ve known of experienced agents who become lazy after years of selling real estate, and I’ve seen newer agents who are highly motivated and eager to earn your business in hopes of future referrals.While this info is not all inclusive, if you are thinking of buying a home or selling the one you already own, please rely on me to recommend an agent for you to interview, so you can choose the one that you can relate to and will understand your real estate needs.",

They’re often puzzled when they find out that their consumer score isn’t the same as what we, their lending company, come up with.It’s important to take note of the fact that consumer sites aren’t selling you a FICO credit score. The significance of this is most lenders use FICO scores when assessing your level of risk for loan approval.To be sure, there are a few sites that will generate your credit score vis-à-vis the FICO model. Even still, your lender’s version, designated as “version 4,” will differ from that of the consumer website’s. Sometimes, though, the scores are comparable, and other times, there’s quite a gap between them.  “Monitoring your credit in advance of purchasing a home will eliminate any surprises when it comes time for your lender to calculate your score.”The bottom line is if you’re not already monitoring your report, now is a good time to start. It’s fairly inexpensive and AnnualCreditReport.com will actually allow you to pull your report (not to be confused with your actual score) at no cost. Monitoring your credit in advance of purchasing a home will eliminate any surprises when it comes time for your lender to calculate your score.  If you’re thinking about buying, selling, or refinancing a home in the near future, please reach out to me.

There are a number of loan programs that allow for this, the most common of which is called the Fannie Mae Homestyle Renovation Loan.This wonderful loan program allows people who own primary residences, second homes, or investment properties to renovate their property to their liking, with very generous allowances in terms of repairs, instead of moving in and waiting a few years to make the changes they want.“This wonderful loan program allows people who own primary residences, second homes, or investment properties to renovate their property to their liking, with very generous allowances in terms of repairs.”These types of loan programs are more complicated than the usual: They typically take about 45 days to close, there will be general contractors involved, and there will even be a contingency reserve fund of about 10% of the total renovation costs.For example, if you’re going to purchase a home for $400,000, and there will be $50,000-worth of renovation costs, that means there will be a $5,000 contingency reserve. When you add up all those numbers, the sales price, in a lender’s eyes, is going to be $455,000. Therefore, any down payment that you make on that home will be based on the $455,000 figure.Furthermore, by the IRS’s own rules, when you go to “substantially improve the property” via renovation, they will classify that debt as “acquisition indebtedness,” instead of “equity indebtedness,” meaning there are also tax benefits available for homeowners who take advantage of this excellent loan program.If you’re looking to purchase a home that needs renovation or have any other questions about home loan programs, please feel free to reach out to me.

That way, we can actually close on your transaction the way that you want to. Many lenders don’t do thorough work on the front end; it does take some more effort, but it’s so worth it for our clients because it gives them peace of mind when they go shopping for homes. They know that there won’t be a hiccup in the process that will prevent them from closing on the home they find.“We’ve structured our team to have the minimum number of cooks in the kitchen.”Communication is also vital.

Or you could sell them online.  Facebook and Craigslist usually have a local online consignment page where you can post photos.  Since it’s local, you don’t have to pay for shipping.  eBay is another option but there is a hassle of shipping the items you have sold on that website.  Donate your stuff – The local Goodwill or Salvation Army come to mind—but there are other places you may want to consider. Halfway homes.  Abused women shelters.  Senior citizen homes.  Be sure to check what they will and will not accept.  Throw away your stuff – While some of your stuff my be too bulky to take to the dump, there are services that will haul away your items—like 1-800-GOT JUNK. Another way is to move the large items to the curb with a sign that says “FREE: TAKE ME PLEASE”.  If you have stuff like chemicals or paint, check with the local recycling center to see what they will take.  One more thing, most communities have a “used appliance pickup day” once a year where they will remove your stuff from the curb.  Store your stuff – If you simply can’t part with the items and think you can use it again sometime in the future, consider placing it in a self-storage unit. It could also be items that you only use periodically and it’s best to store them off site.  However, the danger is that if you store the stuff and find you never visit the storage unit, you are postponing the inevitable—so you may as well get rid of it. ",

This assessed value is important because it’s what the county uses to multiply your current tax rate each October.A lot of my clients have been fortunate to have their properties appreciate over the last year, which is great for resale purposes, but not so great for property tax purposes. Many of my other clients, then, have been asking me how they can lower their property tax bill.One of the only ways you can lower your property tax bill is by protesting the assessed value your property taxes, and there are a few ways you can do this.The first way is by compiling any comparable data you have, taking that data down to the appraisal district, and protesting your case.“I’d be glad to refer you to a professional who can help you protest your property taxes.”However, not everyone is equipped with the knowledge to do this, so you can also try hiring a property tax consulting firm. They’ll do all the work, and you don’t pay them anything unless they save you money. The downside of doing this, though, is they’ll take anywhere from 30% to 50% of what they save you.Also, a lot of these firms have assessed value cutoffs where they’ll only accept cases for properties over a certain threshold because of the time it takes to protest these taxes. If using one of these firms isn’t an option for you, there are some do-it-yourself vendors out there who can provide you with all of the data you need for a small nominal fee in exchange for you doing all of the work with the courthouse.I have contacts in all of these fields, so if you’re interested in working with one of these professionals, I’d be glad to refer you or anyone you know to one of them.If you have any other questions about protesting your property taxes or you have any other mortgage needs I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

So, your refund is delayed until they check you out!That’s one of the reasons that tax preparation companies offer tax-refund advances – so you don’t have to wait weeks or months to get your refund.But here’s the thing. It’s not an “advance”. It’s a loan from a bank, and they have the right to check your credit, report the loan on your credit report, and it could possibly reduce your credit score. And, if you read the fine print, your “loan” is subject to underwriting requirements—which means that even if you apply for the tax-refund advance, there is no guarantee that you’ll be approved.The interest rate is usually zero. However, you will be charged a “processing fee” – usually $40 to $60 – for the privilege of getting your refund in advance. And there is usually a limit to the amount the tax prep company will advance.For example, if you are expecting a refund of $4,500, they may only advance $2,000. When the refund is received, the $2,000 will be deducted.By the way, according to H&amp;R Block, the tax-refund approval rate is 75%.If you take the standard deductions—don’t pay for someone to prepare your taxes!If you can wait a few more weeks—don’t take the tax-refund advance!Guardian Mortgage and Wade Betz do not provide tax, legal or accounting advice.

Specifically, you should expect to provide documentation on three separate occasions: once during your pre-approval, once when you’re under contract and locking in your rate, and once (though not always) when you get closer to the final approval.The mortgage process can last multiple months, so you should also expect to be in frequent communication with your lender—by phone, text, email, and, in some cases, video. Remember, you’re borrowing a lot of money, so you and your lender need to be on the same page during this time.To further summarize what you should expect from the mortgage process, I’ll share with you our mantra at The Betz Team: “Close accurately, on time, and with lots of communication.”“Remember, you’re borrowing a lot of money, so you and your lender need to be on the same page during this time.”For example, as far as accuracy goes, we’re very thorough on the front end in completing your pre-approval so that you have the best chance possible of getting your offer accepted. We also promise to close on time because, otherwise, you’ll be stuck with a moving van full of furniture and nowhere to go with it.Because there’s a lot of communication happening during this process, you need to make yourself available and check your email regularly, because there will be a lot of timely, actionable items that you’ll need to complete.This emphasis on being readily available and being in constant communication with your lender is so that you cross the finish line and become a happy homeowner within your contract deadline.

This means that ​if you are borrowing $100,000, paying one point would increase the closing cost by $1,000.Yet most people don’t realize that points can work in reverse, as well. ​In exchange for you agreeing to a higher interest rate, you can actually receive a lender credit which can go to lowering some of the closing costs. ​This is called premium pricing.Whether or not you pay points or get lender credit depends on your particular situation. We can analyze that as part of a cost break-even analysis to determine which one is going to be appropriate for you given your holding period and your goals.“Whether or not you pay points or get lender credit depends on your particular situation.”Keep in mind, though, that one point equals roughly a .25% difference in interest rate. Therefore, if you pay a point, you can expect the interest rate to be about a quarter of a percent lower. If you increase the rate by a point, or if you get a lender credit for a point, you can expect it would be about a quarter of a percent higher.I don’t want you to think that if you pay a point, your interest rates will be a full percent lower.

Every month, you put money into that account so your servicer will have the full amount to pay those bills when they’re due.Here’s the thing, though—we only collect from the escrow account based off of what the previous year’s bill was, and unfortunately, property taxes and homeowners insurance tend to increase over time. This means that each year, you’ll have a small deficit in your escrow account that you’ll need to cover. “We only collect from the escrow account based off of what the previous year’s bill was.”For example, let’s say your property tax increases $1,200 year over year. You might be thinking that your monthly payment will have to increase by $100 to account for that, and you’d be correct, but what you might not realize is that your escrow account was likely $1,200 short the previous year, so your future payment will have to increase by another $100 to account for that as well. Therefore, a single $1,200 year-over-year increase in your property tax actually equates to a $200 increase in your monthly payment.This is why it’s important that you partner with a lender who’ll keep the servicing of their loans.

For all intents and purposes, you need to be comfortable with the rate you lock down because that’s almost always the rate that you’ll close with.So, in answer to the question of how locked one’s rate is—it’s locked pretty tight, with some small exceptions.

So, it’s critical that you take the following steps and provide information to ensure that you get a fair value assessment for your home.Here’s what you can do:Contact your local real estate agent (I can recommend one for you) and find out the prices for homes recently sold in your area.If you find that some of the homes sold for tens of thousands of dollars LESS than what you perceive the value to be, find out if the home was sold because of a divorce, job relocation or foreclosure. Let the appraiser know – even if they don’t ask you for it. (This holds true regardless if you are selling or refinancing your home.)Prepare your home—the same way you would if you were holding an open house. While appraisers are supposed to ignore dirty dishes or overgrown bushes, they are only human and it may have some influence on the value.Give them a list of your home’s best features. Don’t count on them discovering every detail that makes your home different from the others in your area. Note any recent upgrades, improvements, schools, shopping, unique views, etc.When you get a copy of the completed appraisal, check for any errors. If you find a mistake, call the appraiser directly (because the loan officer is not allowed to call him/her) and ask to have the information reviewed. If they are NOT willing to update or cannot explain why they won’t change it, you can complain to the local/state appraiser board.",

One half is the mortgage note, which will almost always be sold to an investor like Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae so that the lender can get their money back and then lend it to someone else. That’s the way that virtually every loan in the country is done, with the exception of portfolio loans. Luckily, since Guardian is bank-owned, we also have portfolio loans.The other half of the mortgage coin is the servicing side—that’s who you pay your monthly mortgage payment to, who administers an escrow account for taxes and insurance, and who calculates the interest you paid year to date for the IRS.The servicing rights are often sold numerous times until you end up with some megabank, it seems; that can be frustrating as a consumer because, frankly, it’s hard to just keep it all straight.“That’s one of the major advantages of working with a lender like Guardian: We maintain the servicing rights for virtually every loan that we close.”That’sone of the major advantages of working with a lender like Guardian: We maintain the servicing rights for virtually every loan that we close.

In turn, that makes it very important to deliver on what we promise you because we’re going to be partnered on this together for the life of the loan, and it also gives a vested interest in your success, as well.When you work with us, we’ll connect every year for annual mortgage reviews to make sure that the mortgage we put you on is still appropriate for your needs.

That is why this time of year really gets people in the home buying mood.Purchasing a home this time of year may not seem like the most popular time to buy a house, which is why you could really benefit from becoming a homeowner now. You will receive low competitive rates on a Dallas mortgage and you can take your time when viewing different houses.So, to help you get started, your local lenders known as The Betz Team with Guardian Mortgage have listed the most recent Dallas market update for the residential region.Dallas Market UpdateAccording to realtor.com, the median listing price for all property types has been fluctuating since 2015. Three years ago the median listing price was $340,000 and by November 2016, the price had risen by 10.3% to $375,000. One year later the median listing price had increased an additional 3.7% to $389,000. The current median listing price for 2018 is $380,000, which is an 11.8% increase over the past three years and is approximately a 2.3% decrease over the past year.This recent decline in listing price compared to 2017 means now would be an excellent time to lock in a rate with your Dallas mortgage lender. It should be no surprise that the housing rates are predicted to rise in the near future, therefore, it would be a great idea to settle on an interest rate and purchase a home now before they get more expensive.",

If you have a steady job, matching your income with your mortgage payment and expenses is a good thing.  But if you are an entrepreneur or work on commission, it pays to be more conservative.

Is there room for all of your stuff? Check out the closets, storage space, garages, basement or sheds—or will you have to hold a garage sale before you move?        How big is the yard?  While it looks good on paper that the yard is huge, ask yourself if you really want to maintain it on a regular basis.        Will someone else like it?   While this is going to be your home, and you might live there forever, at some point in time, you (or your family) will probably sell it.

Know what’s happening in your area – Are people moving into your area because of job opportunities? Are people retiring there? Are you in a vacation area where you can buy short-term rental homes?  Do you want to buy a duplex or four-plex home, live in one of the units and rent out the others?  Understand the costs involved – In addition to a mortgage payment, taxes and insurance, you will need to budget for repairs, landscaping/snow removal.  Long-term or short-term investing – Investing in real estate can help you build your wealth over the long term. Or buying fixer-uppers and selling them immediately can give you more cash over the short term.  You will need to decide which one is right for you.  Know all of your financing options – the mortgage rules are different in regard to the down payment, the closing costs and interest rate. I can help you decide which loan program would be the most advantageous for you.  Know your numbers – Cash flow and income tax rules can benefit you when you invest in real estate. That’s where a great accountant/CPA can help you determine if the numbers work for you and your tax bracket. (I can recommend one to you.)  Build your own real estate investment team – Even if you are only considering buying one or two rental properties, it’s best to work with people you can rely on to give you good advice.

Two – Monitor Your Accounts  Mark your calendar to check your bank account, credit card charges and balances, your retirement and stock accounts weekly.   You may even be able to get an email or text alert from them if something changes.

Well, if this is you then do not worry because there is a simple solution to this problem.So, to help provide some insight, your local Dallas mortgage lender, The Betz Team with Guardian Mortgage, has listed how exactly you can obtain a home equity line of credit.Home Equity Line Of CreditA home equity line of credit is most referred to as a HELOC. This is an additional mortgage that is taken out on top of your existing Dallas mortgage. This type of loan taps in your home’s equity. You are able to accumulate equity the more you pay off your loan since equity is the difference between your home’s appraised value and your loan balance. Most lenders prefer that you have at least 20% equity in your home in order to apply for a HELOC loan. This means that you could borrow up to 80% of your home’s overall value and spend that money however you want.To gain access to your home’s equity you either need to sell your home or take out a second mortgage. A HELOC is a second mortgage that is set up like a credit card, meaning you will have a certain amount that you have been approved for and can spend however much of that amount as you like. A major benefit to a HELOC is that if you do not spend the whole amount that you were approved for, you only have to pay back the amount that was withdrawn and you typically have a period of 5 to 30 years where you can withdraw this amount.Your house is put up as collateral with a HELOC, which is the reason why you are offered such low-interest rates. To be approved, you will need to have good credit, a stable income, and be sure not to have too much debt. If you owe a lot on your current Dallas mortgage, you may have a hard time getting approved for a HELOC loan. So, be sure and pay off your first mortgage as much as possible before you apply.Contact UsFor more information on how a home equity line of credit works or to get started on your application today, please contact your local Dallas mortgage lender, The Betz Team, at (469) 906-2522.",

Before hiring a tax preparer, consider the following:  Check with the Better Business Bureau to see if any complaints have been filed  Check to see if they have a PTIN number from the IRS  If CPA or Attorney, check with your state’s professional board for complaints and if they have a current license  Ask what continuing education courses they have taken within the last 12 months  Ask if they belong to any professional organizations  Ask how long they have been preparing tax returns  Ask if he/she is familiar with the “type” of tax return you need to file  Find out how they determine the fees you will pay (will it be hourly or flat fee?)  How many clients have they represented in IRS audits?The IRS has provided a directory of credentialed tax preparers to assist in finding the right preparer for your needs. A few things to keep in mind when selecting a tax professional:  Steer clear of tax preparers who claim they can get you a larger refund—without reviewing your paperwork first.  Steer clear of tax preparers who charge a “percentage” of your refund—the tax return may contain inaccurate info in order to pump up the refund amount.  Steer clear of tax preparers who have “a lot” of experience with representing clients who have been audited—this may be a sign that they claim “questionable” deductions. The IRS has compiled some tips when it’s time to choose a tax preparer.Keep in mind, I’m not a tax professional, and this is just general information, but I have many clients who have had good and bad experiences.

        "content": "I’m not an insurance agent, but I’ve heard enough stories to know that when reviewing your homeowner’s insurance coverage, don’t assume that everything will be covered in case of a claim. In fact, in a 2007 survey, National Association of Insurance Commissioners revealed that homeowners misunderstood what their policy covered.  Here are some of the findings and things NOT covered by standard homeowner’s insurance policies:  68 percent think vehicles such as cars, boats and motorcycles stolen from or damaged on their property are covered.  51 percent think damages from a break in the water line on their property supplying water to their home are covered.  37 percent think damages due to a break in the sewer line on their property that connects to their municipal sewer system are covered.  35 percent think damages from earthquakes are covered.  34 percent think damages from mold are covered.  31 percent think damages from termites or other infestation are covered.  22 percent think pets stolen from or injured on their property are covered.Call your insurance agent if you’ve done any of the following: Acquired expensive possessions, such as furniture, computers, stereos and televisions.Made any major home improvements – usually anything more than $5,000.Experienced change in your state’s laws where you could be held legally responsible for the actions of anyone who drinks in your home and then has an accident in your house or after leaving it. Your policy should protect you against lawsuits due to these types of liability issues.Added any backyard items, such as a trampoline or pool, which may require you to increase your liability coverage through an umbrella policy that protects you in the event that someone is injured while on your property.Purchased jewelry, acquired family heirlooms, antiques, art – consider purchasing an additional “floater” or “rider” to your policy to cover these special items. They’re typically not covered by a basic homeowner’s or renter’s policy.Make an inventory of all of your personal property, along with a photograph or video of each room. Also, save your receipts for major items and keep them in a safe place away from your house or apartment. That will make it easier if you need to file a claim.For more helpful tips and information on home insurance, please visit https://www.insureuonline.org/insureu_type_home.htmGuardian Mortgage is a division of Sunflower Bank, N.A.

Even if you are not planning on listing right away, a good agent can keep you updated on a monthly basis.  Based on the real estate sales data, determine a price you are planning to ask the agent to list the home at.  Ask the agent the length of time homes in your price range stay on the market. Your home may sell right away.  It may take months.  But you will have an educated guess on when you will need to move.  Ask the real estate agent for suggestions about decluttering and staging your home for sale. Those suggestions may help you sell your home for a higher price—or sell more quickly.  Have an “agreed-upon price adjustment plan”. If the home is not selling in the timeframe you would like it to sell, or the feedback from the showings is not favorable, talk about adjusting the price of the home within a certain time period.  Be prepared to move. Mortgage approvals and closings can be accomplished within three weeks (depending on the buyer).  So, think about what you would need to do if you had to move out quickly.If you are looking for a great real estate agent, I would be honored to connect you with one for an initial consultation to see if you would be a good fit for each other.",

As a result, mortgage insurance is now included with the mortgage.“Back in the day, banks did not often lend more than an 80% loan-to-value; people once had to put down a very large down payment.”There are a multiple ways you can structure your mortgage insurance policy. Most people are familiar with having it included in your monthly payment, but you can also factor it into the loan amount, or build it into the interest rate—each has its pros and cons.If you would like to have a conversation about which might be the best structure for you, please reach out to me. Hearing from you would mean the world to me, and I will take great care of you.",

        "content": "Myth versus fact: I need perfect credit to qualify for a loan. Today I am debunking this myth for you.After the last recession, a lot of lending guidelines were tightened up and the perception was that you needed a perfect credit score in order to qualify for a loan. While this was true then, things have really loosened up over the last few years.As long as you have a 620 credit score or higher, you will qualify for most loan programs. The exception to this rule will be for most jumbo loans. For a conventional loan, however, 620 is going to be the cutoff.“If you have a less-than-perfect credit score, you should consider improving it with the help of a credit repair specialist.”This is not to say that you will not qualify for other programs if you do not have a 620 credit score. A VA loan is an option if you are a veteran. There is no standard minimum score to qualify for it, although certain lenders do have their own internal minimum scores, which they will not lend to if you are below.The FHA loan is another option for someone with a lower credit score. This is a great loan program which lends to very low credit scores. Although, any score lower than a 620 will result in you having some difficulty getting approved, while anything below 580 will make it very difficult for you to get approved.So, if you have a less-than-perfect credit score, you should consider improving it, and perhaps speak with a credit repair specialist. If you need an introduction to a credit repair specialist, I will be more than happy to assist you with that. They will take great care of you, as will my own team throughout the process.And, if you are one of the people who is not monitoring your credit score on your own, you should definitely start. There are numerous consumer sites where you can pull up your credit report. You should know, though, that the report you see and the version that a lender sees are not going to be the same. Expect that there will be a difference between the two numbers.The higher your credit score, the easier you will reach your goals, and I want to help you reach your buying goals. If there is anything that I can do to help you on your path to buy, please feel free to reach out. I would be happy to assist you in any way that I can.",

Being familiar with the current market trends and comparing them to trends over the past three years can help you decide when the best time to buy is. Reviewing this data can also give you a better idea of where the listing prices and interest rates might head in the future.So, to help you get started, your local Dallas mortgage lender, The Betz Team with Guardian Mortgage, has listed the most current market update to assist you in the home buying process.Dallas Market UpdateMedian Listing PriceAccording to realtor.com, the median listing price has been steadily increasing over the past three years. In June 2015, the median listing price was $339,000 and rose 16% the following year to $393,250. By June 2017, the median listing price was $414,411 and rose an additional 0.4%; with the current median listing price for June 2018 being $416,000. A medium increase in the price of only 0.4% suggests that now would be an excellent time to purchase a home and obtain a Dallas mortgage. Before the rates increase again and become more expensive, we suggest locking in a rate now.Median Price Per Square FootThe median price per square foot has mimicked similar trends to the listing price. In June 2015, the price per square foot was $168 and increased 12.5% twelve months later to $189. By June 2017, the median square footage price was $200, which is a 5.8% increase from the previous year. The current median price per square foot is $207, which suggests that the real estate in Dallas is becoming more valuable over time.Median Days On MarketHomes have been selling at an increased rate over the past few years. In June 2015, the median amount of time a home was on the market for was 40 days. One year later the median days on the market was 51 days and decreased to 49 days by June 2017.

This is the reason you typically skip a payment when you close on a new loan, and also why you might have a little bit extra due over your principal balance when you go to pay off your loan. Your payoff amount will always be larger than your principal because it includes the interest that you have yet to pay, since interest is collected in arrears.If you have any questions about this or would like to walk through how that works for you specifically, please feel free to reach out to me.

        "content": "Thinking of selling your car and buying a new one? While trading it in may be the quickest way to get rid of it, you may make several thousand dollars more if you sell it yourself instead. Here are five easy car-selling steps I wanted to share with you. You can find additional helpful tips by visiting www.edmunds.com/sell-car/Step 1: Calculate the sales price – There are various websites that will provide you with an estimated value of your car. One of the most popular is the Kelley Blue Book at  www.kbb.com. They will ask about make and model, the mileage, the overall condition and if you have any unique extras. Then add $1,000 to $1,500 to that price to allow for negotiation.Step 2: Write an ad – If you are planning to post on a “car-for-sale” website or social media pages, write a detailed description that includes the price, make, model, mileage and the condition of the car. Does it have any extra features like a “towing package”? Describe the interior. Did you make recent repairs? Replace the tires? Do you have maintenance records? Mention that in your ad! Oh, and if you park your car with a “for sale” sign, tape the description you have written to the window of the car for people to read.Step 3: Prepare the car for sale – Remove your personal items, wash the exterior, vacuum the interior and dust the dashboard area. If you have service records, make copies of those for prospective buyers to review. Check your insurance coverage to make sure the car is covered if you are allowing people to test drive and they get into an accident.Step 4: Display &amp; show the car – Put a for sale sign in the window. Park it in a location where there is a fair amount of traffic. Provide a phone number so people can get in touch with you to ask questions. If someone wants to test drive it, meet them in a public location and bring a friend. Ask the buyer to show you their valid driver’s license. Ride along with them. If they want to test drive it without you, ask to hold on to their credit card while they go for a spin.Step 5: Negotiate and finalize the sale – When you have negotiated the sales price, prepare a “bill of sale.” You can find forms online, such as https://billofsale.net/tx/texas-motor-vehicle-bill-of-sale/. Ask for payment in the form of a cashier’s check and verify with the bank that the money is legit. If you have to pay off a loan to get the title to the car, call the loan company and ask they how long it will take to get the title and advise the buyer of the car.",

        "content": "There are many myths about the real estate market. Today I am discussing the biggest myth surrounding down payments.The biggest myth I hear is “I need a 20% down payment.” After the last recession, underwriting guidelines tightened across the country, and the perception became that you needed at least a 20% down payment to qualify for financing. While this was true at the time for jumbo financing, it has since changed. There are a wide array of loan programs with different down payment options.“An FHA loan has a 3.5% down payment minimum, assuming you have a credit score over 580.”In Texas, jumbo loans are set by the government, and this year, the amount for a jumbo loan is anything over $453,100. A loan larger than this will usually still require a 20% down payment. However, there are plenty of lenders who will loan at 100% loan-to-value for the right borrower. Just remember that the lower the down payment, the higher the interest rate.Loans lower than $453,100 will be considered a conventional loan, and their down payments can range from as low as 3% to however high you want to make it. These loans will have different requirements for mortgage insurance that you should be aware of.Your next option is the FHA loan, which has a 3.5% down payment minimum, assuming you have a credit score over 580. If you have a credit score of less than 580, it will be hard to qualify for financing, but at that point, 10% is required.The final two loan programs you can use are USDA and VA loans. USDA loans are used for rural properties and VA loans are for veterans. Neither requires any down payment.As you can see, there is definitely a wide range of down payment possibilities. If you have any further questions about the myth of the 20% down payment or how to best use your funds, please don’t hesitate to ask. I’d be glad to help you.",

If they are licensed and in good standing, this allows you to get help from the state insurance department if you are having problems.  Check to make sure they are financially healthy.  A company that is in poor financial shape may not have enough money to pay your claim…or they might try to negotiate lesser coverage when it comes time to cut a check.  Here are several websites you can visit to check on their financial health. It is suggested that you check at two of them.      A.M. Best Ratings –   www.ambest.com        Fitch Ratings –  www.fitchratings.com        Moody’s –   www.Moodys.com  Check the number of complaints.  Again, the state’s insurance department should provide you with the number of justified (keyword: justified) complaints from consumers.  The report gives you a “complaint ratio”, meaning it compares the number of justified complaints to the total number of insurance complaints in the state.  You can also find that ratio at www.NAIC.org, The National Association of Insurance Commissioners website.  Look for a low complaint ratio.Check their response time.  If you find yourself holding on the phone for a long period of time.  If you don’t receive timely call backs. Or if the explanations of coverage are confusing to you, it’s a good indication that you will have similar problems when it’s time to file a claim. If you are looking to buy insurance or change insurance companies, please contact me because I know many great insurance agents for you to check out.",

The alternative is a pretty expensive down payment assistance program which has some restrictive qualification standards.“There are some stipulations about gifting money for real estate transactions.”There are some stipulations about gifting money for real estate transactions, however. The gifter has to be an immediate family member—a grandparent, parent, sibling, and so on—and the donor will have to sign a gift letter. This letter is very important because it states that this is a bona fide gift rather than a suspicious type of loan that gets paid back after closing.The lender will also have to document the transfer of funds from the donor’s account to the borrower’s account. Now, this transfer typically happens just after the appraisal comes in, but before closing. This timing is more common because most donors, frankly, don’t like the idea of giving a large amount of money to someone whose deal is not yet guaranteed to go through. By that point in the transaction, the unknowns should have been addressed.

Previously, you could deduct the mortgage interest on a loan up to $1 million. That number has been lowered to $750,000. While that’s still a very large number, this change will undoubtedly affect some people at the upper end of the market.2. Equity indebtedness. If you’ve taken cash out of your property at some point in the past, there were complex rules about what can and can’t be deducted. Starting in 2018, none of the interest on the equity piece of your loan can be deducted. If this is something that might affect you, I recommend discussing it with your tax advisor.3. The property tax exemption. You’re only going to be allowed to deduct up to $10,000 on your property taxes. Although that might sound like a large number, especially in the DFW area, it’s not the largest property assessed value that affects you. Keep that in mind.“The capital gains exclusion is still in place.”The key benefit that is remaining from the previous tax policy is the capital gains exclusion, allowing you to deduct up to $250,000 in capital gains on the sale of a property if you’re single and $500,000 if you file jointly I know many real estate investors who have greatly benefited from the exclusion.If you have any concerns about the new tax bill and how it will affect you, it may be worth the time to consult with your tax advisor.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Today’s topic is about why your lender matters in a competitive market.I talk to a lot of Realtors in my profession, and frankly, they tell me there are about four key things that make a difference in the likelihood of an offer getting accepted.1.) Local lenders. Listing agents routinely look for local lenders; they prefer not to work with large national banks or internet lenders. They want to be able to contact someone local if there’s an issue and someone who has local appraisers on their panel. Choose who you work with carefully.2.) Pre-approval letters. In the state of Texas, pre-approval letters are required to list what documents have and have not been verified, so if the letter that you’re looking at doesn’t have those items on there, I’d encourage you to ask your lender why, or find a different lender. Make sure the lender has actually looked at some documents.3.) Have the underwriter sign off. Have the lender take the process a step further and have the underwriter sign off on the pre-approval letter. Even though it takes a little bit more time for the lender, it’s a much more thorough way to go about it. It gives the listing agent certainty that you can actually close on the financing that you’re applying for because the underwriters actually sign off on it. As long as you don’t lose a job or blow your down payment money in Las Vegas, you’ll be able to close on the transaction.4.) Have your loan officer contact the listing agent to talk up your offer. Frankly, that type of call goes over very, very well with the listing agent. This can be the thing that pushes you over the edge in a multiple offer situation. I had a client just last week who was one of 22 offers on a property, and the seller took our offer because I called them—even though it was $8,000 less than the highest offer. We’re a local lender with a good reputation, and they knew we were communicative about having the underwrite on the file.Frankly, that type of call goes over very, very well with the listing agent.

I wanted to take just a minute to talk about flood insurance here in Texas and how it relates to your mortgage.When you take out a home loan, your lender is required to pull a flood certification to see if your property is in a flood zone. If you are, you’ll be required to take out a flood insurance policy. These can get quite pricey.You have to pay for them in full prior to closing, and you have to have them escrowed in your account regardless of whether you’re escrowed for taxes or insurance. It’s very important that if you are in a flood zone or looking at a home in a flood zone, you learn about it early on in the process so you can have time to make an educated decision on how to proceed.“Many of them don’t protect against water damage at all.”Being from New Orleans and having to go through Hurricane Katrina, I have deep sympathy for all of our friends in Houston and Florida. I’ve learned from first-hand experience that the biggest floods tend to happen in non-flood zones.

        "content": "Most people associate an adjustable-rate mortgage, or ARM, with the market crash of 2008. In reality, ARMs were misrepresented to the public during that time and people have been slow to come back to them. However, they have a purpose. An ARM could be the perfect thing for you, depending on what your goals are as a homeowner.“There is some risk involved, but it can be a very useful tool.”If you’re going to be in a home for a set period of time, let’s say four or five years, it behooves you to look at an ARM mortgage because it could actually save you a lot of money. While ARMs are known for adjusted rates, they usually have a fixed period at the beginning of the loan. This means for a certain time, the interest rate is lower on that mortgage than it would have been on a traditional 15 or 30-year loan. After the “fixed period,” the rate will adjust up or down depending on what you agreed to on the front end. There are caps in place to protect you from large swings, however. That’s what happened to a lot of people during the recession.Those who benefit from ARMs have a defined holding period and know exactly how long they want to own a property. You can also benefit from an ARM by rapidly paying down your loan at the beginning of the term while the rate is low. By the time the rate adjusts, your payment will have lowered, even with a higher rate.An ARM definitely has a place in the lender’s toolbox, but there is some risk involved.

However, most people may not realize that the removal of mortgage insurance, regardless of loan type, is actually dictated by the federal government.If you take out an FHA loan, your ability to remove mortgage insurance is predicated on the down payment amount. If you put more than 10% down, you are only required to pay mortgage insurance for 11 years. If you put less than 10% down, then you have to pay mortgage insurance for the entire life of the loan. So, keep that in mind if you are considering an FHA.Conventional loans carry private mortgage insurance, or PMI. Most people think that once they get to 80% loan to value, the mortgage insurance falls off. That’s not exactly true. The rule states that if you pay mortgage insurance, it automatically falls off at 78% loan to value—but you can request to remove it at 80% LTV. Contact your loan servicer once you reach 80% and ask to get that PMI removed.“Appreciation in value adds a bit of a wrinkle to this process.”Appreciation in value does add another wrinkle to this process. A lot of customers say, “My home appreciated in value since I bought it. Now I have the 20% equity and would like to remove my mortgage insurance.”That is fine, but the rules for using appreciation as justification are different than the rules based on the original purchase price. You are ineligible to use appreciation as justification years zero through two of owning the home. Between the two and five-year mark, you need 25% equity for justification; after five years, that number goes back down to 20%.Your loan servicer will require an updated appraisal at that time to make sure that you have subsequent equity levels.If you have any other questions about removing mortgage insurance, just give me a call or send me an email.

They limit the maximum loan-to-value of your financing to 80% of the home’s value. Regardless of the financing you are doing, the state requires an appraisal to be conducted to determine its value to make sure it doesn’t exceed the 80% threshold.There are a few different types of equity loans out there. Here’s a little bit of information about each.Equity lines of credit are variable and can be used for practically anything. Standalone second liens are typically taken out for home improvements. Cash-out refinances are when you refinance your entire loan balance in excess of what you want to borrow to get cash out of the property.“You can only have one equity loan at a time.”There are advantages and disadvantages to each, but one thing about these loans is universal in Texas. Whenever you take one out, there is a 12-month cooling off period until you can touch it. If you did a cash-out refinance and rates cratered immediately after, you are prevented from refinancing again until after the period has passed.Also, keep in mind that in Texas, you are only allowed one equity loan on a property at a time. If you did a cash-out refinance, for example, you are not allowed to take a home equity LOC out after the fact.If you have any questions for me or would like to discuss your specific scenario, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

You can refinance to remove one person from the loan or sell the house.Texas is a community property state. A refinance may not be necessary if you dictate in the divorce decree who will be obligated to make the payments. However, the downside is that the departing spouse’s credit is still tied to the home. If the occupying spouse misses a payment, it would still negatively affect the other’s credit. That’s why I recommend refinancing.“It’s important to know the plans for the home.”The timing will dictate whether an owelty lien is used. In Texas, if you’re trying to refinance to remove one spouse, many times you need to take cash out to pay them their share of the equity. Texas has limits for the maximum loan-to-value you can have on a cash-out refinance of 80%. Depending on what the home appraises at or the agreed payment, it may or may not be enough equity to take out. The alternative is the owelty lien, which gets put on the property for the agreed-upon amount and prevents the occupying spouse from refinancing or selling the property without guaranteeing payment to the departing spouse.It’s the most secure way to get equity out of the home. However, it needs to be agreed upon before the divorce is finalized. Sadly, I many people come to me after the divorce is already finalized, so this option is off the table.Selling the property releases both parties from the obligation of the mortgage, but they both still need to move somewhere.

There are three main types of mortgage insurance you need to be aware of.“Know the goals of your property before picking a mortgage insurance.”The most common type is borrower-paid monthly mortgage insurance. This is where the monthly amount gets added to the principal and interest portion of your payment. You would then make that payment each month until you get to a 78% loan-to-value ratio.The other type is single-premium financed mortgage insurance. This is where the lifetime costs of the mortgage insurance get financed into the loan amount. It keeps your interest rate the same, but it adds to the loan amount. This actually results in a lower monthly payment because you don’t have the interest rate at that higher amount each month.The last type is lender-paid mortgage insurance. This is where the lender pays the lifetime cost of the mortgage insurance in exchange for you agreeing to a higher interest rate. A higher interest rate has a negative connotation with most consumers, but the reality is that it results in the lowest possible monthly payment, and it’s even lower once you consider the after-tax mortgage interest deduction. This is a good way to structure your loan, but not if you’re going to keep the loan for a very long time.The benefit of the monthly mortgage insurance is that it can fall off once you get to the 78% loan-to-value ratio. If you finance it in as a lump sum into the loan amount or roll it into the interest rate, there’s nothing to fall off because it has already been factored in.The rules to remove monthly insurance are pretty complicated, and which structure makes the most sense for you is largely dependent on your goals for your property.My staff and I would be honored to help walk you through this, so if you have any more questions or know anyone looking to purchase a home in the next six months, please don’t hesitate to give us a call. we‘d love to speak with you!",

This means that instead of paying your mortgage once a month, you’d pay twice a month.“With this plan, you get the same effect as bi-weekly payments without the middle man and their fee.”The reality of working with these companies, though, is that you’ll pay them a month in advance. Then, you’ll pay every two weeks, and in turn, they will pay your lender once a month. This will continue until they’ve built up enough reserves in the escrow account they’ve set up for you to make that 13th payment a year.I advise my clients to take that monthly payment you’re paying to your lender each month, divide it by 12, and add that amount to what you pay every single month.

Out of all of those factors, the one that has the most bearing on a successful transaction is the lender’s ability to close on time.If you take out a loan, it’s very important to partner with a lender that will go through the due diligence steps up front to ensure that you’re fully pre-approved. After that, they should set the correct expectations for you so that when you shop for a home, you know how to properly negotiate for it so the transaction is a smooth one and you have a happy closing.Nationwide, about one-third of all home loans don’t close on time, according to the Campbell/Inside Mortgage Finance Housing Pulse Tracking Survey. FHA loans only close on time 59.2% of the time. Conventional loans (e.g., those that are backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) only close on time 63.6% of the time.

Why would a recast be more advantageous for you?A piggyback loan is when you take out a single loan for 80% of the home’s value and either 10% or 15% of the remainder to purchase the home. It’s usually either an 80/10 or 80/15/5 split.Structuring the loan this way usually makes sense when you’re very close to the $417,000 conforming loan limit. There are definitely better ways to structure this if possible, though. I say this because when you structure it with the first and second lien, the interest rate on that first lien is quite a bit higher than it would be otherwise.If the loan amounts cooperate, most of our clients actually structure this with a single loan, pay the private mortgage insurance, and then pay the loan down in either a lump sum payment as a result of the sale of another property, or with accelerated principal payments throughout the loan so that the mortgage insurance drops off.At that point, they can then contact us to recast the loan so it acts as a retroactive down payment. What happens, then, is you end up at the same place as if you structured the loan with the first and the second lien. The difference is by structuring it with a single loan with mortgage insurance and throwing in a recast there, you end up with a lower interest rate over the life of the loan, which ends up saving you quite a bit of money.“Structuring your loan this way will give you a lower interest rate.”If you find yourself in a unique situation and you want to talk through it with me and my team, just give us a call or send us an email.

These changes would include things like job loss, for example. The downside to a one-time close loan product is that the interest rate is quite a bit higher.The alternative is to structure it with two separate loans, or a two-time close.

        "content": "Many people have no idea what to do if an appraisal comes in low on a home they are trying to buy or refinance. There are a number of different options you have based on what kind of product you have. The first big distinction to determine is if it is a home purchase or refinance.If it is a home refinance, your lender would have started the loan with an assumption of what the appraisal would be, and priced your loan accordingly. If the value happens to come in lower, it could put you into a higher risk loan. If you’re trying to do a cash-out loan, it could also prevent you from being able to take cash out.“Lenders won’t lend more than the appraised value.”For a purchase loan, it’s a little more different and complex. The sales price is set by the sales contract. The lender is only allowed to lend on either the sales price or the appraised value; whichever is lower. When you have a low appraisal come in as a buyer, there are three different ways to handle this:  Ask the seller to renegotiate the sales contract to bridge the gap.  Rebut the appraisal by providing the lender additional information for the appraiser to consider that they may have missed.  Accept the value as-is, and by doing so, cause your cash to close to increased.That’s kind of the big picture overview of what happens when you have a low appraisal. No matter what happens, your loan officer will be contacting you to resolve these issues as soon as possible. If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.",

        "title": "Dissecting the Loan Process for You",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "What all goes into the loan process?The loan process starts once a lender has a 1003 Form, also known as a loan application. With that, they’ll pull a credit report. From there, they’re going to request the specific documentation from you in order to pre-approve you for your loan. As we’ve previously covered, the most common documentation include tax returns, W2s, paycheck stubs, bank statements, and other things of that nature.“Mkae sure that all documents get sent in timely fashion.”Once you’re pre-approved, you’re free and clear to start shopping for your new home and hopefully place a property under contract. Once you’ve placed a property under contract, make sure you forward that contract to your lender as soon as you can so they can update the federal disclosures to be sent to you. We’re required to send you a loan estimate within three days of you identifying a property address to us.Once your lender has those disclosures electronically signed, they’ll be able to move your file forward into the underwriting phase. During the underwriting phase, the underwriter will review everything and issue a conditional loan approval. At that point, the processor will introduce themselves to you and send you a needs list to help clear the conditions of the loan. By “conditions,” we usually mean an updated bank statement or paycheck stub.Once final loan approval is granted, the file will be sent to a pre-closing quality control reviewer, and then onto the closing department where the closing package can be prepared for you. Once the closing disclosure gets sent to you, it has to be acknowledged by you three days prior to closing, or the closing would have to be pushed back. Once the lender has the closing disclosure, the next step is for you to show up at the official closing with a valid photo ID and any certified funds that are required for it.Stretch out your forearm beforehand, because you will be signing a lot of documents. After that, you can count yourself as a happy owner!If you have any more questions or need help with this process, just give us a call or send us an email. My team would be happy to help.",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "To get fully approved for a mortgage, you need to make sure all of your documents are in order. We’re going to talk about some of the documents you will definitely need in order to get approved, and when you should have them ready.The first one you’ll need is a 1003, by far the most important document lenders need to complete an approval. We use that to pull a credit report and from that point we can dig into all the specifics required. The high-level overview will need two years of tax returns, two years of W-2s in addition to the two most recent paycheck stubs covering a 30-day pay period. You will also need to provide the two most recent account statements for whatever bank accounts or asset accounts you have.The reality is that there are literally dozens of potential documents we could be requesting, but until we get the loan application and review your credit we won’t be able to tell you. When you’re ready to purchase a home, make sure you’re prepared for a pre-approval. The document request is just an initial request. There will likely be more requests throughout the process as we get closer to closing.“We want you to be able to make an offer on your dream home.”At the end of the day, our goal is to be in compliance with the government by showing that you have the ability to repay a loan and have been given no special treatment. We document your file so we can stay compliant and try to shrink any problems that may occur from the get go. We want you to be able to make an offer on your dream home when it comes along, so that’s why a pre-approval is so important.If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out.

        "title": "The Difference Between Pre-Qualification &amp; Pre-Approval",
        "author": "Kourtney Brown",
        "category": "",
        "content": "You may have heard real estate professionals tell you that you need a pre-approval letter or a pre-qualification letter to buy a home. Do you know the difference between these letters?In Texas, we have the conditional qualification letter and the conditional approval letter. When most consumers contact us about getting a letter, they are referring to the conditional qualification letter. One of the quirky things about the state of Texas is that lenders are required to list the documents that they have and have not verified on that letter.When people contact us saying that they want a pre-qualification letter, most think that we’ll help them with a loan application by pulling their credit and writing them a letter. While that’s fine and we can do that, we must list on the document that nothing has been verified, and that can make it a very weak letter. In today’s highly-competitive real estate market, you need as strong a letter as possible when making your offers.For that reason, we encourage our clients to take it a step further and provide us with the supporting documents so that we can issue a strong letter for them. Almost all of our clients take us up on that, and we can do it very quickly just as long as they provide us all the info in a timely manner.“In today’s market, you need as strong of a letter as possible.”Again, there is that second type of letter in the state of Texas - the conditional approval letter. The great thing about this letter is that once you’ve been pre-approved, we can push your file forward to an underwriter for full credit approval. Basically, all of the hard work of the loan is done up front, the underwriter signs off on everything, and, with the exception of getting an appraisal on the property, you are completely done with your mortgage. With all the hard work done up front, the time frame for being under contract is shortened, and the experience is just more enjoyable all around.If you’re looking to buy and looking for a lender, we’d be honored to serve you. Send us an email or give us a call and our team will get working with you right away.",
