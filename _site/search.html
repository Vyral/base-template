        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "If you are a buyer, there are four things that you should never say during a showing or to the seller:1. Never say that this is your dream home. It doesnât matter how gorgeous the house is or how ugly the house is; you never want to say that you love the home, especially if the seller or sellerâs agent is present. You might think that making this kind of comment would make the seller want you to get the home. However, once they know you are in love with the home, they will want to mark up the price. They will use your love for the home as leverage and maybe even make you overpay for the property, so make sure that you leave your feedback and comments with your Realtor.2. Never tell a seller that you can afford their home.Â Once they know you can afford it, they will try to make you go higher. Now, thereâs no room for negotiation for your buyerâs agent. The negotiation process will be more challenging, and you may end up paying more for the home.âDonât tell the seller how much you love the home unless you want to pay extra for it.â3. Donât ask the seller why they are selling. When you ask this question, sellers immediately put their guards up. They donât have to share this information with you, and they could be moving for very personal reasons. Maybe somebody passed away, or they have to relocate because of a job situation. Donât get really personal when it comes to buying your home, especially if the seller is right there in front of you.4. Never submit a lowball offer, especially in a sellerâs market where inventory is low and demand for houses is high. A lowball offer could be offensive to the seller. They know their home is worth a certain amount, and submitting an offer way below market value would definitely offend them. They would put their guard up and they may not entertain your offer. You will most likely lose out on a chance to get a home that you really like if you make a lowball offer. The seller will want nothing to do with you. When deciding what price to offer, talk to your professional real estate agent to come up with a fair value that will work for you.Remember, do not attempt to say any of the four things we mentioned today at your next home showing.If you have any questions in the meantime, just give us a call or send us an email. I would be happy to help you!Â ",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today, I have four tips for sellers who are looking to list their homes in todayâs market. These tips will help you sell your home quickly, smoothly, and for more money.âA real estate professional will take care of the costs of marketing your home.â  Donât list your home inaccurately.This will affect how long it will take for your home to sell, how long youâll end up staying on the market, and how much money youâll be leaving on the table. Hire a local professional to help you determine the right price for your home.  Hire an agent. If you plan on listing by yourself, how will you handle negotiations and determine which offer is best for you and your family? The knowledge and expertise that Realtors have will help you negotiate terms and understand the contract, and theyâll help you eliminate stress from the process.  A real estate professional can help reduce marketing expenses. By yourself, you could advertise your home on free websites, but youâd actually be missing out on the true potential of buyers on the market. A real estate professional will take care of the costs of marketing your home and will have access to even more avenues through which your home can be exposed to potential buyers.  A professional will lend you time and freedom. Imagine if you listed your home on your own and you tried to go on a family vacation. Your phone would blow up because everyone would want to see your home and ask questions about it. Hiring an agent would take the stress off your shoulders by managing the listing, answering calls, and making sure that you donât miss out on opportunities.If you are looking to buy or sell a home in todayâs market, feel free to reach out to us. Weâd love to be your real estate professionals.",

        "content": "If you want to get pre-approved to buy a home quickly, here are four tips which can help:1. Have at least two yearsâ worth of work history.Â This doesnât mean you have to have been at the same job for two yearsâit just means you have to have been working for at least the last two years.2. Have credit. Make sure youâve been building up your credit so you can qualify for the best interest rates. If you havenât started building your credit, apply for some credit cards from your local bank and use them wisely.âThese four tips will help you get pre-approved for a loan quickly.â3. Save money.Â Nowadays, there are a lot of down payment assistance programs out there that could help you, but youâll still have to pay for things like closing costs once you purchase your home. That money will have to come out of your pocket.4. Have all your documents in place.Â This means your pay stubs, bank statements, W-2s, and all forms of identification are in place and ready to go when your lender asks for them.If you have any questions about how to get pre-approved quickly or you have any other real estate needs, donât hesitate to call us or send us an email.

        "title": "Does Your Home Insurance Policy Cover Everything It Needs to?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "There are a lot of commercial advertisements for different home insurance companies out there, and these advertisements can get repetitive to the point where you might assume that when they promise you âpeace of mind,â they mean they will cover everything. Is that true?These are just advertisements, so not everything they say is true. The best way to know for sure is to dive into your policy. One of the reasons I wanted to address this topic today is because of the recent wildfires Southern Californiaâs been experiencing. So many insurance claims have been racked up due to these wildfires, and they can get expensive, especially with recent supply and demand and home values increasing.âIf your policy doesnât cover certain natural disasters, it may be time to switch companies.âThis is why you need to make sure your policy is up to date. A couple years ago, your home may have been covered up to a certain dollar amount, but that may have changed without you even knowing about it. Make sure any damage that can be caused to your home is covered. If your neighborâs home burned down but yours didnât, your home can still be affected by the ash blowing onto your property. Is that cleanup covered? If you donât understand your policy, odds are that it isnât.When an insurance company promises peace of mind, you need to make sure you understand the ins and outs of your policy. If it doesnât cover certain natural disasters that can happen in your area, it may be time to switch companies. Sit down with your agent and double-check if everything is up to date.If you have any questions about this topic or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home in the near future, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

Donât wait until the grass turns yellow and the leaves are off the trees. Prepare in advance by taking pictures of the inside and outside of your home while the landscaping still looks really good and green.2. Have floor mats ready. Itâs wintertime in California, which means the weather will be rainy. Have floor mats going in and out of your home so that people donât track water onto your wood or laminate flooring. The last thing you want is for buyers to come in and leave a mess all over your home.âMake sure that everything works properly.â3. Make sure everything is working properly. You donât want a buyer to come to your home and find that two out of three lights arenât working. Make sure the HVAC system works as well. Buyers always test everything to make sure it works.4. Listen to your Realtor when it comes to home pricing. You donât want your home to be on the market longer than it should. Pricing too high will cause your home to linger on the market, which causes buyers to wonder whatâs wrong with it. Make sure that you work with your Realtor to make sure that your home is priced correctly for the market.These four tips will help make the selling process faster and less stressful.

If youâre submitting an offer for a home, they can let you know how much youâll need for a down payment and all your closing costs so youâre not surprised or caught unprepared at the last minute.As a rule of thumb, closing costs are usually 2% to 5% of the homeâs purchase price.

For example, letâs say you schedule a showing with your Realtor at 2 p.m. but work kept you late and you canât get to the house until 3 p.m. If your Realtor works with a team and they have another appointment at 3 p.m., they can simply send one of their teammates to meet you.

The biggest benefit to VA loans is that there is no down payment required. Thatâs an awesome benefit considering youâd need around $10,000 to get into a $300,000 home at 3.5% down with a conventional loan, not including closing costs.If you want to apply for a VA loan, the first thing you should do is find a good lender. You want to find someone you can trust. Theyâll be able to make sure you are eligible for a VA loan and can help out if there are any hiccups.âHire a good lender to see if you qualify.âAfter you find a good lender, find a good real estate agent who is also familiar with VA loans. They will be able to avoid the pitfalls that other people come across when looking for a house. Since a VA loan is federally backed, they have much higher standards for homes theyâre willing to approve. If there are any problems, it wonât qualify for the VA loan and the seller would have to either make all the necessary repairs or find another buyer instead.If you have any questions, donât hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

You can check out the first part of our conversation here.There is a large percentage of first-time buyers in our current market. Nick says that there are many loan programs available for first-time buyers, but some are shrinking and some are changing. Whatâs available today might not be available tomorrow.The best thing you can do is meet with a loan officer to go over your specific situation so that you can find the program that is best for you. You still need to have good credit, a job, and verifiable income. Some programs even give you a low down payment option, but keep in mind that itâs always best to have access to some funds when buying a home, as there are definitely costs that come with the transaction.Itâs incredibly important that you find a lender you are comfortable with before you start looking at homes. You need to know what your options are and what your buying power is. Some people start looking at homes in a certain price range only to discover that they cannot afford to buy those homes. That can make the home search process frustrating, as you are constantly comparing the homes you can afford to the homes you want in that other, higher price bracket. Knowing your buying power helps you set realistic expectations for your home search.âMake sure you talk to a lender before you start looking at homes.âOn the other hand, some buyers may get approved at that higher number but they donât want to buy in that price range. If you look at your own budget and set a more comfortable number, that is perfectly fine. No one understands your financing better than you do, so itâs really important that you talk to your lender and develop a plan that is based on your wants, needs, and goals.If you have any other lending questions for Nick, you can reach him at 916-262-7631 or email him at Nick.Street@MWFInc.com.

For part one of our conversation, we talked about the current state of interest rates and what the future holds for them.Nick has been in the mortgage industry since 2004, so he has a wealth of knowledge to share. One of the things he has taken notice of in the last few years is that many people arenât aware that interest rates are affected by how our economy is doing. When the economy is suffering, rates are going to be pushed down. When our economy is doing well, like it is right now, you will start to see rates increase.Interest rates greatly affect buying power in this market. If youâre approved for a $300,000 home right now with current interest rates, you would only be able to afford a $270,000 home if rates went up by just 1%.âInterest rates have a big impact on buying power.âRight now is actually a great time to buy for a number of reasons. For one, interest rates remain historically low. While itâs true they arenât as low as they were last summer, when you look at historical data itâs clear that rates are still just about as low as they ever have been. Our market specifically gives buyers a lot of advantages that renters donât have.

Your pre-approval number is generally referred to as your purchasing power.How does your lender calculate this amount? By going through your credit, looking at your income, and determining your debt-to-income ratio, your lender will help you determine what mortgage payment youâre comfortable making.The interest rate you qualify for is a big factor in determining your purchasing power. For example, if you qualified for an interest rate of 3.25%, your mortgage payment for a $250,000 home would be roughly $1,088 per month. If you donât qualify for that 3.25% rate and instead qualify for a rate as high as 4.75%, your mortgage payment for that same $250,000 home would increase to $1,300 per month.âThe interest rate you qualify for plays a big role in your purchasing power.âSee why itâs so important to know what interest rate youâre able to qualify for and lock in?

        "content": "Lately, Iâve had a lot of buyers wondering how Iâm able to show them homes that I donât personally have listed. If my picture isnât on the âfor saleâ sign, how can I show the home?When a homeowner decides to sell their home with the help of an agent, theyâre working with a listing agent. The listing agent puts the home on a service called the MLS (multiple listing service), which basically advertises that home to every agent who has access to the MLS. Why would you want your home advertised to these agents, though? When a home is put on the market, thereâs a certain commission thatâs agreed upon by the seller to pay the listing agent and the agent who brings them a willing buyer. The agent who brings a buyer is known as a buyerâs agent.âLockboxes let any agent show a home to their buyer, no matter who the listing agent is.âThe Realtor who shows the home represents the buyerâs side of the transaction, whereas the listing agent represents the sellerâs side of the transaction. Every agent who has access to the MLS also has access to a lockbox, which they can log into for access to the keys to the home. Every time a buyerâs agent logs into a lockbox, their ID and license verification get sent to the seller to notify them who is looking at their home and how much traffic is coming in.This will give sellers an idea of whether their home is priced right and attractive to buyers. So thatâs how weâre able to show homes to our clients that arenât our listings.I hope this helps you understand the MLS and how showings work, no matter who the listing agent is.

Today, I wanted to share three reasons why:  A mortgage is fixed, but rent is not. It depends on the landlord as to how much, but your rent will go up over time. A mortgage payment will stay the same throughout the lifetime of your loan.  A mortgage acts as a forced savings account. Down the road, as you pay your mortgage and reduce the balance on your loan, you also increase your equity in the mortgage. If an emergency occurs or you want to make upgrades to your home, you can pull equity out of your mortgage because it acts like a savings account from the beginning.  You can rent out your home if you need to move, and they can pay down your mortgage. You can even potentially earn income from that renter.âA mortgage acts as a forced savings account.âThese are just three reasons why owning a home is beneficial to your finances. If youâre looking for more reasons or youâre ready to buy or sell a house, give me a call or send me an email soon. Iâd love to help you out!",

        "content": "Today, I have good news and bad news that I want to share with you.The bad news? Since the election, interest rates have gone up. Sadly, theyâre no longer hovering around their all-time low average of 3%. The good news? Itâs still a good time to buy. Why?To answer that, letâs turn back the clock a little bit. In the 1970s, interest rates were averaging around 8%. In the 80s, that average rose to 12%. Then, in the 90s, it shrunk back down to 8%. In the 2000s, it shrunk down a little further to 6%.âYou can still lock in an ultra-low rate by buying now.âNow that weâre almost into 2017, our interest rates are averaging 4%. So, as you see, even as theyâve risen, theyâre still incredibly low from a historical perspective. You may have missed out on the apex, but we canât go back in time. Compared to previous decades, our rates are still historically low, so if you wanted to buy a home, youâd still be locking in a better rate than your parents ever could have.If youâre looking to buy or sell a home, donât hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email.

        "content": "One of my clients recently ask me, âShould I buy now and own a home, or should I keep renting and save for a bigger down payment?âThis is an important question. Everybodyâs situation is a little bit different, but if you find that youâre asking yourself the same question, I can tell you that there are three reasons you should stop renting and go ahead and buy.The first reason is that when you write rent checks to a landlord, youâre paying themânot you. Youâre not building any equity for yourselfâyouâre building equity for your landlord. If youâre renting to try and save for a bigger down payment and prevent PMI being added onto your mortgage, youâre not doing yourself any favors. In all that time, you couldâve been lowering your mortgage and building equity for yourself.The second reason is that when you own a home, you can do whatever you want to it. When you rent, if you want to change anything substantial about the property, you need permission from the landlord. Even if the landlord does give you permission, youâre only upgrading their propertyânot yours.âOwning a home means building long-tern equity.âThe third reason is if you do buy a home and the experience is too overwhelming, after five years, you have the option of turning the property into a rental home and becoming a landlord, yourself.Do you want to be able to do whatever you want to the house youâre living in? Do you want to be able to pay yourself first and build equity in the long run? Do you want the freedom to be able to become a landlord in the future? If you answer âyesâ to any of these questions, you probably have your answer.If you have any questions about this topic, please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email.

        "content": "Today I wanted to discuss three important aspects of home inspections.The first thing to remember is that you as a buyer will have to pay for the home inspection. You donât want the seller to pay for the inspection because if they do, they will choose the inspector. As a result, the inspector will look out for the sellerâs best interests instead of yours. You want the inspector to be working for you so that he or she can give you an unbiased opinion of the home.Secondly, you will get some recommendations for inspectors from the agent that is helping you buy the home, but youâre not obligated to choose any of them. Feel free to do your own research on a home inspector that fits your needs.âYou want to be able to choose your own inspector.âFinally, donât expect the home inspection report to be very detailed; it will only cover the basics. An inspector is not going to break down walls and look at plumbing or wires. They will only cover the cosmetics of the home to make sure it looks decent, that the water is turned on, the gas works, the power outlets work, and whether the roof looks good. We still recommend having a roofing professional come out to do a detailed roof inspection to find out whether itâs certifiable.Hopefully, this gives you a better idea of what to expect when it comes to home inspections. Remember that you can be present during the inspection. That way, the inspector can address any specific concerns you have.If you have any more questions about home inspections or youâre thinking about buying or selling a home in the Sacramento area, give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "There are three reasons to get pre-approved for a mortgage before you shop for a home:  Youâll know what you can afford. People will come to me wanting to look at homes in a certain price range and then proceed to get pre-approved. Many times, these buyers end up qualifying for more than they thought and have more options for buying a home. You wonât have to cap yourself because youâll know what you can afford.  You wonât know what interest rates will be until you lock them in. If you look for a home first and then get pre-approved, you wonât have a good idea of what your payment is. You might find out that payments are more than you can afford on a monthly basis, and we have to reduce the purchase price. Interest affects more than just the price, so you want to lock in your rate before shopping.âGetting pre-approved tells toy exactly what you can afford.â  You can provide the seller with the pre-approval letter. This is huge if you find yourself up against other offers. If you donât have a pre-approval letter and the offer youâre competing against does, the seller will most likely go with the offer with the pre-approval. Why? All the lender information is there to verify that the buyer has the necessary funds. Sometimes sellers who go under contract with buyers who arenât pre-approved will cancel the deal within a week when they find out about their pre-approval status.Donât underestimate any of these three points about getting pre-approved for a loan before you look at homes. If you have any questions about the pre-approval process or youâre thinking about buying a home in Sacramento, give us a call or send us an email. Weâd be happy to help!",

A contingency period in a normal offer is anywhere from 17 to 21 days. Your offer may look stronger if you shorten up your contingency period to perhaps 15 or 10 days.This makes you appear to be more serious about your offer. The seller might be willing to take your offer over other offers that are higher just because your contingency period and your terms make more sense for them.âShorten the contingency period in your offer.âThe second strategy you can use is writing a personal letter to the seller letting them know why they should choose your offer over everyone elseâs. That letter could mean the world to them because it makes your offer more personal.The third strategy is to include your lenderâs information in your offer. This includes their cell number, email, and the name of their company. In this case, if the seller is looking to do their due diligence on the offer to make sure that youâre approved or have the amount ready for the down payment, they have all the information they need in order to do so.If youâre looking to buy our sell a home, donât hesitate to get in contact with us.

To put that in perspective, a balanced market has four to six months of inventory. Anything below that is considered a sellerâs market.With only a little over a month of inventory available, houses that are priced correctly are flying off the market in as little as 10 days. Demand is incredibly high right now, and if a buyer finds the right home, they are moving quickly to make sure they get it.Part of the reason why demand is so high is because interest rates are at an all-time low. The buyer I spoke with was able to get a 30-year fixed rate of 3.6% by working with our preferred lender. If youâre like me and you have a 5% interest rate on your home, now is a good time to look into refinancing your mortgage. Even though itâs a strong sellerâs market, itâs a strong borrowerâs market as well.âSacramento is in a strong sellerâs and borrowerâs market.âThe second quarter of 2016 is even better than the first.

In fact, to find out what the right answer is for a particular clientâs situation,I ask the following questions:  What are your plans for the next 2-5 years? You need to think about your relationships and your job before you make the leap into homeownership. If you may be relocating in coming years, locking in a mortgage may not be the best option.  How much are you paying in rent? If rent is, say, $1,600 a month, you have options out there where you would be paying the same amount of money in monthly mortgage and principal payments.  What are the benefits of homeownership? If you own your home, you can write off some of your expenses when tax season comes around and, historically, home prices increase over time, so owning a home becomes a type of forced savings. With rates at historic lows, owning a home is more affordable than it usually is!  What are the disadvantages of homeownership? When you become a homeowner, you are responsible when things break.

A Realtor can get you up to 6% more for your home, and that can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars in a sale. Studies show that homes priced correctly will sell faster and for more money.  You have a negotiator on your side: There are a lot of different people to negotiate with throughout the process of selling a home, and it pays dividends to know how to speak with these people and get their attention. Realtors already have relationships with these people, and youâll find it much easier for them to negotiate than doing so on your own.  Realtors have professional marketing experience: Real estate agents have the ability to display your home on hundreds of different websites and this is important because over 90% of buyers look online when they begin a home search.

Cleaning up and organizing your home can go a long way towards making potential buyers feel more comfortable within your home. Remove any collections of photos, art, or other personal items. You donât need your home to be empty, but donât let your particular lifestyle be readily apparent to everyone who walks inside your home.âBe sure to speak with us before your home sale so you donât waste your money on unnecessary repairs.âAs you prepare to sell your home this spring, I hope that these tips will be able to put more money in your pocket. The repairs that you think might net you more money are not always the ones that you need to be making. Be sure to speak with us before your home sale so you donât waste your money on unnecessary repairs.Please donât hesitate to contact me with any questions you might have about real estate in Sacramento!",

I usually like to reserve these market analyses for individual cases, but today Iâll give you a generalized look at whatâs happening in our area.  Low interest rates have kept the market strong because itâs an incentive for buyers to purchase, and itâs also making sellers want to list their homes because of increased demand.  Weâre currently seeing about 3 months of inventory in Elk Grove. With our marketing strategies we can probably cut that number down to one month (contact us if you want to sell quickly and for more money).  For the most part, buyers want to come out and purchase homes right now because of high affordability. New loan products from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with only a 3% down payment requirement should also bolster buying power, which should cause an extra surge of activity in Elk Grove.âBuyers want to come out and purchase homes right now because of high affordability.âThis is a generalized report on our market, but please feel free to contact me if you would like to sit down and discuss your particular situation. As always, please donât hesitate to contact my team with any questions!",
