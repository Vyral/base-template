        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I am joined by Fred Larsen from Pillar to Post Home Inspection to answer some common questions about home inspections. So what should you expect when youâre inspecting?The most common issues found during home inspections are water related. Water can get into the house by grading and draining from the exterior, rain gutters leaking, leaking around flashing, and through improperly installed roofing and siding materials.If you are looking to sell a home, a good first step is to get your gas appliances checked and serviced to make sure that they are safe for use. Of course, itâs also a good idea to address any of the water issues previously mentioned. Take care of anything you know needs to be taken care of before the inspector gets to your home.Getting your home pre-inspected also boasts a ton of benefits. Doing so will save you lots of time and money. Also, when your home in under contract, it will save you the headache of trying to scramble to get everything fixed or repaired during the due diligence period.âIf youâre a buyer, get the inspection done as early as possible.âIf youâre a buyer ordering a home inspection, make sure to get it done early in the due diligence period. There may be some things that the inspector finds that youâll want to be checked out further. Also, make sure you find a good home inspector by asking your agent for referrals and interviewing potential hires. Itâs always a good idea to ask for a sample report, as well.Itâs important to understand that a home inspection is a visual inspection. Home inspectors donât tear things apart or dig through walls, and there are things they canât see. Fred and his team try to be as thorough as possible, though; they cover up to 1,600 items.Keep in mind that Utah does not require a license to do home inspections, so make sure you get an experienced and qualified home inspector.If you have any further questions for Fred or youâd like to schedule an inspection, you can reach him at 801-281-0484 or go to saltlake.pillartopost.com.If you have any questions about buying or selling a Salt Lake City home, give me a call or send me an email. Iâd be happy to help you!",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Hereâs a look at what is happening in the Wasatch Front real estate market.As the year comes to a close, itâs time to take a look at the 2016 report card for the Wasatch Front home sales.The Wasatch Front sales volume for single-family homes is nearly the same this year as it was in 2015. Thatâs 29,000 single family homes that have sold, which is very strong. In fact, our strongest sales year was in 2006 when 29,300 homes were sold.Our average sale price along the Wasatch Front in 2015 was $285,250 and in 2016 it is just over $305,000, which is a 7% increase. If we adjust for inflation, we are actually above pre-recession pricing.Condos and townhomes have been off the charts. There has been an 18% increase in sales between 2015 and 2016. 2015 was already a record year, so this year has been phenomenal.First-time home buyers should buy before a rate increase.âFirst-time home buyers should buy before a rate increase.âIf we look at the average price of these properties, the condos and townhomes in the Wasatch Front area were $193,000, a 5% increase year over year.So what might 2017 look like? Utahâs economy remains one of the strongest in the country, and the number of families that are moving into the state remains one of the highest in the nation. The average age of our residents is 29, which is also the average age of a first-time home buyer. Therefore, we anticipate that we are going to continue to see strong sales, but not record breaking sales. However, something is going to happen with interest rates.Predictions for 2017 are widely varied. They are dependent on world events, the incoming presidency, and signs of a recovering economy. All of those factors will influence the direction of mortgage rates in the new year.We know that rates have been on the rise for the last 30 days, and the FED has been fairly clear about their intention to raise rates even more. So what does this mean for home buyers? A 1% increase in mortgage rates equates to a 10% increase in the cost of a home over a 30-year loan. Even more unfortunate, itâs predicted that if we have a 1% increase in rates, 18% of first-time home buyers will no longer be able to afford a home.

        "content": "Should you sell your home during the holidays? I believe the answer is yes, and here are the top six reasons why:      You will face less competition. There are fewer sellers on the market this time of year, which means your home will have fewer homes to compete with. One of the common myths in real estate is that you should wait until school is out to put your home on the market. The thing is, that is exactly what most people will do. You can get an edge over the competition by listing when there is only a handful of other properties on the market.        Buyers are serious. In the spring and summer, some buyers are just getting their feet wet and trying to decide whether or not they want to buy a house. In the wintertime, buyers are strapping on their snow boots and coming to your house because they are ready to buy today. It wonât take as many showings to find the right buyer in the winter.        Homes show really well this time of year. Nothing says home like the holidays. All consumer decisions are based on emotions first and are then justified by logic, so people become very emotionally attached to holiday themes. They envision having their family in your house over the holidays and cozying up to the fire with their family. Another way to appeal to buyersâ emotions is to bake some apple pie, cookies, or bread. These scents bring back memories and create a positive attraction to your home.âBuyers are ready to purchase your home right away!â        Buyers have more time off at this time of year. Everyone takes time off during the holidays, which gives buyers more time to look at your home. They will be able to make it to more daytime showings, which works great for sellers and makes things easier for buyers who have to work those tough 9-to-5 jobs.        There will be more competition after the holidays.Â If you are planning on selling your home, do it during the holidays. Most sellers will wait until right after the holidays to put their home on the market. In the second week of January, there will be a surge of homes on the market. My recommendation to you is to list now and beat the surge.        You can sell now but move after the holidays. You can put your property on the market in November, get a contract in December, and then you have 35 to 45 days before the buyer moves in. That means you can spend the holidays in your home and be secure in the knowledge that you have a contract on your home.  There are many benefits to putting your home on the market during the holiday season. If you have any questions about getting your home ready for the market or about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

        "content": "Itâs that time of year, folks â winter is coming. Itâs going to get cold. Now is the time to harvest what is left of your garden, winterize your sprinklers, and cozy up at home with your friends and family.That said, there are three huge mistakes that can cost homeowners thousands of dollars. Luckily, you can easily avoid these mistakes by properly winterizing your home.First of all, make sure that you buy a $2 protector for your outdoor faucet. Itâs amazing how much damage a little bit of ice can do. Ice can cause pipes to explode or leak into your basement. Just an inch of water in your basement can cost up to $15,000 to pump out and dry. All you have to do to prevent this disaster is buy one of those protectors and take your hoses off of your faucets.Now, I know everyone loves Instagramming icicles, but donât just take your pictures and leave the icicles on your roof. If there are icicles hanging off your roof, then you probably have ice damming issues. Basically, when the ice melts, the water has nowhere else to go. Ice damming can cause serious damage to your roof, which costs thousands of dollars to repair. Not only that, icicles are also safety hazards; it can be very dangerous to walk beneath some of those huge icicles we get here in Salt Lake County.âA little ice can cause a lot of big, costly problems for your home.âIf you notice that you have ice damming, you can pay a few hundred dollars to have someone come out and steam the ice away. You can even rent one of those steamers yourself. I also recommend installing a little extra insulation around the eaves of your house, which is typically where ice damming occurs. Heat tape can also help you avoid ice damming and water damage, which will save you thousands of dollars.Finally, donât let cold air sneak into your home. If you add up all of the cracks in the average home, itâs like having a 3x3 foot window open at all times. Not only will that make for a cold winter, it will also cost you a lot of extra money in energy bills. Fortunately, you can head to a Loweâs or Home Depot and buy some caulk. Caulk comes in all kinds of different colors, so find the one that matches your home and fill up those exterior cracks. That way, you wonât have all of that cold air coming in through your windows, stucco, or doorframes.",

        "content": "A couple of weeks ago, I did a market update for our local radio station KNRS. As I was preparing the data for the show, I realized that we had a tale of two markets on our hands.You see, if we look at the availability of all the housing types across the entire Wasatch Front under $300,000, we have about a three-month supply of homes available. In a real estate market, itâs considered a level market when you have between a four-to-six-month supply of homes available. When there are fewer than four months, itâs considered a sellerâs market. When there are more than six months, itâs considered a buyerâs market.âI want you to be able to win no matter what market youâre completing in.âIn any price point less than $300,000, then, itâs absolutely a sellerâs market. Here are three quick strategies you can use to help you compete if youâre a buyer in that market:  Be the first to know. Your agent should be able to match your specific home buying criteria so you can be the first to know about homes as they become available. This will allow you to weed out the competition and avoid multiple offer scenarios that may cause the price of the home to increase.  Get a full approval letter.  This will take you through parts of the underwriting process, and thatâs exactly what the seller wants to see. This will turn you into a cash buyer in the eyes of the seller and help you stand out from the competition.  Try using an escalation clause on the offer you write. For example, you could state that youâre willing to offer X amount of dollars higher than the highest net offer the seller receives, provided the cost doesnât exceed a certain price.As I said, weâre experiencing a tale of two markets. The other market Iâm referring to is all the housing types above $500,000, in which there is a 10-month supply of homes. This, obviously, is a buyerâs market. Here are three tips you can use if youâre a seller to ensure your home priced more than $500,000 sells fast and for the most amount of money:  Boost your curb appeal. Itâs a fact of lifeâeveryone judges a book by its cover. Make sure the front doorâs got a fresh coat of paint on it and the landscaping looks good. Take photos now if youâre planning on listing over the winter.  Stage the home. Clear off all the flat surfaces in the property of everything other than decorative items. Clean lines show the property, and itâs the property youâre selling, not the stuff. Flat surfaces run vertically as well as horizontally, so make sure both surfaces are cleared of all clutter.  Price the home right. Be sure to use accurate comparables within your micro-market and view those comparables through the eyes of the buyer.Regardless of what tale our market is telling, I want you to win. If you have any questions, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!",

        "content": "We recently sold a property for more than list price in less than two weeks. Prior to working with us, these clients had their home on the market for over six months before the listing expired.During that time, the property had six showings and no offers, so the sellers were understandably frustrated. When they were referred to us, I told them exactly what they needed to do to get the property sold.The first thing you need to understand is curb appeal. If you look at the video above, you will see before and after pictures of the property. I had the clients paint the exterior of this beautiful log home because the photos from the original listing showed that the home had deferred maintenance. Everybody on the Internet judges a book by its cover, so your home needs to look good.Imagine going to an expensive restaurant and paying $50 for a plate of food. That plate of food will come out looking good, and because it looks good, itâs going to taste better. The same principle applies to buying a home.If you look at the video above, you will see a couple of interior photos as well. Before, the property had not been staged. I found that the clients were more than happy to stage the home but their prior agent didnât give them any direction on what to do or how to do it. We went room by room and staged the property correctly. For instance, we referred them to our countertop guy so they could finish updating the kitchen. It cost $1,500 to replace the countertops and they look great.âAlways look at comparable properties to see if the property is fairly priced.âWhen you look at a listing online, after the exterior photos, the buyer should see a picture of the kitchen, the master bedroom, and the master bathroom in exactly that order. Those three rooms are the most important to buyers and most buyers will only look at your listing for a little bit, so you need to post photos of those rooms up front in order to grab their attention.We are incredibly grateful to these clients. They did everything that we asked them to do. We launched the property using our grand opening technique and, as a result, we sold this property in fewer than two weeks.If you have any questions about the home selling process or if youâre having trouble selling your property, give us a call or send us an email.

        "title": "Do You Want to Buy a Fixer-Upper? ",
        "author": "liz@getvyral.com",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I have a few tips for buying a home that needs work. There are different types of fixer-uppers out there and some need more work than others. The way you pursue a purchase offer on the home most likely depends on which fixer-upper category it is in.Most sellers realize that a home needs work when they put it up on the market and have already accounted for that when they priced the home. I have yet to find a seller who is willing to subsidize a buyerâs home improvement dreams, yet that doesnât stop buyers from trying to get a discount on an already discounted price. It is very important to look at comparable properties in order to determine whether a fixer-upper has been priced correctly.Now, letâs talk about the different types of fixer-upper homes.First, you have your basic fixer-upper. Fixer-upper homes are generally priced for sale as-is. These homes often have deferred maintenance items or other minor repairs that the sellers either arenât willing to fix or cannot afford to fix. When you make an offer on these properties, have your buyerâs agent pull comparables for other fixer-upper properties to see how the price stacks up. That way, you are comparing apples to apples.On the other hand, you may be interested in a mint condition vintage house. Although these properties are not modernized, they can be very desirable. Mid-century modern houses have made a real comeback recently; other vintage houses include Victorians or Craftsman bungalows. Generally, the seller will add a premium price pad due to the area and architectural uniqueness of the property.Usually, the interior of a vintage property will be in incredible condition. However, they can look very outdated. When you write an offer on this kind of property, be aware that there may be a premium price to pay for the uniqueness of the property. Make sure that you look at other similar homes and compare the listing price to those that have already sold.Another kind of fixer-upper is the newer home that may be outdated. Lots of subdivisions have homes that were built in 1995; these sellers know there are newer homes out there, but still price their homes as if they are brand new. That is unfortunate because a lot of the trends from the 90s â like hunter green carpeting â are not popular today. Some of these sellers may be priced above where they should be, so again, make sure to look at comparable properties. When you send your offer in, send along the list of work it would take to modernize the home and include how much it would cost to do all of that work. That way, the seller can see things from your perspective.âAlways look at comparable properties to see if the property is fairly priced.âA lot of buyers think they will get a good deal when it comes to buying a foreclosure property, but thatâs not always the case. Banks will usually not lower the purchase price on a foreclosure property within the first 30 days. Foreclosures normally come with other rules beyond that. For example, after 30 days, the bank may lower the price by 3%. If 60 days go by without an offer, they may lower the price again by another 3%.You should also make sure to do a title check on foreclosed properties because the banks have not occupied these properties. The bank should have cleared any hidden liens on the property, but it is still a good idea for you to work with a good title company and pull a complete title report.If you are interested in a short sale, you need to know that there is nothing short about them. Short sale transactions can take a lot of time to close. Since the seller cannot afford to make the payments on the home, they also cannot afford to do any work on the property, so short sale homes are often sold as-is.You should also be aware that the price an agent sets for a short sale property is not always accepted by the bank. The bank will do an independent appraisal on a short sale property to ensure that it will be sold at market value. Donât be lured in by the price on the MLS system unless it says that the price has been previously approved by a third party. More often than not, thatâs the price the bank is willing to accept.Finally, you may want to buy a âpackratâ house. If you have ever watched Hoarders, you know that these houses have stuff stacked up to the ceiling and aisles to get from room to room. The challenge with these properties is not that there is a lot of stuff in the house (which makes it hard to visualize what youâre going to do with the property, though), but that there is a monstrous amount of deferred maintenance that needs to be addressed.Again, it helps to look at other distressed properties to see if the packrat house is priced correctly. It is especially important in this case because you wonât know how much work the property really needs until you get a home inspector in there. Keep in mind that if all of that stuff in the home is still in the way, the home inspector wonât be able to do their job thoroughly. Consider extending your due diligence period and require the seller to allow access to all visible parts of the interior of the property before the home inspection.The number one thing to keep in mind when purchasing a house that needs some work is to look at comparable sales. You can then deduct the price of the work thatâs needed based on estimates from licensed contractors. If that adjusted price lines up with the listing price, you might need to pay the listing price to purchase that fixer-upper.If you have any questions about fixer-upper properties or need to get in touch with a licensed contractor to fix up your property, just give us a call or send us an email.

The analogy weâve come up with makes a lot of sense, and we hope it will help shine some new light on the process for you if youâve been thinking about selling.For this analogy, letâs say we are starting with the ball right on our own one-yard line. There are 99 yards between you and the goal line. Once an offer is accepted, youâve made it to midfield.An offer will be contingent on a few things, including due diligence. Due diligence is basically any type of inspection a buyer wants to do. We know that 24% of contracts fail and 80% of those are due to due diligence. The buyer could decide they donât want to buy at this point for pretty much any reason.The good news is that once weâve made it past due diligence, we are in the red zone. Good offense so far, but youâre not quite there yet. Now the offer is contingent upon the financing going through.Your buyer should already be pre-approved by a lender; however, that still doesnât mean they will get the loan. The âdefenseâ in this situation is underwriting. Itâs a secret weapon that is going to look for every reason not to lend the buyer money, so certain things can come up.ââA good agent will be in contact with the lender who issued the pre-approval to ask certain questions to see if they will be able to pay. You want to find out as much as you can up front about their financing.After the financing hurdle has been cleared, you are on the 10-yard line. The offer is now contingent upon the appraisal. In the last couple of years weâve had more and more issues with appraisals because the market is improving. Homes still have to appraise for buyers to be able to purchase. If you get a bad appraisal, you do have options to remedy it without throwing the deal away.After youâre through the appraisal, you are at the five-yard line. The final hurdle is the settlement table. This is where we sign all the documents with the title company to be able to transfer the deed into the buyerâs name. It usually happens a week or two after the appraisal.Bad things can happen, like a medical emergency or the buyer losing their job, but itâs not likely. Now you are at the one-yard line, and the property must fund in order for the seller to receive the money and the buyer to get the deed. Once that has happened, you are in the end zone!

        "content": "When updating or renovating your home, you may be under the impression that making major renovations to your property will net you more money on the appraisal. This may not always be the case. In fact, some improvements may not increase your homeâs value at all, leaving you with a sunk cost. In an effort to help you avoid this situation, Iâd like to share with you seven home improvements that will not add to the value of your home.      Extensive professional landscaping. You may not recoup the cost of that koi pond and waterfall in your backyard. Realize that major outdoor features like these are personal aesthetic choices, and that a future buyer may not share your same vision or want to pay for the maintenance of those choices.        Upgraded electrical or plumbing. Odds are, your neighbors have already upgraded to copper plumbing and have probably already updated their electrical systems as well. These improvements are only considered to be ones that bring a property up to modern standards, so theyâre not likely to increase the value of your home.        New roof, gutters, sprinklers or HVAC. These are all major systems of a property since they can last for over 10 years. The reality is that it is unlikely that the appraiser is going to add any value to your property, since these are the kinds of systems that the buyer is going to expect are already in great working order at the time of purchase.    Swimming pool. Here in Utah, swimming pools and other water features like hot tubs are not all that common, and some buyers may have a problem with that. This is called functional obsolescenceâsomething about the property that you will not get back from a value standpoint.âPainting your home is not likely to add value in an appraisal.â      Making dated improvements. Upgrading to white appliances or white ceramic countertops might seem like a great idea because they are newer to you, but these decisions may deter some potential younger buyers, since theyâll see those as âdated updates.â If you have questions on which improvements to make or not make, ask me!        Painting your home. While painting your home can actually freshen up the property and strengthen its appeal, it is not likely to add value in an appraisal; it may, however, increase the probability of it selling.    Solar panels. Regardless of the Kool-aid that the solar panel salespeople are selling you in regard to resale value, realize that an appraiser is not adding value for solar panels. Worse yet, if youâve financed solar panels, youâll probably have to pay them off at the time of sale, which is something that probably was not disclosed to you when you purchased them.If you have any questions about what to do or what not to do in order to get your home sold for the most amount of money possible, please give me a call or shoot me an email and Iâd be happy to answer.",

        "content": "The question of when you should respond to an offer as a seller is one we get quite frequently, especially in a market like this. Most agents are advising their clients to hold off on responding to offers until after the first weekend theyâve listed, in which an open house will often be held.This benefits buyers because many can only go out to look at homes on weekends when they donât have to work. It gives everyone equal footing to get into the property and enough time to prepare financing. The seller benefits as well because they donât have to show the property as much and can get all the offers around the same time.When youâre responding to an offer as a seller, you do have four different options:  Accept the offer.  Make a counter-offer.  Reject the offer.  No response to the offer.âYou want to be gracious, not forceful.â That being said, a seller really isnât going to ignore an offer unless itâs blatantly ridiculous. The real key to getting your offer accepted is understanding timing. Maybe the seller is waiting for other offers to come in before deciding because they just listed. However, if the home has been on the market for a month or more, the seller is probably very anxious to get an offer.I recommend that you call the sellerâs agent and ask them what would be enough time for a response. This is a gracious way to make it clear to them that you still want the home.If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us an email anytime.

        "content": "The law of supply and demand in real estate is irrefutable. Itâs important to understand. Generally, if thereâs a low supply and a high demand, price will be high, of course. In contrast, the higher the supply and the lower the demand, the lower the price.So letâs define inventory and absorption rate in real estate. If you take the amount of available homes and you divide that by the amount of homes sold in the past 30 days, youâre left with whatâs called a monthâs supply of housing. Itâs considered a level market when you have a four to six month supply of homes.If thereâs less than four months of supply, itâs a sellerâs market. Likewise, a more than six month of supply of homes gives us a buyerâs market. âYou need a strong Realtor to help you navigate this market.âSo letâs take a look at the Wasatch Frontâs supply of single-family homes (excluding townhomes and condos). Right now we have a 4.4 month supply of homes available. Seems like weâd be in a level market, right? Not so fast.If we look at homes by price range, we only have a 3.4 month supply of homes on the market under $350,000. If we look at homes under $250,000, we have just 2.75 months of supply. This poses a real challenge for first-time homebuyers, as theyâre finding they are competing with multiple offers for almost all of the well-priced homes under $350,000.For that reason, weâre seeing condos and townhomes really take off as affordable housing for first-time homebuyers. In this market, we only have a 3.78 month supply of such homes along the Wasatch Front. As a result, weâre seeing buyers try to tie up homes to lock out the competition - sometimes without even seeing the inside of the home before writing an offer! This allows people to lock up a property even though they sometimes cancel the offer down the road after finding a better option. Weâre seeing a lot of this right now.If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!",

        "content": "There are eight things that we feel you can do to compete to get the home you want in the Wasatch market.  Be informed. If thereâs a specific neighborhood, community, or builder youâre interested in, start researching and following them on social media and set up Google alerts. The first line of defense is to know whatâs going on so you can act fast.  Register your name on the internet list. Most of the communities and builders will reach out to those who have interest on their internet lists. Youâll receive news about model homes, property releases, and other updates. If you want to be the first to know, make sure the community or builder knows about you.  Work with a Realtor. We have the inside track and in many cases will be able to alert you to important news before the public is aware of it.  Make a friend. It doesnât hurt to make friends with a sales agent in a community because theyâre great resources for details that other people might not be aware of.  Get pre-approved for a loan. If youâre not pre-approved and you go to buy, you could lose out to someone who is pre-approved.  Check for financing options through the builder. Sometimes builders will provide incentives for using their lender, like assistance with closing costs or money towards upgrades at the design center.  Talk to your Realtor about options and upgrades. Model homes will likely be very upgraded and full of options that raise the price beyond the base price of the property. Having an idea of the options and upgrades that you want will be important for you to know upfront to make sure you can qualify for that loan and still be within the payment youâre comfortable with.  Familiarize yourself with the community and the properties. Intense community interest can cloud judgement and create a frenzy. You never know which line youâll be in for a home. It could be the home youâre dreaming of, and itâs gone by the time you get to the front of the line! Knowing the community well will help you make an informed choice when the time comes.âRealtors have the inside track on many new homes.âIf you or anyone you know has any real estate questions, email me or give me a call!",

        "content": "Today, we are going to talk about inspecting your sewer line before you buy your home, especially if you are buying an older property.The last thing you want to do is spend an additional $2,500 to $10,000 after youâve moved into your new house to accommodate a sewer line problem. I recommend having a small operation inspect the sewer line with their cameras. Large franchise operations tend to recommend replacing the entire sewer line, which is just more money in their pockets.One problem you might encounter is tree roots growing into sewer lines. Roots crawl into tiny openings and expand in the sewer line, latching onto other debris that typically cause backups, such as grease or eggshell waste. Sometimes chemicals can kill the tree roots. However, if the roots reappear, the pipe may be damaged and require excavation to fix the problem. Another option is to have the lines snaked once or twice a year to avoid backup.Another common problem is a belly in the sewer line. A belly is a low area or sag in the sewer line that has lost its positive slope for drainage. This can be caused by a number of factors.  It should only be corrected if the belly is truly causing an actual problem, not just lacking perfection for a short distance. A low area holding a half-inch or so of water for 3 or 4 feet is likely not going to cause a major problem. Consult a licensed plumber after having the sewer line scoped to determine how much of an issue the belly really is.âYou need to get your sewer lines inspected.âIf youâre buying an older home, those sewer lines were often installed in sections or segments. When a connected section does not line up perfectly with the other it is considered âoff-setâ. Not all instances of âoff-settingâ are a problem. Avoid evaluations from large franchise companies and look to a reputable licensed plumber to determine the extent of the issue.Older homes also tend to have sewer lines made of clay or cast iron, which erodes from the inside. Not all older sewer systems will need replacement anytime soon, and not all systems will need a full replacement. You can get away with partial replacement.Again, because the cost of sewer line replacement is high, we recommend you have your sewer line examined by a professional via camera as part of your home inspection process. Then have a good professional plumber take a look at it.If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!",

To decrease the chances of getting your offer rejected, we are going to give you four different reasons why your offer could get rejected.      Your offer price was too low.Sellers can easily feel insulted if a buyer offers too little for their home. They may believe the buyer isnât serious and may even reject the offer outright. If the house just came on the market, itâs much too early for sellers to look at lowball offers or even offers that are more than 5% below asking price.        The buyerâs agent is a jerk.They may scream or raise their voice on the phone, make demands and ultimatums, or insult the listing agent by printing out comparables and inferring that they donât know what they are doing. Whenever a buyerâs agent fails to show professionalism, thatâs bad.        The listing agent represents a competing buyer.A little known agent practice among consumers is the variable or dual-rate commission. This is something that the listing agent has up-front with their sellers. During discussions, the listing agent might say that if they are representing a buyer that ends up purchasing the home, they will take less on their commission. If youâre competing for a home, and the listing agent wrote an offer for another buyer, youâre at a disadvantage. On our MLS in Utah, you can look to see if there is a variable-rate commission on the home. You can always call them and ask as well.        The buyer didnât meet the sellerâs specific needs.The buyerâs agent should always call the listing agent to find out whatâs important to the seller. Itâs not always about the price. If the seller needs a longer escrow period or settlement time, write it in the offer. If they want more earnest money, give them more earnest money. Do whatever you can to stand out in the sellerâs mind. It will help you get the home.  Thanks for joining us today.

Thatâs when the title of the property is transferred from the seller to the buyer. Closing costs are incurred by either the buyer or the seller or, sometimes, both.Typically, home buyers will pay between 2% and 5% of the purchase price of the home in closing fees. These fees include wiring fees, hazard insurance, and priming your escrow account for property taxes, title insurance, appraisal, underwriting, and processing fees.âIn todayâs market, sellers arenât paying closing costs.âThe Wasatch Front market is hot right now, and buyers who try to make the seller pay for closing costs are losing out. There are a lot of multiple offer situations, and buyers are offering to cover closing costs in order to get the home.One way to position yourself to win in a multiple offer situation is to get a premium priced loan. The lender bumps up the interest rate by 0.25% or 0.50%. Then, the lender pays the closing costs, so you donât have to pay money out of your own pocket; your offer then appears stronger to the seller.If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Today, weâre going to talk about what not to do when selling in the surrounding Salt Lake County area.First of all, donât set an unrealistic price. The market is hot right now, so it can be tempting to set an extremely high price for your home. However, buyers are well-educated and know the difference between an accurately priced property and an overpriced one.Overpriced properties sit on the market for a long time. Buyers start to wonder whatâs wrong with those properties. The longer a home sits on the market, the less money you will get. Accurately priced homes actually draw in multiple offers and create a bidding war situation, which drives the price up.âOverpricing your home costs you time and money.âAnother mistake people make is selling without an agent. The National Association of Realtors reports on average, For Sale By Owner properties sell for 12% less compared to homes sold with an agent. Thatâs a lot of money, and itâs less expensive than paying a commission for an agent to sell your home. You will also save time by hiring an agent because selling a home is a full-time job.Not marketing your home is not a good idea. Quicker access to more buyers means your home sells for more money in less time. Your listing agent has a sophisticated marketing plan that will cast the biggest net possible for buyers.Finally, donât skip repairs. According to NAR, 24% of all offers accepted between buyers and sellers fail, and 80% of those fail due to the inspection contingency. If you have deferred maintenance, fix it. The buyer will choose their own preferred vendors, which could cost you more money than it would to hire some people and take care of things on your own.",

Itâs the one room that will largely determine if online buyers will come take a look at your home. To make sure your kitchen looks great, make sure you have matching appliances and fixtures. Also make sure the cabinets are in great shape.  Bathroom. Look at the small things first. Buy a brand new toilet seat and ensure that the sink looks great. Bathrooms also need storage space, so consider adding cabinets if you can!  Exterior. This is always the first thing people look at when deciding whether to buy a home. Remember, the front door is the first impression a buyer has of your home, so you should repaint or restain it if necessary.  Roof. Make sure that the roof is leak-free and in great shape. If you wait for the buyerâs inspector to find a problem with your roof, it could cost you a whole lot of money!  Landscaping.

        "title": "7 Deadly Mistakes for Salt Lake County Home Sellers ",
        "author": "Emily Peterson",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Selling your home is one of the most important steps in your financial life. Today, weâll go over the seven deadly mistakes most home sellers make. Knowing these mistakes will help you maximize your profits, maintain control, reduce stress, and help you make good decisions with your moving goals.Failing to analyze why you are selling. We encourage you to have a very clear motivation when it comes to the decision to sell your home. Many home sellers simply arenât clear on why they are selling their homes, and try to sell for the wrong reasons.  Not preparing your home for the buyerâs eyes. You have one chance to make a good first impression. Nearly all buyers begin their home search online, so pictures are incredibly important. Work closely with your agent to stage the property, and consider hiring a professional photographer to take photos of your home.  Pricing your home incorrectly. Everyone wants to get the most amount of money for their home as possible. Unfortunately, many buyers are unrealistic about their homeâs value. If a home is priced too high, it tends to sit on the market for a long time, causing buyers to wonder whatâs wrong with it. By the time you decide to adjust the price, it is often too late to get a quality buyer. Pricing your home correctly right out of the gate saves you time, money, and reduces time on the market.  Selling too hard during showings. Nothing is more awkward for buyers than having a personalized tour of the home by the seller. Buyers make decisions based on their emotions first, and then justify the decision with logic. A buyer is unable to emotionally attach to a home when a seller gives them the grand tour. Step back and let your agent handle the showings.  Signing a long-term listing agreement without a written performance guarantee. Unfortunately, some agents have a tendency to over-promise and under-deliver. If you sign with that agent, the only time youâll hear from them is when they want to reduce the sales price. You should never get stuck in an agreement without a written guarantee of performance or a cancellation contract that allows you to get out of the contract if you are unhappy with the agentâs performance.  Making it difficult for the buyers to get information on their homes. Buyers are three times more likely to inquire about a home when thereâs no risk of feeling obligated. This means they donât want to have to call you or your agent to get information on the home. Make it easy to get information on your property instantly and free of charge.  Failing to obtain a pre-approved mortgage buyer. You donât want to get stuck with a buyer whoâs unable to get a loan. The first 5 weeks you are on the market are the most important, so you donât want to be under contract for 45 days and find out that the buyer is unable to get financing. Do your due diligence. Make sure the buyer has a full approval letter, and check in with the lender to make sure they have verified all of the buyerâs information.If you have any questions about todayâs video, give us a call or send us an email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Today, weâll talk about what rising interest rates mean for you as a buyer in the Wasatch Front.We know that the Federal reserve Chairman, Janet Yellen, has increased the Federal Reserve rate. What we also learned at that time was the chairman mentioned her plans to continue to gradually increase rates each quarter. The first rate increase was anticipated, so the market was able to absorb most of that increase without seeing much of a change to long term loans like 15 or 30 year mortgages. The next 3 increases will see a bigger impact on the 15-30 year mortgages.For our millennial home buyers, this is a bit of a challenge, as most of their young adult lives they have had rates at or just below the 4% mark. First thing to know is that the 42 year average for interest rates is 8.39%.  If we hit the reset button at 1990 the average interest rate is 6.6%.  All of my blog viewers over 40 are chuckling because they remember buying their first home at rates in the 8% to 15% range.We likely will see interest rates exceed 5% by the end of 2016.  Letâs suppose this is a 1% increase. This is how the 1% increase affects you as a home buyer on an averaged priced home along the Wasatch Front, which is about $275,000. Assuming the loan amount is the purchase price, the principal and interest payment for a 30 year loan at 4% is $1,312.89 if the interest rate goes up to 5% the principal and interest payment  goes to $1,476.26 or $163.37 more than the 4% rate which is about 11% more per month.Over the course of 30 years, a 4% loan with the original principal balance would be $197,642.  On a 30 year loan with a 5% interest rate the total amount paid in interest is $256,453 almost $59,000 more youâd pay in interest if interest rates go up by 1%.The thing to know is that interest rates will go up because they have to go up. When interest rates go up by 1% the cost of your home goes up by 10% or more. Another way of looking at this is that the home at $275,000 becomes the same cost as buying a home at $302,500.I hope this makes sense and helps you digest the affordability of housing now versus the affordability of housing in a historically average market.",

        "content": "There are 4 common strategies that most sellers use to price their homes. It is unwise to assume that a higher asking price will net you a higher selling price. In fact, this equation works in reverse if youâre not paying attention to what the market is telling you. Bear this research in mind when you set your asking price.      Clearly Overpriced â Every seller wants to get the most amount of money they can for their home, and real estate agents know this. If more than one agent is competing for your listing, an easy way to win the battle is to overinflate the value of your home. I can see this in our own market, which has been VERY good for sellers this year by looking at the fact that over 8,500 homes expired. Thatâs 27% of all home sellers who intended to sell and couldnât because of overpricing.        Somewhat Overpriced â About Â¾ of the homes on the market are 5-10% overpriced. These homes will sit on the market longer than you want. There is usually one of two factors at play here: either you believe in your heart that your home is really worth this much, despite what the market has indicated, OR youâve left some room for negotiation. Either way, this strategy will cost you both time on the market and, ultimately, the price that you receive from a buyer.        Priced Correctly at Market Value â Some sellers understand that real estate is part of the capitalistic system of supply and demand. These people carefully price their homes based on a thorough analysis of other homes on the market. These competitively priced homes usually sell within a reasonable time-frame and very close to the asking price.        Priced Below the Fair Market Value â Some sellers are motivated by a quick sale. These homes attract multiple offers and sell fast â usually in a few days â at, or above, the asking price. Be cautious that the agent suggesting this method is doing so with your best interests in mind.

Donât get pre-qualified, get pre-approved: A pre-approval is what you need to stand out as a buyer, and with new TRID rules itâs actually the only designation you can have as a buyer. If youâre pre-approved, youâre on par with a cash buyer.        Keep short time frames on contingencies: Make the inspection and due diligence periods the acceptable length. It usually takes 14 days to complete the inspections and 21 days for the financial paperwork to be completed.        Write a personal letter to the seller: Explain to them why you should be their #1 choice. Tell them about your family and how much you admire the home. Pull on their heart strings a little bit and you could become their #1 choice. Then, have your agent make an offer in person to the seller and their listing agent. This is a powerful move, and it puts more gravity on your offer. Itâs an old school tactic, but sometimes it does the trick.        Ask your agent to present the offer in person. Going along with the emotional connections a seller has with a buyer, itâs much easier to represent you as a buyer when your agent is willing to meet the listing agent and the sellers on their turf. A little communication from your agent directly to the sellers can go a very long way in making a win-win relationship happen.  I have found these techniques to be very useful when the situation calls for it. If you have any further questions, please donât hesitate to contact me.I would love the opportunity to find you your dream home!",

        "content": "Many people are getting ready to put their home on the market this holiday season, so today we wanted to talk about the most common mistakes when selling a home. We want you to avoid these when it comes time for you to sell, no matter what time of year it is. Hereâs what you need to avoid as a seller:      The home isnât readyNothing kills a transaction like a home thatâs unprepared for the market. Hereâs what you need to do to ensure your home is:          Declutter-  Decluttering is a big deal, but you already know that.      Flat surfaces- Make sure you clean off all flat surfaces, which include fridges, countertops, bookshelves, and more. Make sure they only have decorative items on them.      Curb appeal- Make sure to repaint your front door and remove any debris in your yard to help buyers feel more relaxed and comfortable when they walk into your home.      Pay special attention to the kitchen, master bedroom, and master bathroom.      There is nothing worse for your price than showing or photographing a home thatâs not ready.        Too many improvements          Most improvements that you make on your home should be for yourself and your family, because you enjoy them. Many donât generate a positive return. Even putting granite countertops in will only get you seventy cents back for every dollar you spend. Improvements also make things that are unimproved stand out like a sore thumb, which isnât good.        Not hiring the right people          This is one of the most common mistakes I see as a listing agent. After you sign a contract with an agent, itâs hard to get out of because you have to honor the contract. With our contracts, they are day-to-day, up-front, and in writing.      Donât make these mistakes! If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!",

        "author": "Emily Peterson",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today, weâll talk about the TRID Mortgage Disclosure Form, which affects both buyers and sellers. This new integrated disclosure rule is the Federal Governmentâs attempt to clean up and simplify the mortgage closing process. It helps make things easier to understand for buyers. The rule has a good basis, but it also has some unintended consequences for both parties.TRID has now gone into effect. Letâs talk about the good stuff first. Buyers will get the payment on the document signed at closing. We love the new look of this document, because buyers are always concerned with payment. It makes sense. Additionally, you will receive the closing documents directly from the lender, instead of the title company.However, there are some unintended consequences. For instance, changes in concession amounts by the buyer will require a mandatory three-day redisclosure by the lender. This means you canât change this just before the settlement deadline, before you purchase your new home. You have to do all of that in advance.Terms now are changing, which can cause confusion here in Utah. Previously, settlement was defined as closing in the Utah real estate purchase contract. Instead of settlement referring to the title company, it now refers to when everything is recorded. This could also be confusing because the Utah real estate purchase contract has not changed its verbiage and I believe the Federal Government will likely override the stateâs verbiage. Furthermore, we will use consummation now instead of settlement. Consummation refers to what happens when we submit documents to the title company.A change in loan will require a new six-day redisclosure. This is a big deal. Lenders will no longer send documents to the title company, but instead, prepare the documents for themselves. Many lenders are not prepared for this. An average escrow period will shift closer to 45 days, making thirty-day closings a thing of the past. Please note we do not advise accepting or writing an offer with a thirty-day settlement, unless the lender confidently fulfills the new rules. Our preferred vendor has assured us that theyâre able to stick within this thirty-day time frame.Thanks again for taking the time to watch our blog!

        "content": "Do rising interest rates affect home values on the Wasatch Front? The answer might surprise you.Many people are wondering whether they should sell now or wait until the spring season arrives. Hereâs something to think about if you are asking yourself that question: when interest rates increase, the purchasing power of buyers decreases. In fact, if interest rates increase by 1%, the market loses the bottom 18% of first-time home buyers.In addition to those changes, a 1% rise in interest rates makes your home 10% more expensive to the next buyer. Just recently, the Fed has decided to keep rates where they are, but Janet Yellen has made it clear that rates will slowly start creeping up soon. As it is, low interest rates are keeping buyers in the market, and sellers often sell their homes for more money and in less time.If youâre looking for certainty in the marketplace and want your best chance at getting top dollar for your home, now is the time to make your move.

        "content": "Today we are going to talk about real estate investing, crowdfunding style. This morning, when I woke up, I went online and researched crowdfunding in real estate. What I began to notice is that there are dozens of platforms for individuals to begin investing in real estate.Crowdfunding has a distinct advantage in the real estate investment world. Instead of having to invest $50,000-$100,000 of your own money, you can invest as little as $5,000 into an existing investment platform and begin to see returns.However, there are some downsides to this method. You donât get to choose your own properties, and you donât get to see them in person either. Itâs an elusive investment, like the stock market. Itâs something you canât physically see or touch, but itâs there.Thereâs another way to crowdfund in real estate. With local crowdfunding, Iâve had many real estate investors who have created an LLC involving multiple business partners looking to invest in real estate. Local crowdfunding offers some additional benefits that national crowdfunding doesnât.First, you get to choose your own partners. Secondly, you get to choose your own real estate agent. Third, you get to choose the property you buy, and it will be closer to home so you can go see it in person. Finally, you also get to choose the tenants, rental rate, and rental terms. You and your partners are in control of this transaction, and donât have to trust that someone else will make the right decision.If youâre thinking about crowdfunding on a local or national level and youâd like to talk about these options, I would love to talk. Just give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to speaking with you!",

        "title": "Why Should You Get a Home Inspection?",
        "author": "Emily Peterson",
        "category": "",
        "content": "I find most folks are willing to take a used car to a mechanic to look it over before they purchase the car. They probably spend about $150 to do this, and the car may cost between $5,000 and $10,000. So, why wouldnât you consider having your home inspected by a house âmechanicâ before spending $200,000 to $300,000?A professional home inspection can be done at a cost between $350 and $500. Your Realtor can write your contract up to be subject to these inspections. Here are some of the common items I see in inspections, and the costs associated with repairing or replacing any problems the home inspector finds:  Double tapping in the break panel. This usually means you have too many wires feeding into one circuit in your break box, which makes it a fire hazard. Resolving double tapping can cost between $75 and $150, but if the break panel is out of room, you would also need to add a distribution panel at a cost of $1,000.  Heating and Air Conditioning. I find most sellers arenât in the habit of servicing their HVAC systems yearly. This could be a hidden cost passed along to you, the buyer. Servicing the HVAC costs around $75 to $150. If the HVAC hasnât been serviced, you could end up with AC condenser issues ($3,000 to repair) or issues with the furnaceâs heat exchanger ($3,500 to repair). As you can see, servicing your HVAC systems avoids some costly problems down the road.  Attic and Crawl Space issues. This is where we find hidden problems never seen by the homeowner that can explode into large cost problems for you, the buyer, to fix.  Water seepage along the vent flues. Sometimes the rubber boots that go along the flues become cracked, and when it rains or snows, you get water in through those vents. That costs $50 to $100. Ice damming causes water damages along the eves of the property, which could cost $250 to $350 to fix. If water gets in and mold grows or the wood rots, then your repair costs would be thousands of dollars.These are just a few of the common issues we see during home inspections here in Utah. As you can see, an inspection pays for itself. Donât forget, always inspect!A good home inspector can save you lots of money and give you peace of mind. Feel free to email me.

There are two things you really need to know about, and here they are:Student LoansIf youâve had them in the past while applying for or receiving a mortgage, the FHA has allowed lenders to not count deferred payments against you. However, starting September 14, thatâs all about to change. Lenders will now be required to count the full payment, or 2% of the balance, against you. This is important for a lot of people doing income-based repayment. This is going to change your buying power substantially.Installment LoansThese are things like car loans or anything that has a specific time for repayment. In the past, FHA has allowed lenders to not count these against you either if it was less than 10 months to repayment, but that is changing now too. Lenders will not count those payments against you unless that payment is less than 5% of your gross income.Both of these changes are going to significantly affect your qualification. Now is a great time to find a property if youâve been thinking of looking, and you may still be able to avoid these changes.

(We recommend us, but weâre biased.) Why? Because with MLS access, we can get you comparables. In order to say that your home is worth less than the county says it is, youâll need a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 comparable homes which sold in your area during 2011. Real estate agents have access to the true price that those homes sold for.  Next, youâll need to complete an appeal form. We can help you do that.  Then, submit both the comparables and the appeal form to the Salt Lake County Board of Equalization, either by mail or in person. This is located at 2001 State St, Salt Lake City, UT 84190.If you purchased your home during 2014, and your purchase price itself was less than the countyâs assessed value, than the process is also simple: attach a copy of your HUD-1 settlement statement (closing statement) and the appraisal of your home, along with the appeal form. Submit it to the above address, again either by mail or in person.If you refinanced in 2014, you can do the same thing if you have an actual appraisal. Make a copy of the appraisal, fill out the appeal form, and submit it to the above address.There is a deadline, though: the appeal form and any other paperwork must be into the Board of Equalization by September 15th.The good news is that in this process, youâre not alone.

Online marketing involves using photo and video, so you want to make sure that your home looks good. This means youâll want to plant as many flowers as possible, and make your home appear as good as it possibly can.After working on the outside, youâll need to impress the buyers with the inside of your home. This means clearing every flat surface of every object except for decorative items. This includes bookshelves, end tables, and more. You should also make sure that your home is painted uniformly throughout, with no red or neon rooms that would stick out.New paint can actually bring a big return on your investment, and it can go a long way towards attracting buyers to your home.Once you have multiple offers on your home itâs important to evaluate the different offers that you have on your home and decide which one would benefit you the most. Is there a pre-approval or a pre-qualification letter? Are they asking for closing costs? Do they have contingencies?Overall, you have to pick the offer that best suits your needs, and sometimes the highest-priced offer is not the best.Thanks for watching again, and if you need any help buying or selling real estate in Salt Lake City, please donât hesitate to reach out to me.

This is going to be brief, because weâre in the busy summer market here in Salt Lake City, but here is what you need to avoid:  Overestimating how much you can buy: You want to be able to comfortably afford a home when you buy it. A lot of people fail to calculate the monthly expenses of owning a home such as maintenance and repair, as well as insurance. I recommend visiting a qualified lender before committing to buying a home, because he or she can tell you what kinds of properties you can afford, and this will make your home search much easier.  Donât let your emotions get the best of you: I want you to make a top 10 list of the most important things that you need in a house. When you finally buy a home, there will probably only be 5 or 6 things from that list in your home, but you then need to decide which of those things are the most important to you.  Buy with the end in mind: Most people live in a home for around 3-5 years, and when you sell it back, you need to be able to make a profit off of it. Whatever you buy needs to have a broad appeal for the next buyer.Hopefully these tips can help you out when youâre looking to buy a home, but if you need any more help when youâre buying or selling in Salt Lake City, please donât hesitate to contact me.",

We have very little inventory, but there are several things you can do to help you and your offer stand out in this market.The first thing you want to do is make sure you secure a strong pre-approval letter. Have your lender run you through a desktop underwriting system and share it with the agent when you submit your offer. Another thing you can do is write a letter to the seller, letting them know everything you love about the property. Be passionate, sometimes sellers will surprise you with how they respond to heartfelt communication.Asking the listing agent what is important to the seller is a good idea. Maybe they donât care as much about price as they do a closing date or shortened inspection period.Watch out for closing costs. When buyers ask sellers to pay closing costs in this market, itâs going to be problematic. Chat with your lender about how much you need, and make sure you donât take a cent more.Finally, you can submit an escalation clause, which is a way you can get the seller to accept an offer that is above all other offers by a specified amount. Presenting the offer in person is a good idea as well.If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us a quick email. Talk to you soon!",

        "content": "Today I want to talk to you about the affordability of buying a home in todayâs market. As we take a look at the Wasatch Front through the history books, letâs first examine the affordability of a home in 1989.In 1989, the average price of a home was $94,000. The average mortgage interest rate was 10%, making the average monthly payment around $825, with median incomes hovering around the $30,000 mark.Fast forward to 2015, and things have changed for the better. Although the average price of homes is up to $208,000, mortgage interest rates are down near 4%, making the average monthly payment of $995 much more affordable to the average person, whose income has risen to $52,250.âIn 2014, an average person would only have to spend 15% of their income to purchase a home, the 3rd lowest figure on record.âIn 2014, an average person would only have to spend 15% of their income to purchase a home, the 3rd lowest figure on record. From this data, you can see that homes have very rarely been as affordable as they are right now.One thing we want to make sure you know is that interest rates are going to rise this year. We donât know when, but we do know that they are low right now. If you want to find out if now is a good time for you to consider making a jump in the market or at least testing the waters, take a look at some homes, and give us a call.

        "content": "Today Iâm going to take some time to answer your questions about the Salt Lake City and Wasatch Front real estate markets. Iâve been getting questions from a lot of different people regarding some different subjects, so if you donât see your question answered here, please donât hesitate to contact me and Iâd be glad to assist you.  Will we see more Millennials buying in 2015?          Statistically speaking, we are seeing more millennial buyers turning to buying instead of renting, but theyâve been delayed by a stagnant economy. However, we are seeing a huge increase in first-time home buyers, and this is expected to have a ripple effect in the market, which is going to generate a lot of activity in 2015.        What do we expect to see this spring?          I expect to see a lot more home buyers this spring with interest rates so low and great loan products available for first-time buyers. Unemployment is at 3.2%, and with the highest amount of inward migration in the nation, I expect this spring to be particularly busy.        Credit Requirement Loosens:          Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have come out with new loan products that require only a 3% down payment on a home. On top of this, private mortgage insurance premiums for FHA loans have fallen by half of a percent, which could save you $85 per month on a $200,000 home.      Hopefully these topics have been helpful to you. If you need any assistance buying or selling homes in Salt Lake City or the Wasatch Front, please donât hesitate to contact me.

        "content": "I recently came across an interesting article on Zillow that was talking about the strange effect that Starbucks was having on home values across the country.The article basically stated that if you lived within a quarter mile of Starbucks that your home value wouldâve appreciated by 96% from 1997 to 2014. This is compared to a 65% appreciation rate if your home wasnât located near a Starbucks. My only idea of why this could be happening is because often times there is development happening around Starbucks, and that could increase the value of your home.While I still donât know exactly whatâs happening with Starbucks, I do know that supply is low and demand is high in Salt Lake City, which means that itâs a perfect time to put your home on the market. If itâs priced correctly and marketed to the right audience, thereâs no reason why you shouldnât be getting top dollar.If youâre interested in buying or selling real estate in Salt Lake City this spring, please feel free to contact me.

        "content": "Hey everyone, welcome back to our blog. Today we want to discuss a few things you can do to prepare your home for sale in the market this spring on the Wasatch Front.The first thing you have to do is change your mindset. Donât think of your home as a home anymore, think of it as a house, a building that you need to sell. If you treat your home sale more like a business transaction, it will make everything a lot easier.The next thing you want to do is make sure you have an accurate picture of your homeâs value. The first step to doing that is clicking the link below, which will give you a good estimate of your homeâs value. The next step is giving us a call to come out and visit your home. This way we can get the most accurate value for your home, within 1% of what itâs market value is.Now comes pricing the home. Pricing your home with the market will make sure that more buyers see it, and it will sell quicker and for more money.Finally, we want to see how mortgage rates can affect you as a home seller. For instance, if rates were to go up by 1%, we would lose the bottom 18% of first time home buyers, who are the people actually driving the market. Without them in the market, nobody else can move up, and the market becomes stalled.We are currently at about 50% of the historical average for interest rates. Every time rates increase by just 1%, the cost of owning a home rises by 10%.If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call or send us an email anytime. Weâd love to set up a time to meet with you and discuss your real estate goals.",

So letâs take a look at what we believe is in store for the housing market in 2015.First of all, we are starting out at a much stronger pace than we did at this time last year. With the government shutdown, a lot of the nation experienced a slow down in real estate last year. Overall, oursales volume is down about 4.5% on the Wasatch Front, however the median home price is up 3% which is a good thing.What we are looking for in 2015 is simple: a stable supply of homes. Anywhere from a 4-6 month supply of homes is considered a balanced market , and thatâs what we would like to see. We firmly believe inventory will stabilize in 2015 and we will see a moderate amount of housing appreciation.Thanks again for taking a moment to check out our predictions for 2015.

These buyers typically have either recently sold their home and are looking to find a new one quickly, or are moving from an area outside the Wasatch Front.

        "title": "An Expert Described the Market as a &quot;Crapshoot&quot; - We Disagree",
        "author": "Kaitlyn Brown",
        "category": "",
        "content": "We came across a CNN Money article the other day in which an expert described the real estate market as a âcrapshoot.â He explained that there is no guarantee that home prices will continue to rise, so investing in real estate is essentially a gamble. In a sense, heâs right - market conditions are ultimately unpredictable. But the fact that there are no guarantees in real estate doesnât mean you canât make a safe bet.There are a lot of variables when investing in real estate. For instance, if you are looking for a new construction property and only plan on living there for a few years, yourâe going to want to get a great price on it so you can get a good return on your investment. On the other hand, if you are interested in a new construction property where you plan to live for 10-15 years, you donât have to worry as much about what youâre paying to get the property. Your particular circumstances play a role in how market conditions will affect you.Another thing to remember is that real estate is local - conditions vary depending on the particular area. If we look at the East Bench area of the Wasatch Front, we have a 4 or 5 month supply of homes. Once we focus on a particular price range things begin to change; under the $300,000 price range we have a less than 4 month supply, whereas for homes over $500,000 weâve got close to a 5 month supply. The larger the supply of homes, the lower the pressure on pricing - which means it takes longer for appreciation to occur.So, the article can be seen as overstating something that is pretty much common sense - home appreciation relies heavily on inventory, and available inventory is always changing. But, as weâve seen, inventory levels vary depending on locale, so a national report tells us little about conditions on the Wasatch front.Investing in real estate isnât a gamble. Itâs a matter of finding the right agent to help you negotiate and leverage to find an ideal price. Depending on what your goals are for you next move, an agent can help you make sure you find a property that is the right fit so that, when you plan on selling, you have equity to sell.We hope to be your number one source for real estate information in Salt Lake County.
