        "content": "A question we get asked almost every day in our business is, âWhen is the best time for me to sell my house?âWith our area being so dense, buying or selling a home can be done at basically any time of year. However, this doesnât mean there arenât seasonal factors at play. We live in a cold-weather market, which means our market cycle is different from those located in warmer climates.When the weather here starts to warm up, then the market tends to heat up too. If you want to know when the best time to sell is, youâve got to pay attention to current market statistics. Understanding market trends is the key to success in real estate.âIf you or anyone you know is thinking of selling, now is a good time to make your move.âSo far this year, weâve seen a decrease in the number of contracts being written compared to what we saw this same time last year. Still, there has been a slight increase in inventory after a very long period of decreasing supply.The market is set up statistically for a shift. With that information in mind, think about anyone you know who is thinking of selling in the next three to 18 months. Conditions are now slowly shifting to benefit buyerâs more, so if you or anyone you know is thinking of selling, now is a good time to make your move.My team and I watch market statistics on a weekly basis, so we have clear evidence that this shift is on its way.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Today weâre counting down the top three mistakes that home sellers make when they put their home on the market.3. Not saying âyesâ to a showing request. You should always say yes. The buyer and the buyerâs agent have carved out time in their schedules to come and see your home. If we ask them to schedule for another day, ask to move the time, or decline altogether, we may never hear from them again. Even if we follow up and ask them to please reschedule, they will probably go out and find another home.2. They donât rise to the occasion and prepare the property to show in the best light possible. Itâs so important that your property looks great. Make sure that you declutter, clean, and make repairs and updates. With wide-angle lenses and enhanced photographs, our first sale is online. Your home has to look amazing online, or the buyer may not come into your home to start with.âYou should always say âyesâ to a showing request.â1. They refuse to listen to market data and price the home correctly for the market conditions. You cannot afford to overprice your home. When you are getting your home ready for the market, itâs important to pay attention to market conditions and price your home accordingly.Those are the three most important things you should keep in mind when preparing to sell your home.If you are thinking of selling your home and would like to know what your home is worth in the current market, just give me a call or send me an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today, I want to go over what interest rates are doing in the local market and how they impact buyers and sellers.Since the beginning of 2018, mortgage interest rates have increased from 4.0% to 4.625% for a 30-year mortgage. That might not seem like a significant jump, and, historically speaking, a 4.625% interest rate is still very low.Hereâs the thingâthat increase has an impact on a buyerâs ability to borrow money to buy real estate.âAn increase in interest rates means a decrease in buying power.âIf you are a homebuyer and you want a specific monthly mortgage payment based on your income, youâve lost 7.2% in purchasing power. That means you have the ability to buy 7.2% less home for the same monthly payment.As a seller, since people who are interested in buying your home have lost some purchasing power, there will be a downward effect on prices and the offers that they might be able to make.That said, the real estate market in Chicago is still very strong. This is a fairly recent development but it is significant, so I wanted to make sure that everyone was aware of it.It looks like rates will continue to increase over the course of 2018. If you have any questions about how rising interest rates will impact your 2018 real estate goals, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

        "content": "Today I wanted to introduce you to Laura Jones, the buyerâs agent for our team here at Carter Property Group, so that you can get to know her and have some of your questions answered by her.Whatâs a buyerâs agent?I focus solely on the purchase of our clientsâ homes. First-time homebuyers, investors, upsizing, downsizingâI only work on the buy side of the transaction. Â Any client we have has to sit down with me for a consultation. Iâm able to get an idea of their needs in about 30 to 40 minutes. Â Once we do that, we begin searching and going out into the field to look at homes. After that, when weâre ready, I write the contract and negotiate the terms.So essentially, I do needs-assessment through a consultation, preview homes on the MLS, set up searches for people, take people out into the field to view homes (sometimes as many as 40 properties a week), write offers and negotiate terms once a property is selected, and eventually get it under contract. Iâm able to service clients at a very high level.What does a typical day look like for you?I wake up in the morning, shake my son awake and take him to school, and then I get to the office. I generally block off my morning for business calls and finding properties that arenât yet on the market for our clients. Iâll take lunch and maybe make time for a workout, and then for the rest of the afternoon and evening Iâll block out that time period to be able to go out into the field with clients.So the MLS is only one source that you use to find properties for clients?Absolutely. Sometimes Iâll send out mailers and follow it up with a call. Sometimes the property for our clients isnât always on the market at the time. That allows me to block a whole morning to find properties and preview them.Whatâs your favorite part of your job?As a buyerâs agent, my favorite part of my job is the fact that I do get to know my clients in a really intimate way. I spend a lot of time with them and their families, I get to know personal things about them, and after the transaction, we donât really fall off. I love checking in with them. They send me photos of remodels, updates, babies, and more. Itâs just really rewarding. I donât take it lightly that buying a home is probably the most money youâre ever going to spend.âHelping someone get into their new home is pretty powerful. I love it.âHelping someone get into their new home is pretty powerful. I love it.If you have any questions about property, taxes, or anything real estate-related, give us a call.

Going in with a 203(k) loan, Paul is borrowing a little bit more money than the purchase price of the property in order to put some money back into that property.ââWe train really hard on stuff like thatâhow to listen, how to find out where people are, and how to ask a question to dig deeper about emotions.ââKnowing that extra money was there to handle problems created a sense of calmness, but the homeâs inspection revealed three relatively big ones: asbestos, residual termite damage, and some fascia on some of the gutters, which is a complicated fix. Moving forward, weâve uncovered a layering of information and still have some unknowns to decide on in order to proceed.Paul jokes that heâs almost fired two people so far, but having the experience of feeling like heâs not being heard was invaluable to him because he always wants our clients to feel like theyâre being heard, as do I.What weâve seen for a long time, and what partially explains this feeling if youâre a homebuyer, is that the further away a person involved in the transaction is from the actual transaction and the core facilitators of that transaction (i.e., the agent), the more youâre just a file to them. They donât have the first-hand connection to your goals, your situation, and your timeline. We always keep these factors in mind when working with our clients.âWe train really hard on stuff like thatâhow to listen, how to find out where people are, and how to ask a question to dig deeper about emotions.âWeâll keep you posted on the next steps of this transaction and relay some more first-hand knowledge on the subject.

Being in the same shoes as you are has helped him understand the process better.âThis experience has been invaluable to Paul as an agent.ââItâs been unique,â he says. âItâs a constant reminder of where our clients are at different stages of the process and how those stages are being influenced, either by the other agent, the seller in this situation, the home inspector, timeliness of responseâall of that stuff is really kind of communicated in a heavy, tangible way what our clients are going through.âThe amount of documentation buyers have to provide to their lenders has stood out as the most vivid part of the process for him. As easy as lenders make that exchange, heâs found that it can still be tense as far as the level of detailed knowledge they have about you. Once he finished getting pre-approved and entered negotiations, keeping his end-goal in mind helped him deal with the emotions of that situation and navigate all the hypothetical scenarios that arose.âContinually coming back to the goal made it crystal clear what we were trying to accomplish.âIn the next part, weâll discuss what happens during the home inspection.

Joining me again is Rees , a client of ours who has recently used short-term rentals in her investing strategy.To watch the first part in this series, click here.In the first part of this series, Rees explained the return she received on this investment.Â Initially, returns were in the single digits. From a percentage standpoint, though, short-term rentals produced a 50% higher return than long-term rentals. Her family also decided to outsource the management of these properties, so they hired a company who handles the management of similar internal units, and that 50% was after that management companyâs fees.When it comes to managing the property itself, her workload has decreased because their management company, like most management companies, has a handyman on call for maintenance issues within short-term properties. Many people wonder how much time theyâll have to devote to managing residential rental property, and the answer is usually less than you think.âAlways have a good team in place when investing in short-term rentalsâRees has two main points of advice for anyone thinking about buying an investment property. The first is to leave a little bit of a buffer from a dollar standpoint, especially with short-term rentals. This is because there is a little bit of upfront capital investment required, and issues can arise that youâll need money set aside for.Itâs also critical to have a good team in place. Rees had a great real estate attorney and a home inspector working for her, and they advised her against buying a different property that wouldâve caused her a lot of headaches.We want to thank Rees for joining us today to help us explore the topic of short-term rentals.

For the second part of this series, click here.To discuss how short-term rentals can make a wise real estate investment strategy, weâve brought in Rees, a client of ours whoâs recently found success investing in short-term rentals.Rees had a few goals in mind when she got into real estate investing. Though she wasnât initially thrilled about the idea, after a few conversations with us, it became clear to her that it was a great option to add to the current investments she has from a diversification standpoint. She also considered it important to gain some passive income in addition to her job. On a more personal note, it was important for her to have an investment dedicated to the medical needs of her son.âFrom a percentage standpoint, though,Â short-term rentals produced a 50% higher return than long-term rentals.âTo clarify, whereas âactive incomeâ is whatever comes from your primary occupation, âpassive incomeâ is typically the category where real estate investing falls, and thatâs the way the IRS categorizes it as well.Rees was initially looking for multi-unit properties (specifically three-unit) with long-term renters, and she was identifying them specifically based on whether they would be a good investment numbers-wise and make sense from their return perspective.One property in particular came up that was significantly higher in return. That property had one of its three units as a short-term rental. She then realized that short-term rentals could be applied to other three-unit properties with long-term renters. Once she was able to take that idea and apply it to other properties, several more options became available.Initially, returns were in the single digits. From a percentage standpoint, though, short-term rentals produced a 50% higher return than long-term rentals. Her family also decided to outsource the management of these properties, so they hired a company who handles the management of similar internal units, and that 50% was after that management companyâs fees.We want to thank Rees for joining us today to help us explore the topic of short-term rentals!

One home, in particular, belonged to a couple in their 90s, who needed help getting the drywall cut out, the carpet removed, and baseboards replaced.Overall, this experience has been incredibly rewarding.

From a management perspective, you as the landlord must offer the property furnished.

Hereâs why.Even though prices have gone up steadily over the last five years, the key question is how much it costs to borrow money from a mortgage lender to buy a home. At 4% interestâthe prevailing rate we see right nowâthe principal and interest payment for a $100,000 loan is only $477 a month. It would be just under $1,200 a month for a $250,000 loan, before taking into consideration any association fees or âassessmentsâ if you buy a condominium, as well as a county property tax bill.âIn many cases, your monthly payments to buy a house are cheaper than your rent.âRental rates here in the Chicagoland market have been high and increasing over the last five years. If you rent now and youâre getting sick of paying your landlordâs mortgage, you really should consider buying a home.

Today weâre looking at those numbers from March 2016 to March 2017.Â âThe median days on market has gone down 16% compared to this time last year.â1.) The first is the median increase in sales price. In the last 12 months weâve seen a 7.6% median increase in sales price across all property types in the entire metro area.2.) The second number, the median days on market, is decreasing. In fact, weâve seen the median days on market go down by 16% compared to last year.3.) The next number is the monthâs supply of inventory, which is a measurement of how many months it would take to sell all the inventory currently on the market if no new properties were added, is very helpful in determining if we are in a sellerâs, buyerâs, or balanced market. Weâve actually seen a decrease in the months supply of inventory of 16% in the last year and have been hovering in a firm sellerâs market. Â 4.) That brings me to the final number to look at, the number of properties for sale. There are more than 6,000 fewer properties for sale than this time last year, which means competition is increasing. So what does that mean for you? More competition is great news for sellers because houses are selling faster and for more money.

In our last video, we covered improvements you can make to your surface areas to spruce up your home. Today weâre back with a few more upgrades that will make your home really stand out.First and foremost, you want to be strategic and economical about the updates you undertake, but keep in mind that upgrades are crucial as buyers are very critical.The areas youâll want to focus on are the kitchen and bathrooms.For the kitchen, youâll want new countertops, a new sink and faucet, new hardware for the cabinets and drawers, and new appliances. You should also consider adding a backsplash or at the very least, painting. Those things will get you the most bang for your buck in your kitchen.âThe areas youâll want to focus on are the kitchen and bathrooms.âAs far as the bathroom goes, the first thing youâll want to look at is the condition of the flooring. Also, make sure you take a look at the area surrounding the tub and/or the shower, as well as the condition of the vanity.Â The good news is that vanities and sinks are generally inexpensive upgrades. Another inexpensive update to consider is adding a new light fixture as that will really make the bathroom pop.Updates can bring some pretty significant returns and there are ways to update your home on a budget. On the other hand, if you really believe you donât have the money to upgrade those rooms, youâll need to be prepared to sell at a lower price.One of the things my team and I have successfully done over the years is help navigate sellers to the best upgrades for their homes that will have the best returns. If youâre thinking about selling, we can definitely help you key in on the things that will be the most important to buyers.If anyone you know is looking to buy, sell, or invest in real estate or you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to me.

The Federal Reserve has just increased their interest rates by 0.25%.The media may lead you to believe that it will have a direct relationship to the interest rates on the open market, but thatâs not the case. We saw rates creeping up toward the end of last week and throughout this week in anticipation of the announcement.âWeâre still in a strong sellerâs market.âIf youâre buying or selling a home in todayâs market, what does this mean for you? In Chicagoland, we have a very strong sellerâs market for the most part. Weâre in the heart of our spring selling season and homeowners are able to sell quickly and at or above list price. Because there are fewer properties available, buyers are competing for limited inventory. Thatâs driving prices up.If youâre looking to make a move later this year or early next year, you should take a look at the market now and see if you would have a better advantage with rates where they are now. If rates continue to go up, it makes sense for you to buy now. As they increase, your buying power will decrease.

        "content": "What are the three areas of your home that need to be in tip-top shape before listing? It really comes down to the big surface areas.That being said, the first thing you want to spend money on is paint. By the time you are ready to sell your home, your walls probably have accumulated some scratches. A clean coat of paint will make your property shine and youâll see a great return on that investment.Next, you want to focus on your floors.If you have carpet and there are signs of wear and tear, replacing it is your best option. Otherwise, make sure to give it a thorough cleaning if the carpet is still in good shape. Hardwood flooring is a favorite among buyers, so if there is damage to the hardwood floors, it might wise to have them professionally buffed and refinished.It is very important to buyers that a home is move-in ready and all the major surface areas are taken care of, so spending the extra money to make sure the hardwood floors are in great shape will pay off.Finally, consider investing in some new lighting fixtures. If a room or space is dark and doesnât produce a lot of light, it will be a huge turnoff for buyers. LED lights have become a new standard in the real estate industry, both for their cost effectiveness and their ability to really brighten up a room.âIt is very important to buyers that a home is move-in ready and all the major surface areas are taken care of.âInvesting in those three things will not only give your home a fantastic, fresh feeling, but will almost always guarantee a great return. If you or anyone you know is looking to buy, sell, or invest in real estate, please donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help!",

        "content": "Today, I wanted to take a moment to compare the 2016 Chicago real estate market to that of 2015.As we left 2016, we found that weâre in a slight sellerâs market here in Chicago; homes sold at a faster pace and for more money than in 2015. Thatâs all good news for sellers.On the buyer side, youâll find that you have to be ready to make a decision once you find a property thatâs the right fit. Thatâs because properties are selling faster than they typically would. However, there is good news for buyers. Interest rates are still incredible. Due to low rates, buyers have a lot of buying power.âDue to low rates, buyers have a lot of buying power.âHave you been considering getting into the real estate investment market here in Chicago? Are you already the owner of an investment property? It continues to be a really strong market for us here in Chicago. Demand for rentals keeps going up as well. In fact, weâve seen increases for the last four years in a row. The speed at which units re-rent is very fast.If you have any questions about the Chicago market or youâre thinking about selling your house or buying an investment property, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email with any questions at all. Iâd be happy to help.",
