        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "If the appraisal comes in low, you have four options as a buyer or seller. Low appraisals are happening more frequently this year because low inventory is putting upward pressure on pricing. In most residential single-family unit sales, they’re basing pricing on comparable sales data, otherwise known as comps. The comps they’re using have already closed, so it’s historical data. As inventory is lowered and prices increase, the data is months old, so it isn’t justifying the higher price. The appraisers will keep up with the market but only at a conservative rate, which could lead to appraisal shortfalls, or low appraisals. You have four options if you receive a low appraisal:1. Either party can walk away. The earnest money can return to the buyer, and no deal happens. That’s always an option in an Oklahoma real estate commission contract. 2. The buyer can bring cash to cover the difference. If they’re putting 20% or more down, it may not even affect their loan amount to cover the distance between the appraisal and purchase price.3. The seller can lower the price to the appraised value. This generally happens when the buyer doesn’t have enough cash to cover the difference.4. The buyer and seller can meet in the middle. Maybe the buyer only has a few thousand extra dollars, so the seller can come down some of the way. You can bridge the gap to get the deal done. Issues like this can always arise, which is why we always recommend you work with an experienced, educated real estate agent to guide you through the process, whether you’re a buyer or seller. “We always recommend you work with an experienced, educated real estate agent.”If you have further questions about low appraisals or anything else concerning real estate, reach out via phone or email today.

        "title": "Q: How Do You Win Out in a Multiple-Offer Situation?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Speed and strength are what make a winning offer.&nbsp; As of right now, we have just 1.5 months of inventory in our Oklahoma City metro market, which is incredibly low. If no new homes came onto the market, it would take just a month and a half to sell off all homes across all price points. Since six months of inventory is considered a balanced market, we’re in a very strong seller’s market. This means many properties are fetching multiple offers and prices are being pushed upward. If you’re a buyer, there are two keys to remember to compete in a multiple-offer situation. 1. Speed. Submit your offer as quickly as possible—I recommend doing it the very same day the home goes on the market. We always advise sellers that their first offer is usually their best, so the quicker you turn your offer in, the better your chance of having it accepted.2. Strength. When it comes to strength, there are four areas to focus on:  Price: The higher the price, the more likely the seller will pick your offer.  Closing costs: Are you paying your own or asking the seller to pay some of them? With so much pressure on pricing, there’s a higher likelihood that some appraisals will come in low. If you’re asking the seller to pay some closing costs in this situation, your offer becomes less attractive.   Earnest money: Purchase contracts in Oklahoma are very favorable in terms of buyer protection, meaning you can put down more earnest money and still be protected. It won’t cost you any more to show the buyer you’re serious.   Flexibility: If you use a good agent, they’ll chat with the listing agent to find out if there’s anything your party can do to tailor the contract to the seller’s needs. “Many properties are fetching multiple offers and prices are being pushed upward.”Bonus tip: Cover appraisal shortgages. When prices are being pushed upward, sellers can get concerned that their home’s appraisal will come in low in a financed deal. If you want to make your offer more attractive, offer to cover appraisal shortages up to a certain amount. For example, if a house is agreed to be sold for $300,000 but only appraises for $290,000, the buyer can typically back out of the deal unless the seller agrees to drop the price to the appraised amount. If you really want to win the home, though, you can tell the seller that you’ll cover any appraisal difference as long as it doesn’t exceed $10,000. As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help. ",

        "title": "What’s the Difference Between Appraisals and Inspections?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "I&rsquo;m explaining the difference between appraisals and inspections. When purchasing a home, everyone’s told to get an inspection and appraisal. However, some mistakenly think they’re the same thing. Anytime you’re financing a property, your bank will hire an appraiser. The bank you receive a loan from will use your home as collateral, and an appraisal provides proof of your property’s value. Some types of loans such as FHA, VA, and sometimes USDA have rigid requirements regarding the home’s condition, so any issues found by an appraiser must be fixed. If an appraiser says, for example, that three particular things need to be repaired, those fixes are mandatory.“Appraisers look for value, inspectors look for condition.”An inspection is a little different. An inspector will do a more thorough examination of the house than an appraiser. Issues found by an inspector are only recommendations and are completely negotiable between the buyer and seller.

        "content": "When you want to know how the market is doing, you need to know the price range that you&rsquo;re looking in. Here&rsquo;s why. One question I get asked all the time is, “How’s the market?” It’s a really hard question for us to answer because it depends on a number of different factors.Every price range has a different market. When we hear this question, our agents will pull a quick analysis of your particular market, which you can see at 0:37 in the video above. It shows all of the homes in a given price range in a given area, as well as the months of inventory.Generally, six months is considered a balanced market. Anything less is a seller’s market, and anything more is a buyer’s market. In a seller’s market, prices typically have an upward pressure and in a buyer’s market, there’s downward pressure.“The $100,000 to $200,000 price range in Edmond is a hot market.”For example, take a look at the Edmond market between $100,000 and $200,000. There were 355 homes sold in the last six months, for an average of around 60 per month. There are only 33 properties on the market right now, so we have just 0.5 months of inventory. If you’re in the $100,000 to $200,000 price range in Edmond, it’s a fantastic time to enter the market. Let’s contrast that with what the market is doing in Edmond in the $400,000 to $500,000 market. There have been 150 home sales in the last six months, which means we’re selling around 25 homes per month. With 122 homes active on the market right now, we have just about five months of inventory.What does all of this mean? You really need an expert on your side who knows the market that you’re in and what it’s doing. In the lower price ranges, sellers have the advantage, while it’s more balanced in the higher price ranges.If you have questions about the numbers in your area or anything else related to real estate, feel free to reach out via phone or email.

        "content": "The way you paid mortgages and rents are different. Today we&rsquo;ll discuss this. Do you know the difference between how mortgages and rents are paid? Here’s a quick overview to refresh your memory:  Rent is paid in advance. For example, if you pay your rent on January 1, that rent applies to the entire month of January. Mortgages are the opposite. Your January mortgage payment won’t be due until February. This knowledge comes in handy when moving from a place you’re renting to a home you’re buyingIf you have a lease that’s up, for example, on June 30, we can shoot for a target closing date on your new house somewhere in the middle of June, so let’s say June 15. This gives you two weeks to move out of your current residence and into your new property, and time to get your rental into a condition in which to get your deposit back. If you close on June 15, your first payment won’t actually be due until August 1. You will pay interest for the month of June, then the July payment isn’t due until August 1. This is invaluable when working with moving costs and ensuring you aren’t making double payments.If you have questions about how this may work for your situation or real estate in general, please give us a call or send us an email.

Today, I’ll share what each of them is and what they entail.1. FHA loans. While this loan is commonly associated with and used by first-time homebuyers, you don’t have to be buying your first home to make use of it. Buyers of all types will be happy to know that this loan allows them to get into a property for just 3.5% down. However, there is a $294,000 maximum loan amount for this product. 2. VA loans. These loans are specifically designed for veterans, who can use it to buy a home with zero down. The max loan for this is also fairly generous, at around $453,000. Better yet, the loan also reduces or removes the expense of mortgage insurance, depending on your circumstances. 3. Conventional loans. This is perhaps the most common type of loan product. Those who use it can put as little as 3.5% down, but submitting a down payment of at least 20% is preferable if you want to lower your monthly payments. 4. Jumbo loans. If you need to borrow more than $453,000, this is the loan product you’ll need to get. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

First of all, let’s say you’ve decided to move and you’ve found the perfect home for you and your family. In scenario one, you catch the seller right as they’re sticking a “For Sale” sign in the yard. In scenario two, you come across the home after it’s been on the market for 170, 190, 210, or even 240 days. How much different would your offer be between those two scenarios? “Overpricing your property right out of the gate can cost you thousands of dollars.”If you’re thinking you’d offer much less in the second scenario, that’s exactly my point: The longer a home is on the market, the less buyers are willing to pay for it. We agents can’t sell properties for more than their market value, but we can make sure your home doesn’t have a stigma following it around because of its high days on market. That’s why you must price your home properly right out of the gate.If you’d like to know more about how to price your home to sell or you have any other real estate questions I can answer, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "When you’re considering the investment worthiness of a property, it’s easy to forget the factors that should be paramount in your decision. Here are three to keep in mind: 1. Monthly principal payments. We’ve talked a lot about positive and negative cash flow, but let’s not forget that every month you’re paying down the principal balance on the mortgage, which serves as a sort of forced savings. When trying to discern a good deal from a bad deal, compare the principal you’d pay on a given property to other types of long-term investment for retirement. “Real estate is one of those assets that appreciates each year, yet it depreciates in the eyes of the tax law.”2. Potential additional income derived from late fees. Every now and then, a tenant might be late on their rent payment, and you’ll earn a little extra income from the attached late fee. Everyone’s happy in the end: The tenant is able to stay in the property for a small fee on top of rent, and you feel justly compensated for the late payment.3. Appreciation over time. This is why I love investment property. Real estate is one of those assets that appreciates each year, yet it depreciates in the eyes of the tax law. Did you know you can actually depreciate your property while you own it by deducting the cost of buying or improving it? Before you go this route, though, be sure to consult with your CPA on what’s most appropriate for your specific situation. If you have any questions or would like more details about these key factors when investing in real estate, please don’t hesitate to let me know.

In reality, they’re simply failing to account for other expenses. Instead, consider this approach: the 50% rule. This rule asserts that 50% of the rent you collect should go to your monthly expenses and as long as your principal interest is below that 50% threshold, you’ll have a property with positive cash flow on your hands.

To find the max sales price, we take the ARV and subtract from it the cost of those repairs and updates, as well as any potential profit.“The maximal sales price of a fixer-upper home is calculated by taking the ARV and subtracting from it the costs of repairs and the potential profit gained from selling the home.”Conversely, when we sell a home that needs updates, it’s critical to understand how a buyer looks at such a property. In this case, we take a similar approach: We subtract any costs for the repairs needed and we also have to account for the profit someone is going to make on the house when we sell it. Buyers won’t typically buy a house that needs work without some kind of incentive to take on the extra work and risk.To reiterate: The maximal sales price of a fixer-upper home is calculated by taking the ARV and subtracting from it the costs of repairs and the potential profit gained from selling the home.If you have any questions about this topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

However, you should know that pools only bring about a 10% return on interest in terms of market value. It isn’t just “fun” home upgrades that offer little value. Practical repairs like a new roof or a new HVAC system will also bring little to no return. Buyers expect these areas of your home to be in good, working condition. Instead of seeing it as added value, they simply see it as a given. “Upgrading your home won’t always bring more value, but strategic improvements can still help you sell.”But what about new carpet or paint? These two items almost always appear on lists of the best upgrades to make before you sell, but the truth is that they will only add value in certain circumstances. If a home badly needs freshening up, new carpet and paint are a good idea. If the home is already in near-perfect condition, though, new carpet and paint won’t make as big of an impact as you might expect. The bottom line is this: Upgrading your home won’t always bring more value, but strategic improvements can still help you sell if your home isn’t up to its full potential without them. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

Even the most well-intentioned sellers may be tempted to fall back on a quick fix rather than a long-lasting solution. Most sellers simply don’t have the time to focus on repairs given everything else they’ve got to handle during their home sale.“Even the most well-intentioned sellers may be tempted to fall back on a quick fix rather than a long-lasting solution.”If the seller does choose to take care of repairs, though, they should always hire a third-party contractor.

A pre-foreclosure home is not.”A home that’s listed as a foreclosure is actually already for sale. If a home is listed as a pre-foreclosure, it’s technically not for sale. Zillow identifies these properties by a lis pendens, which essentially means that the homeowner has missed a payment or two on their mortgage and are in danger of pre-fault. Once they record the lis pendens on the title, it lets other people know that a couple of different things could happen:1.The resident catches up on their payments.2.The property goes into foreclosure, but we don’t know what price it will be until that time.3.The property could be sold without hitting the market at all.In conclusion, if you’re looking for a home in the next few months, I’d steer clear of pre-foreclosures. If you have any questions for me about buying a home or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "It can be hard to remove personal feelings from a real estate deal. After all, our homes are incredibly important to us. So when it comes time to buy or sell a home, it can be hard to know whether you’re making decisions driven by logic or whether you’re letting your emotions take the wheel.Today we’ll be covering five strategies that can help you determine whether you’re making choices for the right reasons during your buying or selling experience:1. Ask yourself: If you sleep on the decision, will you feel the same way in the morning? Sometimes in the heat of the moment, we can convince ourselves that a certain choice is the only way to go. After giving ourselves more time to think, though, we may come to a different conclusion. Applying this strategy to the decisions you make during your home purchase could save you from making a major mistake. 2. Ask yourself: Are you thinking about your feelings, or about what makes the most sense? Everyone wants to earn the best possible deal when it comes to real estate. With that being the case, the people on the other side of your transaction may have a very different idea of how things should proceed. If this happens, it’s important not to let any of the emotions this might bring out cloud your judgment. “When it comes time to buy or sell a home, it can be hard to know whether you’re making decisions driven by logic, or whether you’re letting your emotions take the wheel.”3. Ask yourself: Is what you want to say going to actually help, or just make you feel better? Any conversation that will legitimately move the deal forward is one you should certainly have. That said, it’s best to think twice before blurting out something you might regret. 4. Ask yourself: Are you simply reacting on impulse, or are you thinking through your decisions? Gut reactions are rarely the most fruitful responses in a real estate deal. Acting in accordance with a carefully thought-out plan will be much more helpful to your ultimate goal.   5. Ask a trusted advisor for their opinion. Sometimes, the answer you need can’t come from within. Seeking out the guidance of a professional, instead, may sometimes be your best option.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

According to the numbers, though, this simply isn’t true.Although it is true that more homes sell during the first quarter, there are fewer homes that come on the market during the fourth quarter, so the absorption rate is higher during that time.For example, during the fourth quarter of 2017, there were 1,014 new listings that came on the market and 834 homes that went under contract. If you do the math, that’s the market absorbing 82% of the new inventory.“If you’re thinking of selling your home sometime in the next six months, I highly recommend doing it during the fourth quarter of this year instead of the first quarter of next year.”During the first quarter of this year, there were 1,446 new listings that came on the market and 1,121 homes that went under contract, which means the market only absorbed 77% of the new inventory.As you can see, more homes sell during the first quarter, but the competition is also higher, which is why the chances that you can sell your home during that time actually decrease by 5%.

A balanced market is one which has six months of available inventory, yet our current market has just three months’ worth of supply right now. In other words, sellers currently have a strong advantage. 2. It’s important not to overspend on updating your listing. Doing some home improvements before you list can help you earn top dollar, but not all projects will be worth the investment. Partnering with your agent to determine which updates will bring the best ROI will be essential. 3. The more people who see your home, the better. Don’t limit the number of showings you take on. “Only professional agents have the knowledge, experience, and resources necessary to achieve optimal results in our market.”4. Fairly priced homes will see the best results. With that in mind, make sure you don’t overprice your home. Even in a strong seller’s market, overpricing can extend the time your listing sits on the market and ultimately lose you money. 5. Hiring an agent to help with your sale is crucial.

The typical cost of these types of pools ranges from between $40,000 and $110,000. This figure does not account for the additional expenses of landscaping or fencing.As a general rule, pools tend to add between 10% and 20% of what they cost to install onto the value of a property.

        "content": "As a homebuyer, there are five things you need to know about new construction homes.1. Some new construction homes may not be listed on the MLS. Oftentimes, builders don’t list new construction homes until they’re close to completion. This is because if they list it as soon as the slab is put down and nobody buys it for a long time, that might hurt the home’s days on market. A home may become more difficult to sell if it’s listed for too long. Always ask a local agent to help you find shadow inventory that’s available but may not be listed.2. New homes are often sold before they’re built. A builder will generally get financing lined up and the new construction and sale process mapped out.3. The first buyers may get the best discounts. Early in the sale process, the first buyers may be able to negotiate the price down. With this reward, however, there is also a potential risk. As an early buyer, you’re fully committed to the project.“Always ask a local agent to help you find shadow inventory that’s available but may not be listed.”4. Builders don’t have personal relationships with the homes. For them, building a home is a business—it’s more spreadsheet than sentiment. They’re focused on making sure you’re qualified to buy the home and they set their prices based on the local inventory, although there may be room for negotiation.5. Discounts may be available in the form of upgrades. Very rarely will a builder discount the price of a new construction home, and there are several reasons why. First, they don’t want to hurt comparable sales in the rest of the neighborhood because that could hurt appraisals. Second, if they give a price discount to one buyer, they may have to give the same discount again and again to other buyers. If you’re buying the last house in the neighborhood, however, you may have a little room for negotiation.If you have any other questions about new construction homes or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

So today, I will be going over what you need to know about these two processes.First, we always recommend you have an inspection performed any time you buy a home. This makes sure the property is safe and in working condition.Insurability, though, is one thing people sometimes forget about the inspection process. So talk to your insurance company and make sure the home is insurable.Inspections are optional, but we always recommend them. Appraisals, on the other hand, are a requirement whenever you are doing a financed purchase. An appraiser is selected through a randomized process by the bank to ensure impartiality.“Inspections are optional, but we always recommend them.”The appraiser will come in and place a value on the home. They want to make sure the home is sufficient in value to act as collateral for the bank and also that the home is safe, sound, and secure for an owner-occupied loan.Inspections are more thorough and time-consuming than an appraisal.Once an appraiser has finished looking at your home, they may make a few requests. These requests must be satisfied in order for the loan to go through. However, these requests are rare. Your agent can help you negotiate them if this situation arises.When an inspection is over, on the other hand, the results are just suggestions. Nothing the inspector recommends is a requirement. A buyer may ask for a credit, ask the seller to have items fixed, or simply accept the property as-is.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Setting your budget. If you aren’t paying cash, talk to a local mortgage professional who will guide you through the process and help prepare that budget. You will need to know how much cash you will need for the down payment and what your monthly mortgage payments will be. That way, you will be able to build a sales price budget and an overall home budget.2. Analyze your needs and wants for your home. You will sit down with your real estate agent and explain your needs and wants for the home. Do you need a home in a good school district? Do you need more space or a higher quality home? If you buy a higher quality home, you may make some sacrifices in space. If you need more space, sometimes you may have to sacrifice on quality by foregoing certain upgrades.3. Finding the right property. We will work together to put together a list of homes that you might want to see. I recommend that you pick your top five, and our agents will show all of those homes for you.“Figure out how much you need for the down payment and what your monthly payment will be.”4. Make an offer. Once you find the right property, we will help you write your offer and negotiate the best price and terms for you.5. Order an inspection. Once the home is under contract, we recommend doing a general inspection and a termite inspection. The bank will order an appraisal as a safeguard to make sure that you’re not overpaying for the home.We will guide you through the process of negotiating repairs. We’ll help you understand what’s important and what’s not important during that process to make sure that you don’t get in over your head or buy a house with a roof that’s caving in.6. Closing. Closing takes place three to four weeks from the day you go under contract on the home.

        "content": "What’s the difference between a short sale and a foreclosure? If you’ve ever wondered this, I have the answer for you today.Many people who are new to the market have heard they can get a great deal on a foreclosure and a short sale, but they may know what those terms mean.A foreclosure is when a homeowner goes into default. This means they aren’t paying their mortgage loan back. The bank will take the home back and then relist it for sale on the market. We have access to all foreclosure listings and can guide you through the process of buying one.“A short sale takes place when a homeowner goes into default on their mortgage but still owns the home.”A short sale, however, is when a homeowner is in default, but still owns the home. They haven’t been making their payments for 30, 60, 90, or 120 days, so in order to stave off a foreclosure, they try to sell the home. However, since they don’t have enough equity in the home to pay off the entire mortgage, the homeowner must “short” the payoff. This process is a little more time-consuming than a foreclosure because you’ll have to get multiple parties to approve the sale; the bank will have to agree to accept less than the full payout on the balance owed. This can take 75 to 100 days to complete, and you may find a better property in that time.For more questions about these topics, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I want to talk about three general strategies for investing in real estate.1. Rentals, or “buy and holds.” Essentially, we buy a property using either financing or cash and then rent it out. One strategy we use to rent out homes is to keep them occupied as much as possible. We prefer to give a little bit less than market rent to make sure we stay occupied, rather than holding out for an extra money and risk a vacancy. It helps get us a higher level of return over the life of the property.2. Flips, or “rehabs.” This is where we buy a property for below market value, possibly in a distressed condition that requires a lot of work, after which we’ll make some repairs and get it back to market value. Though this is a popular method on TV, these deals are harder and harder to come by, though some people can make a living doing them.“For a ‘buy and hold,’ we buy a property using either financing or cash and then rent it out.”3. House hacking. This is a favorite strategy of mine. House hacking is when we buy a live-in renovation or multi-unit property on an owner-occupied financing plan where you get better terms. You can rent out the other units to help reduce the cost of living.If you’re interested in learning more about real estate investing or about any of the strategies mentioned above, feel free to reach out to us.",

New listings hitting the market continue to outpace sold properties, so we might see a shift toward a buyer’s market coming soon. We thought as much back in September, and these numbers prove that notion.“There are a lot more homes hitting the market and a lot fewer homes being sold.”We saw an upswing of 21% more new listings in September 2017 compared to September 2016. There was also a 9% reduction in closed properties in September 2017 compared to September 2016. In total, that’s a 30% swing in inventory levels. There are a lot more homes hitting the market and a lot fewer homes being sold, so if your house has been on the market in the last several weeks or months, this reduced activity might make things more difficult.This is why it’s important that you work with an agent who’s in tune with the market so they can advise you properly and help you make the best decision for you and your family.If you have any more questions about our Oklahoma City market or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Should you buy an existing home, or should you buy or build a new one? There are a few points to consider before making this decision.  The upfront costs. Existing homes will carry normal closing costs as the price of the down payment. When it comes to new homes, these costs tend to be higher. One reason for this is that the price per square foot will be elevated in a new home. However, you might pay lower taxes on a new home for your first year.  Maintenance. Existing homes tend to have more wear and tear and therefore will carry higher maintenance costs. This isn’t a case in a new home though. Because everything in the home is brand new, you won’t have to worry as much about things breaking down as quickly as they could in an existing home. “People living in homes built since 2000 generally spend 21% less on energy costs.”  Landscaping. One benefit of buying an existing home is that they often come with better-established landscaping. New homes are often in newer neighborhoods, which generally lack established landscaping.  Energy efficiency. In the past, homes simply weren’t built with efficiency in mind the way they are now. This means you’re going to be spending a little more on energy. Newer homes tend to be much more efficient. In fact, people living in homes built since 2000 generally spend 21% less on energy costs. Newer homes also come with cool features like tankless hot water heaters.Ultimately, the best way to determine which type of home would be best for you is to talk to a Realtor.If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like us to help you decide whether to buy a new or existing home, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "If you are buying a home, odds are that you want to find the best deal possible. How can you do that?First, it’s important to know your goals. Do you want to keep as much cash in your pocket as possible? Do you want a lower monthly payment? Do you want to pay the house off as soon as possible? Or is the goal to pick up additional items, like the playset in the backyard, the golf cart, or the fridge?Once you know your goals, you need to figure out what the market is doing. What defines a good deal here in Edmond? Right now in the $200,000 to $300,000 price range, homes are selling for 98.5% of the asking price. That means that the average buyer is getting a 1.5% discount off the listing price.Since that is the case, if you get 3% off the listing price, then you get twice the discount the average buyer is seeing in our market.“First of all, know exactly what you are looking for in a good deal.”Now it’s time to find a home that lines up with your goals. We use a couple of strategies to identify homes that will be a “good deal.”1. Look for a well-priced home that is new to the market. You have to be ready to go and have all your ducks in a row. Make sure you have a pre-approval letter or proof of funds letter. You have to decide quickly if you want to make an offer on the home. The key here is to make your offer and lock the property up before there are multiple offers on the property; that is what will keep the sales price low.2. Look for a house that has been on the market for a long time and gone through several price reductions.The seller might have overpriced the home to try and get more money, but that failed. Now that the home has been on the market for five months, buyers think, “This looks like a good house at a good price, but it’s been on the market awhile. What’s wrong with it?” More than likely, there is nothing wrong with the home; the seller just made a pricing error. As a buyer, you can take advantage of that situation.3. Look at vacant homes. Whether the seller has to sell or can hold onto the property for a long time doesn’t matter. There are still costs such as taxes, utilities, and insurance payments that the seller will not be able to recover. As a result, vacant properties will have a more motivated seller.If you have any other questions about finding the best deal in today’s market, just give us a call or send us an email.

Understanding each of them is the key to making sure your home sells for top dollar. Here are the four different types of buyers:1. Serious and in a hurry. These buyers are the most aggressive. Whether they need to get into a home because they just sold theirs or they had an unexpected job transfer, they are ready to make a move.2. Serious and not in a hurry. Some of these buyers are homeowners who don’t have to move, but would if the right property came along. Some of them are first-time homebuyers who are proceeding very cautiously as to not make a mistake. “Understanding each of these types of buyers is key.”3. Investors. If you’ve already listed your home For Sale By Owner, you may have received a few calls from them already. Most of the time, these buyers are just looking for a deal, so they prey on FSBO sellers and make lowball offers in the hopes of getting a deal.4. Looky-loos. I don’t even know if you can call them buyers. Most of the time, they can’t even qualify for a loan and are just looking at homes for fun or to get some decorating ideas. They will lead you on until the cows come home.When you look at each of those types of buyers, you can see that serious buyers are the ideal buyers. However, most of those buyers are going to be working with agents who already have listings to show them. They probably won’t even see yours if you list FSBO. If you sell your home on your own, it’s your job to know which buyers are which and help all of them. If you can’t do that on your own, hiring an experienced professional like myself is the right move.If you have any other questions about real estate or the market, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

Here are four different options you have if you want to juggle buying a home and selling another at the same time.1. Keep the existing home and turn it into a rental property. Owning rental property is a great way to build wealth and we highly recommend it. However, you need to consult with your lender beforehand to see if it’s even an option.2. Buy the new house first, then sell your old home. The main benefit of this is only having to move once. It makes the process a bit smoother and less risky, too. The downside is that you may have to carry two mortgages at once and there is generally a high financial risk involved. “It all depends on what kind of risk you are willing to take.”3. Sell before buying the new house. This has the lowest financial risk, but it’s a risk nonetheless. In this case, you risk not being able to find the house you want before your home sale closes. However, you can likely negotiate a rent-back or extended closing.4. Make a contingent offer on a home before selling. This is our preferred option because it’s the least financially risky. We won’t start the inspection or appraisal processes until we remove all our contingencies. This allows us to have the first right of refusal within 24 hours. If another offer comes in, we will have the opportunity to match or beat it.If you have any questions for me about this topic or anything else related to real estate, give me a call or send me an email.

When you put on your “buyer hat,” it isn’t hard to see why someone looking for a home might be deterred from an overpriced listing.Imagine one home that has just gone on the market, where the sellers have barely had time to put the sign in their yard. Then, imagine a property that has been on the market for 180, or even 210 days.“The longer we’re on the market, the lower the offers will be.”If these properties were exactly the same, how would your offers be different? The truth is that most people will offer less for a home that has spent more time on the market.The longer we’re on the market, the lower the offers will be. So selling sooner rather than later is key.If you are a buyer, however, you can use this fact to get a great deal. By finding a home that’s spent a lot of time on the market, and has no other issues other than having been initially priced far too high, you could have a great opportunity to get into a house that may now actually be cheaper and see less competition.As a seller, though, you want to avoid this situation. When you price your home too high, it’s inevitable that you will likely sell it for even lower than what you could have gotten if you had just priced it right the first time.If you have any other questions or want more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.
