        "content": "Halloween will be here before you know it, so today I&rsquo;ll share some quick tips that will help you and your family have a fun, safe holiday.Â Skeletons, spiderwebs, and Jack-oâ-lanterns galore are popping up all over our neighborhoods, and that can only mean one thing: Halloween is just around the corner. If your preparations so far have involved stocking up on candy and choosing the perfect costume for yourself or your children, youâre on the right track.Getting in the Halloween spirit is great, but decking out your yard with spooky decor and buying sweets for trick-or-treaters isnât the only thing you should be doing to get ready for the holiday ahead. Ghouls and goblins might be nothing more than fun, fictional frights, but there are some real dangers to watch out for on Halloween night.Thankfully, by following a few simple safety tricks, you can help make this Halloween a fun and safe treat for everyone.1. If youâre a homeowner expecting trick-or-treaters, make sure you:  Keep your home, yard, and sidewalks brightly lit (and shoveled if applicable)  Clear debris and obstacles from your yard, steps, and walkways  Keep pets kenneled  Park your car in the garage  Use LED candles instead of real candles inside Jack-oâ-lanterns  Tone down extra-scary decor  Keep a close eye on your front door2. If youâre a parent with children who plan to trick-or-treat, make sure you:  Always accompany young children to each house they visit  Visit neighborhoods with sidewalks to avoid walking in the street  Always use crosswalks and look both ways before crossing the street  Add reflective tape to your childâs costume  Keep masks at home, as they can obstruct your childâs vision  Have your child carry a flashlight  Establish a curfew for older children venturing out on their own  Remind older, unsupervised children to call 911 in case of emergency  Tell unaccompanied children to never enter a strangerâs homeâYou can help make this Halloween a fun and safe treat for everyone.â3. If youâre going to be driving on Halloween night, make sure you:  Stay alert and watch for children in the street  Eliminate any distractions within your vehicle  Drive slowly  Be especially cautious at intersections and corners  Be mindful when pulling in or out of drivewaysWith Halloween holding such a high risk of accidents involving child pedestrians, following these safety tips will be essential. Still, even after your children have made it home with their Halloween haul, there is one more important safety concern youâll need to address: their candy.4. Check candy for the following red flags before letting your trick-or-treaters dig into their treats:  An unusual or discolored appearance  Spoiled or unwrapped items  Tears or holes in wrappersIn addition to following these tips, you should also be wary of homemade items or baked goods. If you donât personally know who made them, these should be discarded. As a general rule for any treat: When in doubt, throw it out.Parents should also be mindful of treats that could pose a choking hazard. Hard candies, gum, peanuts, and small toys should only be given to older children. If you have any additional questions regarding tainted or unsafe candy, you can contact Poison Control or your local police department.By following these tips, you and your trick-or-treaters will be all set to have a safe and happy holiday.Fangs for reading and sharing this. Happy Halloween!",

        "content": "Today Barry Malesh from A Buyer&rsquo;s Choice Home Inspections joins me to provide you with some tips on how to prepare your home for the winter.Calgarians are getting ready for winterâtheyâre preparing their cars and their garages are swamped with snow tires. But what about their houses? Barry Malesh from A Buyerâs Choice Home Inspections is here to give you some tips about what you should be doing to prepare your home for the coming winter.1. Service your furnace. Nowâs the time of year that youâll start needing your furnace the most. Make sure you get it serviced and have your ducts cleaned out because you donât want to have any problems with it when the temperature is 40 below. Cleaning your unit and changing the filters will also help you avoid carbon monoxide leaks, keep the air in your home clean, and keep your bill lower.2. Check your smoke detectors every time you change your clocks. This includes carbon monoxide detectors, as well. Change out the batteries regularly, and replace your units once about every five years, since they donât last forever.3. Reduce the inside temperature when youâre gone to save heat. Many people think that if they lower the temperature at night, theyâre just wasting money reheating the house the next day. Tests on this scenario have been done, and itâs actually been proven that the larger the temperature differential between the inside of the house and the outside of the house, the more heat is lost. So, if you do lower the temperature in the house when youâre gone more than four hours, you can save on heating costs.4. Make sure the attic is the same temperature as the outside of your home. Hereâs a great tip for keeping the heat in your home from leaking out of your attic: seal off your attic hatch with vapor barrier, and be sure to weather strip it, as well. Make sure that the vents for your bathroom and kitchen range lead to the outside, too; that air is warm and moist, so the condensation could freeze and cause damage if it isnât vented outside.Heat escaping from the attic will also cause melting on your roof and create ice dams. Barry has seen homes where, because of ice damming, water seeps under the shingles and the melt runs down the interior walls, shorting the electrical system.âChange out smoke and carbon monoxide detector batteries regularly.â5. Always shut off your outside taps. Disconnect your garden hoses, turn off the water shutoff valve, and then go back outside and open the tap so that the air can escape. Itâs the compressed air in water lines that causes them to break, not the ice.6. Have your downspouts extended at all times. If ice on the roof melts and runs down your house without proper drainage, the water will pool at the foundation. Here, it can freeze, crack your foundation, and let more water in.7. When going away for winter vacation, shut off the main water to the home. This way, if anything starts to leak, you wonât have any water issues. The valve for this is in the basement.Additionally, have someone walk through your house while youâre gone. Your insurance might have a clause that mentions this as well: Every three days to once a week, someone should walk through the house to make sure the heatâs on and that there arenât other issues with the home. Failure to do this might allow for problems to go unnoticed, and your insurance may not cover it.If you would like more tips about how to protect your home in the winter, reach out to me. Iâll send you a free report that includes a checklist you can follow every fall and spring.",

You find a place you love and go to the open house or call the agent and itâs already gone. This can feel like a waste of time and be heartbreaking.Would you be surprised to know that you are probably missing places that were actually perfect for you because they were gone so fast? It happens to people every day, particularly in the styles, communities, and price ranges with the highest demand.Often this happens because somebody else heard about it either before it hit the market or the instant it came on. Our coming soon inventory is constantly changing, so make sure you let us know if you are looking for anything in particular, and we can keep you updated.We have access to a number of other agents and their coming soon listings. This not only gives you a secret advantage over other buyers, but it also makes sure you donât miss out on some of the best places. All three of these properties are in desirable areas in the fastest moving price range of $375,000 to $475,000. As youâll see, these homes are going to see a lot of action.âThese will get scooped up quickly.âOur first property is a bungalow in the SW neighbourhood Westgate. It is currently being painted, so itâs going to look even better than it does now. People just love the mature trees and the easy access to bow trail and downtown.The next property is a 1,400 square foot bungalow with hardwood floors in the NW neighbourhood Dalhousie. This is located on a great crescent and close to sought-after schools. This really has some great potential for somebody that is willing to do a little bit of work and updating. Do you want to build some sweat equity? This is an opportunity to do so.The third secret deal is a nearly 1,600 square foot two-story with a double-attached garage and a fully developed basement for under $375,000. It is currently being painted inside and the huge back decks are being stained. This one will get scooped up quickly. Itâs also close to schools, shopping, transit, and the Stoney and Deerfoot trails.If you want more information on these, other properties, or our other unique home marketing systems and strategies, give us a call or send us an email today.

        "content": "To have a successful home purchase, there are certain buyer fears you need to overcome.Â As a buyer, if you can acknowledge your fears about the home buying process, you can overcome them and move forward with your purchase with clarity, courage, and commitment.What kind of fears do buyers usually have? Here are four of the most common:1. Fear of loss. In this case, buyers will come across a property and get scared that they have to buy it soon or someone else will.2. Fear of missing out. Hereâs where the analytical brain kicks in and tells you that, even though you really love this house, itâs only the third one youâve looked at, and there are thousands of more listings on the market you should look at too.3. Fear of overpaying. Nobody wants to look like they overpaid for something. If you think a house is overpriced, the tendency is to not want to pay too much for it, wonder why someone else hasnât bought it yet, and/or wonder whether youâd get a good deal or not.4. Fear that something is wrong with the house. What if thereâs a structural defect and thatâs why nobody has bought it? If itâs a condo, a structural defect might necessitate a special assessment or increased fees.âItâs not a perfect market out there, and a homeâs list price might be either above or below its true value.âYouâve probably heard the phrase, âWhat you think about, you bring about.â In other words, the fears you think about can manifest themselves in the form of mistakes because you overcompensate to avoid those fears. With that in mind, here are five common mistakes buyers make that are caused by the fears above:1. Not getting pre-approved. Itâs common for people to start searching for homes and making offers without knowing how much they can afford. This can cause you to lose out on the home you want or lead you to become âhouse poor.â2. Overpaying. Itâs not a perfect market out there, and a homeâs list price might be either above or below its true value. Not everyone has access to records of previously sold listings, expired listings, or other statistics that indicate where the market is going.3. Not having access to all properties. In addition to the properties listed on the MLS, there are âcoming soonâ listings, âFor Sale by Ownerâ listings, off-market properties, and other options available to buyers.4. Listening to the wrong people. There are all sorts of people out there who claim to be real estate experts, so make sure you listen to an actual expert.5. Not having your own agent. Make sure you hire a proper buyerâs agent to represent you. Theyâll have a fiduciary duty to you and only you, which will save you thousands of dollars in the long run. Also, make sure you hire the right agentâone who has a team of professionals behind them to look after all of your needs.For example, most agents average between zero and three deals per year. Our team, on the other hand, closed three deals just last week. I donât say this to bragâI say it to assure you that we cover all our buyer clientsâ needs. Here are some specific services we offer that you should look for when selecting your agent:  We have a VIP buyer program that gives you access to all properties online and offline  We do a careful market analysis to make sure you never overpay for a property  We supply competent affiliates and professionals (home inspectors, lenders, lawyers, etc.)If you have any questions about this topic or you have any other real estate needs, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

        "content": "There are three signs you need to watch out for to know whether your home is overpriced.Â If youâre putting your home on the market, itâs important that you price it correctly from the start. Overpricing it can cost you tens of thousands of dollarsânot just in terms of carrying costs, but because youâll end up chasing the market downward.A lot of people assume a buyer will eventually make an offer for less than what they ask, but that doesnât happen very often. Think of the TV show âShark Tank,â where people offer a percentage of their company in exchange for an investment: Some of those companies are amazing, but their founders will still walk away without a deal because they ask for too much of an investment.The same thing can happen to sellers in our Calgary market, so if you do overprice your home, youâll need to adjust quickly. How can you tell if this is the case, though? Here are the three signs you should watch out for.1. Your listing has expired. If itâs been on the market for six months or more, itâs already gone through a lot of exposure.âOverpricing it can cost you tens of thousands of dollars.â2. The Rule of 10. In other words, for every 10 showings you have, you should get at least one offerâif you go 10 days without a showing, your home is overpriced.3. Feedback. People will give you feedback after a showing if your Realtor is doing a great job. Make sure you listen to it. A lot of sellers try to block this feedback out, but if buyers give you feedback without wanting to buy your home, it means theyâre trying to help you. A lot of their minor complaints can be solved once the price is right. If your price is right, the only feedback you want to hear is an offer or a clarifying question.If your home has been sitting on the market and you want it sold soon, we specialize in fixing bad listings, so give us a call and weâd be happy to help you.",

We look at bad real estate pictures every week, and thatâs not where you want to be. Weâre joined by a real estate photo expert today to answer some common questions about what he does.Iâm a big believer in the 80/20 rule that says 80% of our results come from 20% of our efforts. In real estate, photography comes within that 20% of work. Danny Boutet of Visual Marketing knows a lot about this topic. Heâs been in business for 11 years and has shot over 7,000 homes in and around the Calgary area.According to Danny, the biggest mistake he sees homeowners make when it comes to photos is not having their spaces decluttered. If youâre not using something, get it out of the way. Misplaced shoes, clothes, jackets, and trinkets should be out while photos are being taken. He also recommends double checking your lights, windows, and mirrors to ensure they are clean. HDR photos can pick up things that we didnât have to worry about in the past, but it can also show your home off in a way thatâs never been possible before.â80% of our results come from 20% of our efforts.âIf you have any questions for Danny about how you can make your homeâs photos sparkle, give him a call at (403) 470-4350 or send him an email to &#100;&#046;&#098;&#111;&#117;&#116;&#101;&#116;&#064;&#118;&#105;&#115;&#117;&#097;&#108;&#109;&#097;&#114;&#107;&#101;&#116;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#046;&#099;&#097;.Feel free to watch one of our previous videos on prepping your homeÂ as well.

Remove any oversized furniture and pack up any personal items, knick-knacks, and fragile items. Also, remove your valuables and any items that arenât going with you to your new home. Make sure you keep your countertops and surfaces clear of any portable electronics, and if you have a pet, try to minimize any evidence of their presence.When it comes to your deck and patio areas, bring the outside in by laying down some carpet and sitting up tables and chairs. Donât tell buyers you have a great outdoor spaceâshow them.âYour homeâs marketing should happen both online and offline.âAlso, donât cheap out. Hire professionals to help you do the job.

In the video above, Iâm at the home of one of my seller clients, and theyâve power-raked their lawn so that it will grow extra green in the coming weeks. Theyâve also added fresh mulch to their landscaping. Besides doing these kinds of things, power washing your homeâs exterior is always a good idea, too.Inside the home, the owners have done a great job handling another important task: cleaning and decluttering. Specifically, donât forget to clear the countertops in your kitchen and bathrooms. In general, do whatever you can to show off the master bedroom, master bathroom, and the kitchen area.In each room, the beds should be made and the closets should only be half full. The goal is to show off how much storage you have, so pack up all your winter clothes and store them away.âDo whatever you can to show off the master bedroom, master bathroom, and the kitchen area.âWhen it comes to the windows, they should be cleaned from both the inside and the outside.

        "title": "A SWOT Analysis of the 2019 Calgary Market",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I&rsquo;ll be doing a SWOT analysis of the Calgary real estate market&mdash;that is, identifying its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, as well as what they&rsquo;ll mean to you.Â The Calgary Real Estate Board released their 2019 forecast a few weeks ago, and in the past, I havenât been in full alignment with the numbers theyâve put out. Last year, they predicted 0% growth, whereas I saw house prices fall 2% and apartment prices fall 5%. This year, however, I think weâre more in line with the Boardâs predictions.Letâs first take a look at what happened in 2018:  Detached home sales dropped 15.95% and prices dropped 1.45%.  Apartment sales dropped 7.24% and prices fell 2.70%.  Attached home sales dropped 15.43% and prices decreased by 1.49%.  For the City of Calgary overall, there was a 14.61% drop in sales and a 1.52% decrease in prices. As always, putting too much stock in averages can be dangerousâif your head is in the oven and your feet are in the freezer, your average temperature would be okay, but youâd be dead anyway. Perspective does matter when it comes to analyzing these figures.This year, as I said, weâre more in alignment with predicted trends. Overall in Calgary, home prices dropped 2.35%, which makes this the fourth consecutive year of price decreases in our city. That constitutes a decline of about 9% since 2014; those who purchased their homes in 2014 will be the most affected by the current market conditions.Why is this happening? Well, in addition to oil prices and the uncertainty of the political environment, interest rates are a big factor. Not only have interest rates been creeping up, but when the stress test came into effect on January 1 of last year, it was the equivalent of having a 2% increase in interest ratesâthis really reduces peopleâs buying power.What is negatively impacting home prices in 2019?  The energy sector and the economy are continuing to soften.  Consumer confidence is down. People arenât certain about their real estate prospects, and when people arenât certain, they either fight, flee, or freezeâa lot of people are freezing.  The number of good-paying jobs continues to decrease.  The lending market is tightening rules as interest rates continue to rise.  The housing supply continues to rise, and when that happens, prices decrease.âOverall in Calgary, home prices dropped 2.35%, which makes this the fourth consecutive year of price decreases in Calgary.âOn the other hand, the increasing population and net migration to Calgary are working in our favor. Many immigrants who come begin by renting for a couple years before buying homes, which contributes to the decreasing vacancy rates over the past year. This creates opportunity for investors: If you can buy for less and your vacancy rates are decreasing, your rates will begin to increase.There are other opportunities to be had, as well, if youâre looking at moving up or down. Right now, propertiesâespecially detached homes between $350,000 and $450,000âare really hot. Weâre even generating multiple offers in some cases; though it may take two or three sometimes, weâre still getting the job done. If youâre someone who owns a home in that hot zone and wants to move up to a higher-priced home, then that market is softer and you can get a better deal.If youâre looking at moving down, the condominium market is softer, and there are better deals there than ever. The gap that youâre paying is actually smaller; if you remove your personal reservations about selling your house for less and look at your net numbers, youâll see that there are some pretty significant savings and opportunities that we havenât seen in Calgary for years.What threats might present themselves if the 2019 predictions donât come true?  Pipelines/energy sector. If major employers move into the area or leave it, that will affect the market.  Employment. Jobs are the biggest driver of real estate trends.  Consumer confidence. Peopleâs reservations and optimism definitely affect the market.  Interest rates/lending markets. Weâre expecting interest rates to creep up, but not much, since itâs an election year. Again, rising interest rates do reduce buying power.  Government. With this year being an election year, thereâs some uncertainty in the market. A lot of people may be waiting to see what happens.While all of these factors are important, they all take a long time to shift.

        "content": "Here&rsquo;s what to avoid during your home renovation.Â When renovating your home, there are a lot of things that can go wrong. Joining me today is Ian Galvin of Velao Projects, a home restoration and remodeling company. Ian has over 30 years of residential construction experience, and weâll be discussing three of the biggest mistakes you can make during a home renovation. Hereâs what to avoid doing:1. Not hiring a competent design professional. Some services both design and build while others do not, so itâs important to find out what youâre getting. Who is going to build the project? Who is going to advise them? You want everything laid out for you from the beginning: What your countertops will be made of, the colors of cabinets, the type of wood, etc.Â 2. Being your own supplier. Problems arise when you provide your own products for others to install. If thereâs a mistake, what happens? Who looks after you if something is broken? Thatâs between you and your contractor, and it can be a messy situation to navigate. Itâs advised to use an outside supplier to avoid the issues that can arise from supplying your own products, especially during larger projects.Â 3. Not asking enough questions. Donât ever assume things are going smoothly. You want to visit the project and get updates on its progress. Make arrangements with your contractor to review the project periodically so you can catch things before itâs too late. Things can move very quickly during a renovation, so fixing problems before they grow is important.âMake arrangements with your contractor to review the project periodically.âThereâs a specific license for Alberta contractors that allows them to handle the process of advanced payment. So if they ask for advanced payment, ask for the license. Beware of large payments unless they are definedâfront-end draws can be substantial if there are a lot of materials to pre-order.If you want more information on preparing for a renovation or have any questions, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Fellow Realtor Sarah Johnston joins me today to talk about how politics are affecting our Calgary market.Â Today I have the pleasure of sitting down with fellow MaxWell Realtor Sarah Johnston to talk a little bit about how politics and policy are affecting the Calgary real estate market.Sarah recently attended the NAR Annual in Boston, Massachusetts and got the chance to talk with many agents across Canada and the U.S. According to her, although markets in the states vary, theyâre doing just fine as a whole. Unemployment levels are low, and theyâre keeping up with the cost of inflation. While some markets might be doing better than others, she didnât notice any areas that were outright struggling.I always like to say that if they sneeze in the states, we in Canada catch a cold, so this news bodes well for our near future. What Sarah is more concerned about right now, though, is whatâs happening here in Canada. In her opinion, politics are getting in the way of whatâs going on in our market.âI was in Ottawa a month ago with the Political Action Standing Committee for the Calgary Real Estate Board,â she says, âand they didnât seem to think that housing was a big deal right nowânot anything that they wanted to concentrate on.âIn fact, it was her impression that they wanted to increase some of the legislative changes coming up, which means it might get more difficult for homebuyers in our market. In addition to a growing concern about Canadiansâ household debt loads, we expect to see interest rates continue to increase in 2019. Regulation is essentially collapsing housing industries everywhere outside of the major cities, and our sales havenât been this low since the late 90s.This trend affects other industries outside of real estate. The housing industry produces between $30 and $40 billion per year, and a lot of other industries make a living off of houses being built and trading hands. The inability to slow that down can have crippling and far-reaching effects.âRegulation is essentially collapsing housing industries everywhere outside of the major cities.âOn a lighter note, while at the NAR Annual, Sarah also got a chance to listen to Mark Wahlberg speak. Although Mark is known as an actor, heâs diversified his portfolio and heâs heavily involved in commercial real estate.âIt was inspiring, actually, to listen to him. Weâve heard about his past indiscretions. He was a bad apple. He did some terrible, terrible things, but people really like a coming-of-age, good news story, and heâs turned his life around.âThere are plenty of lessons to be learned from Markâs story and how heâs been able to build a franchise around his name by working hard. Thatâs advice we can use no matter what industry weâre in.I want to thank Sarah for joining me today.

With everything going on in our Calgary real estate market, though, some might think Iâm out of my mind for traveling out of the country right now.If you arenât already aware, Calgary is on track this year to see the fewest sales since the year 2000âsince which time weâve had a 53% increase in population. Prices have, of course, gone up. Theyâve actually risen 167% since 2000.Despite all of this, I donât actually believe our Calgary market itself is the problem. Allow me to illustrate why with a brief anecdote.Recently my wife and I decided to go to Kensington on a date night. As we were walking around, we noticed the incredible number of vacant businesses in the area. Even many of the businesses that were technically open were virtually abandoned. We went to a sushi restaurant, for example, and found that it was next-to-impossible to receive any kind of service. After some time of waiting, we left and decided to try somewhere else.âMarket conditions aside, Realtors must be able to understand their clientsâ pains, pleasures, and dreams.âOur experience at the next restaurant couldnât have been more different from what occurred at our first stop. We were greeted at the door, escorted to a table right away, and given great service through the duration of our meal. The food was good, but the service was what really mattered. And this same line of thinking can be applied to real estate. Whatever may be happening in the market, real estate professionals must remember that they are, essentially, in the service industry.The âproductâ itself is far less important than how consumers are treated. Agents must be creative and resourceful when meeting the needs of their clients. Market conditions aside, Realtors must be able to understand their clientsâ pains, pleasures, and dreams. Now is not the time to cut back on marketing costs and personal growth.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give my team or me a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "I am at Sherwin Williams to talk with assistant manager Alex about how to choose the right paint for your home and have it look its best.Â You have sent us a lot of questions lately, so today Iâll the answer one of the most commonly asked: âWhat should I do to prepare my home for sale?âOne of the answers is often to paint, which is why I have Alex, the assistant manager of Sherwin Williams in Avenida Village, here with me today to share some doâs and donâts of preparing to paint your home. These apply whether youâre selling or youâre painting because you simply want to enjoy your home a little more.Alex says that when customers come into her store to purchase paint, she starts by asking if you have a certain color in mind, as well as if it will be for the interior or exterior. From there, itâs all about finding out specifics such as tones and how you feel about popular trends. She tells us that the grays, off-whites, and creams are currently the most popular colors. Beige is also popular because it mixes both gray and warmth together.After you pick out your colors, Alex says you need to choose your sheen level. Typically this is an eggshell or satin for walls or a semi-gloss for trim. For ceilings, most people go with flat. If you bring in a sample for them to match, both color and sheen level will have to be matched.For kitchens and bathrooms that are prone to moisture, Alex says they can recommend paint that is more resistant to mildew and moisture, such as Emerald. This is the most washable and can even come with a flat sheen. There is also Duration paint, which is designed for bathrooms and kitchens, as well as Harmony, which has a high mildew resistance just like Duration.âFor kitchens and bathrooms that are prone to moisture, Alex says they can recommend paint that is more resistant to mildew and moisture.âHarmony, she tells us, is zero VOC, or volatile organic compound. Having zero VOC is important to her clients because they are more concerned than ever about the environment and their own personal health. Volatile organic compounds can make people sick, so painting companies have moved away from it using oils and instead creating waterborne paints.For all the do-it-yourselfers, Alex says that the biggest mistake is not completing prep work properly. People tend to want to skip to the fun part of painting so they donât sand, wash the walls, or tape things off and, unfortunately, thatâs when things donât work out. To avoid having your painting look bad, you will need to prepare accordingly. If you do this and also follow her directions, Alex tells me that youâll be really happy with your beautiful end-product.To end, I have a surprise: Alex is more than just the assistant manager. She is also my stepdaughter and she has arranged a special account for us and our clients and friends! You can visit any Sherwin Williams in the country and mention our phone number, (403) 827-8081, to bring up our contractor discount. Alex does suggest that you include your name and address so that if you ever need more of the same color, you can easily match it through their system.If you have any more questions about this or anything else real estate related, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I am explaining the differences between the three types of values that your home is assigned.Â What is the difference between assessed value, appraised value, and market value?First, letâs talk about assessed value. The City of Calgary assesses homes using an algorithm. When a property sells, they use this to help calculate what the nearby properties are worth. By looking at the most recent sales, they can extrapolate what youâll be paying in taxes based on those other properties. Your property may not have sold, so they do not know the true market value and therefore go by similar properties.Now, letâs look at appraised value. An appraiser will have more recent sales, so they will look at a property that sold recently as a comparable for another. By doing this, they can know whether you paid too much or if you got a great deal. An appraiser also takes things like view and other factors and adjusts for it.What an appraiser does not take into account is what is currently happening inside of the market. They only look at what happened in the past. If a market is going up, a property may be worth more than another within a month. Meanwhile, if a market is going down, the property may be worth less.âReal estate is not a perfect market like the stock market, where you can look at the price and what it is is what you pay.âThis is where market value comes in. We look at supply and demand and see what is happening with the competition.These are the biggest differences between the three different types of value. Real estate is not a perfect market like the stock market. A seller may be motivated, so they may accept less money than what it is worth, or a buyer may be willing to pay more because they missed out on other places previously.If you have any questions or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to me. I would be happy to help you solve your problems and realize your dreams.",

        "title": "How Can Feng Shui Be Applied to Your Home's Curb Appeal?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "You may have heard of the ancient art of feng shui, but do you know what it can do for your life and your home? Today I&rsquo;ve brought on an expert to explain.Â How can your homeâs exterior improve your health, wealth, and relationships? Feng shui expert Myrna Brown joins us today to explain.First of all, what is feng shui? In Myrnaâs words, feng shui is a âway of looking at our physical environments, and seeing how we can manipulate them so that we feel better in them.âAs you could imagine, feng shui is a vast subject. So today weâll just be covering how this ancient art can be applied to the outside of a home. Implementing feng shui into your home can help you when it comes time to list, but can also benefit you while youâre still living in a property.There are three pillars in feng shui. The first pertains to everything from the curb to your homeâs front door. This area is especially critical in real estate, because first impressions are vital.Buyers will often drive by a property theyâve seen online to solidify their opinion of it, so a potential buyerâs first impression based on your homeâs exterior could determine whether they end up submitting an offer or walking away.But what constitutes a good (or bad) exterior? To start, if a home is obscured by large trees or if the entryway is overly dark, buyers may tend to shy away. Things that look gloomy will make it more difficult for buyers to feel engaged or enlivened by a space.âWhen you change your space, you can change your life.âMyrna says itâs best to avoid planting a tree in line with the front door or any large, front-facing windows. Instead, she recommends adding lighting and removing excessive foliage to make the home feel more inviting. Curb appeal can make a huge difference in a propertyâs energy and value.In feng shui, transitional spaces (like that between the curb and front door) should welcome you gently from the outside world back into your home. A propertyâs exterior can often reflect the transitions a person is going through in their life, and can also serve as a means of improving those transitions.For example, when Myrna was in high school, her father was nearing retirement and was feeling quite stressed. He was, in her words, trying to block out the world. He allowed a small hedge in front of their home to become wildly overgrown. This sent out a clear message to the world outside of their property: Stay out. It may be subconscious, but people understand such messages when looking at the spaces we encounter in our lives.Interestingly enough, as Myrnaâs father proceeded into retirement and his stress levels went down, the hedge began to shrink as well. This is a clear example of how feng shui can impact your attitude and the way you approach whatâs happening in your life. When you change your space, you can change your life. If youâd like to know more about what Myrna does, feel free to reach out to her at (403) 874-1817 or at myrna@myrnabrown.com.And, as always, if you have any other questions or would like more information from me, please give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "How do home stagers help sellers save, and earn, money? Special guest Rachel Borrelli of Diversa Designs joins us today to explain.Â Today I am joined by special guest Rachel Borrelli, Owner of Diversa Designs Home Staging and Redesign to cover some inside tips on effective home staging. These helpful hints are absolute musts in our current market. But before we move on to these tips, letâs go over a question many ask when the subject of home staging arises: How do stagers help people save and make money with their home?The way stagers help people save money is actually quite simple. Stagers can enter a sellerâs home right before they list to tell them exactly what should be done to prepare the property. This prevents sellers from wasting time and money on unnecessary upgrades or repairs. Having the advice of a professional stager can guide sellers to making informed, effective renovations.According to Rachel, kitchen updates bring some of the highest returns. She also said that these updates can sometimes be as simple as changing out knobs on cabinets.Beyond just helping sellers save, stagers can also help sellers earn more for their homeâas we mentioned earlier. In fact, studies have found that professionally staged homes can earn between 6% and 20% more than other listings. And our team here at Eric Mortimer &amp; Associates can absolutely verify this trend. According to statistics pulled from the Calgary Real Estate Board, our team sells 96% more homes than other agents. We also sell homes 48% faster and for 100.7% of the purchase price, on average. Our collaboration with Rachel and Diversa Designs has played a significant role in achieving these incredible statistics.Moving on, letâs talk about what stagers are looking for when they step into a home. Rachel says that the first thing she considers is how to highlight a particular homeâs best features. Making sure a home appears spacious in person and in all marketing materials is very important. Modernizing a home can also be helpful in boosting its appeal. While some may feel these tasks are something they could take on alone, the guidance of a professional stager is critical to any sellerâs success.âStaging gives buyers the opportunity to really fall in love with the home.âProfessional stagers stay on top of current trends because what appealed to buyers 10 years ago is not necessarily effective today. Of course, not all buyers will have the same interests and tastes. Professional stagers have an extensive knowledge of what is attractive to various demographics. With that being said, it is no wonder why having the help of a professional stager is so important. Nevertheless, some still question whether hiring a stager is worth it.If you are still unsure, consider the following statistic: 77% of agents believe it is easier for potential buyers to see how a given room can, or should, be used. Vacant rooms look smaller and make it more difficult for buyers to see past flaws. A staged home, on the other hand, could entice buyers to spend eight times longer during showings. This gives buyers the opportunity to really fall in love with the home.If you want to know more about home staging or have any other questions for Rachel, you can reach her by phone at (403) 813-2719 or by email at &#114;&#097;&#099;&#104;&#101;&#108;&#064;&#100;&#105;&#118;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#097;&#100;&#101;&#115;&#105;&#103;&#110;&#115;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;.And if you are interested in selling your home, feel free to give me a call or send me an email and our team will send you a free home preparation guide. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "I was recently joined by mortgage broker Bob Reader to discuss the latest with interest rates. Here&rsquo;s what we learned.Â There have been some big changes in the real estate and mortgage market this year, which is causing confusion, myths, and misinformation that may be affecting homeowners and home buyers. Today Bob Reader joins me to help explain this problem and how to solve it.Bob is a mortgage broker, which means he works for the buyer instead of the bank. He helps his clients shop the entire market, look at every option, and act as an agent for the consumer. When you have someone thatâs working for you instead of working for the bank, youâre going to see a much better shopping experience.With these new changes, everyone who is applying for a mortgage now has to qualify for the stress test rate, which is 2% higher than the best rate that is being offered. Right now, that rate is at 5.14%. This has dropped affordability for buyers anywhere from 16% to 20%. In Calgary, we havenât seen a dramatic affect on home affordability, but other markets like Vancouver and Toronto have been affected quite dramatically.If you already have a mortgage, lending institutions generally donât require any qualification for renewing a mortgage after the end of the term. However, if you want to take some of your equity out to pay off some debt, you will have to re-qualify with the stress test, but a simple mortgage renewal shouldnât require any of this.âThe variable mortgage probably offers the best chance of saving money right now.âWe have been hearing a lot from buyers about some first-time home buyer programs disappearing. However, anyone who wants to buy a home in Canada only needs to put 5% down, whether itâs their third or their first home. Thereâs really no restriction on down payment requirements, and weâre pretty much in the same ballpark as we were before.Finally, letâs discuss interest rates. With them creeping up, should buyers go for a variable or a fixed-term? According to Bob, it depends on the buyer. However, the variable rate mortgage probably holds the best chance of saving money right now. Over the last 12 years, rates have remained very stable and thereâs no reason to expect them changing dramatically anytime soon.Thanks to Bob for joining us. If you have any questions for him, donât hesitate to give him a call at 403-819-0500 or send him an email to Bob@canadianmortgagepro.com. If you have any other questions for us about the market or real estate in general, donât hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Why do people choose to work with Eric Mortimer as their Realtor? Just ask Kimmy, a client who worked with Eric to get her home sold. Hereâs what she had to say:âEric was different from other agents. He was calm and centered about everything. What matched him with me is our shared spiritual beliefs in the way that we approach life, the belief that everything is connected and that are things that you can do to help set up the intention and have it just work out right for the house. He was very positive about how we were going to set the price and about how the process was going to come along.Eric helped me get the most I could from my home sale. Certainly, the house that I was selling was very unique in that we had renovated it and put a lot of extra, special items in it. Eric was actually the last of the Realtors that I had interviewed. A lot of them had brought the same data that he had concerning the pricing for the house, but because this was such a unique house, we actually went with getting an appraisal, per his recommendation.Â We set the price based on that. I knew that I wasnât going to get the full cost of the renovation out of the house, but it was certainly a much higher price than what any of the other Realtors had come up with. They were strictly basing it on market analysis instead of looking at the unique features the house had. The statistics didnât really speak to the value that was in this house. Eric knew that once he got people in to see the house, they would definitely see the value at the dollar amount we were asking for.âEric and his team went above and beyond just the home sale process.âHis negotiation skills definitely showed up when we had an offer on that Saturday night. We basically had it pretty much all signed except for the final signature from the buyer, who waited until Sunday, so the offer was still pending. Just before the open house that Sunday, we had another offer come in. Eric had been speaking with the Realtor of that second offer, letting them know that we did already have another offer on the table. The second offer came out to be for full listing price.Eric and his team went above and beyond just the home sale process. My initial intent was to sell the house and then go on to rent. When I wasnât finding anything to rent, I asked Eric if he would help me look at a couple properties I could possibly buy. He arranged the showings, and even though one of the properties had a conditional sale on it, we were able to just go in and look through it. That gave me a little more sense of what I wanted to do; as it turned out, I didnât want to buy in Calgary. I ended up finding a place on Cooper Island. He went over and beyond what any other Realtor would do.Â Living in the electronic age made this process amazing. I could be on my computer in a coffee shop when an offer came in, and I could just electronically sign in acceptance of the offer or counteroffer. Other Realtors donât even use the DocuSign system yet. Itâs really great for getting work done quickly and efficiently anywhere you are in the world.âAs you can see, you donât just get the standard amount of service when you work with Eric Mortimer &amp; Associates. We go above and beyond to help you with all your real estate needs. If you have any questions or if you need a resource to help you buy or sell a home, please donât hesitate to reach out to us.

Determine whether the showers and bathtubs are properly caulked. This prevents maintenance issues and makes your home look more appealing.When buyers sense that a home is well-maintained, they will feel more inclined to put forward a strong offer. As a homeowner, it can be difficult to see which areas in your home might need improvements. It never hurts to have a friend over to look at your property with fresh eyes.âWhen buyers sense that a home is well-maintained, they will feel more inclined to put forward a strong offer.âMinor issues that might go unnoticed by a homeowner could be more obvious to a buyer. And, even if you arenât getting ready to sell, periodically fixing small problems with your home is a great way to keep your property in good shape.As for the exterior of the home, one of the issues Barry notices regularly is raised downspouts. This, along with grading issues, can cause cracks in the foundation as water freezes and expands.

        "content": "This post may be controversial for some because it doesnât necessarily reflect what everybody is saying about our real estate market. Today Iâm going to share some challenges and opportunities for people in the apartment, detached housing, and attached housing markets. Iâve got a forecast for the 2018 market to share as well.Some people say real estate is all about location, location, location. In my opinion, itâs actually all about money, money, money. Ultimately, the real estate market is affected by how much money is in the system. It comes from three different places.First, it comes from the money that is available through jobs and wages. Statistics show that our unemployment rate is decreasing, but it can be very misleading because the replacement jobs are not in the same salary range. This statistic also doesnât show who has had their hours cut back, who is on furlough, and who is receiving reduced salaries and bonuses. On the other side, there are good things that weâre not hearing about, such as whatâs going on in the fracking and drilling market.Secondly, the money that is available from banks. The impact of stricter lending criteria and higher rates mean there is less money available for buyers. This will push demand for the lower-priced detached homes even higher. If you have a home youâre looking to sell, there is a great opportunity here to be a move-up buyer.âThere are a few things you need to be prepared for in 2018.âThe third kind of money is the money in the stock market. Our market has been overvalued for a long time in my opinion. We should be due for a correction (or three) soon. When people start losing money in their investments and retirement portfolios, it always affects the economy.When you combine those three types of money with our current inventory, which includes a lot of new construction, I donât think we will see much of a change in our market as far as the number of sales are concerned.At the same time, I think you should be prepared for a few things in 2018. Because of the increased supply of apartments on the market, I think values will drop around 5% this year for apartments. The attached home market should remain pretty flat and the detached home market is in for about a 2% drop in pricing.If you have the right product in the right neighborhood, you can do very well in this market. Weâve been seeing a lot of multiple offer situations out there. With a complex market like this, the first thing you need to do if youâre thinking of buying or selling is to call an expert. Iâd be happy to be your real estate expert and Iâm always here to answer any and all of your questions. Just give me a call today! I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

However, when you are truly serious about obtaining a diagnosis, you most likely turn to a medical professional or specialist.You wouldnât trust your health to a websiteâs best guess, so donât trust the value of your home to one either. In order to know what your home is truly worth, youâll need to contact a trusted advisor.If you like, you can send your assessment to me. I would be happy to send you some recent comparables.Also, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Iâm in a beautifully renovated bungalow for this weekâs post. As soon as I walked in here, I knew it had so many amazing features that are usually reserved for homes at twice the price. The one feature that stood out to me was the American Clay walls. They are absolutely gorgeous. They were done by Patrick Allard, a local artisan and craftsman who just happens to be with us today.Â Patrick and his company, Ecowalls, specialize in the application of natural plasters and work with things like American Clay and lime plaster. Both are veneers that are intended to cover existing surfaces like drywall, masonry, and certain types of wood composites.Their company motto is âImproving your space one wall at a timeâ and Patrick explained a little bit more about what that means to him. Thereâs certainly an aesthetic component to it, but the walls that they build have even more benefits beyond that. One is a significant environmental factor. Pound for pound, clay plasters like this are the cleanest and most environmentally stable things that you can use to build or renovate your walls.âThese walls can bring health benefits as well.âThese walls bring health benefits as well. Have you ever been in the woods after a rainstorm? Something magical happens when earth and water meet, but in reality itâs all scientific. When earth and water meet in the form of vapor, negative ions are released that make you feel refreshed and relaxed at the same time. These walls are like having a natural negative ion machine in your house. The bathroom is a perfect place for these because of the amount of humidity in there. The mirrors will never fog, even if you forget to turn the fan on.A few more things to note about these clay walls is that they are mold resistant, they never fade, and they reduce dust in the home via a positive static charge.Â If you have any questions at all about these walls. Head on over to ecowalls.ca and have a look. If you have any other questions about real estate or anything else, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.",

        "content": "Should you buy first or sell first? I get the dilemma: You donât want to lose a whole bunch of money, but you also donât want to end up homeless either. Today, weâre going to discuss some mistakes that buyers and sellers make that can cause them to lose sleep, money, and even your marbles.One of the traps that are easily avoidable I see people frequently fall into can be summed up in this example:Tom and Mary are excited to move, but they want to make sure they find the right place first, so they go out with their agent right away to start looking at places. It takes a little time, but they find a place that they fall in love with. They go to write an offer and at this time, they start talking to a mortgage broker who informs them that they canât buy a property without selling their property first. Oops.But since they just love the property, they decide to put in an offer anyway, one thatâs subject to the sale of their home. After a lengthy negotiation, they come to an agreement on price and terms. Itâs about $10,000 more than the market value because the sellers demanded a premium due to the risks involved with the clause that makes the transaction subject to the sale of the buyersâ home. They decide to go for it.Â Tom and Mary also understand that if another offer comes along, theyâre going to have to waive all of their conditions, not just the sale of their home. That means that if something comes up within the week, theyâll have to waive their financing and home inspection right away.Â Tom and Mary are eager to get their home going, so they donât have time to make the necessary repairs or even stage their home. They decide to put it at about $5,000 under the last comparable saleâthey figure it will sell a little faster this way too, and whatâs another $5,000?Things are going well on the purchase of their dream home; the home inspection went well, and the last-minute financing was sorted out as well. Now they even have an offer on their place. However, this offer is about $20,000 under their already aggressive price. They canât accept that; thatâs crazy!Just then, they get a notice from the other agent, saying that thereâs another offer that has come in on their dream home. Now they have 48 hours to waive all of their conditions. They decide to think about it overnight.Â After a sleepless night and a lot of arguments, they decide to accept $15,000 lower than their asking price from the current buyers. So theyâve now spent an extra $10,000 on the purchase of their old home and about $20,000 lower on their new home because of their emotional attachment.âI get the dilemma: You donât want to lose a whole bunch of money, but you also donât want to homeless either.âThey decide to waive the conditions on the financing, the home inspection, and even the sale of their current home. Luckily, everything goes along fine, and Tom and Mary are now in their new home.Theyâre fairly happy, that is, until a property comes on the market three doors down with an identical floor planâfor $10,000 less than for what they bought theirs. Oops.Please donât fall into this trap. Your numbers and stress could be smaller or significantly larger. It didnât have to go this way for Tom and Mary, and it definitely doesnât have to go that way for you. There are all kinds of systems and processes that we can utilize that will save you time, money, and heartache.Remember, sharing is caring. If someone you know is in this situation, please share this with them. For any questions you have about this or other topics, feel free to get in touch with my team and I.

Here are the seven most common life changes that let you know youâre a candidate for an address change as well:1. The seven-year itch. The average consumer moves homes every seven years.2. You are living below your means. Quite often when we get a promotion or raise, we want our environment to reflect that. Renovations often arenât worth the money, so buying a bigger or better house is a great option.3. You have children that have recently left home. This signals that itâs time to downsize.Â 4. Youâre expecting children. This signals itâs time to upgrade to a larger space.5. Youâre getting married. Itâs often better for the new relationship when you can start off fresh in a new home instead of trying to move into one of the spouseâs old homes that will never quite be your own.6. Youâre getting divorced. The process moves along much quicker after any shared dwelling is sold and each party gets their own home.7. You have a long commute. If youâre driving 45 minutes each way to work, thatâs 1.5 hours every day and 1.5 months every year. Thatâs a lot of time to spend on unnecessary travel.âThe average consumer buys a new home every seven years.âIf you or someone you know fits any of these criteria and is ready to start the process of finding a new home, give us a call or send us an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "If you are trying to sell your property, itâs important to avoid these three cardinal real estate sins.1. Winging it without a proper pricing strategy. Itâs very important to have the correct pricing strategy right from the start. The price is not just about location, location, location and the strengths and weaknesses of your property. We have to look at the technical analysis and economic data, which includes things like the absorption rate, days on market, and trends in your neighborhood.To determine the right price for your home, weâll look at a few different factors. First of all, weâll look at expired, withdrawn, or terminated listings. Those homes were rejected by the market. Then, weâll look at recently sold properties, which will give us an idea of what your home could sell for. Finally, weâll look at active listings that are currently on the market. These listings are your competition, so we need to see how your home compares to those properties.Determining the price of your home means walking the very fine line between selling your home close to market value without leaving any money on the table.2. Promoting too little. There are a lot of distractions out there these days. Corporations spend billions of dollars on weapons of mass distraction to get your attention. To get and keep a homebuyerâs attention, you need superior online and offline marketing strategies.That means we will promote your home on social media and online classifieds with professional photos and virtual tours. Offline, weâll use door hangers, open houses, and signage. People still look at traditional, offline strategies. Since we never know where a buyer will come from, itâs important to cover all of our bases.3.Not making your property presentable. You donât get a second chance to make a great first impression. Make sure your property looks its best from the very start. It should look fantastic in the pictures and for every showing. Make sure that the house looks clean and consider adding a fresh layer of paint.âWork with an agent who has a professional stager.âItâs very important to pick everything up in your home. Even a little bit of clutter can stop a buyer from making an offer. Work with an agent who has a professional stager. Having the property professionally staged will put your home over the top and ensure that your sale will happen as soon as possible.If you avoid these three major mistakes when selling your home, you will succeed.If you have any other questions about selling your home or pour current real estate market, just give me a call or send me an email.

        "title": "5 Ways to Avoid Buyer's Remorse",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Far too often, buyers find what they think is the perfect home only to be disappointed after they move in. Once the rose-colored glasses come off and problems start to become apparent, they are left with serious buyerâs remorse.Â When it comes to real estate, regretting your purchase isnât as simple as going back to a store and telling the cashier that youâve changed your mind about what you bought.Â However, this situation can be avoided if youâre equipped with the right knowledge. There are a few key things you should never overlook when buying a home. Today, Iâd like to share five tips.  Make sure to go see the property at night. You want to make sure that you see your property at various times of the day. A home can look and be very different at different times. It isnât just danger you need to worry about. Perhaps youâve only seen the property during the day when many of your neighbors were out or at work. If you move in believing you have plenty of street parking only to find out that the entire block looks different after sundown, you could end up with some problems.  Donât forget to figure out your new commute.Â Nowadays, distance tends to be measured in time instead of in kilometers or miles. Make sure you check out your route to work and other critical places when considering a new home. Traffic is another thing to consider, so be sure to drive the route you would take during different times of the day. This will give you the best feel for what things will truly be like.Â   Pay attention to features that canât be changed. Donât let yourself be blinded by flashy details. Things like a jacuzzi or an Elvis mural shouldnât outweigh features like the floorplan and the lot location. Personal details and flashy touches can be added down the line. For example, even the most spectacular house may not be worth it if itâs in a terrible location.Â   Donât overlook the propertyâs resale value. Properties will always come with their own unique set of features and challenges. While a home sitting on a busy street may not be a problem for you, it will be an issue for other buyers. Even if you donât plan to move for quite some time, you still need to think about resale value from the very start.  Pay attention to the bedroom-to-bathroom ratio.Â Ideally, you want to have an ensuite and at least one guest bathroom. The more bathrooms, the better. No one should ever be upset about too many bathrooms. And no, two toilets in one room do not count as multiple bathrooms.âWhen it comes to real estate, regretting your purchase isnât as simple as going back to a store and telling the cashier that youâve changed your mind.âIf you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Whatâs the latest real estate news from Calgary?There is still some uncertainty in our market with fluctuating interest rates, and there are some new rules in place that have knocked some buyers out of the market. Due to decreased demand, inventory has increased. However, there are new rules coming down the pipeline which will most likely give us a little boost because buyers have a fear of missing out before the rules change again.Letâs look at the latest numbers. In September, we had 6,861 listings and 1,462 home sales, and Calgaryâs overall benchmark price for that month was $441,500. The average price for detached houses was $508,900, the price for attached homes was up to $336,000, and the price for condos was $263,700.As I often say, though, averages are dangerous. You can have your head in the oven and your feet in the freezer and your average temperature would be OK, but you wouldnât be feeling too good. This rationale also applies to our market.âAs I often say, averages are dangerous.âTake a look at our months of inventory, for example. In Northwest Calgary, things are relatively hot, and weâre just above our three-month moving average. Just above that in North Calgary, the moving average is also just above three months, but in reality, things are much cooler because there is about 5.5 months of inventory available on the market right now.There are challenges and opportunities in both these kinds of marketsâit really just depends on where you are, having the right skill set, and having the right plan in place.Next time, weâll talk about three seller mistakes you want to avoid in todayâs changing market and what you shouldnât overlook when buying your next property.In the meantime, if you have any questions about our current market, donât hesitate to reach out to me.
