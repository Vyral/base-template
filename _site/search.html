        "content": "Today I want to explain a few different real estate terms in detail. Oftentimes, we use a lot of shorthand or abbreviated words without realizing it, and I wanted to make sure youâre clear on what some of these terms mean when you hear them come up in conversation.1. Comps. This is short for âcomparables.â Itâs just a word that we use to refer to homes that are comparable to yours when weâre getting ready to buy or sell a home. They help us know whether or not a homeâs value is in the right range.âPMI is required for homebuyers that are putting down less than 20% on their home purchase.â2. PMI. This stands for private mortgage insurance. Itâs required for homebuyers that are putting down less than 20% on their home purchase. This insurance insures the lender, but it doesnât have to last forever. Once you have 20% equity in your home, you can get a re-appraisal and get it removed.3. Closing costs. They refer to all the additional fees it takes to finalize a home closing. They include things like escrow fees, lender fees, and attorney fees. It doesnât include inspection costs.Those are just a few terms that I wanted to make sure you were aware of. If you have any questions about the Memphis real estate market or anything else, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Today I wanted to talk about five things that you should never compromise on as a buyer:1. The floor plan. Make sure that it fits your needs now and in the future.2. The school district. Even if your kids are out of the house, this matters for resale value. Â You can find out about the different municipalities online to see what school system the home you are looking at is in.âIt is important not to overextend yourself financially.â3. The neighbors. If you are interested in a house in a neighborhood you are unfamiliar with, drive around during different times during the day to make sure you will be happy and comfortable there.4. Your budget. It is important not to overextend yourself financially. You want to be comfortable with what you are buying.5. The commute. Maybe take a test drive of the commute before you decide to pull the trigger. This is another important factor.If you have any questions for me or you are interested in buying or selling a home here in Memphis, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "title": "6 Ways to Compete Against Cash Buyers and Win Your Dream Home",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "How do you make a competitive offer when you are going against cash buyers? While a lot of the market is not paying cash, there are some people who are. Youâre not out of luck, though. I have a few options for you that will help you be competitive and win your dream home.1. Provide a level of comfort to the seller. If you are comfortable with it, show them your bank statements and credit scores to prove that you have your finances in order. They will know you have quite a bit of cash if you are putting 20% down on a loan.2. Consider not doing an inspection. You always have the right to an inspection. But, if you are comfortable with not doing an inspection because you are buying as-is anyway, it could be huge for the seller to not have to deal with that. Inspections are a source of contention which could be avoided.âIf you are comfortable not having an inspection, you may be more appealing to a seller since they can avoid that possible contention.â3. Have all the documentation ready for your lender. This way, all they need is a contract from you and an appraisal. This will cut down the process tremendously.4. Expedite the appraisal process. When you are supplying the documentation, ask the lender if they can order an appraisal the day they have the address. Let the seller know this so they can have a quicker closing.5. Cash buyers think they should get a discount since they are spending cash. This is not necessarily true. You could finance a little more to pay the seller more and the difference could only be $15 to $20 per month. The seller will choose you because you are providing more.6. Provide a letter about yourself. If you write a personal letter about your family, it touches the sellerâs heart. They know they are selling the home to someone who will love it as opposed to an investor, which means a lot to a seller.If you have any questions about any of this or about buying or selling, please feel free to contact me.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today I want to give you some tips on how to interview agents before you hire them to help you sell your home. Here are seven questions you need to ask:1. How long have you been in the business?Â A good way to gauge an agentâs experience and productivity is to ask them about their designation. A good designation for an agent to have is the CRS, or certified residential specialist, which requires you to have a certain level of production and work a certain number of hours.2. What is your list-to-sale price ratio? Your Realtor should know their average list price to sales price. If they listed a home for $100,000 and sold it for $95,000, then their list price to sales price would be 95%. Seeing the averages can show you how much more they can get you. And, how much more money in your pocket.3. Whatâs our best marketing plan or strategy? Are they online? How do they take their pictures? Are they on Zillow? Whatever you would like to know about that, feel free to ask. They should even have some samples for you to see, or different sites to go to.âWhatever you would like to know about that, feel free to ask.â4. Do they have references that you can talk to? You should look for someone that can point you to references. You should be able to call them if you wanted. Zillow is huge right now for reviews, so we try to get a lot of reviews on Zillow. You can see if a Realtor that you are looking at has their reviews on Zillow and what they say.5. Can you review the documents ahead of time? Some people may send pre-listing documents that you may want to look at before they come back. There is nothing wrong with looking at that and asking questions.7. How much do you charge and what kind of guarantee do you offer? Since commissions are not a set amount, this can range. Nobody can set these fees for you as they do depend on different companies and agents. Is there a satisfaction guarantee included as well, or some other kind of guarantee?7. What have I not asked that I need to know about? See if there are any common questions that slipped your mind or you didnât even think to ask about.If you have any questions about this list or anything else related to selling your home, please contact me by phone or email. I look forward to speaking with you.",

Letâs take a look at how our market fared this February and March compared to what we saw during the same time in 2017.First of all, sales and average home prices have both risen year over year. Year-to-date, prices have actually risen 8% so far. This is a decent improvement upon the 5% average increase we typically see over this period.âThis lack of inventory is great for sellers but can make it difficult for buyers to find the right property.âWhile sales volume is up, we are still experiencing a shortage of inventory. As of the end of March, we recorded just 3,883 units on the market. In March of 2017, there were 4,464 units on the market. This lack of inventory is great for sellers but can make it difficult for buyers to find the right property.If they are able to find a home, buyers currently have the opportunity to take advantage of todayâs low interest rates.No matter what your real estate goals may be, I would be happy to help you discover the best way to navigate these current market conditions.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Today, Iâd like to share with you 10 observations I received from an inspector that he sees during every home inspection.1. Windows often need to be replaced or resealed. In terms of cost, itâs not as big of a deal as you would think to fix those issues.2. Check to make sure the chimney is cleaned and well-maintained. Itâs a good idea to have the chimney checked every two years. Almost nobody does that, but we have people we can refer you to if you need.3. Make sure doors seal and shut properly.4. Take care of the heating and air conditioning system. If you havenât changed the filter recently, itâs a good thing to do. Itâs cheap and a great thing to do ahead of time so that you can provide the letter of service when itâs time for the inspection.5. Provide and change the lightbulbs.Â I know it sounds silly, but you would not believe how many times we see in inspection reports that a certain number of lights donât work.âMove or pack away any items that will prevent an inspector from accessing areas theyâll need to in order to do their jobs.â6. Check for rotten wood around the home.Â That includes walking around the exterior, looking behind the gutters, and under the eaves and soffits. Home inspectors will be looking for that.7. Buyers want a roof that is in great shape. We have a roofer who can come out and inspect yours to see if there are any issues or leaks. For $75, he can give us a roofing letter.8. Tighten your plumbing fixtures.Â Make sure there arenât any drips or cracks that could cause water- or mold-related damages.9. Make sure there is no furniture in the inspectorâs way.Â Move or pack away any items that will prevent an inspector from accessing areas theyâll need to in order to do their jobs. Panel boxes, water heaters, furnaces, and other such key areas are especially important to keep clear.10. Know your home. We always put things off until we get ready to list, but if you take the time to familiarize yourself with the workings and condition of your home, the easy it will be for you to address any problems before it comes to inspect it.If you need any resources or have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us.

These fees can vary quite a bit and can really affect your monthly mortgage payment.4. Different credit cards.

Any seller whoâs considering refinancing is probably staying where theyâre at, and this trend has created a shortage of inventory in our market, both locally and nationwide. As you can see in the graph in the video, our year-to-date inventory is the lowest itâs been in the last decade.If youâre a buyer, the current situation might be a bit of a struggle.

Make sure theyâre a member of the Home Builders Association (in our case, the West Tennessee Home Builders), which allows them to provide a one-year warranty. Beware of all of the add-ons, too, because there are many things that could be considered upgrades that might pull you out of your budget. Stay involved in the building process and donât be afraid to ask questions. Also, learn about the surrounding neighborhood before you buy.âStay involved in the building process and donât be afraid to ask questions.âNext, be flexible. With the weather being how it is, builders canât always determine when your house will be totally completed. They should be able to keep you updated and informed, but youâll need some flexible dates in mind so everything can be controlled.Lastly, itâs not a bad idea to have a home inspection. The builder will do a walkthrough with you, but itâs still worth the money to have a home inspection and let someone else take a look at the home to make sure nothing gets overlooked.If you have any questions about buying new construction or any other real estate topic, feel free to give me a call.

Bank-owned property sales are down by 20%.  Home sales over $500,000 are up over 30%.As far as that steep drop in bank-owned property sales is concerned, itâs actually a good sign for our market.

There are still foreclosures available out there, but they are a little harder to find now.âBank-owned properties are down a whopping 20%.âThere is a chart below that shows the numbers for all the different municipalities in the area. As you can see, the average sale price has increased in Arlington, Bartlett, Collierville, and Germantown.The market is still very strong for sellers, but we arenât seeing as many multiple offer situations.

        "content": "If youâre looking to buy a home here in Memphis, you might have to compete against other offers for a home you like.For starters, remember that no other buyers know what the offers are, so you donât have to worry about your offer being revealed. However, you can do a few things to make your offer better.First, put down as much earnest money as possible. This speaks volumes to the seller about your interest level in the home and that you can follow through with the loan process. Putting down a small amount means you donât have any skin in the game, and the seller might not see your offer as worth it at that point.Secondly, show the seller that you are qualified for a home loan. Get fully pre-approved for a loan instead of just getting pre-qualified, which carries less weight. An offer with a pre-approval is akin to a cash offer for a seller.âSHOW THE SELLER THAT YOU ARE QUALIFIED FOR A HOME LOAN.âYou can also give the seller extra time to move. Call the listing agent and ask them whatâs important to their seller, because itâs not always all about money. For example, I recently worked with a seller who needed to rent the house back for a couple months after closing because they have a handicapped child. There are many situations going on in peopleâs lives, and accommodating them can help you win the home.Finally, add a personal touch by writing a letter telling the seller why you love the home. Also be aware of what youâre willing to pay for the home.If you have any questions about multiple offer situations when buying a home, give us a call or send us an email soon.

If you have a $500 limit, donât let the balance sit at $495.Next, donât switch jobs. If you do need to switch, try to stay in the same field so lenders have information about the switch.

If you have a high limit and youâve maxed that out, it wonât look good to lenders.

Unless you live in the downtown area, you should have received your appraisal by now.If you disagree with your appraisal, you can go to the Shelby County tax assessor site and fill out an informal request for a reassessment. You donât have to provide a lot of documentation for an informal request, so it is a fairly easy process. That said, there is a short time frame for informal requests. Beginning on May 1st, you can make a formal request. That is a much more involved process.âMAKE SURE YOUR LENDER IS USING THE CORRECT TAX ASSESSMENT.âIf you are selling your house and your taxes have gone up, this could impact you. Since taxes are divided between you and your potential buyer at closing, the buyer could come to you and ask for additional taxes since your appraisal went up.If you are a buyer and you are currently under contract to purchase a home, make sure that your lender is using the correct tax assessment. Unfortunately, in some instances even a slight increase in monthly taxes can make a huge difference between getting approved for a loan or not.As always, if you have any questions about this topic, just give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "Interest rates have been a hot topic recently, so today, Iâve brought in Wendy Thompson with the Wendy Thompson Lending Team of Bank of England Mortgage to help me explain.The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.25% last week, and the market actually responded very positively. Rates had been rising before, but weâve actually settled with rates at about 4.25% with FHA, VA, and USDA interest rates at 4%. The Federal Reserve anticipates two more rate increases of 0.25% this year as well.The good thing is that despite the recent rise, rates are still very low. If youâre thinking about buying a new home, itâs better to act sooner than later.Rates have been so low for so long that itâs actually better for the economy for them to go up now. After all, we all want our retirement funds and investments to do well also. The impact of rising rates on your costs isnât substantial either. For a $200,000 home, a 0.25% increase in rates only equates to about $25 more per month. Historically speaking, having rates this low is great compared to the 18% I saw when I started in real estate.âRATES HAVE BEEN SO LOW FOR SO LONG THAT ITâS ACTUALLY BETTER FOR THE ECONOMY FOR THEM TO GO UP NOW.âMany people donât know that mortgage-backed securities control mortgage rates. Thatâs why itâs important to work with a mortgage lender who follows rate changes daily. As Wendy says, itâs a bit volatile right now because things outside of the country can even have an effect on rates, so they can change on a dime. Having a knowledgeable lender is more important in these conditions.If you have any questions for Wendy about rates or getting approved for a home loan, you can reach her at Wendy@TheWendyThompsonTeam.com or give her a call at 901-461-8858.As always, if you have any questions about our market or youâre thinking about buying or selling a home, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

After all, the way we live in our home every day is different from the way we live in it after it has been on the market. Here are five things you need to pay attention to when selling a home with pets:      Tufts of fur: If you have a cat or dog that sheds, you need to clean up the extra fur that gathers around the house so that your home doesnât look messy.        Floor stains: Redo your hardwood floors if need be and make sure that any pet stains are cleaned out of the carpet.  âCLEAN UP ANY PET STAINS TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY.â      Pet odors: You can get used to the smell when you live there, but you donât want buyers to walk in and think your house smells like wet dog. Pet stores sell products, like candles, that will cover up pet odors without being too overwhelming.        Scratches and dings: Puppies love to chew and scratch at things. If you have marks on your furniture, there are special pens out there that can cover those up. Pay attention to your windowsills and doors, as dogs tend to scratch on those as well.        Bowls, pet beds, and litter boxes: Put away all of the pet paraphernalia that you can and make sure that the litter box is clean; buyers donât want to see or smell that.  Take care of these five things so that your home shows well. If you have any other questions about selling with pets or about the home-selling process in general, give me a call or send me an email.

There are plenty of things you may have put off, like new appliances or granite countertops, so why not enjoy them a bit before selling your house? Give yourself a chance to cook with those new appliances first.The second reason to start renovations early is that they always take longer than you expect. If you get an estimated timeline of six weeks, plan on 12 weeks. Itâs just the nature of the beast. If you plan for this, you wonât have to be stressed about getting your house finished and on the market in a certain amount of time.Thirdly, you might run into issues that youâre not aware of.
