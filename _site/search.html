        "content": "Here are five ways you can prepare your home for sale:  Clean &amp; declutter. Remove any excess furniture and belongings that are on the countertops or shelving to make the interior space feel more open.  Depersonalize. Remove any photos or personal items that are specific to your family and lifestyle so that the new buyers can picture their family in that space.âThe way the home looks from the curb is what draws buyers inside.â  Do minor repairs. You donât necessarily need to retile the bathroom or remodel the kitchen, but you do want to take care of other minor things, like making sure the doors and cabinets open and close correctly, patching up holes and nicks in the walls, or repainting the walls and trimming where needed.  Enhance curb appeal. Make sure that the exterior of the home and yard is clean and tidy. One thing that makes a big impact is adding bright and colorful flowers and pots. Remember, itâs the way the home looks from the curb that draws buyers inside.  Detach emotionally. Start to think of it as a house rather than your home. You want to visualize the new buyers moving in and yourself moving on to the next stage of your life.If you have any questions or would like more information regarding this topic, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to helping you in any way I can.",

        "content": "Should you reach out to your Realtor in order to find a local lender? Yes. Real estate agents have access to many local lenders, credit unions, and mortgage companies.Larger institutions canât service your financing needs as well as mortgage companies. They usually offer limited products, whereas mortgage companies usually offer 15 products or more. Youâll also face a better chance of pre-approval with a mortgage company because they offer more loan products to choose from and are more flexible with down payments and credit scores.The advantages of working with a preferred lender are numerous. Our preferred lenders have amazing customer service, theyâre great to work with, and theyâre always available after hours and on the weekends.If you have any questions about our preferred lenders or whatâs going on in the real estate market, please give me a call or send me an email.

There are a lot of other variables in play, including the terms of the loan, whether or not itâs a cash offer, some contingencies, and the length of the closing. You should consider four things before accepting a buyerâs offer:  Their financing  The length of the closing period  The terms of the loan  Any contingenciesSometimes cash buyers are better than financed offers; however, cash buyers usually come in lower.

        "content": "Today, we wanted to take you on a quick tour of the lovely Sellwood neighborhood in Portland. Sellwood is located on the east bank of the Willamette River, near the southern end of Ross Island. Itâs about two miles long and a mile wide.Sellwood is a teardrop-shaped area thatâs rich in natural and recreational amenities, including four public parks. Sellwood also boasts a full range of businesses and services, like specialty retail stores, antiques, grocery stores, hardware stores, banks, and dry cleaners to name a few.Itâs a very walkable neighborhood for both errands and exercise.One of the great parks is Sellwood Riverfront Park, which stretches 7.6 acres along the river in Southeast Portland. The park has a boat dock, canoe launch, an off-leash dog area, paths, and riverfront views. Itâs a popular area for celebrating the Fourth of July thanks to the great views of the downtown fireworks. The park is just south of the famous Oaks Amusement Park and Roller Rink.Sellwood has a New Seasons Market nestled right in the middle. New Seasons is a locally-owned chain of grocery stores that supplies many locally-sourced items and sells home goods and wellness products as well.In the video above, you can see a good example of a Sellwood house. This bungalow was built in 1904 and is 1,899 square feet with three bedrooms and one bathroom. This home sold for $500,000 in November 2015.I hope you enjoyed this look at Sellwood! If youâre interested in buying or selling a home in Portland, give me a call or send me an email. Iâd love to work with you!",

        "author": "liz@getvyral.com",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Why is housing inventory an important statistic to track on the market?Housing inventory is measured in months of inventory. This is basically how many months it would take for all of the available homes to sell if no new homes were listed on the market.A good housing inventory would be about four to five months of houses on the market. If that number is smaller than four, it means that the home buyers are dominating the market and that there are relatively few sellers. In that market, home sellers have the advantage. A number over five would mean that buyers have the advantage in the market.How does housing inventory affect your homeâs value? While your homeâs value is affected by size, location, and condition, a tight real estate marketâor one with a lower inventoryâwill always drive prices up. Itâs the law of scarcity.If youâd like to know the current housing inventory in your area or have any other questions related to real estate, please give me a call or send me an email. Iâd be happy to help you!",

A non-biased third party will physically come to the property and inspect the interior and exterior of the home. The appraiser will then pull comparisons from the neighborhoodâtypically homes that have sold or are currently pending within a close radiusâgather the information, put it into a very thorough report, and come up with a value. Upon finishing the report, the appraiser will then send it to the lender, the lender will contact the buyer, and the buyer will be able to pick the report apart to find out how the value was calculated.How do appraisals affect the home buyer? The appraisal is performed to protect the buyer from overpaying for the property.âThe appraisal protects the buyer from overpaying for the property.âHow do appraisals affect the home seller? If the appraisal comes in below the sales price, the borrower will not be able to obtain a loan to purchase the property. If this is the case, either the seller will have to lower their sales price to accommodate the appraised value, or the buyer can come in with a larger down payment to make up the difference.If you have any other questions about the appraisal process and what to expect during it, or youâre thinking about buying or selling Portland real estate, give me a call or send me an email.

Soon, in the winter, youâll be reminded of how often you use the furnace, too.Itâs one of the major systems in your home, and a surprise issue with one of these systems can be a nightmare if handled improperly. Thatâs why we wanted to share a video from Angieâs List that we recently saw about proper maintenance of your heating and cooling systems.If either unit is having issues, did you know you can actually hire technicians who are specially trained to work on certain brands? For example, if you have a Trane system, you can find a tech who is trained specifically to work on Trane products.Secondly, always remember to get a second opinion when someone recommends that you replace a system because oftentimes a repair will do. You want to be certain when it comes to a part of your home that should last 20 years, especially considering the cost of a replacement.Unfortunately, as the video points out, there are a lot of people out there in that deal in these systems and prey on customers that donât know any better. If youâre hiring a company, you should investigate them by checking out their web reviews or social media pages.Also, be proactive with service with on these systems. If you wait until the system is broken down and needs repair to get it checked out, youâre now at their mercy.As always, for any real estate questions for the Syracuse area, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "How can you stand out as a buyer in the competitive Portland real estate market? There are a few ways to achieve this.  Pre-approval from your lender and a competitive offer. A pre-approval shows you are qualified for a mortgage and are financially able to buy their home. These days, sellers wonât take an offer seriously without a pre-approval letter, especially in competitive markets like Portland. Donât even consider making a lowball offer. Sellers have a slight edge in this market, so if you want your offer to stand out, you need to show that youâre serious.  Quick timelines on inspections and appraisals. Sometimes, a competitive offer price isnât even enough. To many sellers, favorable time lines like those on inspections, appraisals, and closing carry more value than a few thousands dollars. The buyerâs agent should reach out to the listing agent to find out the sellerâs goals and if they want to close quickly or if they want to close after their children are done with the school year.  Trust for your agent. Your agent is a real estate professional who works full-time studying the market in order to get you the best deal. Theyâre also expert negotiators who can get you the best deal on a home and find ways to make your offer more attractive to a home seller.We can help with all of these factors.

Designer Angelo Surmelis shares several great ideas to spread holiday cheer throughout the home. Here are some of our favorites.  Pay attention to the mantle. If you donât have some already, buy some kind of garland to drape over the mantle. Next, use leftover ornaments and candles to add light and texture. When choosing ornaments and candles, ensure they are in the same color-palette. This helps make your mantle a great focal point!  Use smaller Christmas trees. Every house has their main Christmas tree. In addition, you can also purchase smaller, inexpensive, eco-friendly trees to place throughout the home. Decorate these trees with strips of fabric from a T-shirt in holiday colors to save money for the main tree.  Use what you have. Be resourceful. Adding a plate charger and place mat to your everyday dining set adds some jazz to your table. Fresh-cut flowers and candles will help finish the look. You donât need grand, expensive candles â a little candlelight goes a long way!As you can see, it doesnât take much to make your home feel more festive.

It follows the Willamette River for three miles, stretching north to South Waterfront and south to the Sellwood Bridge. Johnâs Landing is home to both commercial and residential properties, including our very own Stellar Realty office!Just across the street is Jolly Roger, a great pit stop whether youâre looking for food or something to drink; we really like to do Thursday night trivia! Down the street youâll find the amazing Zen Salon; I recommend Melissa - sheâs great for girls and guys alike!There is a great variety a homes in the Johnâs Landing neighborhood. Properties range from gorgeous old foursquares to bungalows and condos! Seeing these great old homes is a great reminder of the home maintenance we should all be doing in our current homes: cleaning your furnace filter; inspecting your tub and sink drains; cleaning your carpets and windows; checking the batteries in your smoke detectors; and inspecting your roofing, among other things.  For a complete list, check out the Better Homes and Gardens Maintenance Checklist!A great restaurant in the area is Fulton Pub &amp; Brewery, one of the infamous McMenamins restaurants. The story behind this pub is quite interesting. Although the McMenamins didnât open this pub until 1988, legend has it that the pub dates back to 1926, before it was a prohibition era hangout that served home cooked meals and offered pinball games, candy, and ice cream. To learn more about McMenamins and the passport program they have, click here.One of the best parts about Johnâs Landing is Willamette Park. Thereâs plenty of room to play for the kids and plenty of room for adults as well. Across the river is the Oregon Yacht Club, to the south is the Sellwood Bridge, and to the North is the downtown area. Itâs a great place for recreation of all kinds, but especially boating!If you have any questions about Johnâs Landing, or if you want to search for homes in the neighborhood, visit Caralee.PortlandPropertyFinders.com.

        "author": "Emily Peterson",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today, Shelby Spencer of Primary Residential Mortgage joins us to discuss some of the changes to FHA Guidelines starting September 14.The biggest change to look out for is with student loans, which can no longer be removed from the debt ratio if they are deferred. This means that all contracts or offers written after September 14 will be affected by these changes. Another change comes to large deposits; we used to only need to source large deposits of around 2% of the sales price, but deposits of 1% or more now need to be documented. In addition to these changes, know that funds can no longer be used as assets; you canât create a stronger profile with gift funds, although they can be used as a down payment.With the inventory as tight as it is; there is a good chance some of the pre-approved FHA buyers may find themselves losing their previously issued pre-approved status before they get an accepted offer. The new FHA guidelines take effect with FHA case numbers assigned on or after 9/14/15. (Case numbers can only be assigned when a property has been identified.)  The following bullet points are just a few of the areas that could affect buyers. I * recommend that all FHA pre-approved buyers contact their loan officer to review their * situation against the new guidelines. Here are some of the areas that are affected (I * will cover them in more detail soon):  Federal Tax Liens  Mixed Use Property  Bankruptcy less than 2 years  Occupant borrower has no credit score  Self-employed borrowerâs income is greater than 20% declining from the previous year  Installment debts with less than 10 months remaining  Deferred loan payments (student loans)  30-day credit accounts  More than 3 jobs and/or profession changes in the last 12 months  2- to 4-unit properties  Retaining current home as a rental  Nontaxable income (like social security income)  Earnest money deposits greater than 1% of sales price  Using gifted funds for any reserve requirementsAs long as everyone is aware of these changes up front, closing times shouldnât be too affected. Of course, the best way to prepare yourself for these changes is to reach out to a professional and begin the process sooner than later. You can reach Shelby at SSpencer@Primeres.com or (503) 572-8865. Of course, if you have questions or concerns on the real estate side of things, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

        "content": "Today Iâd like to share an interesting video I found on HGTV. It documents the ten best renovations that you can make on your home that wonât cause you to go broke! Renovations can get expensive, but here are some ideas to help you get more bang for your buck.  Using subway tiles is an inexpensive way to redo your kitchen and add a retro feel to it.  Speaking of a retro feel, using vintage furniture and fixtures can look and feel great on your wallet.  You can create an âart wallâ by collecting used wood. This hand-crafted, old-school look is sure to impress your guests.  Instead of ripping out your hardwood floors entirely, just replace the ones that cannot be used anymore. Lacing new boards in with old ones has an eye-catching look.  Changing the knobs on your cabinets and doors can create a whole different feel in a kitchen.  Instead of updating your entire bathroom, just refinish your tub. It makes everything else look new again.  Painting your home by yourself can be a huge money-saver.  Hiring a good Realtor can save you money as well. They know how to negotiate deals and get you the best price on a home that youâre buying or selling. Talk to me about this!  Waterproofing your roof can save you tons and tons of money down the road. Being proactive about major structural issues in your home is always a good idea.  The last couple saved nearly $20,000 renovating their home because they knew a good mill-worker. While I canât promise that youâll save that much, I do know good contractors that can offer you discounts on their services!So, there you have it. Ten easy ways to save money while renovating your home. While these are all great ideas, Iâd prefer if you spoke with me before you went about ripping up your house.Not all renovations are necessary if youâre trying to get top dollar before a sale.

        "content": "There is so much going on in the Portland real estate market right now.Itâs been so crazy that we havenât had time to update you with a video in quite some time. Weâre back now and decided that now is a great time to catch you up to speed on whatâs going on in Portland real estate.We have been getting some panicky messages from sellers who have heard that the market has cooled off. That is not necessarily the case. According to the Case Shiller Home Price Index, while appreciation and home prices have slowed, they are still appreciating in value, both nationally and locally. We canât have 12% appreciation every single year, so this is not the end of the world.Most economists realize that inventory plays a big part in this market trend. When we talk about âmonths of inventoryâ we are referring to how many months it would take to sell the current inventory assuming nothing new comes on the market. So, for example, if we have 6 months of inventory, that means we have the same number of homes coming off the market as there are going on it. In some of our local areas in Portland, the inventory we have is 45 days or less. This has forced buyers to back off of their home search for a while due to limited choice. This is having an effect on how fast our market is appreciating.Right now is an amazing time to sell. We have just realized double digit appreciation in most of our local markets and interest rates continue to be at historic lows. Neither of these things may continue in the near future. New construction will start increasing as the economy grows, and weâll be competing with brand new homes and new properties on the market. If you want to figure out what your home is worth, we can give you an instant  valuation right here on our site, or you can give us a call and we can give you a free, no obligation detailed home valuation.",

        "content": "Prices have risen aggressively in the past year â some Portland areas have experienced as much a 15% increase! By looking at those numbers, the housing market may not have recovered as well as we think. Trulia, a well-respected resource for this subject, recently wrote an article about the housing recovery and broke it down into five very important factors:  Home prices have gone up substantially  Delinquency and foreclosure rates  Existing home sales  New construction starts  Employment rates for people between the ages 25-34In addition, Trulia, Zillow and Forbes are all predicting rising interest rates as soon as the year ends. So, what does this mean for you as a buyer? You should get it in gear! Home prices will continue to rise and so are interest rates â the real estate experts are predicting that this wonât last much long.As a seller, if you donât like your values now, good things may happen if you wait. However do keep in mind that as interest rates rise, you could potentially lose buyers and as values go up, more and more people will sell their homes. This will increase your competition!For more a more detailed look at these numbers, visit the main article here.If you have any questions regarding our market or the surrounding area, please feel free to call or email us.

If there is anything you would like me to discuss in a future video, please email us or better yet, comment on this post. We really appreciate and remain true to providing you with the best information.Weâve been receiving many questions about the recently-realized price increases. However, they have tapered off in the past few weeks and remain unchanged. Currently, the median list price is sitting at $325,000 and the Market Action Index shows that we are still in a sellerâs market. However it does suggest that we are creeping down to a more neutral market. Also, Portlandâs average days on market is sitting at 131.In mortgage news, last weekâs job report was better than expected. However, mortgage bonds still remain unchanged. This is a pretty boring week in finance as we all wait to see what the Fedâs next move will be after their meeting on March 18th. They are expected to keep short-term rates at the same levels.Mortgage rates are hovering at about 4.5% which makes it increasingly important to consult a mortgage advisor. Rates have the tendency to change multiple times over the course of a day and also every circumstance might not meet your individual goals. We thank Shelby Spencer over at Guild Mortgage, who is our preferred lender, for this information!If this information interested you and you would like a report that is tailored to your specific situation, donât hesitate to contact us.

        "content": "As we move forward into 2014, I wanted to speak with you about accurately pricing your home for sale and why itâs important. Before I get started, I wanted to point out a few of the great features on our blog. If youâre a seller, we have a link for a free, instantaneous home value report. It may not be 100% accurate, but it gives you a wonderful place to start and contains a lot of useful information. As for buyers, we have a home search that utilizes the local MLS which is constantly updated. It also gives you the option to have information sent to you on a daily, bi-weekly or weekly basis.Pricing a home is somewhat of an art form; you donât want to price it too low (for obvious reasons) but if you price it too high, you can make one of several mistakes that will hurt your bottom dollar. You could end up with no activity, which forces the home to stay on the market for as little as 30 days, and will generate a much lower offer. We have also seen that the first offer you receive is 90-95% of the time is the best.That offer could be lower is you had accurately priced the home correctly in the first place. Pricing your home too low also leaves money on the table. It is extremely important for our clients to maximize your hard-earned equity.Our home evaluation is a great start, but if you would like a more detailed report we would be happy to generate one for you. This will help us see the entire picture before signing off on a recommended value for your property. Thanks and have a great day!",

Otherwise, you could end up scrambling at the last minute and with our marketâs low inventory, that lapse in preparation could cost you the house.Sellers also want to specifically see pre-approval letters from buyers up front; they may not even let you view their home without one, especially during the holiday season when time is precious.

        "content": "Trulia Chief Economist Jed Kolko reveals the latest findings from Bubble Watch , revealing whether home prices are overvalued or undervalued relative to their fundamental value. In the fourth quarter of 2013, home prices were 4% undervalued despite having rapidly rising over the past year. But in Orange County and Los Angeles, home prices are more than 10% overvalued.Truliaâs Bubble Watch reveals whether home prices are overvalued or undervalued relative to their fundamental value by comparing prices today with historical prices, incomes, and rents. The more prices are overvalued relative to fundamentals, the closer we are to a housing bubble â and the bigger the risk of a future price crash.Truliaâs first Bubble Watch report, from May 2013, explains our methodologyin detail. We look at the price-to-income ratio, the price-to-rent ratio, and prices relative to their long-term trends, using multiple data sources, including the Trulia Price Monitor as a leading indicator of where home prices are heading. We then combine these various measures of fundamental value rather than relying on a single factor, because no one measure is perfect. Hereâs what we found.Prices Far From Bubble TerritoryWe estimate that home prices nationally are 4% undervalued in the fourth quarter of 2013 (2013 Q4), which means weâre nowhere near another housing bubble. To put this in perspective, prices were as much as 39% overvalued in 2006 Q1, at the height of last decadeâs bubble, then dropped to being 15% undervalued in 2011 Q4. One quarter ago (2013 Q3) prices looked 6% undervalued; one year ago (2012 Q4) prices looked 13% undervalued (see note at end of post). This chart shows how far current prices are from a bubble:At the metro level, home prices are above their fundamental value in 17 of the 100 largest metros. Most of these overvalued metros are only slightly so: of the 17 overvalued metros, just two â Orange County and Los Angeles â look at least 10% overvalued. (Austin rounds up to 10% but is actually slightly below.) Several California metros also stand out for having both overvalued prices AND sharp price increases, including Orange County, Los Angeles, Oakland, and Riverside-San Bernardino.Prices are most undervalued today in several Ohio and Florida markets. Even with the huge gains in the past year, prices are still 14% undervalued in Detroit and 13% undervalued in Las Vegas, which would have made the most undervalued list if we extended it to 11.âDespite Climbing Prices, This is Not Last Decadeâs BubbleâIf prices nationally are 4% undervalued, why are so many people worried that a new bubble is forming? Because prices have risen quickly over the past year, and even with the recent slowdown in the past few months, rising prices stoke bubble fears. The October 2013 Trulia Price Monitor reported that asking prices were up 11.7% year-over-year â roughly the same sharp increase in as in 2004 Q3, when the housing bubble was inflating.But, aside from similar sharp price increases, the housing market today is very different than it was in 2004 Q3. The key is that the level of prices, relative to fundamentals, is much lower today than in 2004 Q3. Our Bubble Watch shows that prices were 24% overvalued in 2004 Q3, compared with 4% undervalued today. At the metro level, 99 of the 100 largest markets were overvalued in 2004 Q3, and 74 of 100 were overvalued by at least 10%. Today, just 17 metros are overvalued, and just 2 by at least 10%.Today looks different from 2004 Q3 in two other important ways, too. First: unlike mid-last decade, we are not overbuilding. New home starts today are approximately 40% below normal levels. Second: mortgage lending for new-home purchases is tight today, unlike last decade when mortgages were, if anything, too easy to get. Therefore, even though prices are rising today as fast as they were during last decadeâs bubble, todayâs price gains are a post-crash rebound, not a new bubble. Today, unlike last decade, prices are slightly undervalued, construction is low, and mortgage credit remains tight.Bubble+Watch+-+100+Metros+-+Q4+2013Note: each quarterâs Bubble Watch includes minor revisions to previous estimates because the underlying data sources are often revised or updated.",
