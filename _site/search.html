        "content": "Home staging is an underrated way to boost your home’s sale price.Here’s how our friend and favorite home stager, Lorrie White, does her magic on homes.Selling your Central New York home? Get a free home value reportBuying a Central New York home?  Search all homes for saleI was delighted to be joined recently by Lorrie White of Lorrie White Staging Company, aka “The Secret Weapon” to talk about what she does and to see her work in action.We’re at one of Coldwell Banker Properties 6797 Dutch Hill Road. in Dewitt, NY. This house has been on the market for a little while, and the owners have had Lorrie come in to stage the entire house. Watch the video above to get the full home tour after Lorrie and her team did their magic.Did you know that according to the National Association of Realtors, 80% of homes that are professionally staged and professionally photographed will sell quicker and for more money?According to Lorrie, these are the top three things people need to know about staging a house:1. Staging is affordable. Many people are under the impression that staging is too expensive or not worth the money. It’s important to know that there are many different variations of staging. Lorrie is always willing to work with budgets, and some home staging is better than no staging at all. Even just working with a few key first-impression spaces can make a drastic difference in the presentation of the home during staging. Lorrie’s consultations typically take anywhere from one to two hours.“80% OF HOMES THAT ARE PROFESSIONALLY STAGED AND PROFESSIONALLY PHOTOGRAPHED WILL SELL QUICKER AND FOR MORE MONEY, ACCORDING TO THE NAR.”2. Staging is not the same as decorating. Even the best-decorated home can sit stagnant on the market for a number of reasons. They may be a little too taste-specific or individualistic. Decorating is more of a personal thing for everyday living. Staging is done for marketing purposes to help a product appeal to the most number of buyers possible.3. Square footage sells. It’s extremely important to your home’s value. Certain things in a space can make a home feel smaller (i.e. large area rugs, dark paint colors, and too much furniture). It’s all about opening up your home, which Lorrie did wonderfully as you can see above.If you have any questions for Lorrie or want to get in touch with her to see how she can help expedite your home sale, visit her website, follow her on Instagram, or give her a call at If you have any questions for me in the meantime about home staging, the market, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

Get a free home value reportBuying a Central New York home?  Search all homes for saleIf craft beer and good company is your idea of a good night on the town, you’ll like today’s local business spotlight.I’m talking about All Who Wander, a craft beer bar and grill at 315 Fayette St. According to co-owners Dan Chapman and Joe Ori, the name “All Who Wander” speaks to the experience of finding your place to enjoy a nice craft beverage, a grilled cheese sandwich, and having a nice social experience. For them, it’s as simple as taking the products that they love and sharing them with their customers.Speaking of products, they not only have wine and many regional beers on tap, but also on-tap nitro coffee. If you haven’t heard of this new trend, nitro coffee is cold-brew coffee infused with nitrogen so it pours out of a tap just like a Guinness would. It adds a silky, smooth flavor that’s nothing short of delicious on a warm day.“DAN AND JOE CONSIDER IT AN IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR JOB TO REPRESENT BEER ITSELF.”All of the craft beers they serve are hand-selected by Dan and Joe. They consider it a very important part of their job to represent the beer itself and share with people the way certain beers are supposed to taste. Furthermore, the history and story of the beer brings more to the drinking experience (I call this “knowledge-based drinking”). One of the fulfilling things about their work is sharing stories back and forth with their customers.To know more about All Who Wander, you can visit them online at www.wanderhere.com or send them an email at letstalk@wanderhere.com.If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to speak with you.",

Get a free home value reportBuying a Central New York home?  Search all homes for saleIf you’re in need of a quality shave or haircut, I have the perfect place to introduce you to.That place is Saving Face Barbershop, where I’m live on location speaking with barber and co-owner Taylor Horseman. Located at 127 East Seneca St., Saving Face has been in business at this new location for about four months. They also have another location in Camillus that’s been open for seven years.According to Taylor, what makes their establishment different is that their employees have been at their jobs for a long time and have a passion for what they do. Cutting hair is more of an art than a job to them. With the communal atmosphere they present, they intend Saving Face to be a place where men can hang out and build friendships in addition to getting a haircut.“AT SAVING FACE BARBERSHOP, CUTTING HAIR IS MORE OF AN ART THAN A JOB.”While you wait for a haircut, you can watch TV, play shuffleboard, or pour yourself a nice cup of coffee. They like to be versatile and able to accommodate any customer, so they perform many different types of cuts, including straight-razor shaves and full facial treatments.To learn more about Saving Face Barbershop or to schedule an appointment, you can visit them online at www.savingfacebarbershop.com or email them at savingfacemanlius@gmail.com.I highly recommend that you visit this location in the near future. It’s great for Manlius, and I look forward to featuring more local businesses in the near future. If you have any other questions, give me a call. I look forward to talking to you soon!",

			<p>Chip Hodgkins was born into business - his family has been doing business in central New York since the late 1800’s. Because his roots run deep here, Chip is passionate about helping the community develop and grow through real estate. He works tirelessly to improve his knowledge of the industry so he can service his clients at the highest possible level. When he’s not coming up with new marketing strategies, he’s traveling across the country attending conferences and events so he can learn from the best and contribute his own ideas to national real estate business systems.</p>
