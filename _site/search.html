        "title": "How Does Square Footage Affect Your Homeâs Value?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "How much does your homeâs square footage affect its value? There are several factors to consider.If you own a two-story, 3,000 square foot home that Zillow says is only worth $275,000 and youâre comparing it to a home across the street thatâs also 3,000 square feet but has just sold for $350,000, why is that?If the home across the street is a ranch-style home where all 3,000 square feet are on one level instead of two, your home wonât sell for the same price. One reason for this is ranches are much more desirable in our Charlotte market. Secondly, ranches are more expensive to build. The base of a ranch home is much larger, and itâs more expensive to build out than it is to build up because that involves more concrete, more plumbing, and more structure to be built around the property. This is why when you see homes that are $20 or $30 more per square foot for a single level, you canât compare that.Â What about homes with basements? What if your home is 6,000 square feet with two stories and a basement and all the other two-story, 6,000 square foot homes without basements are selling for $125 per square foot?âWhen it comes to calculating your homeâs market value, you have to do a full equity evaluation.âYour basement doesnât cost as much to purchase as a home whose two stories account for all 6,000 square feet because your homeâs square footage is 4,000 feet above ground and 2,000 feet below. That basement in general, depending on what sort of finishes it has, could be 30%, 40%, or 50% of the actual square footage cost of a home that has two stories instead of three. Â If a home across the street sells for $500,000 and itâs the same square footage as yours, be careful in assuming yours will sell for $500,000 too. You donât know what upgrades that home has had or if the previous homeowners made any structural differences to make it a completely open floor plan. If both of your homes were built at the same time, that kind of renovation and other kinds of renovations might make it look newer than yours.When it comes to making sure you know what your home is worth, you have to do a full equity evaluation that will account for square footage to a certain degree, but also the overall condition of a home, what upgrades have or have not been done, the location, andâmost importantlyâsupply and demand.Â In addition to the square footage, all of those factors determine the value of your home.Â If you have any questions about this topic or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home in the Charlotte area, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd love to help you.",

        "title": "Thinking of Listing on Your Own? You May Want to Reconsider",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "A lot of people ask me whether selling For Sale By Owner (or FSBO) is a good idea.When you list FSBO, the people who come to your home wanting to negotiate a deal are generally unqualified. Theyâll come to your door without an agent and without a pre-qualification letter. In fact, most FSBO buyers need owner financing.Â Most people who want to sell their home simply canât do owner financing, since they typically want to buy another home with what they earn from their listing.Â As you might expect, these kinds of buyers arenât bringing great offers to the table. People who know that youâre listing FSBO will be well aware of the fact that you arenât being represented. Therefore, you can be sure theyâre going to try to take advantage of this fact by giving you a lowball offer.Recently, the National Association of Realtors did up the percentage of successful FSBO listings from 2% or 3% to 5% or 6% depending on the part of the country. Still, this leaves FSBO sellers with just a 6% chance at best to sell their homes on their own.âDonât get caught without representation.âOn top of that, those 6% of successful closings really arenât that successful at all, since the final sale price is almost always far below the homeâs true value.People sometimes falsely assume that theyâre saving money by not working with a Realtor, but the truth is that FSBO sellers ultimately walk away with much less money. You really need to be careful trying to list on your own.Â Last year, my team and I encountered a FSBO seller who only wanted $525,000 for a property. We were of course able to find a client willing to give that amount, but the home actually appraised for $615,000.Â The seller was ecstatic at closing, since they believed they had gotten a great deal. From the perspective of our team, though, we saw that they actually still left a lot of money on the table. This couldâve been prevented with the help of a qualified agent.Donât get caught without representation. The chances of success arenât good, and people who are successful in listing FSBO still end up receiving 5%, 10%, or 15% less for their homes.Â If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "There is a common misconception that you need a down payment of 10%, 15%, or 20% in order to purchase a home. However, there are actually a few options out there that allow buyers to put zero down on their home purchase.Â The first option pertains specifically to people who are serving, or have previously served, in the military. As a way to thank our veterans and active duty military members for their service, the VA loan allows them to purchase a home for no money down and with a very low interest rate.For those who arenât in the military, there are still options.The USDA loan, for example, is a great route for anyone considering living in a rural area. There are a few different applicable areas around the outskirts of Charlottesville, Belmont, Mount Holly, Troutman, and certain other places all qualify.Â This loan is a great option, since it has low interest rates, no down payment, and requires no PMIâwhich is mortgage insurance.Â If neither of these programs is applicable to you, there are still options.Â âThere are a few options out there that allow buyers to put zero money down for their home purchase.âCertain programs exist that allow you to pay as low as 1% down. A couple of our in-house lenders actually allow buyers to qualify for a conventional loan with just a 1% down payment. To qualify for this, you do need a credit score above 640 to 660 depending on your job and assets.Â Finally, grant programs through the state can also provide down payment assistance. The North Carolina Grant Program is still offering $15,000 for first-time homebuyers. This is a great program. If you are a new buyer or havenât bought a home in a few years, weâd love to help you look into this product.These days, making sure that you have the best financing options is incredibly important and could save you hundreds on a monthly basis. When you work with us, we do our best to make sure you get the best rates, terms, and conditions.Â If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "What is the key to getting multiple offers on your property?Many people assume they have to price their home $20,000 or $30,000 below market value, but thatâs not true. What you do have to know, though, is how your home will fit into todayâs market. To find this out, you have to do a full equity valuation on your property and a market absorption analysis to calculate its true market value.Â The average person in our area does a CMA, or comparative market analysis, to calculate a homeâs market value. This is an old-fashioned, real-estate-101 process that typically uses as little as three sold properties to come up with a number your home might be worth.Â âIf you allow a CMA to determine the market value for your home, youâre in trouble.âCMAs offer a little value, but when it comes to knowing the market, the problem with a CMA is you donât know what happened with those three sold properties. Were they relocation homes? Was one of the properties a distressed home? Was there a divorce involved somewhere?Â If you allow a CMA to determine the market value for your home, youâre in trouble. You might get multiple offers, but theyâll likely be for $20,000 or $30,000 less than what your homeâs actually worth and youâll end up leaving money on the table.Â On the flipside, you canât price your home extremely high, either. Regardless of the quality of your homeâs marketing, overpricing it will turn off a large segment of buyers and force you to eventually reduce its price. Doing that will also cause buyers to wonder what might be wrong with your home. By the time you do finally reduce your homeâs price to where it shouldâve been in the first place, youâll earn 5% to 10% less because buyers will deduct you for the number of days the home spent on the market.Â To generate multiple offers the right way, I recommend hiring a professional team of agents like us to help you. We can come into your home, give it a full equity evaluation, and price it appropriately. From there, weâll use aggressive marketing to attract a lot of offers from qualified buyers within a handful of days your home gets listed.Â If you have any questions about getting multiple offers on your property, donât hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to seeing you at the closing table.Â ",

Over the last three years, **the market has seen consistent growth and the interest rates have generally stayed low. **We can see from this that there isnât a very high likelihood that the Feds will be raising interest rates in a significant way.

If you are in the market to purchase a home you should be looking for a lender.But donât settle for your first encounter, be sure to shop around to get the best rates and the best terms and conditions on your mortgage. You should also get a buyerâs roadmap. A buyerâs roadmap will show you how we get priority access to all the best deals on the market.This will help you win out against the competition. Having the roadmap will be your guide to success as a buyer, but youâll still need a quality agent. When looking for the right agent, be sure to ask how many homes they sell per year, how well they know the area, and how well they know financing.Sellers will need a game plan, as well. Having a selling guide and using high-quality marketing will be key. **My team and I offer a 151-step marketing guide that can help you have as smooth and successful a transaction as possible. **âVERY FEW OTHER AGENTS, OR TEAMS OF AGENTS, CAN DO WHAT WE CAN.âFull-disclosure, full-detail marketing strategies are also something we do.

We also offer a 75-point photography checklist designed to ensure that your home is being presented in the best light.Very few other agents, or teams of agents, can do what we canâlet alone at such a high level.To find out if an agent will be able to get you top dollar, there are a few questions you should ask as a seller. How many homes have they sold this year? Do they have a resume?With as many agents as are coming in our area, weâre seeing a few of them underpricing homes and therefore only selling between two to four properties a year. Selling quickly isnât worth it if an agent is undercutting their clientâs profit by thousands.One of the things that sets my team apart is that we only accept full price offers for our clients. You need an agent who has a game plan for getting you at or above list price.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

We wanted to go through the process and clarify any questions you may have today.If youâre considering building a new home, itâs always best to go into the process with an agent who has experience working with and negotiating these kinds of deals. You might think that you could save some money as a buyer by not using an agent, but you would be completely wrong.If a builder knows you donât have representation, they are going to run you over and you will end up overpaying for a property. Until you have an agent who knows what theyâre doing when it comes to negotiating with these builders, you wonât have as successful of a home purchase as you could have had.âAN AGENT CAN HELP YOU GET A LOWER INTEREST RATE AND BETTER UPGRADES.âBy working with an agent, you can get a lower interest rate, better upgrades, and other discounts that you wouldnât be able to get on your own. The expertise of an agent really pays off in situations like this. If youâre working with one of our buyerâs agents here at the Dan Jones Team, let them know if youâre interested in this kind of property.Speaking of our great agents, let me give a shout out to one of our new agents, Karen, who has been doing fantastic as of late putting homes under contract and is working with several new construction buyers right now.In the meantime, if you have any questions for us, donât hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

An estimate is a reasonable approach to value in regard to real estate, but an estimate is, by definition, inexact. Enjoy using a Zestimate as a tool, but donât be surprised by the inaccurate information that you receive from it.Why are Zillowâs Zestimates so inaccurate? There are a few reasons. First off, Zillow doesnât look at supply and demand. They look at recent comps, but not recent appraisals. They also pull from tax records, which can be extremely inaccurate as well. If you use that data, you could be misrepresenting your homeâs value by as much as $60,000 or $70,000. Tax records arenât a good tool for estimating a homeâs value.âYour home could be worth $60,000 or $70,000 more than you think.âAnother thing Zillowâs Zestimate doesnât take into account is location. Your home may have five or six different good comparables, but Zillow wonât be able to determine whether you live in a location that would boost your homeâs value. If you live on a golf course, cul-de-sac, or a wooded lot, Zillow would not factor that in.Finally, Zestimates donât take upgrades and updates into account. Your homeâs value will be determined in the same way whether you have a fully remodeled kitchen, bathroom, or basement. Assigning a list price to your home based on a Zestimate could be hugely detrimental to your sale.I have a rental property that Zillow recently told me is worth $80,000 more than it really is. If anyone out there would like to buy the home for the Zestimate price, let me know and weâll get a contract written up. Otherwise, if you have any other questions or want to know what the true market value of your home is, give us a call. We would be happy to do an equity evaluation for you and give you a professional opinion on how much your home should sell for.",

        "title": "What Are Some of the Hidden Costs of Selling a House?",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "There are several hidden costs of selling a house people usually donât find out about until they get to the closing table. What I want to talk about today are some of those major expenses.First of all, if you havenât lived in your house for very long, there is a good chance youâre going to be paying a capital gains tax. Itâs a good idea to speak with your accountant to confer over this.Next are the seller closing costs. A lot of agents like to beat around the bush about who pays what, but itâs important to know this up front when youâre deciding who youâre going to sell your home to and at what price. Closing costs consist of attorneyâs fees and deed stamps.âItâs important to know your closing costs up front.âRepairs to the house is another cost to consider. They might be simple, or they might be complicated, but almost all homes end up having repairs. Just getting an electrician through the door can cost as much as $150. A lot of buyers also like to ask for a home warranty. We donât encourage our sellers to buy those up front because weâd rather wait for the buyer to negotiate that in and move up the asking price of the home.Finally, you have costs like additional repairs or attorneyâs fees. If there are any title issues, we strongly suggest that you clear them up beforehand.Be sure youâre aware of these omissions when itâs your time to sell so youâre prepared for the process. If you have any questions, please send me an email or give me a call. As always, I look forward to your referrals and talking to you soon.",

        "title": "Pricing Errors that Cost Carolina Home Sellers Thousands",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Homeowners can lose thousands of dollars when they sell their house for a number of reasons. How is it possible to lose money when selling, you ask?In Carolina, weâre probably in one of the best sellerâs markets weâve seen in a decade. We have great comps to get homes sold, but when people are valuing their home, they arenât doing a full equity evaluation and really understanding what the market can absorb. Many people are simply getting a comparative market analysis (or CMA) and underpricing the home, only to see it sell in a few days for up to 6% less than they should have.If your home is worth around $300,000 or more, thatâs a lot of money to leave on the table.âPricing a home too high or too low will cost you in the long run.âSecondly, overpricing is a way people are throwing away money. I have people tell me they want to start their home priced $30,000 above what it should be. The downside is that the homeâs going to sit on the market for a long time, and even if you find a buyer, the home probably wonât appraise for that price. If a home sits on the market, youâll have to lower the price. By the time the price comes down to where it should be, buyers will think there is something wrong with the house and they wonât even come view it.What you end up with is a house that sat on the market for around 200 days that ends up selling for up to 15% less than it should have if it was priced appropriately.Finally, choosing the wrong agent can cause you to lose tens of thousands of dollars. You want to make sure the agent you hire has a full marketing budget to get your house proper exposure. There are a lot of new agents out there who just donât know the market. If youâre not selling a lot of homes, they may end up underpricing and losing you money.Let me know of any questions you have about pricing your home, or if youâre considering buying or selling a home. I look forward to speaking with you!",

        "title": "Why Is the Carolina Market So Hot? ",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Now is a great time to sell your house. In the last three to six months, weâve had a lot of problems getting homes appraised because the market jumped up so quickly. However, now there are plenty of comparable sales to support those increases, and the market is on fire.Why is the market so hot? The main reason is we have very low supply and very high demand right now. We are shifting into a sellerâs market as there are not a lot of homes to choose from. Properties that are prepared properly and positioned well in the market sell pretty quickly and for top dollar.Secondly, interest rates are very low. Two or three years ago, many people suspected we would see 5.5% interest rates in 2016, but rates have held consistently over the last year or so. In fact, rates have actually come down a little bit. These low rates mean it is still very affordable for you to buy a slightly bigger home or even build a house.âDo not underprice your home in this hot market.âIf you are thinking of selling in this market, I have one warning: Do not underprice your home. Since the real estate market is picking up, there are a lot of newer agents getting their licenses and diving into the market. These agents donât necessarily know how to price your property for this market. You could lose 5% to 10% of your true home value when you underprice your property.If you are thinking about selling, give us a call or send us an email. We will do a full equity evaluation of your property so you donât leave a lot of money on the table. We look forward to hearing from you.",

Most of the time, it comes down to choosing the wrong agent.Our team of agents here at Carolina Real Estate Experts have professional coaching and theyâre full-time agents who really know and understand todayâs market. There are too many agents out there who went out and got a real estate license a few years ago when the market got hot, and donât truly understand what the market was and where it is today. They really donât care about you getting the best price, terms, and conditions, because theyâre really just interested in getting a check at the end of the day.Itâs very important to us at Carolina Real Estate Experts that you get the best price, terms, and conditions on your property and that we do a great job for you from start to finish.âAsk good questions when hiring an agent.âMake sure that if youâre going to work with someone, you donât make the mistake of working with an agent who has a license but doesnât have proper training yet. Be careful about asking good questions, because seeing two or three properties with an agent doesnât exactly mean youâre âworking with an agent.â Interview a few agents to make sure theyâll get you the best conditions.If you or your friends, family or co-workers have questions or real estate needs, reach out to us.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Purchasing a home is not as easy as people think. Most of the time, a buyer will go look at homes and actually purchase a home through the first agent they speak to. Thatâs probably the worst way to go about purchasing a home.You really need to talk to an agent and figure out what they do. Do they work with a team? What kind of support staff do they have? You need the answers to these questions so you hire an agent who will make sure you get the best price, terms, and conditions when it comes to negotiating and understanding the market.The last thing you want to do is walk into a transaction with someone who just got their license or only sells two homes a year. That agent really just doesnât know whatâs going on with the market. They wonât know what it will be like for you to sell that property again in the next five to 20 years.âInterview more than one real estate agent.âThink twice about what agent youâre using. Interview more than one agent. Make sure you work with someone who really knows the market. You need someone from the area, who sells 30 homes a year, and works on a team of agents that can get you the best price, terms, and conditions.My team and I can get you to the closing process with the least amount of trouble.
