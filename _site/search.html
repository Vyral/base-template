        "content": "Today on âTulsa Foodie,â weâve decided to feature Ediblend Superfood Cafe in Utica Square. To give us a better idea about what this great restaurant is all about, we decided to meet up with its founders: Piper Kacere and Amy Murray.Â The idea for Ediblend Superfood Cafe began years ago when Piper and Amy, who are sisters, decided to do a juice cleanse. They got off to a rocky start, but shortly after beginning their second attempt, Piper and Amy began to attract the interest of people around them.Â Eventually, they started making cleanses for these people and, before they knew it, they started receiving text messages and calls from total strangers who were interested in their product. So they bought up all the mason jars and shower caddies they could find, then started making and packaging cleanses from a playroom in Piperâs home that they had converted into a kitchen.âThough these juice blends are where they got their start, the Ediblend Superfood Cafe has a lot more to offer.âThat coming summer, they moved their operation into a test kitchen they had rented out, and, lo and behold, they completely sold out for the season. Their satisfied customers couldnât stop raving about their experience, so Piper and Amy knew it was time to open a permanent location. Now, since opening in 2014, the Ediblend Superfood Cafe has two locations and a massive fan base here in Tulsa.Looking at their wide range of healthy and delicious blends, like the Sweet Green, 1717, and Sexy Yowza, itâs no wonder why. And though these juice blends are where they got their start, the Ediblend Superfood Cafe has a lot more to offer. When you visit their restaurant, you can also enjoy great salads or one of their customizable aÃ§aÃ­ bowls. Best of all, everything in the cafe is made fresh every single day.Â In the future, Amy and Piper are looking forward to expanding their business, and its menu, even wider. If youâre as interested as we are in seeing whatâs on the horizon for Ediblend Superfood Cafe, or youâre curious about their hours, locations, or menu, be sure to follow them on Facebook or visit their website: https://ediblend.com/&nbsp;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "title": "5 Deal-Breakers That Can Wreck Your Home Sale",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "There are five deal-breakers sellers must prepare for and avoid if they want to sell their home quickly and for top dollar:1. Structural problems. Here in Oklahoma, our houses move over time. Depending on how old your home is, you might be able to notice a few settlement cracks here and there. Sometimes these are the normal effects of settling, while other times they can be more serious and may require the installation of a few piers. A single pier costs around $500, so if you see some cracks around your house that look a little more extreme than normal settling, youâll want to get that checked out.Â 2. The roof. Is your roof insurable and do you have proper coverage on it? If the buyerâs insurance company isnât able to insure your roof, many times the only other solution is to replace it.Â 3. The HVAC system. Itâs a good idea to schedule regular maintenance checks for your HVAC system with a local heating and air company. When the appointment is finished, make sure to ask for a receipt or to have a sticker placed on your system. This way, you can prove to buyers that the system has been checked.âTermites arenât prejudicedâthey love all types of wood and all types of houses.â4. Termites. Termites arenât prejudicedâthey love all types of wood and all types of houses. If thereâs termite activity in your house, treatment costs anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000. If your home had termite problems in the past, it may have been damaged, so get a visual inspection to see if thatâs the case. If past termite damage is apparent and it isnât fixed, termite inspectors will have to declare that your home needs termite treatment. Wood rot is another item that gets checked during a termite inspection, and if your home has this problem too, you need to get it cleaned up.Â 5. Low appraisals. This is a prevalent deal-breaker weâre seeing in our market right now. Appraisals are based on the current market, and appraisers have to look back in time at recent sales to make sure your home is priced correctly. There are always ups and downs in the market, though, so even though your appraisal might not be up to date with current trends, you have to go with what the appraiser says. A low appraisal hurts both sellers and buyers because when a buyerâs obtaining a mortgage, they canât pay more than the price the appraiser sets.Â We love helping sellers plan their move in advance, so if youâre thinking of selling your home any time soon, give us a call so we can help you get it ready for the market and have buyers wanting to pay full price for it.Â If you have any other real estate questions or youâre thinking of buying a home in our Tulsa market, donât hesitate to reach out to us as well. Weâd love to help you.",

        "content": "Weâre more than halfway through 2018, and itâs been an amazing year for The Wolek Group.Â Weâve been able to help more than 104 families buy and sell real estate so far, and we look forward to helping many more through the end of 2018 and beyond. Of course, another way we love to help all of you is by providing key insight into whatâs happening in our market.Â At this point in the year, real estate tends to slow down a little bit. With school starting up, buyers with families are mostly done shopping for homes by this point. This lull in our market is nothing out of the ordinary, but those looking to sell should be aware that it might take a little longer now than in recent months to find a buyer. Not to worry, though.âItâs not the time to throw in the towel, but it is time to be realistic about how youâre presenting your listing to the market.âAfter school is back in full swing and labor day is over, market activity will likely pick back up. Seasonal market changes are normal, and there is still plenty of time and opportunity to sell your home before 2019.Â If your home is already on the market and youâre feeling discouraged by current conditions, though, a price adjustment may be just the thing to jumpstart buyer interest. Buyer activity may be down, but it is not stagnant.Â There are still people out there looking for homes, and, with the right strategy, your property could be the one they choose. Itâs not the time to throw in the towel, but it is time to be realistic about how youâre presenting your listing to the market.Â If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are curious how we can help you achieve your real estate goals, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

Juniper offers standout entrees such as seared duck, fried chicken curry, and a refreshing seared ahi salad.Â Of course, Juniperâs menu is always changing. New dishes are released each week to fit the restaurantâs ever-shifting themes, as well as the seasons. Itâs no wonder why Juniperâs growth comes from its kitchen, where head chef Neil Trumpy works his culinary magic.Â âWhether youâre in the mood for a savory meal or a sweet, tasty drink, you can find what youâre craving at Juniper.âChef Trumpy received his education from the Oregon Culinary Institute, where he developed a skill set based around sustainability and the use of local ingredients. As youâll see in todayâs episode, watching him work is an amazing sight to behold.Â But delectable dishes arenât the only thing there is to enjoy at Juniper. Diners can also enjoy any of the many refreshing signature cocktails they offer. So whether youâre in the mood for a savory meal or a sweet, tasty drink, you can find what youâre craving at Juniper.Â Dining at Juniper is an amazing experience, so be sure to come check it out yourself.Â Juniper (located at 324 East 3rd Street in downtown Tulsa) Â is open for lunch Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., and for dinner from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Monday through Saturday.Â If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "We all know that itâs important for a homebuyer to use a licensed real estate agent when buying a home. But do you know why? Today I will share three of the top reasons.Â 1. We have the inventory. As real estate professionals, we have access to the multiple listing service (MLS), which is a database for Realtors. Of course, there are other websites out there that list houses for sale, but we all know that the MLS is the most up-to-date database for listings. Buyers who look for homes on other websites will only to be disappointed to find out theyâre not available.And, if we do not have the inventory, we have the tools and technologies and databases to help find you a home that fits all of your needs.âWhen a seller lists their home on the market, they have already agreed to pay the buyer agentâs compensation.â2. We have the negotiation skills. As a homebuyer, you may be hesitant to speak your mind on certain points, for fear of offending the seller.With an agent on your side, you will get the best deal and terms, you will know what is normal, and you will know what to expect. We will keep you up to date on timelines to make sure that you do not miss out on an opportunity for inspections or appraisals.3. A buyer agent is free. When a seller lists their home on the market, they have already agreed to pay the buyer agentâs compensation. There is no reason for you to do all of the work when you can use us. We can help you negotiate your best terms, hold the deal together to get you to closing on time, and provide you with all of our years of experience for free!If you have any additional questions or are interested in buying, please feel free to call me.

According to Eileen, about one in every four children goes to bed hungry at night. And, as we can all agree, this is unacceptable.Â âItâs part of our job just to make sure [these children] get what they need,â says Eileen.It was truly amazing to get a behind-the-scenes look at operations here at the Community Food Bank. Especially because at the time of my visit, they were preparing for âSummer Feeding.â The Summer Feeding program is one way that they are able to continue providing for kids who rely on school meals at other times of the year. On day one of this program, they fed an estimated 1,100 children.âApproximately one in every four children goes to bed hungry at night, so the work the Community Food Bank is doing is critical.âThe workers at the Food Bank are also delegating more resources to their partner programs, as they know that their lines grow longer in the summer months, as well.Â So, with as much as this organization does for our community, how can we give back and help them make a difference? Well, for every dollar donated, the Food Bank is able to produce four meals. Obviously, financial gifts are always welcomed.Â Of course, volunteering your time and donating food are also great ways to help.So, if you want to get in touch with Eileen, you can give her a call at (918) 585-2800, or visit www.okfoodbank.org.Â ",

Beyond that, raised beds also keep animals from getting to your garden.Â They also allow you to plant earlier, since the loose soil you fill the bed with will be warmer than the ground itself.âThe decision as to whether a raised bed is right for you depends on your preferences and circumstances.âNow, letâs take a look at some of the downsides.Â First, theyâre pricey. Youâre going to have to invest in the bed, the materials, soil, and fertilizer to get started. Raised beds also arenât as sustainable as simply planting your garden in the ground.Ultimately, the decision as to whether a raised bed is right for you depends on your preferences and circumstances. And if youâre unsure, my friends over at Groggâs Green Barn can help you decide what gardening solutions may work best for you.As always, if you have any other questions for me or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Today Iâm coming to you live from the downtown office of Emergency Infant Services (EIS) here in Tulsa to tell you a little bit about this great organization and what they do for our community. Joining me is EIS Executive Director Bill Andoe.Â For the last 40 years, the mission of EIS has been to serve families who are experiencing financial hardship and have children under the age of five. They provide clothing, diapers, groceries, formula, and other essential needs these families have. All these families have to do is meet with an EIS interviewer to assess their needs so they can determine which services they can provide and which community services might be available to themâeven if their children are over five.Â Aside from their downtown location, they also have a location on the east side of Tulsa and two satellite locations on the north and south sides of town. Right now theyâre in the middle of a capital campaign, so a year from this summer, theyâll be moving to 11th and Denver. This move will help them provide more resources for families, centralize their warehouse, and stockpile more supplies.âAnyone is welcome at EIS.âOne thing in particular I love to share about EIS is anyone is welcome there. They provide their services with love and without judgementâitâs one of their founding principles. According to Bill, they average about 18,000 visits per year, and they expect that number to reach 20,000 in the near future. To help carry the loan, they have church groups, school groups, and a number of other regular volunteers who help them on a weekly basis.Â âWeâre in this because we want to help,â Bill says. âThatâs what attracts employees and volunteers to EIS. We often talk about the people who come inâwe talk about professionally mentioning them statistically as clients, but theyâre really more than just clients. Theyâre members of our community. They go to our churches. We see them at public events. Theyâre Tulsans just like us. Weâre here to help them.âEIS relies on the generosity of donors and the Tulsa community at large, so if youâd like to help them in their mission, they always welcome financial donations. They also accept diapers, wipes, car seats, strollers, and anything else a family with a young child might need.Â If youâd like to get in touch with EIS or youâd like more information on how to donate, you can visit their website at www.EISTulsa.org.Â As always, if you have any questions for me or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Decluttering is so important in getting your home ready to sell as well as just cleaning up for spring. Whatever your motivation, thinning out your home is a great way to feel good. Today letâs go through the seven steps it takes to declutter your home.1. Make sure the front of your home is welcoming and encourages buyers to come inside. First impressions are everything. Buyers are probably going to find your home online first, and then they might even drive around the neighborhood to check it out. Youâll want to clear out any dead leaves and put some fresh mulch down. Be sure that there are no mud daubers or birdâs nests in your eaves. Pretend youâre a buyer and walk up to your front porch. What would you think?Â 2. Take it one room at a time. Decluttering can be really overwhelming, so just start small. Thin out the things in your room and closet; think about what your room would look like in a photograph. What isnât needed? Pictures will amplify those extra things on countertops and other areas.Â 3. Decide what furniture you really need in the home. To make your property look like a model home, get rid of extra furniture and end tables.4. Clean off countertops. These are common places for us to pile things up, but kitchens are very important rooms to make a good impression with. Put your toaster, blender, and other similar appliances away in a cabinet, and clear away other extraneous papers and tidbits.âThink about what your room would look like in a photograph. What isnât needed?â5. Clean your shower. When we come to preview your home, weâre going to pull back the shower curtain. Be sure the grout is clean and that tiles or paint arenât peeling. Your shower will tell buyers a lot about how you take care of your home.6. Take away your collectibles. Itâs great that you care about and collect things that are dear to your heart, but that can become a distraction to buyers. Go ahead and box it up and put it away.7. Declutter the garage and storage sheds. If there are things in there that you need to keep on hand, put them in boxes or storage bins that are neat and organized.All these things sound crazy, however, they make a lot of difference. A decluttered home will help you get the most money for your home in the shortest amount of time.If you need any help with decluttering your home or have other questions, please donât hesitate to reach out to me.

Today, Iâm talking to Maryann Donahue from Global Gardens.Global Gardens was created by a teacher from Tulsa named Heather Oakley [spelling?] in 2007. Heather had a background in urban science education and peace education. She also had a bachelors degree in botany. She combined all of those things to create Global Gardens.The purpose of Global Gardens is to help fight the cycle of poverty and empower kids from high-poverty communities to be agents of change in their own lives and in their communities.When Heather came back to Tulsa in 2007, she started the first program at Eugene Field. She offered during and after-school programs. At that time, there was an empty lot next to Eugene Field that was bare, empty, and forgotten. She and that first group of students turned it into a beautiful, bountiful garden, and thatâs what Global Gardens has done ever since.Since then, Global Gardens has added three more sites in addition to Eugene Field, including the one Maryann and I are filming from today. This field services Union Middle School and Union High School. There are two other elementary schools in the program as well: Rosa Parks Elementary and McAuliffe Elementary in East Tulsa.âTHE PURPOSE OF GLOBAL GARDENS IS TO HELP FIGHT THE CYCLE OF POVERTY AND EMPOWER KIDS.ââWe serve over 1,800 kids every week in this program,â says Maryann. âWeâre helping about 2,500 people a year.âGlobal Gardens uses gardening as a vehicle for empowerment. They also use gardening to teach science and how to be peaceful. âIn the during-school program, they have a class garden. They get to decide what to plant, and they have a harvest party at the end of the year,â says Maryann. âThey do all of that together. Itâs very intentional.âThese programs teach science that addresses state science standards while also teaching teamwork. The students donât have many opportunities outside of Global Gardens to do hands-on, real-world things and have to do them as a team.We really believe that Global Gardens is doing a great thing. How can you help? Go to Global-Gardens.org to make an online donation. All of their funding is raised from community donations; they donât have state contracts or charge fees.Maryann says that Global Gardens hopes to add a fifth site at Jackson Elementary School in North Tulsa by 2019. This has been in the works for a while, so please consider helping them reach their goal.I would like to thank Maryann for taking the time to talk to me today. You can learn more details about Global Gardens at Global-Gardens.org.If you have any real estate questions or know another local nonprofit you think we should spotlight, give me a call or send me an email.

Weâve been using it in bathrooms for a little bit. People do want to use quartz for their surfaces these days. There are a lot of new materials out there. People like wooden countertops as well.For bathrooms, people stick to light, neutral colors. Those will last a long time. Back in the 80s, people made pink, green, and purple bathrooms. That doesnât work. My job is to come into somebodyâs home and put something in there with tile that will last. Technology has improved with tile and cement, so we can build up bathrooms that are mold-free and 100% waterproof, which is great.How can someone get in touch with you about a remodel or to ask any questions?My phone number is 918-574-4610 or look at my website, JohnCarterBathrooms.com. You can enter your information and get a free 3-D model of what your bathroom could look like at no cost to you.Thank you to John for answering my questions.

Get a free home value reportLooking to buy a Tulsa area home? Click here to browse Tulsa homes for saleToday Iâm excited to be joined by special guest Carey Baker. I had the opportunity to ask Carey some questions about her involvement with The Parent Child Center of Tulsa. Her and her husband, Brett Baker, are Co-chairs for Toyland Ball 2018.The Toyland Ball, held every January, is The Parent Child Center of Tulsaâs annual signature fundraising event. This black tie gala featuring a whimsical theme offers an elegant evening of dinner and dancing, with a live auction.I caught up with Carey at the Toyland Ball Stock the Bar Party where attendees bring a bottle of wine valued at $50 or more to be auctioned off at the Toyland Ball 2018 in January. In past years, the wine auctioned off at the event in January has raised between $8,000 and $10,000 for The Parent Child Center of Tulsa. That is just the money raised from auctioning the wine. There are other items that are auctioned off that raise even more money for the cause.For those of you who may not know, the mission of The Parent Child Center of Tulsa is to prevent child abuse and neglect through education, treatment, and advocacy. People who have been victims of abuse or neglect are given education and counseling so that they are able to end the cycle. Many people only know what theyâve been taught, so The Parent Child Center of Tulsa aims to reverse this.If youâre interested in attending, the Toyland Ball auction will take place on January 20th, 2018 at the Cox Business Center. For tickets, visit www.ParentChildCenter.org. You can also become a patron sponsor by donating $1,000 for two people.At the event, there will be raffles, an auction, and a live band. Also, all of the proceeds go directly to the counseling funds for The Parent Child Center of Tulsa.We hope you have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "When you encounter an offer that is lower than asking price, itâs common to negotiate.Do not take the low offer personally.Looking to sell your Tulsa area home? Get a free home value reportLooking to buy a Tulsa area home? Click here to browse Tulsa homes for saleToday, Iâm going to give my two cents on a topic that keeps coming up in our business. I know if youâve watched my videos in the past, I say the same things over and over again. That just because we sell lots and lots of houses and we get to help lots and lots of people. We have a lot of experience with this.I am still primarily the listing agent for our team, so I mostly work with sellers. I receive offers from agents that are working with buyers, and so many times these offers come in lower than the listing price, and sometimes with other concessions built in, such as closing costs and warranties.I will admit that sometimes, Iâm a little shocked at some of the offers we get.Then I remember that in a buyerâs mind, they are doing the best that they can for their family. Of course they want to make a lower offer, because they feel like itâs their job to negotiate.Well, as an agent, thatâs also part of our job: to best prepare our clients and to explain the market to them.When we receive these lower offers or offers that have different contingencies built in, itâs our job to settle the client (the seller) and explain to them that these are expectedâlow offers like these are the norm.âI WILL ADMIT THAT SOMETIMES, IâM A LITTLE SHOCKED AT SOME OF THE OFFERS WE GET.âIâll admit it: I forget that you guys donât do this every day like I do. I do need to slow down and understand where youâre coming from, because as a seller, you are working to get your best deal and to put the most money in your pocket. That is my goal for you, too.However, I do know that Iâm studying the market all the time and monitoring the average list-to-sales price of the MLS, how we can put the most money in your pocket and at the same time, get your home sold.An offer early on may be a little lower than you were planning on, and yet, if it doesnât sell, how much longer will you have it?Remember that the process of selling is a negotiation. Please do not ever reject an offer; you have to do a little bit of negotiating to show that you want to sell your house. The buyer is working to get their best number, and youâre working to get your best number, so sometimes you have to get together in the middle somewhere.Thatâs our goal: to get you the most money, and for the buyers to get the best deal. At the same time, we have to work together to achieve your real estate dreams.Let me know if this was helpful to you, and if you have any questions, give me call! Iâd love to speak with you.",

What does DISC stand for, though?The D stands for âdriver,â âdominant,â or âdoer.â These people are the CEOs and trial attorneys of the world. These people come in, get stuff done, and donât allow anyone to waste their time.The I stands for âinfluencer.â These people are motivated and typically work through other people. Theyâre sometimes referred to as âthe life of the partyâ or âa social butterfly.â This isnât always the case, but theyâre definitely not shy in group settings.âYOU CAN TELL A LOT ABOUT PEOPLE BY HOW THEY ACT IN GROUPS AND HOW THEY WORK THROUGH CHALLENGES IN THEIR LIFE.âThe S stands for âsteady,â âstable,â or âsecure.â This personality represents the majority of the population. These people donât like change. Theyâre the schoolteachers of the world. Theyâre all about loveâwhen you walk into their home, youâll see family pictures everywhere because thatâs important to them. It should be important to all of us, but itâs especially evident in them.Finally, the C stands for âcompliant.â These people are the accountants and engineers of society. They love following the rules and checking off tasks. Sometimes, theyâre hesitant to move forward until they have all the answers.All of us have each of these different behaviors inside of usâthey just show up differently for each person. Some people are more slanted toward one behavior, while others are a blend of each. D and C personalities are task-motivated, while I and S personalities are more relationship oriented. You tell a lot about people by how they act in groups and how they work through challenges in their life.If you have any questions about DISC or how you can use behavioral assessments to better your life and the lives of those around you, feel free to get in touch with me.

Click here to browse Tulsa homes for saleOur market is starting to shift, so what does that mean for you?Weâre at the end of the summer rush and the kids are back in school. Typically during this time of year, our market experiences a slight downturn before encountering another uptick in early fall. This is a seasonal trend that happens every yearâthe real estate market always works in cycles, after all.We donât know whatâs going to happen beyond this cycle, but I do know there are buyers and sellers in the market all the time looking to make a move. I also know from years of experience that itâs always about price.This means if youâre a seller, itâs still an ideal time to sellâyou just have to price your home correctly. This will give you your best chance at attracting a buyer early on, getting the most money in your pocket, and moving onto where you want to go. Pricing right from the start is everything, and we call this âpricing ahead of the market.â When we get together and examine the numbers, we analyze whatâs happened with sales in the recent past and whatâs happening currently with your competition.âREAL ESTATE IS A CONTESTâARE YOU GOING TO WIN?âReal estate is a contestâare you going to win? Are you going to be the No. 1 or No. 2 house buyers have to choose from in your area? Buyers buy homes that offer the most value.

If not, you need to offset that by offering a better price.You have only one opportunity, and thatâs early on in the listing period.

I know that some people might have a little fear about that word, but we are always seeing shifts in this market throughout the year. As real estate agents, we are always prepared for these types of shifts.Based on the last few months, weâre seeing a bit of a change in the market. Youâve heard me talk about home sales above $200,000 slowing down. Homes in the $100,000 to $200,000 price range which have been selling within days over the last few months have also seen a slowdown in sales as well.We have put great homes on the market in the last month in the $150,000 to $185,000 price range that I thought for sure would be easy sellers, and they havenât sold as quickly as we thought.If youâre a consumer, just know that the market is always changing. You should always pay attention to whatâs happening locally, and pay less attention to whatâs happening on a national scale.

        "content": "The moving and real estate industries have a lot in common. I recently spoke with Julie Woolslayer about some tips and tricks of the moving process.Looking to sell your Tulsa area home? Get a free home value reportLooking to buy a Tulsa area home? Click here to browse Tulsa homes for saleI was recently joined by Julie Woolslayer of Great Day Moving, who you may remember from past conversations weâve had.She and her husband have a great business that Iâve used personally and also that Iâve referred to multiple clients.The moving industry is very much related to the business of real estate, so I wanted to give Julie the chance to present some tips and tricks for moving.First of all, Julie recommends that you should always start early in the process. If you think youâre moving, decluttering will help you for a number of reasons. Not only does it prepare a home for showing but it also makes it easier on you when it comes time to move your belongings.Get as much help as you can from friends and family members when you undertake the task of organizing and decluttering your home. One tip that Julie recommended on the matter was to read the book âItâs All Too Muchâ by Peter Walsh. Itâs full of great tips on how to organize and get rid of items in your home.You may even want to enlist the help of professional organizers. The bottom line is that there is a lot of help availableâyou just need to get motivated and get started.âTHERE IS A LOT OF HELP AVAILABLEâYOU JUST NEED TO GET MOTIVATED AND GET STARTED.âThis process is especially helpful for sellers who are downsizing. Julie and her team are more than happy to talk to people undergoing the downsizing process in order to assess what kind of help will be most useful to them. She also mentioned Settled Inâa company sheâs worked with in the past that helps clients decide what to take and what to leave in a move.Julie also has a plan for people who are unable to move into their new home right away but need to move their items out of their old home.In situations like these, Great Day Moving partners with another Tulsa business: Premier Logistics. Premier Logistics has trucks and trailers available for rent, which Great Day Moving then loads and stores at their 24-hour secured lot for as long as the seller might need.Then, once it is time to move, Great Day Moving brings the truck on site to the new home and unloads it as they would during any other moving process.Overall, Julie works hard to offer moving solutions.

Whether you need to have your furnace filter changed or itâs time to clean out your gutters, this app will remind you at regular intervals to do those things. There are so many things that we can forget to do around the house, but this app stays on top of things for you.Another awesome feature is our directory. Within it, youâll find all of our preferred service providers. These are people we have vetted, people we have worked with, and people we trust to give you fair prices and great customer service. All of their contact information is located right here within the app.âOUR DIRECTORY IS FULL OF REPUTABLE, VETTED SERVICE PROVIDERS.âFinally, it can be stressful trying to keep or remember where you put certain receipts, manuals, and home improvement plans. If your phone has a camera, you can just take a picture of these documents and save them right in the app. You can then access the documents from any device or desktop.If youâre a small business owner or service provider whoâs interested in being one of our partners, give us a call or send us an email today.If you have any other questions for us or youâre looking to buy or sell in Tulsa anytime soon, give us a call or send us an email.
