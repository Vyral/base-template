Search all homes for sale.As a buyer, how much down payment money do you really need in our market?âTHE MAJORITY OF ALL BUYERS PUT DOWN LESS THAN 10%.âMany still believe they have to put down at least 20% or more, but thatâs simply not the case. According to the National Association of Realtors, from October 2016 to November 2017, the average down payment amount for first-time homebuyers was just 6%. Also, 61% of first-time homebuyers put even less than 6% down. The majority of all buyers put down less than 10%.Here in the Wilmington market, we have some really great homes that qualify for 100% financing, USDA financing, and other forms of low or no down payment financing. We also work with some really great lenders in the area who specialize in loan programs that require a low down payment or no down payment at all.If you have any questions about what kind of down payment you can expect to pay in our market or you need help buying or selling a home, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd love to help you.",

Search all homes for sale.Many people believe that spring is a better time to put their home on the market. Today, Iâm here to tell you why this isnât the case.The main reason to sell now rather than wait until spring is youâll have more competition in the spring than you would in the fall.Itâs true that there are typically more buyers out in the spring, but the thing about fall buyers is that theyâre more serious and more motivated to buy your house. No one really wants to buy a house during the holidays, so the ones that are looking at houses now are going to be more motivated going into closing. That can also mean a faster sale and a higher price.âFALL BUYERS ARE MORE MOTIVATED TO BUY YOUR HOUSE.âThe other good thing about listing in the fall is that the grass is still pretty green, and we have beautiful autumn colors, so itâs a great time to take pictures of your home to highlight its positive qualities. If you wait until winter, youâll find that everything is kind of dreary and brownânot a pretty backdrop for any photography. Youâd then have to wait further into spring to list your house, when you could be missing a good portion of the spring market.If youâre going to take your pictures now and get your house ready for the market, youâre probably going to experience a better selling situation.If you have any questions about preparing your home for the fall market, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email.

However, this saying is also true when it comes to buyers.In todayâs competitive real estate market, there are more buyers than there are homes. As a result, sellers today tend to believe that they are in a position of power.While this is true in terms of negotiation, there are still things to be careful of.For example, you donât want to scare off any buyers that are interested in a home. In any real estate transaction, a lot of things can go wrong. Whether it is an issue with repairs, interest rates, or the appraisal, there are a lot of variables that go into the process.You should always avoid being disrespectful to interested buyers. Never assume that another buyer will come along.âALWAYS TREAT OTHERS THE WAY YOU WANT TO BE TREATED.âWhile this may be the case, you still want to get your house off the market as soon as possible.Even if another buyer does come along, they will be deterred from your property if they see that a deal has fallen through in the past.It is important, therefore, that you do everything you can to work with an interested buyer when one comes along.The golden rule applies in real estate as much as it does in life. Always treat others the way you want to be treated. If you have any questions about working with interested buyers or any other real estate topics, feel free to reach out to me.

Search all homes for sale.In any real estate purchase, pre-approval should be one of the first steps you take.Here in Wilmington, weâre currently experiencing a trend that is common throughout the countryâthe number of buyers is outweighing the number of available properties. Getting a pre-approval for a mortgage will give you not only a starting point in terms of what to search for, but it will also show the seller that youâre serious. In fact, most sellers wonât even consider an offer without an attached pre-approval letter.Pre-approval will make you and your offer stronger from the very start.So what does a lender look at when you go to get pre-approved? We can break the factors down into Freddie Macâs four Câs. The first C stands for âcapacity,â which denotes a buyerâs ability to pay the monthly mortgage.âPRE-APPROVAL WILL MAKE YOU AND YOUR OFFER STRONGER FROM THE VERY START.âThe next C is your credit score. This number will help indicate to the lender how diligently youâve paid your debts in the past.Next are capital or cash reserves. A lender will look at sources from which you can draw money, such as savings accounts or investments, to have a better understanding of how stable your finances are.Finally, the last C stands for âcollateral.â Collateral depends upon the property youâre purchasing, which will also affect the appraisal.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

There are three different strategies that you can use.How much would your Wilmington home sell for in today's market?Want to buy a Wilmington Home? Search all homes for sale.How can you reduce your closing costs?Unfortunately, closing costs generally are what they are. However, you can shop around with different closing attorneys and lenders to determine what their rates are. Whenever you talk to a lender, I recommend asking for a good faith estimate. That way, you can determine what their fees and rates are. Then, you can compare apples to apples.While you may not be able to reduce the closing costs themselves, we do have three strategies you can use to reduce the amount of money you have to pay out of pocket:1. Close on the home toward the end of the month. Doing so will reduce the interim interest you would pay on the closing. Letâs say you closed on the 25th of June. You would owe interim interest from the 25th to the 30th of the month. Plus, instead of having to make a July payment, you wouldnât have to make a payment until August. Basically, closing toward the end of the month reduces the amount you have to pay out of pocket.âYOUR AGENT CAN NEGOTIATE FOR THE SELLER TO COVER A PORTION OF THE CLOSING COSTS.â2. Ask the seller to pay a portion of the closing costs. We can ask the seller to pay a specific amount, like $3,500 or $4,500. The sellerâs portion comes out of the proceeds of the sale, which reduces the sellerâs net. You need an expert agent to negotiate for you if you want the seller to cover part of the closing costs.3. Ask the lender to wrap the closing costs into your mortgage. This option could increase the interest rate on your mortgage as well as your mortgage fees, but you would still reduce the amount that you have to pay out of pocket.If you have any questions about these strategies or would like to learn more about buying a home, give me a call or send me an email.

Search all homes for sale.Here in Wilmington, most price ranges in most locations are in a sellerâs market. With high demand and low supply, weâre starting to see a lot of multiple offer situations. Sellers are pricing properties aggressively, and buyers have to make high offers to get the home they want. Sometimes appraisers canât keep up with market conditions like these, leading to issues with low appraisals.What do you do if the appraisal comes in low for a home youâre trying to purchase? You have a few different options.âAS A BUYER, THERE ARE FOUR WAYS YOU CAN HANDLE A LOW APPRAISAL.âThe first is to ask the seller to lower the price of the home to the appraised value. Some sellers are willing to do this because they know the buyer wonât pay more than the appraised value.Your second option is to make up the difference between the appraised value and the purchase price. Your lender will only lend a certain percentage based on your loan amount for the actual appraised value or the contract priceâwhichever is lower. If the contract price of the home is $200,000 and it appraises at $190,000 and youâre doing an 80/20 loan, the lender will only lend 80% of $190,000. Therefore, youâll have to make up the difference between the 80% of $190,000 and the $200,000 purchase price.The third option is to meet the seller somewhere in the middle, with you going up in price a little bit and them going down in price a little bit.If the low appraisal comes back during the due diligence periodâwhich we highly recommendâyour fourth option is to terminate the contract and find another house to buy.Before you make an offer on a property, make sure youâre making a reasonable offer thatâs above what others are offering but isnât also overpaying for the property.

Whenever that happens, we start to see multiple offers on homes.If you are a homebuyer competing with other buyers for a property, there are a couple of things you can do to get the home.First, you need to make sure that you work with an agent to represent you throughout the process. Why? There are more than 80 variables in the home buying process and if any one of them is mishandled, it can end up costing you thousands of dollars. You may even lose out on your dream house. So, itâs incredibly important that you have an expert agent representing you.In a multiple offer situation, the key is to make sure that you do not overpay for the home. Make the offer you are comfortable with. Pick a number that wonât make you kick yourself if you lose out on the property and wonât give you buyerâs remorse if you do get the home.âMAKE SURE THAT YOU DO NOT OVERPAY FOR THE HOME.âItâs also important to submit your best offer right from the start. In multiple offer situations, you will not get a chance to submit a counteroffer. Include the best terms you can because sometimes the seller may be looking for certain terms.Ultimately, a good buyerâs specialist can get you the home you want for the price you are willing to pay and the terms that you desire.

Search all homes for sale.When youâre looking to buy your first home, there are a number of things you need to keep in mind throughout the process.The first thing you need to determine is if you are actually ready to buy. Itâs a big step, and youâve got to be sure youâre financially ready to do so. Extra costs can pop up during the transaction, so youâll need to set aside some extra cash, probably more than you were planning on initially.The next step you need to take is talking to a lender to make sure you qualify for what you want to buy. After that, you need to consider the resale value of the homes you are looking at. Even if you donât have kids, the school district that your home lies in impacts your homeâs value and may matter a lot to future buyers.âPAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO YOUR HOMEâS STRUCTURE.âThe next thing to pay attention to is the overall structure of the home youâre looking at. If there are any major repairs that need to be done, those will come to light during the due diligence period when you have your inspection done. In North Carolina, you have the right to terminate the contract for any reason during the due diligence process and youâll get your earnest money back.Finally, you want an agent who is an expert in the areas you are looking in. Only then will you be able to find someone who can negotiate the best deal possible for you. At our office, we set our buyers up to succeed by providing them with updates directly from the MLS when a home that matches their specific criteria hits the market.If you pay special attention to these things throughout the home buying process, you should walk away with a great deal on a great home.

Search all homes for sale.How can you stage your home to sell for top dollar this spring? There are six easy steps that will have you well on your way.The first step is to make a good first impression. The first impression a home makes comes from the outside, so make sure you pressure-wash the exterior, see that the lawn is well-manicured, and do anything else you need to do to the outside so that buyers arenât turned off when they step out of their car.The second step is to keep the home in âshow readyâ condition. Before you leave the house to go to work, for example, make sure the beds are all made, all dirty clothes are in the hamper, and any dirty dishes are stowed away in the dishwasher. You might not always have time to run home and get things situated before a showing, so this due diligence can save you a lot of time and energy.âBUYERS NEED TO BE ABLE TO SEE THEMSELVES IN YOUR HOME.âThe third step is to update your kitchen and bathrooms. This can be done rather inexpensivelyâyou donât need a total renovation from either room. For example, in the kitchen you can replace the hardware on your cabinets and add a fresh coat of paint on the walls.The fourth step is to remove any and all personal photos and trinkets. Since youâre moving anyway, you might as well pack these items up. Buyers need to be able to walk into the house and picture themselves living inside it, and this can be difficult if there are mementos of your family festooned everywhere. I also recommend removing about one-third of the furniture in your house to make the interior look larger.The fifth step is to hide all pet items. Not everybody likes pets, so remove any water/food bowls, litter boxes, or pet beds scattered about. Itâs especially important that none of these items show up in any of your listing photos.The sixth and final step is to hire an experienced agent. This means an agent that knows your market, knows how to price a house correctly, and knows how to market it for top dollar.If youâre interested, we can offer you a free staging consultation and offer you some tips on how to prepare your home for the market.

However, there are ways to get out of having to pay it.How much would your Wilmington home sell for in today's market?Want to buy a Wilmington Home? Search all homes for sale.Iâm here today to answer the question of âWhat is PMI?â and give you tips on how you can avoid having to pay it.Private mortgage insurance, or PMI, is an insurance policy that you pay anytime you have less than 20% equity in your home. Basically, it protects the lender if you default on your mortgage.This applies to any conventional loan in which you have less than 20% equity. However, paying PMI is not always necessary. Here are a few ways to avoid it:1. Put 20% down on your home purchase. This will automatically get rid of PMI, but itâs not always a feasible option.âTHE EASIEST WAY IS TO PUT 20% DOWN ON YOUR PURCHASE.â2. Paying PMI up front in the form of closing costs and lender credits.3. Build up 20% equity in your home. Once you do that, you can call your lender and ask them to remove the PMI from your monthly payment.4. Look at other loan programs. There are options out there that donât require a PMI payment each month or a 20% initial down payment.If you have any questions, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.",
