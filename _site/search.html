        "content": "http://www.johnschustergroup.com/home-seller-forum.phpItâs amazing the impact that having a quality real estate team on your side can have. To illustrate this, I recently brought on Paul Douglas and Jordana Green from WCCO Radioâtwo friends and past clients of mine to talk about their experience working with the John Schuster Group.Â According to Paul, the decision to work with us not only solved his real estate needs, but also resolved some marital tension. Before partnering with the John Schuster Group, Paul and his wife were working with another agent. Unfortunately, this agent did a poor job. Things just werenât working out.Â The uncertainty and ambiguity they faced while working with this agent created so much stress that the experience began to put a strain on their relationship. Thankfully, as I mentioned before, all was resolved when they turned to us for help. We were able to successfully guide them through their transaction and, as a result, help reduce the tension that had grown in their marriage.Â Jordana had a similar story to share. She had also listed with another agent before coming to our team for help, and, like Paul, found that things just werenât working out. Worse still, the agent wouldnât let her out of the contractâleaving her to suffer for six months with no offers on her home.Â When the six-month contract was up, Jordana decided to come to the John Schuster Group. Her experience with us couldnât have been more different from what she faced with her previous agent. She received multiple offers almost immediately and within just three weeks was under contract with a great buyer.âWe are constantly striving to help people just like them meet and exceed their real estate goals.âOur team is so happy to have been able to help Paul and Jordana, and theirs are just two of the many success stories we help create all the time. We are constantly striving to help people just like them meet and exceed their real estate goals. Part of the way we do this is by hosting educational events like the Home Seller Forum we held last September, where sellers had the chance to learn about the resources and techniques necessary to succeed in our market.Â Over 120 people showed up to that event, so weâve decided to host a few more. If youâre looking to learn how to maximize your home selling success, join us on either January 23 or January 24 at the Plymouth Community Center, or on January 26 at the Braemar Golf Course.Â Space is limited, so donât delay in reserving your spot. You can register here for the date and time that works best for you.Â If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Itâs okay, you can rest easyâour marketâs not headed for another crash. However, I believe weâre starting to transition into more of a balanced market, and there are certain trends buyers and sellers need to be aware of.For the past seven years, weâve seen aggressive price appreciation. If you bought a home in 2011 or 2012, youâve probably built up a lot of equity in your home. The great thing is that most of the sales taking place in todayâs market are traditional sales. There arenât as many lender-mediated sales, short sales, or foreclosures happening anymore.One thing weâre already seeing is our annual seasonal slowdown. Inventory is growing, so if youâre a seller, your home has to be in turnkey condition when you bring it to the market because buyers have more supply to choose from.âYou need to know the right time to enter the market.âIf youâre a buyer, this transition is good news because, as I just said, youâll see more inventory and have more homes to choose from. You need to be careful watching the market, though, because interest rates are on the rise. Every 1% increase in interest rates decreases your buying power by 11% or more.In either case, you need to know the right time to enter the market. If youâre a buyer, weâd love to meet with you for a buyer consultation so we can come up with a game plan. You can also visit our website if youâd like to search all the latest listing from the Twin Cities area. If youâre a seller and youâre wondering what your home is worth in this market, weâd love to meet with you as well so we can provide you with a detailed equity analysis.If you have any other questions about our market or youâd like to meet with us to get started on accomplishing your real estate goals, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

If you are a seller, think about it: we spend tons of money to make your listing look fabulous online. We pay thousands of dollars each month to move it to the top of all the aggregators, so when a buyer comes through and they request more information, you need to respond to that as soon as possible.It seems like nowadays, everyone is impatient with their communicationâthey want a response immediately. Our ISAs respond to all online inquiries and anyone reaching out to the John Schuster Group within five minutes during business hours and within 15 minutes on nights and weekends. That means an interested client will get into our sellersâ homes faster.âOur ISAs respond within five minutes during business hours and within 15 minutes on nights and weekends.âIf youâre a buyer, ISAs are also important, especially in todayâs competitive market. You need a resource on your side to find inventory that isnât actively available on the market. Inventory has come down by a third from where it was last year, and many buyers are losing homes in bidding wars. People who choose to work with us on the buy side will benefit from our ability to identify neighborhoods and communities theyâll want to live in.

Weâre lucky to have endorsements from people like Paul and Jordana; we recently had the privilege of selling both of their homes.Jordana tried selling her home with another agent but didnât have any luck. After she hired us, we sold her home in three weeks for more than its original listing price. Paul also tried selling his home with a previous agent, but nothing worked for him either. Thatâs when he hired our team and got almost instant results.âWe are believers,â Paul said. âYou guys have figured out the formula. The marketing is out of this world.âWith that being said, our market is red-hot right now. Inventory is down 23% compared to last year, and many of our clientsâ homes are selling with multiple offers. How do we get such consistent results from our listings?A lot of it boils down to our comprehensive marketing strategy. Most of our clients arenât ready to enter the market immediately, and it takes a while to get a listing ready. This is why weâve mastered âcoming soonâ marketing. If we take on a listing that wonât be on the market for a month or two, we initiate our coming soon marketing plan to create a large pool of buyers for that house once it does hit the market. Thatâs how we generate multiple offers. By doing this, our clients sell faster and for more money. Theyâre happy, weâre happy, and our team is having a blast right now.âOur comprehensive marketing strategy helps our clients sell their homes quickly and for top dollar.âAnother strategy weâve implemented is using pocket listings. This is for sellers who donât want to enter the MLS but would still sell for the right offer and perhaps want to test the market a little. In our low-inventory market, weâve been getting fabulous offers for sellers with pocket listings. This way, we sell about 10% to 15% of our listings before they hit the market.âI always tell people, unless youâre ready to move, donât list with John, because he is going to sell that house,â Jordanna said. âIf you call John, start packing, because thatâs whatâs going to happen for you.âIf youâre thinking of selling your home and youâd like to know what it would sell for, donât hesitate to give us a call or shoot us an email so we can meet with you and give you a consultation.I want to thank Paul and Jordanna for joining me today. Donât forget to tune into WCCO from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, to catch the âThe Paul &amp; Jordanna Show.âIf you have any other questions or real estate needs, feel free to reach out to me anytime.

        "category": "",
        "content": "New homeowners may be excited about finally having a place to themselves, but there are seven things they often forget to keep in mind when it comes to maintaining the home.&nbsp;Today, Iâm going to discuss seven things that new homeowners donât know that they need to be doing.âItâs just the joy of homeownershipâplumbing issues, appliances breaking down, and natural disasters.â  Save for unexpected problems. I know that you already did an inspection, but things are bound to happen when you buy a home. Itâs just the joy of homeownershipâplumbing issues, appliances breaking down, and natural disasters. Put some money away into an account so that you wonât be caught unawares.  Form an inspection habit. You need to inspect your house seasonally, at least once a year. Walk around the exterior, check for peeling paint, check the grading, look underneath the plumbing, and watch for pests.  Buy a lot of furnace filters. We recommend changing your filters once a month. You can order filters online from Amazon and have them shipped to your home. You can even set it up to have them auto-shipped to your home on a monthly basis to remind yourself to do it. Otherwise, most home goods and hardware stores will have them available.  Get to know your appliances. There are certain appliances that need to be tuned up seasonally, like your furnace. We also recommend getting a safety check done going into the colder months. Clean out those burners and make sure that youâre not pumping carbon monoxide into your house. Do the same thing with your air conditioning unit. Additionally, know the life expectancy of your appliances; for example, furnaces often last between 10 to 15 years.  Take advantage of tax credits. When youâre upgrading some appliances, you can actually get some tax credits. Take a look at Energy Star appliances to make sure they still qualify. Solar technology is also a hot item. Just make sure to look at the rate of return because some of those do require more of a cash outlay once you buy them.  Start keeping records. Keep records when you buy anything, when you get anything installed, or do service dates underneath your mechanicals. Iâm old school, meaning folders and file cabinets. But you can also make a Google Doc to record when the dates of when you service something or when you buy any appliances.  Beef up your insurance. You should be shopping for insurance once a year. We recommend that you look at possibly getting a little higher deductible but also getting more coverage. Youâre not going to take out a homeownerâs claim for a $500 ratio; it will probably be $2,000 or more, so you might as well have a higher deductible and get more coverage. Make sure youâve got sewage backup coverage on your policiesâa lot of policies donât cover sewer backups. You might also want to talk to your insurance agent about getting some umbrella coverage over and above your standard policy.If youâre thinking of buying or selling a home in the Twin Cities area, please feel free to reach out to us or visit our website, where you can find a list of available homes and calculate the value of your current home.

There are so few homes out there for buyers to choose from that weâre starting to see multiple offers again. Inventory is actually down 20% from where it was a year ago.Itâs the same with the days on market. Sellers that list their home are spending 15% fewer days on the market than they were last year.Thereâs a lot of pressure on buyers right now. Theyâre seeing interest rates go up; they spiked up almost half a point within the last month. On a $300,000 loan balance, a half a point increase means an extra $1,500 per year, or between $120 and $130 a month.If youâre a seller and youâre thinking of listing your home this year, you need to get your home ready for the market as soon as possible. Our spring market is fabulous for sellers, but it does come and go rather quickly. There is usually a slowdown toward the end of June and into early July.âTiming is everything when you want to sell a home in the Twin Cities.âBuyers looking to enter the spring market need to be ready to act fast. Contact a qualified lender and get a pre-approval letter, and be sure that lender has done underwriting on your file so that youâre 100% good to go. Meet with a Realtor who knows the market that you want to buy in so you can strategize the best way to win out on the house you want, especially if it has multiple offers on it.We have three examples from within the last couple of weeks of just how hot the market is. One is a beautiful home that we listed in St. Louis Park that received a whopping 52 showings in 72 hours.Four of the offers were over list price.In Burnsville, a property had 33 showings over the weekend, and seven offers were tens of thousands of dollars over the list price. Another property in Lake Minnetonka had been on the market for over two years, and it just sold in less than a weekend.Timing is everything when you want to sell a home in the Twin Cities.If youâre thinking of buying or selling a home, feel free to reach out to us.

We sit down with them and walk them through the whole process, from starting your search to finding a home to all of the steps it takes to get to the closing table.We believe that itâs important to give buyers like you a full market exposure.That way, you know what is going on in the price point you are interested in buying in. In certain price points, homes sell quickly with multiple offers. In other price points, buyers can negotiate more aggressively and get a great deal.Some buyers go to Zillow or Realtor.com, see a house they like, and request a showing. Then, they get assigned to an agent and buy the first house that they see.Since these buyers skipped the consultation step, they really donât know what theyâve missed. Other homes on the market might have been a better fit for them, or they may not have gotten the best deal.If you can hit pause for a second and sit down for a full market exposure, you have a better chance of finding the home you truly want and getting a better deal.âIf you donât sit down for a consultation, you could miss out on the perfect house or a good deal.âIf you want to buy a home in a specific neighborhood and canât find one because of a lack of inventory, we can help. Just tell us you are interested in that area during the consultation, and our team will canvas the neighborhood. We will call every home in the area and find inventory thatâs not yet on the market and that other buyers wonât have a chance to look at.We are also good at getting our buyers in front of a lender sooner rather than later. If there should happen to be an issue on your credit report, you can get that fixed in three to six months. If you know that information, then you get get a better interest rate and increase your purchasing power.We will also walk through your negotiation strategy. If you are interested in foreclosed homes, distressed properties, or youâre an owner-occupant buyer, there will be different strategies depending on the type of home you are looking at. There will also be different strategies for each price point. Knowing that information empowers you to make a better decision.During the buyerâs consultation, we cover other important aspects of the home buying process, such as home warranties and closing dates. That way, youâll know which items youâll want to negotiate when you are putting in a purchase agreement.If you have a home to sell, a buyerâs consultation can be very helpful. We can help you figure out if you want to sell your home first and be a noncontingent buyer, or we can help put together a strategy for making your offer contingent on the sale of your current home.Finally, itâs really important that you feel comfortable when hiring your buyerâs agent. You are the boss. You want to hire someone you feel comfortable with and that cares about your purchase decision.A half-hour consultation with a buyerâs agent will empower you with the information you need to make a great purchase decision. Everyone here at our group loves working with buyers, so we would be happy to sit down with you and listen to your wants and needs so we can help you find the perfect home for your family.If you have any questions about the home buying process or would like to schedule a buyerâs consultation, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!",

        "content": "What can you do to increase the value of your home?If you plan on selling your home, we want to help you maximize your equity without leaving any money on the table. For any questions about real estate, just give us a call or send us an email. We would love to help you out and answer your questions with a video or directly.Dan recently reached out to us and asked us this question. If your home is stuck back in the 80s, 70s, or beyond we want to help you maximize your equity without leaving any money on the table.If your home is stuck back in the 80s, 70s, or beyond, there are some very simple equity updates you can do in order to truly maximize the value of your home once it hits the market.First of all, do you have wallpaper in your home? All of that old wallpaper has to come down. Todayâs buyers do not like it. A fresh coat of paint can do wonders for your home. Buyers prefer fresh, neutral colors. The hottest color right now is called greige. As you probably guessed, itâs a mix of gray and beige. There are lighter and darker tones depending on what the room is asking for.Flooring is another important thing to look at. If you have old, frayed carpet, replace it with new carpet or hardwood flooring. If you have hardwood floors, get them buffed, sanded, and sealed. Also replace any outdated or old vinyl flooring.Itâs also incredibly important to pay attention to deferred maintenance issues both inside and outside of the home. Windows can be a major issue; houses often breathe a bit, so water can drip down to the silt plate of the window and cause discoloration. If the window is not too far gone, you can sand and reseal that and use some polyurethane to make it look great.âMake sure that you take care of any deferred maintenance issues.âOther deferred maintenance issues like minor plumbing leaks, peeling paint, and mechanical maintenance checks should be addressed. If your furnace hasnât been tuned up in five years, make sure that you get that done before you put your home on the market. Have an HVAC expert come out for a safety check. Make sure they put a sticker with the date on it so that the buyer and the buyerâs inspector know that the furnace has been checked recently.The buyer will definitely do an inspection, and you donât want to present your house with any deferred maintenance.Another way to bring your house into the 21st century is to remove all of that polished brass and any outdated lighting fixtures. Pick something out at Menards or Lowes and have an electrician come out and install them.There are other updates that you can do in your kitchen and bathroom. Before you do that, though, I recommend contacting a licensed real estate agent. We can come out, do a walk-through, and recommend which renovations will make your home as marketable as possible. We can also guide you as to which permits will be necessary for certain renovations.We recommend that you do the walk-through three to six months before you plan on putting your home on the market.Just give us a call or send us an email with any questions. We would be happy to help you!",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Is Zillow an accurate way to calculate your homeâs value?To calculate any homeâs value, Zillow uses an automated value tool called a Zestimate. Automated values work via a complex algorithm that takes into account neighboring home sales, available tax information, the last time your home sold, and numerous other data points.Some Realtors and brokers hate Zillow, but Iâm not one of them. These automated values are better in some neighborhoods than others. If you live in a subdivision with 100 similar homes, Zillow can usually calculate your homeâs value to within 10% of its likely sale price.The challenge with automated values is with homes that are unique. In Minnesota, waterfront properties, homes with an acreage, or homes that are worth over $500,000 donât work well with Zillowâs automated value system.Automated values are just a starting point. Much like your county assessed value, Zillow doesnât know about all the updates you mightâve completed, the lot premium for your lot compared to your neighborâs, and other factors like that.âAutomated values are just a starting point.âIf youâre looking for a true, accurate value of what your home will sell for in todayâs market, you have a couple of options.First, you can hire an independent appraiser to look at your property, although appraisers are usually only used by banks to help them decide what theyâll lend for a mortgage. Your second option is to contact a real estate agent so they can put together a comparative market analysis.If youâre thinking of selling in the next two years and would like a free-no-obligation market analysis on your home, we would love to help. If you have any more questions about this topic, donât hesitate to reach out to us. We look forward to connecting with you soon!",

        "title": "The Real Reason You Need a Home Inspection",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Why are home inspections important?Before getting into that, Iâd like to define the kind of inspection weâre going to focus on today. The buyerâs inspection, which is the inspection the buyer will have performed once the purchase agreement has been ratified.During the inspection period, which tends to be between 10 to 14 days, there is a lot to be done. The most important items being looked at during any inspection are safety, structural, and mechanical issues. Now is not the time to comment on cosmetic items like an off-putting paint color.But, safety-related items like the presence of black mold or a foundation issue are highly relevant at this time. These are the kinds of things an inspection will uncover.Another inspection buyers are commonly getting in recent times relates to the presence of radon. If a seller has not completed a radon test or the property lacks a radon mitigation system, many buyers are now choosing to have a radon inspection. The EPA recommends that any property with more than four parts-per-million of radon present should have the issue mitigated.Homes with high levels of radon can lead to cancer and other health-related issues, so this inspection is one many buyers are having performed on top of their standard buyerâs inspection.The average cost for a radon inspection is around $150. If a propertyâs radon levels are too high, then there are easy ways to relieve the issue. A radon mitigation system can be installed for about $1,500. But, this is one expense which could potentially be negotiated with the seller.Once the inspection period is over, you as a buyer have three options. Your first option is to move forward with the property as-is, you could cancel the purchase agreement and have your earnest money refunded, or you could try to negotiate an inspection contingency with the seller.If you do go the third route, there are a few things youâll want to receive from the seller before closing. First of all, make sure you are given a paid receipt. This will give you assurance that the seller actually paid the contractor who took care of the inspection issue. You donât want to live in your new home for a few months only to find that youâve been left with a lien on the property.âA home is one of the most expensive purchases youâll ever make, so itâs absolutely worth investing some money into making sure the property is up-to-par.âBefore you can close, youâre going to do one last walkthrough of the property to ensure its condition is as-expected. A home is one of the most expensive purchases youâll ever make, so itâs absolutely worth investing some money into making sure the property is up-to-par.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "title": "How Long Does Closing Take?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "We get this question all the time from both buyers and sellers: How long does it take to close a home?The average timeframe to close a transaction is between 45 to 60 days.Now, there are many factors that can affect a closing date. The biggest one can be the type of financing that youâre doing on a property. FHA or VA financing can take longer than conventional financing; there are longer and more stringent requirements for the appraisal and underwriting processes.With FHA and VA financing, the appraiser will dig a little deeper than normal to make sure that everything is taken care of on the property, so that the buyer can move in without being burdened with repairs.Another kind of buyer youâll see is a cash buyer or investor. These buyers may able to close within 10 days. Weâve even seen investors come in and ask the seller to pick a closing date, which is a great option for some sellers who need the flexibility of a closing date that works for them. As long as the other terms work for an investor, you can see the time to close vary between 10 days and six months.âIn closing a home, thereâs a life cycle to the process.âOnce the buyer wants to put a purchase agreement on a property, the buyer and seller go into a negotiation period. This can range from an hour to as long a week or more. Our market moves pretty fast, so buyers have to step up to the table quickly, especially if itâs a newly listed property.At the point when a purchase agreement has been ratified, the buyer and seller move into an inspection contingency phase, which can last anywhere from 10 to 14 days. This is the time for the buyer to do their due diligence on the property and complete the buyerâs inspection. Sometimes theyâll inspect for radon, or perhaps a sewage or well inspection. If youâre building, there are different due diligence inspections as far as permits, etc., and we can walk you through that process.After the inspection contingency is released, if itâs a financed property, the next stage is the appraisal process. At this point, the bank is going to hire a third-party appraisal company to come out and verify if the price on the home truly reflects market value.During the appraisal process, title work is likely being done at the same time. In the state of Minnesota, the buyer hires a title company to go through and make sure that the property theyâre purchasing is free of all title defects and they can buy it without any encumbrances.Following the title work, the buyer moves into the final underwriting period, which can last from a couple days to a couple weeks. Sometimes, lenders will need an updated copy of a pay stub, or theyâll have a question about the appraisal; lenders sometimes return to the buyer a few times, asking for updated items.Once everything is done and the lender has dotted the Iâs and crossed the Tâs, theyâll then release what is called the Cleared to Close letter (CTC). Everyone is happy at this point because they know that the loan is through the underwriting process and the buyer is ready to close. The buyer may do a last walk-through before all parties meet to close.That is what the process will typically look like from purchase agreements to end, and on average lasts 45 to 60 days.If youâre a buyer or seller and youâre thinking of making a real estate transaction in the Twin Cities area, call us anytime!",
