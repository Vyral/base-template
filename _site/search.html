        "content": "The fourth quarter is a great time to put your home on the market in Tampa Bay because youâll face less competition and the buyers you encounter will be more serious about buying.Selling your Tampa home? Get a free home value reportBuying a home? Search all Tampa homes for saleItâs been a fantastic year to buy and sell real estate, and weâre now heading into one of my favorite times to put a home on the market.Itâs the fourth quarter, and weâre entering the holiday season. A lot of sellers have been taught to believe that itâs a good idea to take their home off the market during the holidays because nothing sells then.Well, Iâm here to tell you that nothing could be further from the truth. Tampa Bay is a year-round market with a strong fourth quarter. Would it surprise you to know that last year, a full 25% of the homes that sold in Tampa did so in the fourth quarter? Out of 33,422 home sales across the entire year, 8,831 sales occurred during the fourth quarter.If youâre thinking of taking your home off the market and listing it after the new year or once spring comes, have you considered taking advantage of the fact that inventory will be lower now because so many other sellers plan on doing the same thing? Youâll face less competition, and youâll deal with fewer but more serious showings because buyers who look for homes during the fourth quarter tend to be more serious.âLAST YEAR, A FULL 25% OF THE HOMES THAT SOLD IN TAMPA DID SO IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.âWho are these buyers? They include:  Out-of-towners flying in over the holidays who want to tie in visits to friends and family with their home-shopping trip.  People who are starting new jobs at the first of the year and need a new place to live.  In-town residents who want to purchase a home and close on it before December 31st so they can put a put a homestead exemption on it.  People who are busy with work and have some time off over the holidays to shop for their homes.If youâve been thinking about making a move but have been assuming it would be best to wait until after the holidays to do so, pick up the phone and give me a call so we can go over which options are best for you.If you have any more questions about our Tampa Bay market, feel free to reach out to me.

Get a free home value reportBuying a home? Search all Tampa homes for saleToday Iâd like to tell you about a little known program that has already thousands of people buy homes. This program can give you up to $15,000 toward your down payment. Unfortunately, many of todayâs potential buyers have never heard of this program, so we want to spread the word to all of our friends and clients who might be able to take advantage of this wonderful program before itâs too late!Back during the housing crisis, the federal government designated funds to help in the bailing out of the housing crisis.However, because not all of this money was used, the funds that were left over were given to several of the most affected states in order to aid in their recovery.Florida was one of those states. As a result, state bond money is being given out to aid in home purchases in many counties here in Florida.Not only does the program give you up to $15,000 toward your home purchase, it also doesnât need to be repaid as long as you stay in the house for at least five years.âSTATE BOND MONEY IS BEING GIVEN OUT TO AID IN HOME PURCHASES.âBut this down payment assistance program isnât going to last foreverâfunds for the full $15,000 assistance are running low, and are set to run out around October 31-November 3 this year, and once they do, the program will change. While the program will continue, the amount of money that is offered will be dropping to $7,500, and the repayment requirements are stricter should you sell the home.So, who qualifies for this program? If you have not owned a home in the last three years, or are a veteran, you may qualify.  Additionally, the income requirements are less strict than you might think. In fact, you can still qualify as an individual with a base salary of up to $82,600.This program is absolutely worth checking out. If you know anyone who would benefit from this program, please feel free to forward this message on to them, and call us immediately for more details.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

Two very important year-over-year statistics prove how well we did compared to March 2016.First, there were 3,283 closed sales, which was an increase of 22%. To put that into perspective, our market traditionally averages between 2,200 to 2,500 sales per month. Across the market, prices were up roughly 8.7%. Depending on your neighborhood and price range, however, this figure can vary.âMARCH WAS A RECORD-SETTING MONTH FOR OUR MARKET.âWhat do these statistics mean? We have a clear dividing line where we switch from a sellerâs market to a buyerâs market. In Tampa, that dividing line is right around the $500,000 mark. Under that price point, we have less than a six-month supply of inventory. Over that price point, the inventory starts to climb.To get a more in-depth look at the latest statistics our spring market has brought, click on this link.Who do you know who might need help buying or selling?

The answer really depends on your own situation, but you certainly want to think about whether the home will support your long-term needs if you make the upgrades, the eventual resale value of your improved home, and whether those improvements will pay off.  There might just be something about your current house that doesnât work for you and your family at this time.  Moving might make more sense, especially if you are over-improving your home for its neighborhood.Depending on what you decide to do, getting your money out when it comes time to resell can be a challenge, so itâs worth doing a bit of research before you decide.

        "title": "Why Its Crucial to Have a Great Agent on Your Side When Buying New Construction",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "If youâre buying new construction, do you need an agent? I would highly recommend hiring one for a few reasons.Selling your Tampa home? Get a free home value reportBuying a home? Search all Tampa homes for saleAre you focused on a newly built house as your next home?Many buyers have new construction at the top of their list when they go looking for a home. Thereâs nothing like the feeling of a brand-new, spotless home, that new-home smell, and a blank canvas ready for your own personal touches and preferences to make it your own.If youâre in the market for new construction, be prepared. There are some common myths, hidden costs, and important things to know when buying new construction, and youâll want an experienced, professional real estate agent who is not affiliated with the builder on your side to make sure everything goes smoothly. Buying new construction without a buyerâs agent is not unlike going to the doctor without health insurance. In many cases, you arenât covered or protected, and you will likely end up overpaying.A builder and the listing agent will give you guidance, but their alliances are to their company, not you. Some buyers mistakenly think they will save on commission when buying new, but the commission is built into the price whether an agent is part of the deal or not. Builders donât remove that from the price of the home if you donât use an agentâs services when buying from them.âA GOOD AGENT KNOWS THAT PRICES ARE NEGOTIABLE AND WILL ENSURE THE BEST DEAL ON THE HOME.âIf you donât have an agent, you may be on your own in more ways than one. Builders often offer greater incentives to agents that agents can then pass along to their buyers. There are often incentives for working with a lender and title company the builder prefers. Many buyers donât know to ask for closing cost assistance or to have certain premiums waived or reduced.Your lot selection can be crucial for the future resale of your home, yet not all the home sites that carry premium prices will translate into premium resale value when you go to sell your homeâan experienced agent can advise you on and help you to make the best lot selection, and prevent you from overpaying for a poor lot choice.Perhaps most importantly, new construction prices are negotiable! Many buyers feel intimidated when visiting a builderâs model center and donât know they can negotiate on price. Itâs to your advantage to have a buyerâs agent with you â thatâs our job. We ask to negotiate the price and go in armed with our knowledge, skills and experience. We can pull information on comparable homes available locally, and present those to the builder to make the case to get you a lower price and a better value. That may mean asking for closing costs to be reduced, warranties to be extended, better pricing on finishes, or upgrades to flooring, appliances, or window treatments.As you reach an agreement on price and go under contract, a real estate professional who is knowledgeable about the industry and pricing provides valuable guidance. That can be a huge help when working with the design center to select from your available options and when you consider customizing your home, including structural issues and whether to handle them during construction or outside the building process.While your home is being built, mistakes can and do happen and the builders need to correct themâthis can often be challenging for a buyer going it alone.  No home is perfect, not even new construction, and the issues we see are often crucial to the future enjoyment of your home.Finally, as your buyerâs agent, we attend the final walk-through with you to help you identify any issues or areas of concern. A professional real estate eye will often see things a person outside of the industry might not notice. Ideally, there wonât be any problems â at least, any major problems; but there almost always are issues to address, and we have the expertise to work with the builder as your advocate and get any items of concern corrected.One more noteâ¦ One of the costliest mistakes we see is when buyers decide to purchase a new construction home, banking on receiving a certain price for their existing home, without ever getting a professional opinion from an experienced listing agent on what their home will really sell for in todayâs market. Itâs easy to get a sense of confidence looking at your âZestimateâ, or prices of current homes on the market in the neighborhood.  The buyer might find out down the road that their house isnât worth as much as they thoughtâthis can result in having to cancel a purchase, or even losing thousands of dollars in deposit money. Just be sure to consult with an experienced agent who successfully sells homes in your price rangeânot a brand new or part time agent.BEST of all our services of a knowledgeable, experienced buyerâs agent are FREE.Click here to download my free guide: Why Itâs Crucial to Have a Great Agent on Your Side When Buying New Construction",

The average homeowner to this day is 38 times wealthier than a renter.âIn his bestselling book, The Automatic Millionaire, Bach does the math:âAs a renter, you can easily spend $500,000 or more on rent over the years ($1,500 a month for 30 years comes to $540,000), and in the end wind up just where you started â owning nothing.
