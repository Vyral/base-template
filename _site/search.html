        "content": "Removing mortgage insurance is different for conventional and FHA loans. However, most people may not realize that the removal of mortgage insurance, regardless of loan type, is actually dictated by the federal government.If you take out an FHA loan, your ability to remove mortgage insurance is predicated on the down payment amount. If you put more than 10% down, you are only required to pay mortgage insurance for 11 years. If you put less than 10% down, then you have to pay mortgage insurance for the entire life of the loan. So, keep that in mind if you are considering an FHA.Conventional loans carry private mortgage insurance, or PMI. Most people think that once they get to 80% loan to value, the mortgage insurance falls off. Thatâs not exactly true. The rule states that if you pay mortgage insurance, it automatically falls off at 78% loan to valueâbut you can request to remove it at 80% LTV. Contact your loan servicer once you reach 80% and ask to get that PMI removed.âAppreciation in value adds a bit of a wrinkle to this process.âAppreciation in value does add another wrinkle to this process. A lot of customers say, âMy home appreciated in value since I bought it. Now I have the 20% equity and would like to remove my mortgage insurance.âThat is fine, but the rules for using appreciation as justification are different than the rules based on the original purchase price. You are ineligible to use appreciation as justification years zero through two of owning the home. Between the two and five-year mark, you need 25% equity for justification; after five years, that number goes back down to 20%.Your loan service will require an updated appraisal at that time to make sure that you have subsequent equity levels.If you have any other questions about removing mortgage insurance, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "You may not realize it, but we actually have some of the most conservative equity laws in the country down here in Texas. They limit the maximum loan-to-value of your financing to 80% of the homeâs value. Regardless of the financing you are doing, the state requires an appraisal to be conducted to determine its value to make sure it doesnât exceed the 80% threshold.There are a few different types of equity loans out there. Hereâs a little bit of information about each.Equity lines of credit are variable and can be used for practically anything. Standalone second liens are typically taken out for home improvements. Cash-out refinances are when you refinance your entire loan balance in excess of what you want to borrow to get cash out of the property.âYou can only have one equity loan at a time.âThere are advantages and disadvantages to each, but one thing about these loans is universal in Texas. Whenever you take one out, there is a 12-month cooling off period until you can touch it. If you did a cash-out refinance and rates cratered immediately after, you are prevented from refinancing again until after the period has passed.Â Also, keep in mind that in Texas, you are only allowed one equity loan on a property at a time. If you did a cash-out refinance, for example, you are not allowed to take a home equity LOC out after the fact.Â If you have any questions for me or would like to discuss your specific scenario, donât hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.",

        "content": "If a marriage ends, what happens to the house and the mortgage?Itâs important to know the plans for the home. You can refinance to remove one person from the loan or sell the house.Texas is a community property state. A refinance may not be necessary if you dictate in the divorce decree who will be obligated to make the payments. However, the downside is that the departing spouseâs credit is still tied to the home. If the occupying spouse misses a payment, it would still negatively affect the otherâs credit. Thatâs why I recommend refinancing.âItâs important to know the plans for the home.âThe timing will dictate whether an owelty lien is used. In Texas, if youâre trying to refinance to remove one spouse, many times you need to take cash out to pay them their share of the equity. Texas has limits for the maximum loan-to-value you can have on a cash-out refinance of 80%. Depending on what the home appraises at or the agreed payment, it may or may not be enough equity to take out. The alternative is the owelty lien, which gets put on the property for the agreed-upon amount and prevents the occupying spouse from refinancing or selling the property without guaranteeing payment to the departing spouse.Itâs the most secure way to get equity out of the home. However, it needs to be agreed upon before the divorce is finalized. Sadly, I many people come to me after the divorce is already finalized, so this option is off the table.Selling the property releases both parties from the obligation of the mortgage, but they both still need to move somewhere. Thatâs why itâs still important to speak with a mortgage lender to get the situation resolved.For more information on this sensitive topic, click here.If you or anyone you know is in this situation and needs guidance, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "To many people, the topic of mortgage insurance carries a negative connotation, but it shouldnât. It has its place in the mortgage process and can benefit you as a consumer. There are three main types of mortgage insurance you need to be aware of.âKnow the goals of your property before picking a mortgage insurance.âThe most common type is borrower-paid monthly mortgage insurance. This is where the monthly amount gets added to the principal and interest portion of your payment. You would then make that payment each month until you get to a 78% loan-to-value ratio.The other type is single-premium financed mortgage insurance. This is where the lifetime costs of the mortgage insurance get financed into the loan amount. It keeps your interest rate the same, but it adds to the loan amount. This actually results in a lower monthly payment because you donât have the interest rate at that higher amount each month.The last type is lender-paid mortgage insurance. This is where the lender pays the lifetime cost of the mortgage insurance in exchange for you agreeing to a higher interest rate. A higher interest rate has a negative connotation with most consumers, but the reality is that it results in the lowest possible monthly payment, and itâs even lower once you consider the after-tax mortgage interest deduction. This is a good way to structure your loan, but not if youâre going to keep the loan for a very long time.The benefit of the monthly mortgage insurance is that it can fall off once you get to the 78% loan-to-value ratio. If you finance it in as a lump sum into the loan amount or roll it into the interest rate, thereâs nothing to fall off because it has already been factored in.The rules to remove monthly insurance are pretty complicated, and which structure makes the most sense for you is largely dependent on your goals for your property.My staff and I would be honored to help walk you through this, so if you have any more questions or know anyone looking to purchase a home in the next six months, please donât hesitate to give us a call. weâd love to speak with you!",

This means that instead of paying your mortgage once a month, youâd pay twice a month.âWith this plan, you get the same effect as bi-weekly payments without the middle man and their fee.âThe reality of working with these companies, though, is that youâll pay them a month in advance. Then, youâll pay every two weeks, and in turn, they will pay your lender once a month. This will continue until theyâve built up enough reserves in the escrow account theyâve set up for you to make that 13th payment a year.I advise my clients to take that monthly payment youâre paying to your lender each month, divide it by 12, and add that amount to what you pay every single month. This results in a 13th payment being made every year. Itâs exactly the same as the bi-weekly payment plan, with the only difference being that by doing it yourself, you cut out the middlemanâand their fee.If you have any questions about this payment plan, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

Out of all of those factors, the one that has the most bearing on a successful transaction is the lenderâs ability to close on time.If you take out a loan, itâs very important to partner with a lender that will go through the due diligence steps up front to ensure that youâre fully pre-approved. After that, they should set the correct expectations for you so that when you shop for a home, you know how to properly negotiate for it so the transaction is a smooth one and you have a happy closing.Nationwide, about one-third of all home loans donât close on time, according to the Campbell/Inside Mortgage Finance Housing Pulse Tracking Survey. FHA loans only close on time 59.2% of the time. Conventional loans (e.g., those that are backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) only close on time 63.6% of the time. Cash transactionsâbelieve it or notâonly close on time 79.1% of the time.âWho you partner with for your financing has a large impact on your transaction.âWho you partner with for your financing has a large impact on whether you have a successful closing or not.

        "content": "What makes piggyback loans beneficial to home buyers? Why would a recast be more advantageous for you?A piggyback loan is when you take out a single loan for 80% of the homeâs value and either 10% or 15% of the remainder to purchase the home. Itâs usually either an 80/10 or 80/15/5 split.Structuring the loan this way usually makes sense when youâre very close to the $417,000 conforming loan limit. There are definitely better ways to structure this if possible, though. I say this because when you structure it with the first and second lien, the interest rate on that first lien is quite a bit higher than it would be otherwise.If the loan amounts cooperate, most of our clients actually structure this with a single loan, pay the private mortgage insurance, and then pay the loan down in either a lump sum payment as a result of the sale of another property, or with accelerated principal payments throughout the loan so that the mortgage insurance drops off.At that point, they can then contact us to recast the loan so it acts as a retroactive down payment. What happens, then, is you end up at the same place as if you structured the loan with the first and the second lien. The difference is by structuring it with a single loan with mortgage insurance and throwing in a recast there, you end up with a lower interest rate over the life of the loan, which ends up saving you quite a bit of money.âStructuring your loan this way will give you a lower interest rate.âIf you find yourself in a unique situation and you want to talk through it with me and my team, just give us a call or send us an email.

Each has its pros and cons, so I wanted to provide an overview of both.A one-time close uses one loan from the beginning to fund the construction and purchase of the home. The advantage of this option is that there is only one set of closing costs and there wonât be potential issues with qualifying after closing if you have any personal circumstances change. These changes would include things like job loss, for example. The downside to a one-time close loan product is that the interest rate is quite a bit higher.The alternative is to structure it with two separate loans, or a two-time close. This means you purchase the property and construct the home with construction financing, and when the home is complete, a lender will come in and refinance you to permanent financing. The downside here is that you will have two sets of closing costs. However, the advantage is that the interest rate will be quite a bit lower (assuming that rates hold steady while the home is constructed).

There are a number of different options you have based on what kind of product you have. The first big distinction to determine is if it is a home purchase or refinance.If it is a home refinance, your lender would have started the loan with an assumption of what the appraisal would be, and priced your loan accordingly. If the value happens to come in lower, it could put you into a higher risk loan. If youâre trying to do a cash-out loan, it could also prevent you from being able to take cash out.âLenders wonât lend more than the appraised value.âFor a purchase loan, itâs a little more different and complex. The sales price is set by the sales contract. The lender is only allowed to lend on either the sales price or the appraised value; whichever is lower. When you have a low appraisal come in as a buyer, there are three different ways to handle this:  Ask the seller to renegotiate the sales contract to bridge the gap.  Rebut the appraisal by providing the lender additional information for the appraiser to consider that they may have missed.  Accept the value as-is, and by doing so, cause your cash to close to increased.Thatâs kind of the big picture overview of what happens when you have a low appraisal.

        "content": "What all goes into the loan process?The loan process starts once a lender has a 1003 Form, also known as a loan application. With that, theyâll pull a credit report. From there, theyâre going to request the specific documentation from you in order to pre-approve you for your loan. As weâve previously covered, the most common documentation include tax returns, W2s, paycheck stubs, bank statements, and other things of that nature.âMkae sure that all documents get sent in timely fashion.âOnce youâre pre-approved, youâre free and clear to start shopping for your new home and hopefully place a property under contract. Once youâve placed a property under contract, make sure you forward that contract to your lender as soon as you can so they can update the federal disclosures to be sent to you. Weâre required to send you a loan estimate within three days of you identifying a property address to us.Once your lender has those disclosures electronically signed, theyâll be able to move your file forward into the underwriting phase. During the underwriting phase, the underwriter will review everything and issue a conditional loan approval. At that point, the processor will introduce themselves to you and send you a needs list to help clear the conditions of the loan. By âconditions,â we usually mean an updated bank statement or paycheck stub.Once final loan approval is granted, the file will be sent to a pre-closing quality control reviewer, and then onto the closing department where the closing package can be prepared for you. Once the closing disclosure gets sent to you, it has to be acknowledged by you three days prior to closing, or the closing would have to be pushed back. Once the lender has the closing disclosure, the next step is for you to show up at the official closing with a valid photo ID and any certified funds that are required for it.Stretch out your forearm beforehand, because you will be signing a lot of documents.

Do you know the difference between these letters?In Texas, we have the conditional qualification letter and the conditional approval letter. When most consumers contact us about getting a letter, they are referring to the conditional qualification letter. One of the quirky things about the state of Texas is that lenders are required to list the documents that they have and have not verified on that letter.When people contact us saying that they want a pre-qualification letter, most think that weâll help them with a loan application by pulling their credit and writing them a letter. While thatâs fine and we can do that, we must list on the document that nothing has been verified, and that can make it a very weak letter. In todayâs highly-competitive real estate market, you need as strong a letter as possible when making your offers.For that reason, we encourage our clients to take it a step further and provide us with the supporting documents so that we can issue a strong letter for them. Almost all of our clients take us up on that, and we can do it very quickly just as long as they provide us all the info in a timely manner.âIn todayâs market, you need as strong of a letter as possible.âAgain, there is that second type of letter in the state of Texas - the conditional approval letter. The great thing about this letter is that once youâve been pre-approved, we can push your file forward to an underwriter for full credit approval. Basically, all of the hard work of the loan is done up front, the underwriter signs off on everything, and, with the exception of getting an appraisal on the property, you are completely done with your mortgage. With all the hard work done up front, the time frame for being under contract is shortened, and the experience is just more enjoyable all around.If youâre looking to buy and looking for a lender, weâd be honored to serve you.

			<p>Wade joined Guardian Mortgage in January 2006 as a vice president of sales and branch manager at our
<br />Dallas, Texas location.
<br />
<br />Wade has a message for Guardianâs customers. Thereâs more to a mortgage than the close. Wade, like his Guardian counterparts, understands that a job well done is a job that lasts the duration of the home loan. Counsel, support and personal service are paramount to becoming a trusted mortgage advisor for Guardianâs clients.</p>
