        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "If youâre selling your home, there a few things you can do to help yourself get top dollar in todayâs market here in Virginia. When selling, pay attention to these factors:  Preparation before a photo shoot is absolutely essential. Our team provides a consultation with a professional stager to help you get insight on how to get your home ready for the camera. After all, the camera is the only eye we have to please. Many people donât want to pay for a stager or think theyâll need to buy new furniture, but remember, a stager will help you take advantage of things you already own. Theyâll help you decide how to place furniture and what to take out of a room to showcase your home to the fullest.  Pricing. Even though itâs a sellerâs market, pricing definitely matters, especially if you want multiple offers for your home. Focus your price on where it will sell and it will pull the trigger on a lot of interest in your property.  Drive exposure with all the buyers out there. Take advantage of all the tools in our toolkit like our âcoming soonâ listings. We market these properties to get a little advanced buzz before it even goes active on the market. Weâve been able to sell properties before they even went active on the MLS with this method. We also have a full-time marketing specialist who exposes your house to more than 300 websites. Itâs not just about Zillow and Realtor.com; we want to maximize the eyeballs on your house.  Make sure you work with a Realtor who can negotiate top dollar for your property. With more than 30 years in the business, Iâd be honored to show you what itâs all about and how our team can help you get the most for your home.If you have any questions or youâd like to learn more about how we can help you get the most for you home, give me a call or send me an email any time. Iâd love to help you!",

        "content": "If youâre looking to buy a home in the current market, you should be prepared to face a multiple offer situation. Today Iâll give you some great tips on how to make sure your offer is the one accepted and you end up in your dream home.Getting an offer accepted isnât always about the price of the house. There are other factors that go into winning a multiple offer situation.First, you need to consider the sellerâs time frame. Find out what their ideal time is to move out of the home and craft that into your offer along with the price. The more you play into the sellerâs needs, the better off you will be.The listing agent is also going to want to know that they are working with a seasoned agent who has a good reputation and a great lender who can get things done on time. Make sure you choose people who are well known and respected to represent you.If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. Iâm always happy to help.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "What is happening out there in the marketplace and how does it relate to you as a homebuyer?Right now, the Fed is committed to raising interest rates in 2017. Rates will go up anywhere from 0.5% to 0.75%. We can no longer keep interest rates at the historic lows that weâve seen the last couple of years.Did you know that for every 0.25% increase in interest rates, buyers lose $25,000 of buying power? Thatâs a lot of money. So, if rates go up by either 0.5% or 0.75% this year, that could affect your buying power by $50,000 to $75,000 in terms of the total mortgage amount.What does that mean for you? Ultimately, it could mean the difference between buying a single-family home and buying a townhouse. Interest rate increases can negatively impact your ability to buy a home.So, if you are a buyer in todayâs market, what are you waiting for? Now is the time to make a move so that you can take advantage of these historically low interest rates. I donât believe that we will ever see these kinds of rates again in our lifetimes.If you have any other questions about buying a home or about real estate in general, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Weâve been experiencing historically low interests rates, but thatâs going to change moving forward in 2017. The Federal Reserve has already announced that they will raise interest rates this year by 0.5% to 0.75%. For every quarter of a percent rise in interest rates, that decreases a buyerâs ability to buy a mortgage by $25,000. This means we could see buyers losing purchasing power by $50,000 to $75,000 in the upcoming year.For you as a seller, this means that as the year progresses and interest rates rise, youâll find buyers who have less ability to buy. For some people, it will make the difference between being able to afford a single-family home versus a townhouse.If youâve had any thoughts of selling, 2017 is the year to do it, and you should put your home on the market as soon as possible. Buyers want to take advantage of these interest rates, and because weâre also experiencing a depletion of inventory, they donât have much to choose from. That means thereâs a significant chance that your home will generate multiple offers, which almost always translates into more money in your pocket.If youâre interested in putting your home on the market or have any other questions, please donât hesitate to give me a call.

As an example, Iâd like to talk about our marketing specialist, Mike Hauptman.Mike has been our marketing specialist for the past two and a half years, and he is a marketing and internet guru. He manages our Facebook, Tumblr, Pinterest and blog accounts for our listings, and is fantastic at taking the information and the professional photography for all of our sellers and using it to provide top-notch marketing all over the world.As a matter of fact, our team has actually sold four homes online over the last 18 months, without buyers having even seen them in-person!Mike is also a Zillow virtuoso. This is important to us because Zillow has really become the national MLS, and Mike has managed our account beautifully. He even provides integrated marketing, like âcoming soonâ teasers for homes that havenât been listed yet.Perhaps most importantly, Mike has also been great at placing sellers at the top of national search sites, ensuring premiere placement everywhere exclusively for our clients.If you have any questions about what else a great marketing specialist can do get your home maximum exposure, or you have any other real estate-related questions, give me a call or send me an email.

This service helps the seller approve showings and know what days and times an agent might be showing your home. Thereâs also an online journal for feedback on your home compared to others in the market.You should also look for a team that uses an interfacing system that allows you to see what that team is doing at all times when it comes to necessary activities for generating a smooth transaction for you. In our case, my Listing manager, my Transaction manager, and I use an online service to give you a sense of what we do on a daily and weekly basis. You should work with a team that constantly gives you the chance to know whatâs going on with your transaction!Since itâs such a big transaction, the importance of great communication with your agent and their team canât be understated.

It may be time for you to start thinking about developing some equity of your own, and saving on your income taxes through a mortgage interest rate tax deduction.The second point I have for you is that you will either spend more and get less as time goes by, or if you choose to be a homeowner, you can take advantage of that equity and an appreciating market, which is a huge financial benefit over time.After 28 years in the business, we are always open and willing to chat about your specific situation.

However, this is not true, and the winter can actually be a great time to sell for some people.Here are three reasons why this is true:  Buyers are very serious in the winter.They often have to buy because of a job transfer or for tax purposes. When buyers are more motivated, you can expect a quicker sale and probably a better price for your home if they have to buy quickly.  Homes tend to look their best during the holidays.Our homes are usually decorated well during the holidays because weâre having friends and family over, and this will entice buyers. Whatâs better than having a buyer walk into a warm home with a fire lit and cookies baking in the oven? Theyâll feel right at home!  There isnât as much competition during the holidays.A lot of sellers think that itâs a bad time to sell a home, so they take it off the market. This means that your home has a better chance to stand out and sell quickly!The holidays really are a great time to sell a home. Itâs a little bit tougher to move, but you can capitalize on a market that not many people know about.If youâre thinking of selling in Loudoun County, please contact me soon.

We want to share some of what we learned today, and talk about how reverse mortgages can be beneficial in a transaction.A reverse mortgage is actually an FHA loan, complete with stock gaps and limits on the loan balance based on the appraisal, so itâs pretty hard to spend too much money on a reverse mortgage so that there is no equity left in the house at the time when the mortgage is ready to be paid off.Itâs a regular mortgage in the sense that the homeowner actually owns the property and the bank doesnât. It allows the homeowner the freedom to not make mortgage payments for any amount of time while they have the reverse mortgage in place.This can be a good tool for some of our seniors, to allow them to stay in their house longer. If the owner of the mortgage passes before the mortgage is paid off, the heirs to that property actually have a full year after the homeownerâs passing to prepare it for the market or keep it in the family through a refinance.If a reverse mortgage might be a help for you or somebody you know, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to get you in touch with our lender who has been helping us out recently with these reverse mortgages. We look forward to hearing from you!",

I put him in touch with a local senior loan mortgage expert, and he proved to be incredibly helpful. Not only did this expert have great ideas about how to help this older man, he also shared that every county has a program for seniors dealing with property taxes.In the example above, the client fit beautifully into the generous parameters of a great program. To qualify, you have to be 65 years or older, produce evidence of a certain income threshold, and have less than a certain threshold as far as assets are concerned. The great unfortunate nature of many seniorâs situations is they often donât have robust bank accounts when they reach those later years.Itâs a pretty simple process to apply to see if your loved one can apply to have the property tax burden removed! This could help many seniors hold onto their homes much longer. If you have questions about the process, or if you need real estate assistance of any kind, give me a call or shoot me an email. Iâm always ready and willing to help!",

        "content": "Weâre continually getting great questions from our friends and clients, and we love to answer them. Today, the question is, âWhy should I talk to a lender before buying a house?âFirst, you need to talk to a lender so you know your buying ability. The last thing you want to do is waste a bunch of time looking for homes in the wrong price range.Secondly, you want to be sure that youâre able to place an offer on the home you find. Donât wait until youâre ready to buy to get pre-approved. Have your finances in order, and be ready to submit a letter of pre-approval when making an offer so the seller knows youâre serious.Lastly, see a lender to make sure you are a strong buyer in a multiple offer situation. If you donât want to miss out on the home of your dreams, you need to work with a lender to ensure that doesnât happen!If you have any questions about real estate in our area, or if you need real estate assistance of any kind, donât hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to hear from you!",

Our clients have been asking us a lot of great questions lately, but one that keeps coming up is, âWhat are the essential elements to a smooth home sale?âIn my opinion, there are 3 elements involved in a great home sale:  Proper preparationWhen selling your home, you want to make sure you get the advice of a great local stager on how to properly prepare your home. You want things like improvements, decluttering, and cleaning to be done ahead of putting your home on the market. You also want to have a good plan in place for getting the home ready for the camera and the buyers.  Proper pricingMake sure you are pricing your home in accordance with the market. Get the advice of an agent on how to price competitively in your market.  Proper promotionYou want to make sure you are taking advantage of social media, and the web in general, to spread the word about your home. Getting your professional photos out to as many eyes as possible is the first step.If you have any questions for us at all, donât hesitate to reach out.

Lately, a question we have been hearing quite frequently from our clients is, âIf I already found the house I want, why do I even need a good real estate agent?âThatâs a fair question. Although you may not think of them right away, there are 3 reasons that come to my mind right away as to why you want a good real estate agent when buying.  You need accurate data about recently sold properties in order to submit a good offer.  We are expert negotiators and have a lot of experience and success helping buyers negotiate great deals.  We have a team of trusted contractors on our side. We can take care of anything from plumbing to electrical work and more.These are just a few of the reasons why it makes perfect sense to hire the best agent possible to help you buy a home.

        "content": "Lately, a lot of clients have been asking us, âWhat is the best time of year to put my home on the market in Northern Virginia?â Today we are going to answer that question, by giving you an overview of a typical year in our real estate market. It has peaks and valleys like any other market, and when you understand that, you can have great success buying and selling.So, if I sit down at my desk on January 1, and try to predict the year in advance, here is what I would come up with. The lowest points of the year are generally the month of August and mid-December through mid-January.By mid-January, we tend to get the early spring market, where people are trying to list their homes to get ahead of the true spring market. This generally works, as homes on the market a little earlier tend to sell a little quicker due to more eyes on the property.By mid-March,  the normal market kicks in. This lasts all the way through Independence Day weekend, which signals the start of the summer slowdown. By August, the market is pretty dead. People are on vacation, kids are getting ready for school, and thereâs a lot less activity.After Labor Day, the market tends to pick up and, usually a week or so after that, we will have a pretty good fall market through Thanksgiving and into mid-December, when we hit our winter slowdown once again.Be sure to remember to give yourself plenty of time to get your home ready for sale. Preparation is essential for a smooth sale and getting top dollar for your home.Thanks for taking the time to check out my blog today. If you have any questions, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me a quick email. I look forward to speaking with you!",

        "content": "Today we are excited to talk about getting your home ready for the market if you are a seller. Youâll want to do several things right out of the starting gate.Loudoun County, in Northern Virginia, is the fastest growing county in the nation. One of the first things a buyer in Loudoun County will do is visit the builders, who are the smartest sellers on the planet. They donât just build a beautiful home, but a home that has a decorator to design and furnish the home. Thatâs the competition your are working against as a seller.When you are preparing your home for sale, the main eye you have to please is the eye of the camera. Buyer activity has gone to the Internet, and people are looking at homes multiple times online before they ever decide to see it in person.To prepare your home for the camera, youâve got to declutter it. Keep in mind you are selling your space, not your stuff, and you want a buyer coming through your home imagining their stuff in your space.Next, youâll want to talk to our professional stager. We have a company that can come in and give you a full staging report, letting you know what you need to do in each room to get your home ready for sale.Another thing youâll want to do is try and gather the important documents from when you purchased the house, including a copy of the plat survey that was done on your home, and a copy of your title insurance policy.These are just a few of the tips we recommend you take advantage of when getting your home ready to sell. If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us a quick email. We canât wait to hear from you!",
