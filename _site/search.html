        "content": "One of the things most real estate investors ask when they come to us about financing is, “Can I put the property in some kind of entity, like an LLC, before or after closing?”Unfortunately, most residential lenders follow Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac underwriting and servicing guidelines. One of the things Fannie Mae has clarified as recently as November of 2014 is that no borrower can transfer part or all of the ownership interest of a property into an entity post-closing without violating the dual sales clause.So the answer to this question is, unfortunately, no.If you want to purchase a property in the name of an LLC or in an individual’s name and transfer it into an LLC, that is actually a commercial loan. That is not something that a traditional residential lender can assist with.“If you want to put the property in an LLC, you will need a commercial loan.”We do have an outlet that can help you with a commercial loan. We will just need to ask you some questions ahead of time to determine your real estate goals so that we can properly tailor this for you.If you know of anyone looking to add to their investment portfolio this year, introduce us to them. We are happy to chat with them about what the requirements are so that they are in the best possible position to make that offer on the investment property.As always, if you have any other questions, just give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to talking with you.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "A lot of our customers contact us with questions about owning a second home. The good news is that transactions for second homes are treated almost identically to transactions for primary residences.The one big difference is that a lot of lenders will look closely at the distance between your primary and secondary residence.“Lenders will pay a lot of attention to the distance between your potential second property and your primary residence.”Something like a vacation home, located far away from where you currently reside, will make sense. However, a secondary residence in the same, or near the same, neighborhood as your first home isn’t going to pass a sniff test.So, talk with your lender ahead of time to develop a roadmap for making a successful offer on your second home.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "FHA loan limits have recently increased. Due to its flexible approval guidelines, the FHA loan program is a great option for first-time buyers or those with little available for a down payment.Loan limits will vary by county, but in the DFW Metroplex, the single-unit limit has increased to $386,400. This limit also varies depending on the number of units in a property. For example, the loan limit is $494,650 for duplexes, $597,500 for triplexes, and $743,100 for quads.“The FHA loan program is a great option for first-time buyers or those with little available for a down payment.”As long as you occupy one of the units as a primary residence, you can structure a loan on a multi-unit property using the FHA program.This program is a great option if you or anyone you know is looking to buy a house in 2018.If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like help obtaining an FHA loan, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "As you’ve probably heard by now, the government has passed sweeping legislation to dramatically change our tax code. A lot of things are going to change.Before I get started, let me just remind you that if you need individualized tax advice, you should consult your tax advisor. However, I want to provide you with some helpful information about how the changes could affect your mortgage and other payments.The main driver in the changes is that the standard deduction has been increased to $12,000 for an individual and $24,000 for a couple. This is important because it will encourage more people to claim the standard deduction as opposed to itemizing those deductions. As it relates to real estate and real estate finance, there are three ways the new tax code may affect you. And, one important tax benefit that is staying put.1. Mortgage interest deduction. Previously, you could deduct the mortgage interest on a loan up to $1 million. That number has been lowered to $750,000. While that’s still a very large number, this change will undoubtedly affect some people at the upper end of the market.2. Equity indebtedness. If you’ve taken cash out of your property at some point in the past, there were complex rules about what can and can’t be deducted. Starting in 2018, none of the interest on the equity piece of your loan can be deducted. If this is something that might affect you, I recommend discussing it with your tax advisor.3. The property tax exemption. You’re only going to be allowed to deduct up to $10,000 on your property taxes. Although that might sound like a large number, especially in the DFW area, it’s not the largest property assessed value that affects you. Keep that in mind.“The capital gains exclusion is still in place.”The key benefit that is remaining from the previous tax policy is the capital gains exclusion, allowing you to deduct up to $250,000 in capital gains on the sale of a property if you’re single and $500,000 if you file jointly I know many real estate investors who have greatly benefited from the exclusion.If you have any concerns about the new tax bill and how it will affect you, it may be worth the time to consult with your tax advisor. If you plan to buy a home in 2018, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call. I am happy to help answer any questions you may have.",

If you go above the $424,100 threshold, that puts you into the jumbo loan category, and that typically comes with certain downsides such as tighter underwriting guidelines, higher credit minimums, typically higher interest rates, and others.“This is a big deal because it gives consumers more buying power.”Those downsides are why it’s important that if you’re able to structure it as a conforming loan, you do so, because it’s just more advantageous for the borrower.If you’re thinking of purchasing a property or meaning to refinance and you’re in the $500,000 to $600,000 price point range, please reach out to us.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Today’s topic is about why your lender matters in a competitive market.I talk to a lot of Realtors in my profession, and frankly, they tell me there are about four key things that make a difference in the likelihood of an offer getting accepted.1.) Local lenders. Listing agents routinely look for local lenders; they prefer not to work with large national banks or internet lenders. They want to be able to contact someone local if there’s an issue and someone who has local appraisers on their panel. Choose who you work with carefully.2.) Pre-approval letters. In the state of Texas, pre-approval letters are required to list what documents have and have not been verified, so if the letter that you’re looking at doesn’t have those items on there, I’d encourage you to ask your lender why, or find a different lender. Make sure the lender has actually looked at some documents.3.) Have the underwriter sign off. Have the lender take the process a step further and have the underwriter sign off on the pre-approval letter. Even though it takes a little bit more time for the lender, it’s a much more thorough way to go about it. It gives the listing agent certainty that you can actually close on the financing that you’re applying for because the underwriters actually sign off on it. As long as you don’t lose a job or blow your down payment money in Las Vegas, you’ll be able to close on the transaction.4.) Have your loan officer contact the listing agent to talk up your offer. Frankly, that type of call goes over very, very well with the listing agent. This can be the thing that pushes you over the edge in a multiple offer situation. I had a client just last week who was one of 22 offers on a property, and the seller took our offer because I called them—even though it was $8,000 less than the highest offer. We’re a local lender with a good reputation, and they knew we were communicative about having the underwrite on the file.Frankly, that type of call goes over very, very well with the listing agent.

I wanted to take just a minute to talk about flood insurance here in Texas and how it relates to your mortgage.When you take out a home loan, your lender is required to pull a flood certification to see if your property is in a flood zone. If you are, you’ll be required to take out a flood insurance policy. These can get quite pricey.You have to pay for them in full prior to closing, and you have to have them escrowed in your account regardless of whether you’re escrowed for taxes or insurance. It’s very important that if you are in a flood zone or looking at a home in a flood zone, you learn about it early on in the process so you can have time to make an educated decision on how to proceed.“Many of them don’t protect against water damage at all.”Being from New Orleans and having to go through Hurricane Katrina, I have deep sympathy for all of our friends in Houston and Florida. I’ve learned from first-hand experience that the biggest floods tend to happen in non-flood zones. Even if your home isn’t in one, I encourage you to at least have a conversation with your insurance professional about what exactly your policy covers.

        "content": "Most people associate an adjustable-rate mortgage, or ARM, with the market crash of 2008. In reality, ARMs were misrepresented to the public during that time and people have been slow to come back to them. However, they have a purpose. An ARM could be the perfect thing for you, depending on what your goals are as a homeowner.“There is some risk involved, but it can be a very useful tool.”If you’re going to be in a home for a set period of time, let’s say four or five years, it behooves you to look at an ARM mortgage because it could actually save you a lot of money. While ARMs are known for adjusted rates, they usually have a fixed period at the beginning of the loan. This means for a certain time, the interest rate is lower on that mortgage than it would have been on a traditional 15 or 30-year loan. After the “fixed period,” the rate will adjust up or down depending on what you agreed to on the front end. There are caps in place to protect you from large swings, however. That’s what happened to a lot of people during the recession.Those who benefit from ARMs have a defined holding period and know exactly how long they want to own a property. You can also benefit from an ARM by rapidly paying down your loan at the beginning of the term while the rate is low. By the time the rate adjusts, your payment will have lowered, even with a higher rate.An ARM definitely has a place in the lender’s toolbox, but there is some risk involved. If you have any questions for us about ARMs or any other type of loan, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.",

However, most people may not realize that the removal of mortgage insurance, regardless of loan type, is actually dictated by the federal government.If you take out an FHA loan, your ability to remove mortgage insurance is predicated on the down payment amount. If you put more than 10% down, you are only required to pay mortgage insurance for 11 years. If you put less than 10% down, then you have to pay mortgage insurance for the entire life of the loan. So, keep that in mind if you are considering an FHA.Conventional loans carry private mortgage insurance, or PMI. Most people think that once they get to 80% loan to value, the mortgage insurance falls off. That’s not exactly true. The rule states that if you pay mortgage insurance, it automatically falls off at 78% loan to value—but you can request to remove it at 80% LTV. Contact your loan servicer once you reach 80% and ask to get that PMI removed.“Appreciation in value adds a bit of a wrinkle to this process.”Appreciation in value does add another wrinkle to this process. A lot of customers say, “My home appreciated in value since I bought it. Now I have the 20% equity and would like to remove my mortgage insurance.”That is fine, but the rules for using appreciation as justification are different than the rules based on the original purchase price. You are ineligible to use appreciation as justification years zero through two of owning the home. Between the two and five-year mark, you need 25% equity for justification; after five years, that number goes back down to 20%.Your loan servicer will require an updated appraisal at that time to make sure that you have subsequent equity levels.If you have any other questions about removing mortgage insurance, just give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "You may not realize it, but we actually have some of the most conservative equity laws in the country down here in Texas. They limit the maximum loan-to-value of your financing to 80% of the home’s value. Regardless of the financing you are doing, the state requires an appraisal to be conducted to determine its value to make sure it doesn’t exceed the 80% threshold.There are a few different types of equity loans out there. Here’s a little bit of information about each.Equity lines of credit are variable and can be used for practically anything. Standalone second liens are typically taken out for home improvements. Cash-out refinances are when you refinance your entire loan balance in excess of what you want to borrow to get cash out of the property.“You can only have one equity loan at a time.”There are advantages and disadvantages to each, but one thing about these loans is universal in Texas. Whenever you take one out, there is a 12-month cooling off period until you can touch it. If you did a cash-out refinance and rates cratered immediately after, you are prevented from refinancing again until after the period has passed.Also, keep in mind that in Texas, you are only allowed one equity loan on a property at a time. If you did a cash-out refinance, for example, you are not allowed to take a home equity LOC out after the fact.If you have any questions for me or would like to discuss your specific scenario, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

You can refinance to remove one person from the loan or sell the house.Texas is a community property state. A refinance may not be necessary if you dictate in the divorce decree who will be obligated to make the payments. However, the downside is that the departing spouse’s credit is still tied to the home. If the occupying spouse misses a payment, it would still negatively affect the other’s credit. That’s why I recommend refinancing.“It’s important to know the plans for the home.”The timing will dictate whether an owelty lien is used. In Texas, if you’re trying to refinance to remove one spouse, many times you need to take cash out to pay them their share of the equity. Texas has limits for the maximum loan-to-value you can have on a cash-out refinance of 80%. Depending on what the home appraises at or the agreed payment, it may or may not be enough equity to take out. The alternative is the owelty lien, which gets put on the property for the agreed-upon amount and prevents the occupying spouse from refinancing or selling the property without guaranteeing payment to the departing spouse.It’s the most secure way to get equity out of the home. However, it needs to be agreed upon before the divorce is finalized. Sadly, I many people come to me after the divorce is already finalized, so this option is off the table.Selling the property releases both parties from the obligation of the mortgage, but they both still need to move somewhere.

There are three main types of mortgage insurance you need to be aware of.“Know the goals of your property before picking a mortgage insurance.”The most common type is borrower-paid monthly mortgage insurance. This is where the monthly amount gets added to the principal and interest portion of your payment. You would then make that payment each month until you get to a 78% loan-to-value ratio.The other type is single-premium financed mortgage insurance. This is where the lifetime costs of the mortgage insurance get financed into the loan amount. It keeps your interest rate the same, but it adds to the loan amount. This actually results in a lower monthly payment because you don’t have the interest rate at that higher amount each month.The last type is lender-paid mortgage insurance. This is where the lender pays the lifetime cost of the mortgage insurance in exchange for you agreeing to a higher interest rate. A higher interest rate has a negative connotation with most consumers, but the reality is that it results in the lowest possible monthly payment, and it’s even lower once you consider the after-tax mortgage interest deduction. This is a good way to structure your loan, but not if you’re going to keep the loan for a very long time.The benefit of the monthly mortgage insurance is that it can fall off once you get to the 78% loan-to-value ratio. If you finance it in as a lump sum into the loan amount or roll it into the interest rate, there’s nothing to fall off because it has already been factored in.The rules to remove monthly insurance are pretty complicated, and which structure makes the most sense for you is largely dependent on your goals for your property.My staff and I would be honored to help walk you through this, so if you have any more questions or know anyone looking to purchase a home in the next six months, please don’t hesitate to give us a call. we‘d love to speak with you!",

This means that instead of paying your mortgage once a month, you’d pay twice a month.“With this plan, you get the same effect as bi-weekly payments without the middle man and their fee.”The reality of working with these companies, though, is that you’ll pay them a month in advance. Then, you’ll pay every two weeks, and in turn, they will pay your lender once a month. This will continue until they’ve built up enough reserves in the escrow account they’ve set up for you to make that 13th payment a year.I advise my clients to take that monthly payment you’re paying to your lender each month, divide it by 12, and add that amount to what you pay every single month. This results in a 13th payment being made every year.

Out of all of those factors, the one that has the most bearing on a successful transaction is the lender’s ability to close on time.If you take out a loan, it’s very important to partner with a lender that will go through the due diligence steps up front to ensure that you’re fully pre-approved. After that, they should set the correct expectations for you so that when you shop for a home, you know how to properly negotiate for it so the transaction is a smooth one and you have a happy closing.Nationwide, about one-third of all home loans don’t close on time, according to the Campbell/Inside Mortgage Finance Housing Pulse Tracking Survey. FHA loans only close on time 59.2% of the time. Conventional loans (e.g., those that are backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) only close on time 63.6% of the time.

Why would a recast be more advantageous for you?A piggyback loan is when you take out a single loan for 80% of the home’s value and either 10% or 15% of the remainder to purchase the home. It’s usually either an 80/10 or 80/15/5 split.Structuring the loan this way usually makes sense when you’re very close to the $417,000 conforming loan limit. There are definitely better ways to structure this if possible, though. I say this because when you structure it with the first and second lien, the interest rate on that first lien is quite a bit higher than it would be otherwise.If the loan amounts cooperate, most of our clients actually structure this with a single loan, pay the private mortgage insurance, and then pay the loan down in either a lump sum payment as a result of the sale of another property, or with accelerated principal payments throughout the loan so that the mortgage insurance drops off.At that point, they can then contact us to recast the loan so it acts as a retroactive down payment. What happens, then, is you end up at the same place as if you structured the loan with the first and the second lien. The difference is by structuring it with a single loan with mortgage insurance and throwing in a recast there, you end up with a lower interest rate over the life of the loan, which ends up saving you quite a bit of money.“Structuring your loan this way will give you a lower interest rate.”If you find yourself in a unique situation and you want to talk through it with me and my team, just give us a call or send us an email.

The advantage of this option is that there is only one set of closing costs and there won’t be potential issues with qualifying after closing if you have any personal circumstances change. These changes would include things like job loss, for example. The downside to a one-time close loan product is that the interest rate is quite a bit higher.The alternative is to structure it with two separate loans, or a two-time close. This means you purchase the property and construct the home with construction financing, and when the home is complete, a lender will come in and refinance you to permanent financing. The downside here is that you will have two sets of closing costs. However, the advantage is that the interest rate will be quite a bit lower (assuming that rates hold steady while the home is constructed).

The longer you plan to be in the home, the less advantageous this financing is.A two-time close allows you to take out a construction loan to purchase the property and then refinance the loan into permanent financing once construction is complete. This option gives you a much lower interest rate, which is great. However, you will have to take care of two sets of closing costs. The other issue is that interest rates may change while the property is being constructed..“Each financing option has pros and cons.”Ultimately, there are pros and cons to each financing option.

        "content": "Many people have no idea what to do if an appraisal comes in low on a home they are trying to buy or refinance. There are a number of different options you have based on what kind of product you have. The first big distinction to determine is if it is a home purchase or refinance.If it is a home refinance, your lender would have started the loan with an assumption of what the appraisal would be, and priced your loan accordingly. If the value happens to come in lower, it could put you into a higher risk loan. If you’re trying to do a cash-out loan, it could also prevent you from being able to take cash out.“Lenders won’t lend more than the appraised value.”For a purchase loan, it’s a little more different and complex. The sales price is set by the sales contract. The lender is only allowed to lend on either the sales price or the appraised value; whichever is lower. When you have a low appraisal come in as a buyer, there are three different ways to handle this:  Ask the seller to renegotiate the sales contract to bridge the gap.  Rebut the appraisal by providing the lender additional information for the appraiser to consider that they may have missed.  Accept the value as-is, and by doing so, cause your cash to close to increased.That’s kind of the big picture overview of what happens when you have a low appraisal. No matter what happens, your loan officer will be contacting you to resolve these issues as soon as possible. If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "What all goes into the loan process?The loan process starts once a lender has a 1003 Form, also known as a loan application. With that, they’ll pull a credit report. From there, they’re going to request the specific documentation from you in order to pre-approve you for your loan. As we’ve previously covered, the most common documentation include tax returns, W2s, paycheck stubs, bank statements, and other things of that nature.“Mkae sure that all documents get sent in timely fashion.”Once you’re pre-approved, you’re free and clear to start shopping for your new home and hopefully place a property under contract. Once you’ve placed a property under contract, make sure you forward that contract to your lender as soon as you can so they can update the federal disclosures to be sent to you. We’re required to send you a loan estimate within three days of you identifying a property address to us.Once your lender has those disclosures electronically signed, they’ll be able to move your file forward into the underwriting phase. During the underwriting phase, the underwriter will review everything and issue a conditional loan approval. At that point, the processor will introduce themselves to you and send you a needs list to help clear the conditions of the loan. By “conditions,” we usually mean an updated bank statement or paycheck stub.Once final loan approval is granted, the file will be sent to a pre-closing quality control reviewer, and then onto the closing department where the closing package can be prepared for you. Once the closing disclosure gets sent to you, it has to be acknowledged by you three days prior to closing, or the closing would have to be pushed back. Once the lender has the closing disclosure, the next step is for you to show up at the official closing with a valid photo ID and any certified funds that are required for it.Stretch out your forearm beforehand, because you will be signing a lot of documents. After that, you can count yourself as a happy owner!If you have any more questions or need help with this process, just give us a call or send us an email. My team would be happy to help.",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "To get fully approved for a mortgage, you need to make sure all of your documents are in order. We’re going to talk about some of the documents you will definitely need in order to get approved, and when you should have them ready.The first one you’ll need is a 1003, by far the most important document lenders need to complete an approval. We use that to pull a credit report and from that point we can dig into all the specifics required. The high-level overview will need two years of tax returns, two years of W-2s in addition to the two most recent paycheck stubs covering a 30-day pay period. You will also need to provide the two most recent account statements for whatever bank accounts or asset accounts you have.The reality is that there are literally dozens of potential documents we could be requesting, but until we get the loan application and review your credit we won’t be able to tell you. When you’re ready to purchase a home, make sure you’re prepared for a pre-approval. The document request is just an initial request. There will likely be more requests throughout the process as we get closer to closing.“We want you to be able to make an offer on your dream home.”At the end of the day, our goal is to be in compliance with the government by showing that you have the ability to repay a loan and have been given no special treatment. We document your file so we can stay compliant and try to shrink any problems that may occur from the get go. We want you to be able to make an offer on your dream home when it comes along, so that’s why a pre-approval is so important.If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out. Give us a call or send us an email, we would love to hear from you.",

        "title": "The Difference Between Pre-Qualification &amp; Pre-Approval",
        "author": "Kourtney Brown",
        "category": "",
        "content": "You may have heard real estate professionals tell you that you need a pre-approval letter or a pre-qualification letter to buy a home. Do you know the difference between these letters?In Texas, we have the conditional qualification letter and the conditional approval letter. When most consumers contact us about getting a letter, they are referring to the conditional qualification letter. One of the quirky things about the state of Texas is that lenders are required to list the documents that they have and have not verified on that letter.When people contact us saying that they want a pre-qualification letter, most think that we’ll help them with a loan application by pulling their credit and writing them a letter. While that’s fine and we can do that, we must list on the document that nothing has been verified, and that can make it a very weak letter. In today’s highly-competitive real estate market, you need as strong a letter as possible when making your offers.For that reason, we encourage our clients to take it a step further and provide us with the supporting documents so that we can issue a strong letter for them. Almost all of our clients take us up on that, and we can do it very quickly just as long as they provide us all the info in a timely manner.“In today’s market, you need as strong of a letter as possible.”Again, there is that second type of letter in the state of Texas - the conditional approval letter. The great thing about this letter is that once you’ve been pre-approved, we can push your file forward to an underwriter for full credit approval. Basically, all of the hard work of the loan is done up front, the underwriter signs off on everything, and, with the exception of getting an appraisal on the property, you are completely done with your mortgage. With all the hard work done up front, the time frame for being under contract is shortened, and the experience is just more enjoyable all around.If you’re looking to buy and looking for a lender, we’d be honored to serve you. Send us an email or give us a call and our team will get working with you right away.",
