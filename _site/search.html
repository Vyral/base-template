        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Whether you&rsquo;re buying, selling, downsizing, or just doing some spring cleaning, there are a few ways you can get rid of your extra stuff.&nbsp;What do you do with all that stuff?You might be asking yourself this question if youâre a seller and youâre packing your things in anticipation of moving, youâre getting ready to close on a home and have thing to pack as well, youâre downsizing or helping someone downsize and they have a lot of personal items, or youâre just doing some spring cleaning.I myself recently experienced this type of situation when I had to help my wifeâs parents downsize out of their previous home. There are a few options to consider, and each one has its own share of pros and cons.First, you can simply pack everything up. This involves getting a lot of boxes, and I recommend you buy boxes that are all uniform in size. This will make them easier to stack and easier to handle. There are some great online resources for gathering boxes, including U-haul and Craigslist.You can alsoÂ bring in your own dumpster. This might sound a little rash, but if youâre downsizing and collecting things that have accumulated over many years, a lot of those things will probably end up in a dumpster. Many dumpster services offer and deliver dumpsters that come in different sizes. The cost difference between a large and a small dumpster isnât great, so itâs better to have a little extra room available just in case.Next, you can try Craigslist to post your items on there for free or advertise them and sell them for a fee. This should only be used for just a few items, though. You donât want to spend a lot of time posting items to this site.There are also charities that will pick your stuff up. The catch here, though, is they wonât accept anything and everything, so you may have to figure out how to dispose of anything thatâs not wanted.âThese options will help you be economical in getting rid of your extra stuff.âDoing an auction is an option you can use for furniture and other things of that nature. In this case, an auction house will come and tell you what they can take and what will actually sell. The downside is that, again, some personal items will get left behind that youâll have to figure out what to do with.A garage sale is another thing you can do. Theyâre a little bit long and tedious though, and when itâs done you typically wonât be able to find a charity that will accept whatâs left over.Lastly, you can have an estate service come in and conduct an estate sale on the property and either sell or dispose of everything in it. Gone4GoodÂ is a service that does this that we highly recommend. Theyâll literally come to your house and clean out everything. Theyâll dispose of anything that has little or no value and sell anything that does have value at their store. They sell larger items on a commission basis. Their fee is negotiable based on how big your home is, how many items they take, and a few other factors.Here are some links related to the options and services listed above that you might find useful:  http://gardnerauction.com/  https://kalispell.salvationarmy.org/  https://www.uhaul.com/Locations/Truck-Rentals-near-Kalispell-MT-59901/842071/  http://www.evergreengarbage.com/services.aspxIf you have any more questions about what to do with your extra stuff, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd be happy to help you.",

        "content": "With a lot of seasonal buyers, dealing with the mail in our market can get tricky. Here&rsquo;s a tip to help.&nbsp;We have a lot of seasonal buyers in our market. With so many people constantly coming and leaving, Iâm constantly getting questions about mail delivery.

Here&rsquo;s what you should know.&nbsp;Are earthquakes in Montana something to be worried about?Having been born and raised here in Montana, Iâve felt a few earthquakes every now and then, but nothing severe. At most, you might experience one that rattles something off a shelf in a grocery store.In fact, I was sitting at home the other day when I felt a loud thud. I thought it was snow falling off a tree and onto our deck, but there was no snow.Sure enough, it had been an earthquake.âDeadly earthquakes arenât impossible in Montana, but are very unlikely.âA belt of seismicity (seismic or earthquake activity) actually runs through the western portion of Montana, called the Intermountain Seismic Belt. It extends into Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, and southern Nevada.There is a portion of the Belt called the Centennial Tectonic Belt that has eight active faults which have produced a few major earthquakes in history,Â although itâs been 40 years since an earthquake produced by this region has been destructive.So in general, no, you donât have much to fear from earthquakes in Montana.For any other questions about real estate, feel free to reach out to me.

        "title": "Should a Seller Do a Home Inspection?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Should a seller do a home inspection when they list? This question crops up quite a bit from sellers.Overall, Iâd say the answer was yes, unless itâs brand new or thereâs some other reason why defects wouldnât crop up. There are three reasons why we encourage people to do inspections:  To save money. It seems counterintuitive to spend money on an inspection in order to save money. However, sometimes the inspection comes through and all of the sudden youâre pushing up against closing dates or some other plans, and things still need to be done. Those fixes are done in a hurry, or a seller ends up crediting money to a buyer to get them done. If you do it ahead of time, it shows that youâre proactive about taking care of a home that youâre aware of the condition of the home.  It helps you close faster because a lot of the time, an appraisal wonât even get ordered for financing until after the home inspection is completed. If you can make the inspection period short, it will help shorten the time span between you and the close, as well as take away the contingency sooner.  It can save a sale. Sometimes people see certain issues on an inspection and run for the hills. Having the inspection done in time to get those problems fixed can sometimes be the difference between a sale and a huge disappointment.âEven if you donât do the inspection, it can help to give your sellerâs disclosure statement.âEven if you donât do the inspection, it can help to give your sellerâs disclosure statement. That way, whatever issues youâve discovered over time are made known during the sales negotiation, not afterward, which would open up the opportunity for renegotiation.Thank you for the great questionâI hope this answer was helpful.

Today, Iâve got some information you need to know before relying on this website.Many people are curious about the true credibility of Zillowâs Zestimate feature.First, the Zestimate relies only on data because it is computer-generated. Nothing else can be taken into account. This becomes even more of an issue because Montana is a non-disclosure state, meaning that real estate transactions are not public information and cannot be pulled up through databases.The Zestimate also has the disadvantage of there being no personal viewing of the property. The Zestimate is based strictly off of numbers.It also isnât bankable. You canât walk into a bank or lender with a Zestimate and expect it to count as an appraisal. In order to move forward, you will need a real appraisal.A major reason for this is that Zestimates can be very inaccurate. The CEO of Zillow himself sold his home for $750,000 below his Zestimate, which was almost 50% of the sales price.You can see for yourself how reliable Zillow is based on some of the information included here.âThe best way to value your property is to work with an agent who is experienced in your area and with your type of property.âUltimately, the best way to value your property is to work with an agent who is experienced in your area and with your type of property.

        "content": "The off-season isnât a bad time to sell your home. In fact, a good percentage of the sales in our market take place during this time.Every year around this time, people who have their homes on the market ask me, âShould I take it off the market during the off-season or should I leave it on the market and continue trying to sell it?â We did a little research to help make the decision a little easier for you if youâre going through a similar situation.If you were to leave your home on the market during the fall season, there are a few reasons why you stand to benefit greatly. One is the fact that the buyers out there during this time of year are serious. They arenât in town to golf, swim, or fish. They are here to look at real estate and most of them are intent on buying.âThere are still plenty of buyers on the market.âAnother advantage for sellers around this time of year is that they have much less competition. About 30% of properties are taken off the market during this time of year. With plenty of buyers still on the market, this is more good news for sellers.How do the numbers differ in the off-season (October 1 to April 31) compare to the numbers during the marketâs peak (May 1 to September 30)? We looked back over the last five years, and the answer is not much. In the last five years, 53% of residential home sales and 59% of vacant home sales have come during those peak months. Meanwhile, the off-season has seen 48% of residential sales and 41% of vacant home sales in the last five years.Thereâs still an awful lot of opportunity in this market during the off-season, as you can see.

        "content": "What is happening in the Waterfront real estate market? Iâve got the latest numbers from the third quarter to share with you today.How is the Waterfront real estate market doing? I have the latest numbers from the third quarter to share with you today.First, letâs look at Flathead Lake.There are 118 homes active on the market. 61 of them are over $1 million. There are six pending sales, three of which are over $1 million. There have been 36 sales so far this year, which is just one short of the 37 sales this time last year. Five of those sales have been over $1 million this year, while eight sales were over $1 million last year.In other words, that $1 million and up market segment is struggling a bit this year. Iâll explore why that is in-depth in an upcoming video.Meanwhile, Flathead Lakeâs median sales price is $640,000 this year, which is down a little from $700,000 last year. Thatâs not a huge drop, so we are in a pretty steady market there.As for vacant land in Flathead, there are 48 lots for sale, three pending, and 14 closed so far this year. Land sales are very strong right now. In fact, the number of closed sales went up 230% from six land sales last year. This may be because there are fewer homes for sale under $1 million in this area, and buying land at an affordable price is a great way to start owning in Flathead Lake.Waterfront pricing in Flathead ranges from $1,500 a foot to $6,500 a foot, where the property had 60 feet of waterfront. The average is probably closer to $3,500 or $4,000 per foot.Next up is Swan Lake.Swan Lake has 11 homes for sale and two pending sales. Nine of the listings are over $1 million and two of them are priced under $1 million. Of the six closed sales this year, three were under $475,000 and three were over $880,000. Basically, there was a $400,000 gap where nothing was happening. There were only five sales last year, so closed sales stayed about the same.As for vacant land, there are five properties for sale, and all but one are over $375,000. There is one pending sale and only one sale so far this year. There were only two sales last year, and not a lot of vacant lot sales over the last couple years. The three sales weâve had were all under $300,000, so people are out shopping for affordable lake lots. Other price points are just struggling.Now letâs see whatâs happening in Echo/Blaine.There are 15 active listings now and no pending sales on either lake. There were two sales this year and three sales last year, so the market has been pretty steady.There are eight vacant lots for sale and one pending. The pending sale is over $1 million, so that just proves that you never know when lightning is going to strike. So far this year, there havenât been any closings on Blaine or Echo.Next, letâs check on the lakes west of Kalispell: Ashley, Bitterroot, and McGregor.There are 16 properties for sale and seven pending sales. So far this year, 10 sales have closed. That is a 50% jump from the five sales these three lakes saw last year, which is interesting because inventory is down.There are 20 vacant lots and one pending sale. The five vacant land sales that have closed were all on Ashley Lake. In 2016, there were only four closing sales, two on Ashley and two on Bitterroot. McGregor hasnât seen any land sales in the last couple years and over half of the available lots are on McGregor, which may mean itâs the place to look right now.Finally, letâs see whatâs happening with Flathead condos.There are 42 condos on the market right now, and two pending sales. So far this year, there have been 20 closed sales. Last year, there were 38. The median sales price last year was $305,000; this year, itâs $370,000. The interesting thing in this market is that we saw a 20% increase in the median sales price and a 20% decrease in sales at the same time.If you would like more details on any of these specific areas, please give me a call or send me an email.

It just wonât generate the kind of income youâre looking for.Given that our market is seasonal, people are coming and going at different times. Because of this, youâre likely to end up with your property staying empty for a period of time during the month. This inconsistency wonât do great things for your bottom line.You also need to take into consideration the rules and regulations of the county and homeowners associations that your property is governed by. In our area, Flathead and Lake Counties are putting or have already put regulations into place for short-term rentals, so you need to be aware of those to avoid any legal troubles later on.Then, there is the question of management. Management of your property can be done long distance or you can hire a local property manager with experience in short-term rentals that can take care of the property for you. Be aware of the costs associated with that as well.If you do use the property yourself for a portion of the year, then there are some tax limitations that you need to be aware of. There is a certain period of time that you can stay at the property and still consider it an investment rental property.Finally, you need to have an exit strategy.

        "content": "How are things looking in our waterfront market as we reach the mid-year point?Things got off to a slow start with a snowy, rainy spring, but our market is starting to pick up, so itâs likely that our third quarter report will be substantially different.âThings got off to a slow start, but our market is starting to pick up.âIn the meantime, there have been 48 total vacant land and residential sales on the waterfront, which is down three from the 51 we saw at this time last year. We also currently have 17 pending sales, so thereâs a good number out there waiting to close.At the end of last year, the big story was the number of waterfront condominiums that had sold on Flathead Lake. This year, Flathead Lake has seen eight condominiums sell, which is down from the 12 we saw at this point last year. There are five pending sales in this category, however, so weâre getting pretty close to catching up. Right now, there are 47 condominiums actively for sale.Staying in Flathead Lake, 21 homes have sold this year, which is down slightly from the 27 that sold last year. The median home price, however, rose from $560,000 to $628,000. Two of those 21 homes sold for more than $1 million. Last year, three homes had sold at this point for more than $1 million, so both years started out rather slowly in that price range. There are five pending sales, and all are priced under $775,000.If we look at the current inventory of 115 homes for sale on Flathead Lake, 58 of those are priced for more than $1 million. If youâre a buyer or seller in this price range, you can expect to see some shifting happening soon.On the vacant land side, there have been five sales, which is up slightly from the four that sold last year. There are no current pending sales in this category, and there are 48 active vacant land lots for sale. This will be an interesting area to watch as the season develops.Moving over to Swan Lake, there have been two residential sales so far this year, which is identical to the two that sold at this point last year. There is currently one pending sale and 13 active homes for sale. The median price for these residential homes is $999,000.On the vacant land side, there have been no sales so far this year. Last year, there were two. However, there is one sale pending and 11 active vacants on the market, of which the median price is $395,000.On Echo Lake and Lake Blaine, there have been no vacant land or residential sales, and last year there werenât any sales in either of these two categories. There are two pending residential salesâone on Echo Lake and one on Lake Blaine. There are 15 residential homes active on the market and 11 vacant lots for sale. The median price is $1 million for residential homes and $500,000 for vacant lands. There are also a couple cabin properties for sale on Deer Island inside Echo Lake.Heading over to the âWest LakesââAshley Lake, Bitterroot Lake, and McGregor Lakeâthere have been seven residential sales so far this year: two on Mcgregor, three on Bitterroot, and two on Ashley. Last year, there were two total residential sales encompassing this area, so this year has seen quite an uptick. There are two pending sales in the West Lakesâone on Ashley and one on Bitterroot. There are also 23 active homes for sale with a median price of $710,000.On the vacant land side, there have been three sales on Ashley Lake so far this year. Last year, there was one on Ashley and one on Bitterroot. There is currently one pending sale on Ashley and 31 active vacants for sale at a median price of $710,000.If you have any questions about these statistics or some of the market trends weâre seeing, donât hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you, and I hope you have a good rest of the summer.",

        "content": "Iâve fielded a lot of questions lately from people selling their home wondering what kind of things they should do to their home prior to listing it on the market. Should you remodel the bathroom? Rebuild the deck? Update the kitchen? Replace all the carpet?Over the years, my response has always been to do small things that add nice touches. Report after report has shown that larger upgrades and remodels never seem to get a dollar-for-dollar return. For example, if you spent $10,000 remodeling your kitchen the research shows youâre likely to only get $7,500 back in added value to your home.Some of the best things to consider are those that make the home more saleable rather than trying to create value. This includes things like a fresh coat of paint on your front door or updating a light fixture here and there, which can be done relatively inexpensively. Leave the rest for the new homeowners because their preference for the carpet or the countertops will almost certainly be different than yours.âSome of the best things to consider are those that make the home more saleable rather than trying to create value.âYou can see a more complete list of the research results about smart home upgrades here.If you have any questions about updating your home for the market or youâre thinking about making a move, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "IRS FIRPTA informationMontana FIRPTA facilitatorBlog about FIRPTA issuesAre you a foreign investor getting ready to sell an investment property? If so, there are a few things you should know about how the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act affects you.The Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act (FIRPTA) spells out what needs to be done at closing as far as withholding goes. With the exchange rate as it is, itâs quite favorable for foreign investors (Canadians especially) to sell and realize a profit.âFIRPTA spells out what needs to be done at closing as far as withholding goes.âRemember, there is a 10% to 15% withholding right at closing, depending on the type of investment. For example, residential properties that havenât been used will differ from vacant land or residential properties that havenât been used personally.These stipulations can be somewhat confusing, but the IRS has authorized administrators to help foreign investors in this situation with things like the paperwork, holding the money, and filing the returns so the process is not as daunting.Itâs also important to note that during the closing phase of the selling process if what you owe on the property and what it sells for is less than 10% or 15%, you may have to bring money to closing to satisfy that withholding requirement by the IRS.If you would like to get in contact with an expert on this subject or you would like more information,Â click here.Â You can also simply Google âFIRPTAâ and it will answer a lot of your questions.If you have any more questions about this topic, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Many of our clients ask, âWhat is the market like?â Today, Iâd like to share some information that recently came in for the entire state of Montana. Weâll compare the the market from 2015 and 2016 and explore why the numbers are what they are.Letâs start with Billings. From 2015 to 2016, the number of sales dropped by 7%. Thatâs probably because of the oil patch slowing down. The good news is that the sales price hasnât changed. So, although the market has some strength, there are fewer transactions.Livingston saw no changes in the number of transactions or in sales price, so that market has held steady for the last two years.Now, Bozeman is the hotbed as far as market activity goes. They have a good number of transactions and the average sales price is $400,000, which is the highest in the state!Great Falls saw no increase in the number of transactions or the average sales price. Helena didnât have any changes in the number of transactions, but they did see a 9% increase in the average sales price. Why? All of the bank repossessions are gone and entry-level housing has been bought up. New construction has not replaced that inventory yet, so there is more demand in Helena than there is supply.Missoula held steady from 2015 to 2016, with the same number of home sales and the same average sales price. On the other hand, Flathead Valleyâs sales went down 10% in 2016. However, the average sales price did go up 4%.Sometimes, when we get out of area customers that are in strong markets, like Chicago, Denver, and Seattle, they are coming from a much more competitive market. Those markets have larger population bases that can fuel supply and demand. It can be difficult for those customers to come to Montana and transition out of a market where people are fighting for homes with multiple offers over asking price.âMontana has a lower population base to drive the market.âMontana has a lower population base and a limited economic base that does not fuel the market in the same way, so we really depend on those outside resources to come in. Lately, those outside resources have been lagging a bit. Weâll see what will happen in 2017.If you have any other questions about our current market or if you would like to learn more about other real estate topics, just give me a call or send me an email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Today Iâd like to talk about a common winter problem homeowners in our area have to face from time to time: ice dams.An ice dam occurs when youâve got a lot of snow on your roof and your attic is just warm enough to melt some snow, causing it to run down the roof until it gets to the colder parts and freezes. That water backs up the shingles and will eventually start coming in underneath through the roof.The vent on our roof is snowed over, so the heat isnât escaping out the top. One of the ways to prevent that is installing heat tape in the summer so itâs ready for the winter. Shoveling the roof off is also an option, but it is dangerous. A roofing company would be able to do it for you without damaging the roof. Also, if you google âroof rakeâ or âroof snow rake,â there are a lot of products out there that will help get the snow off your roof.âRoofing companies arenât as busy this time a year, so they could safely shovel your roof off for you.âItâs not too late to get that taken care of, and youâll want to make sure another snow storm doesnât add to the problem.If you have any further questions about this topic or if you have any other real estate questions, feel free to shoot me a text, give me a call, or send me an email.
