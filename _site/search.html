        "content": "How much of a difference can listing videos make? A lot.Can videos really help sell your home? The short answer is yes, and we have the statistics to back that up. In fact, 85% of clients want an agent who uses video tools as part of their marketing package. Whatâs more, homes presented with a video tend to receive 403% more attention.But making a real estate video isnât as easy as using your cellphone cameraâa high-quality video requires specialized equipment. Weâve invested in a very expensive camera that will allow the consumer to virtually walk through the home and look around almost as though they were there in person. To make a really effective real estate video, youâll also need drone footage. It adds a wow factor to the presentation, showing the home itself and the surrounding areas.With the pandemic changing peopleâs habits so drastically, this kind of technology has really helped keep home sales moving along. Itâs the next best thing to actually viewing a home in person.âNot all platforms can fully capture the richness that listing videos can create.âApart from high-quality technology, youâll also need a high-quality editing and production team to help put the video together. This might sound expensive, but at Colemere Realty, weâve tailored the process down to capture listings of any price range to help them sell for more money in a shorter amount of time.However, you canât have all this great equipment and editing technology without having the right platform to share the videos on. Not all platforms can fully capture the richness that listing videos can create; Zillow, for example, has specific requirements in terms of video resolution that donât really work for the process. There are many options out there, so working with an experienced real estate marketer is key to helping you find the right ones so that you can get your listing in front of as many potential buyers as possible.If you have any questions about todayâs topic or anything to do with real estate, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

        "content": "Here are the two statistics you need to know before entering the market.If youâve been sitting on the fence, now is the time to make a move in the real estate market. There are two statistics, in particular, that you need to understand before making any real estate decision that will also prove why itâs such a great time to buy or sell right now.Our favorite stat in real estate is the absorption rate. When we discuss inventory, we talk about it in terms of time. When homes sell, theyâre taken out of the inventory count, and this affects the number of houses for sale and how much time it would take to sell them. A balanced market has four to six monthsâ worth of inventory, meaning that if no other properties came onto the market, it would take four to six months to sell them all.Currently, the Salt Lake City market has only two weeks of inventoryâwell below that equilibrium of four to six monthsâ worth. If all listing activity ceased today, there would be no more homes to purchase after just two weeks. Weâve never seen inventory this low. Properties are selling very, very quickly.The second stat to know is the daily snapshot. This shows us a comparison of real estate activity today versus the same day last year. The numbers included in the snapshot are active listings, pending listings, properties under contract, and the number of properties sold.âCurrently, the Salt Lake City market has only two weeks of inventory.âFor example, there are a little over 1,200 active listings on the market right now, while that number was over 2,400 at the same time last year. Inventory has decreased by 50% in a year. Interestingly, the number of homes under contract has increased by 37%, which means demand has risen. This is the perfect storm, especially for sellers.This is why we love statsâthey equip us as real estate professionals to help you position your offer well and succeed in this hyper-competitive market. Weâre seeing multiple offers on every house, sometimes more than 10! If youâre well-positioned, you get the best shot of winning the property you want.Some would think that in this type of market a seller can price their home however they like, or just sell it themselves. However, buyers use professional real estate agents, so sellers who overprice will end up selling for less. Use a professional agent as a seller to help you maximize the value of your property and avoid mistakes, such as simply taking the highest-priced offer that may not be supported by an appraisal. An agent can help you make the best decisions.We would love to go to work for you. If youâre sitting on the fence and unsure what to do, reach out to us via phone or email. Weâll show you how weâll add more value to your transaction and reach or exceed your real estate goals. We look forward to hearing from you.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "These five tips will help you sell your home during the holidays.If youâre looking to sell your home during the holidays, which is actually a viable time to list (despite all the misconceptions to the contrary), here are five tips to help you find success:1. Tastefully decorate your home for the holidays. What better time to accentuate the emotional appeal of your home to potential buyers than the holidays?2. Deep clean before you decorate. Make sure that every nook and cranny is white-glove clean.3. Keep the home warm. Donât turn down the heat; in fact, turn it up a little bit. Turn on all your lights, and if you have a fireplace, light it or turn it on to help bring in some emotion. Another good idea is to light some holiday-scented candles to keep your home smelling fresh and cozy.4. Price your house properly. Traditionally, real estate moves a bit slower during the holidays, so pricing your home correctly is critical.5. Be patient during the process. Showings may come at inconvenient times, especially during the holidays, when youâll likely have your own plans to contend with. Just try to be patient with the process. If the home doesnât sell during the holiday season, itâll sell eventually.âLight some holiday-scented candles to keep your home smelling fresh.âIf you have further questions about real estate, donât hesitate to reach out to your Colemere Realty specialists.

        "title": "Which 7 Mistakes Will Hurt Your Home Sale?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Sellers: Be proactive and avoid these huge home seller mistakes!If you want to sell quickly and for top dollar, there are seven critical mistakes you must avoid:1. Picking the wrong agent. Pick someone whoâs experienced and has sold a lot of properties. If you need heart surgery, youâll probably want to pick a heart surgeon whoâs performed a lot of surgeries, right? Your agent needs to have their finger on the pulse of your specific market and offer a solid, customized marketing plan for your home. Make sure your agent actually walks through your home; believe it or not, some agents wonât even do this, and it should be a huge red flag for you.2. Overpricing your property. Even though itâs a sellerâs market, itâs all too possible to price yourself out of the market. Consumers are well-educated these days and can find out everything they need to know onlineâincluding the price at which a given property should be listed. Todayâs homebuyers wonât even bother seeing your home in person if they believe it to be overpriced, and remember: The longer your property sits on the market, the staler it becomes. If you do get an offer on your overpriced listing, appraisal problems will more than likely come back to bite you.3. Only considering the highest priced offer. Thereâs more to an offer than just price, so youâll need the help of your agent to interpret the overall strength of each offer you receive. Obsessing over price alone will cause you to neglect other key elements, like the buyerâs financing (e.g., earnest money, down payment, lender credibility).Is money your only priority? Perhaps youâre like the many other sellers weâve worked with who needed time to find their next property and move. If so, the strongest offer may actually be one where the buyer agrees to an ample rent-back period and throws in two additional weeks rent-free. Thatâs exactly the offer that one of our sellers recently accepted, and it worked out well.âBuyers canât make an offer on a home they canât see.â4. Not preparing your home for the market. We understand the temptation to leave things as they areâwe are in a hot sellerâs market, right? Yes, there will be a lot of buyers walking through your home, but theyâll also be seeing a ton of different homes. Yours needs to stand out from the crowd. In a previous video, we explored all of the steps for getting your home market-ready and offered advice on how to prioritize repairs; we advise you to go back and check it out!5. Not allowing showings. Â Letâs say you go on the market on a Thursday but decline showings that following Saturday. Thatâs a colossal mistake! Those weekend showings are critical because thatâs when most buyers are off work and viewing properties with their agents. Buyers canât make an offer on a home they canât see. Yes, it will be inconvenient and frustrating at times, but be proactive and designate a spot where you can go at a momentâs notice should a buyer request a showing.6. Getting too emotional. Stressed and tired sellers are more likely to decline showings, which is never in their interest. Sometimes, buyers love to come in with their guns blazing and tell you everything they think is wrong with your house to get a better deal on it. Itâs easy to get offended by that, but let cooler heads prevail; the better offer may come from a buyer who is quite particular. Try to remember that, at the end of the day, your home sale is just a business transactionâthe calmer and more focused you are, the better your outcome will be. Listen to the advice of your agent because they are not nearly as emotionally involved as you are.7. Not decluttering. Youâre moving anyway, so why not begin boxing up your belongings now? A clutter-free home helps buyers to better envision themselves living in that space. In a cluttered home, all buyers see is your stuff. Your agent has seen countless homes, and they will be a fresh pair of eyes for yours; listen to their feedback.If you have further questions on how to sell your home quickly and for top dollar, or want more personalized solutions for your selling situation, donât hesitate to reach out to us via phone or email.

        "title": "How Do I Prepare My Home for the Market?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are tips to help sellers prime for a swift and profitable home sale.What goes into preparing a home for the market? First things first, you need to create a home selling plan with an emphasis on properly staging your house. Staging simply refers to the work that goes into transforming your home as you know it (comfortable, highly personalized, reflective of your specific lifestyle) into a property thatâs show-ready (depersonalized, clutter-free, minimally furnished). Itâs all about removing unnecessary items, finding the most aesthetically pleasing arrangement for furnishings, and maximizing your homeâs space.Statistics have shown that a staged home will sell faster and for more money than its unstaged competition. If you donât have a professional stager on speed dial, reach out to us and weâd be glad to help you with that.You should also start decluttering your home as soon as possible. Whether youâve been in the home for three, five, or 30 years, youâve likely accumulated stuff that you donât need or seldom use. Pack up seasonal items, donate usable stuff you no longer need, and throw away junk. Again, the goal is to make your home look as clean and open as possible.Perhaps whatâs even more pressing than clearing the inside of your home is updating its curb appeal. The exterior of the home is obviously what buyers will see first, and if that first impression doesnât reel them in, your home selling journey will be a rough one. Make sure your lawn is mowed, the flower beds are weeded (and thereâs actually flowers in there), and the shrubbery is trimmed.âIf you can repair something in the home yourself before you list it, always do so.âAfter youâve cleaned your homeâs siding and improved your landscaping, head back inside, roll up your sleeves, and do a deep clean of every room. This would include getting the carpets cleaned, wiping down the baseboards, tackling dust in every nook and cranny, clearing out the filter vents, and addressing any small stains or spots on walls. Make sure you also clean out the grout between your tiles, too! If your carpet is in pretty rough shape, either have it professionally cleaned or replace it altogether.Noticing way too many little stains on the walls? The best way to make them vanish is to add a fresh coat of paint! Painting is something you should be doing anyway if your walls arenât already neutrally colored (e.g., whites, off-whites, beiges, grays, etc.).Lastly, itâs time to finally tackle that ever-growing to-do list that we all keep as homeownersâfixes or replacements around the house weâve been meaning to do. If you can repair something in the home yourself before you list it, always do so; it will save you some headaches down the road when your property undergoes an inspection.Hopefully, these tips provided a good roadmap for you to get started on your home selling journey.

        "content": "Writing a buyer &ldquo;love letter&rdquo; will help get your offer accepted.When submitting an offer on a home, a great way to get an edge over any competition is to write a buyer âlove letter.â There are a few reasons why.First, it allows you to thank the seller for letting you into their home and considering your offer. It also gives you the chance to ask them to take a closer look at why youâre making an offer. Additionally, it shows genuine sincerity and enthusiasm for their home. Everyone loves to hear how great their home is, and you can tell them what you love about it.On top of that, it allows you to personally connect with the seller. If the seller is receiving multiple offers, this connection can make all the difference because theyâll be able to see the person behind the offer.Lastly, writing a letter lets you tell your story and talk about your family. You can elaborate on how youâll love the home as much as they did. Everyone has a story to tell, and everyoneâs situation is different. Many of our clients have entered into multiple-offer situations without being able to submit the highest offer and still won because of writing this letter.âIf the seller is receiving multiple offers, this connection can make all the difference.âAs always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are a few tips to help get your offer accepted in our competitive real estate market.To have any chance of being a competitive homebuyer in our market, there are some key tips you should follow:1. Write a strong offer with tight deadlines and few (if any) contingencies. One of those contingencies is the inspection contingency, which gives the buyer the right to cancel the transaction if they donât like what they see during the inspection. We encourage you to communicate with the inspector through your agent before writing your offer so that you can have the inspection take place in a timely manner. This will give the seller peace of mind knowing that youâre not going to waste their time.2. Communicate well with the listing agent. An open line of communication with the listing agent about the offer will show the seller that your agent is knowledgeable and experienced, as well as demonstrate that they can make the transaction move forward smoothly.3. Ensure that all the financial aspects of your offer are strong. Your sales price, earnest money, and deposit need to be strong to entice the seller.4. Be straightforward and donât play games. Donât write unrealistic offers that the home couldnât appraise for. Unfortunately, many agents like to play games by going under contract at a high price and then trying to get a bunch of concessions from the seller later. This tactic just muddies the water and has the potential to cause the seller to pass over your offer.5. Make sure your lender is ready to contact the sellerâs agent early so they can present the pre-qualification letter with the offer before itâs accepted. If the lender contacts the sellerâs agent as you submit the offer, that will make your offer stronger, since it will tell the seller that youâre ready to go and willing to move the transaction along without hassle.If you have questions about this or any other topic, reach out to your Colemere Realty associate.

        "category": "",
        "content": "If you&rsquo;re thinking of buying new construction, you need to hire an agent.When buying a new construction home, you absolutely need an agent on your side representing your interests. There are a few key reasons why.First, while the builderâs agent may be friendly and helpful, they still represent the builder. They have a fiduciary responsibility to represent their interests, and if you enter into the transaction and give them more information about yourself, they can use it against you. Their incentive is to get you to pay more for the property so they make more money.This leads us to our next point: Without representation, the builderâs agent will be the one helping you pick out all of your upgrades, and theyâll inevitably suggest making every upgrade possible. Having an agent working for you provides a voice of temperament when it comes to choosing upgrades. Theyâll help you be smarter about where to spend your hard-earned money and avoid expensive, unnecessary upgrades.âHaving representation when building a new home doesnât cost you anything.âAlso, having representation means having a second set of eyes to look over the builderâs purchase agreement. Most builders have their own purchase agreement, and these are usually lengthy documents. Your agent can identify any mistakes, keep the builder honest, and make sure all contractual items are in order.Lastly, having representation when building a new home doesnât cost you anything. Contrary to what some may think, in this market, builders usually wonât give you a discount if you donât have your own representative.If youâd like to know more about how an agent can help you when buying new construction or have any other real estate questions, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

For families, the easiest way to do this is to find a babysitter for the kids, or have another family member watch them while you tour homes.Â Common sense is our greatest weapon in times of uncertainty.

As you can imagine, the price on that home did get bid up. Another listing of ours went on the market for $629,000 and received three offers in three days, all above list price. Ours is a healthy market, itâs just bound by low inventory.COVID-19 has certainly impacted the market, but itâs done so in a way that only served to create more demand.

Embrace the season. Home sellers often ask if they should decorate their homes for the holidays if they plan to sell, and the answer is yesâbut do it tastefully! What better time to evoke the buyerâs emotions and cause them to imagine their own family celebrating the holidays in your home when it becomes theirs?2. Deep clean before you decorate. Make sure you get every nook and cranny so that your property is, as our stager calls it, âwhite-glove clean.â3. Keep the home warm. Donât turn down the heat, but rather turn it up a little bit. Turn on all the lights, and if you have a fireplace, be sure to light it. The light and warmth helps to bring in more emotion and opens up your spaces. Also, bring in the scent of the holidays with a nice candle; this will help the buyer get into the holiday spirit.âHome sellers often ask if they should decorate their homes for the holidays if they plan to sell, and the answer is yesâbut do it tastefully!â4. Price your home correctly. Traditionally, real estate moves a little bit slower during the holidays, so itâs critical to correctly price your home. You donât want your home to sit stagnant on the market because itâs overpriced!5. Be patient. Showings may be requested at inconvenient times, and with everything else going on during the holidays, it can be a little stressful. Just be patient with the process; if the home doesnât sell during the holidays, it will when the spring market comes. If that happens, we can always change your listing photos to match the season.If you have any questions about real estate, please feel free to reach out to Colemere Realty Specialists. Weâd love to hear from you. In the meantime, have a wonderful holiday season.",

        "content": "Is a recession coming? Maybe, but that might not mean what you think it does.Â Thereâs a question looming in a lot of peopleâs minds these days: âIs a recession coming? What can we do about it?âA key thing to remember is that a recession isnât always a bad thing. A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, and itâs a necessary part of the market cycle. Markets expand and contract over time. During the last five recessions of our country, weâve seen periods of expansion that lasted several quarters prior to each one.Many people ask, âWhat happens to home values during a recession?âInterestingly enough, out of the last five recessions, three of those recessions saw increases in home values. That shows that a recession doesnât always mean that your home will lose value.Â âA recession isnât always a bad thing.âAnother thing to remember is that we could be going through a recession in some segments of the national market, but not in others. Real estate is always hyper-localâwe could have a slowdown in one area, but other areas could stay strong. The recession rule of thumb is that if an area is experiencing growth in terms of jobs, wages, and population, then that area will typically remain economically healthy. And fortunately, weâve had a great local economy here in Utah along the Wasatch Front.If you have questions about the recession, your market area, or about real estate in general, please reach out to your Colemere Realty Associate. Theyâd be happy to answer your questions. If youâre thinking of making real estate plans in the next few years, itâs never too early to start a discussion with us.",

        "content": "Here are four reasons why the fall season might be your best opportunity in quite some time to buy a home.Â Fall is just a few days away now, which is exciting for a number of reasons. Apart from the crisp autumn weather and football season, itâs also a great time to buy a home! Here are four reasons why:1. Home prices are increasing. Price growth is showing no sign of slowing down as we get closer and closer to fall. If you plan on purchasing a home anytime soon, itâs better to make your move in our fall market rather than in the future, when itâll be less affordable.2. Interest rates will continue to rise. Rates have been unbelievably low for an unbelievably long time. Nevertheless, they wonât remain that way forever. And given that your interest rate will directly affect how much your mortgage payment will be, you donât want to wait for rates to start trending upward.3. Youâre paying someoneâs mortgage regardless. If youâre a renter, look at it this way: You can start paying your own mortgage while conditions are on your side or you can continue paying your landlordâs mortgage. Now, if youâre living in your parentsâ basement rent-free, itâs probably safe to assume theyâll want you out sooner rather than later.4. Now might be the time to realize your goals. A common sentiment among would-be buyers is, âWeâll just hold off until next spring or next fall.â But itâs a good idea to give deeper consideration to your reasons for wanting to buy a home. Perhaps itâs because youâd like to put down roots and have a foundation upon which you can grow with your family. Or maybe youâd like to move up and improve your circumstances and lifestyle.âGive deeper consideration to your reasons for wanting to buy a home.âWhile decisions like this can be hard to make, itâs important to get an outside opinion sometimes. One of the many resources we provide is a consultation where we help you with that very thing. So if you have any questions or would like to set up a no-obligation consultation with us, please reach out to us. Weâd be happy to help!",

But in all seriousness, if you feel that your property has been overvalued, you can protest your assessment and get it lowered.In Salt Lake County, the main thing youâll need is a proper evaluation of the current tax year in the form of an appraisal, a closing statement, or comparable sold properties (which we can help you with).Â From there, you start your appeal.The first step of the appeal is usually an online or written form that youâll have to fill out. Youâll send in your evaluation with it, it will be reviewed, and theyâll send back a decision.âIf you donât like their initial response, you can appeal the process again.âIf you donât like their initial response, you can appeal the process again.

During a divorce or bankruptcy. Generally, a judge involved in either of these scenarios will require that some type of value be established before the case can proceed.2. During an estate sale. This is especially true if the sale is a complicated one. If different parties involved in the estate sale live far apart from one another, for example, ordering an appraisal before you sell may be a good idea.3. When youâre using a relocation company. These companies will often require you to order an appraisal.âUnless youâre faced with one of the circumstances we discussed today, youâll generally be better off speaking to a Realtor about your home value as you prepare to sell.âAgents have all the same information at their disposal as appraisers, so unless youâre faced with one of the circumstances we discussed today, youâll generally be better off speaking to a Realtor about your home value as you prepare to sell.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

When a home is overpriced, it tends to stagnate on the market, and when buyers see that, theyâll probably think that somethingâs wrong with it.Another danger of overpricing your home is getting burnt out. The longer your home is on the market, the more worn down youâll get having to clean your house at a momentâs notice to prepare for a showingâespecially if you have kids and/or pets. Your hopes may get high that each buyer who visits will be the last, but if theyâre aware that your home is overpriced, you might be in for a disappointment.âChances are you wonât be able to fool the buyer about the value of your home.âLastly, itâs worth noting that buyers today have more information at their fingertips than they ever have before. Theyâre both astute and diligent about comparing homes to others theyâve seen in the market. Â Even if they donât have the exact data on your home, they do think about the general cleanliness of the home, what upgrades it has, and what features it has compared to homes that are priced lower than yours.

        "content": "Today, we&rsquo;ll discuss why a home inspection is vitally important to those buying a home.Â What makes an inspection such a necessary part of the real estate transaction for homebuyers?Once you go under contract for the purchase of a home, included in your agreement is a timetable for any due diligence youâd like to conduct. Consider this your opportunity to inspect the property to the fullest extent.When you hire a home inspector, theyâll come with a checklist of items, and theyâll examine those items to ensure sufficient functionality of each.As an aside, you may get swept up in all the excitement of going under contract on your new home, only to have an inspector identify some issues. Thatâs why itâs so important to have a professional inspector come inâtheir preset checklist will be comprised of around 300 items, and theyâll document every problem area they uncover in a thorough fashion. This way, youâre not surprised by the actual condition of the home.âThe inspection is instrumental in letting you know the exact condition of the home and about anything you werenât aware of beforehand.âWith a checklist of this length, an inspector is bound to find flaws or areas that need servicing in the home. Weâve even seen cases where inspectors have found issues in new construction properties.If and when issues arise out of the inspection, as the buyer, youâll need to identify the biggest concerns and ask yourself: If any issues were to go unaddressed, how would it impede my ability to move forward smoothly? From there, youâll essentially renegotiate with the seller to either make those repairs or give you a credit toward the repairs.All in all, the inspection is instrumental in letting you know the exact condition of the home and about anything you werenât aware of beforehand, so youâll be comfortable with what youâre getting into.If you have any questions about todayâs topic or anything else real estate-related, please feel free to reach out to your Colemere Realty specialist.

Even though the number of units sold has gone down lately, that has to do more with a lack of inventory than it does with the health of our market. Weâre still in a healthy, strong sellerâs market.Right now, the median price in the single-family home market is up to $355,000 and weâre seeing an appreciation rate of around 8%.âWeâre still in a healthy, strong sellerâs market.âWhat economic factors have led to this? One of them is a bit of a slowdown in terms of job growth.

They gave homeowners a platform to rent their ADUs, and as more and more started doing it, state and city governments became concerned that a surplus of ADUs would become a potential neighborhood nuisance. They donât want streets to become overcrowded with cars or households with ADUs to become disruptive, so they stepped in and established some ground rules for renting them.âThere are a lot of great opportunities to be had with ADUs, but you need to make sure that you follow these rules before adding one to your property.âThere are a lot of great opportunities to be had with ADUs, but you need to make sure that you follow these rules before adding one to your property.

Here are a few reasons why that is:1. Interest rates are on the rise. Increased interest rates will negatively affect a buyerâs purchasing power, meaning they wonât be able to afford the same amount of home if they wait until spring to buy.2. Less competition. Because there are fewer buyers in the market during the fall and winter, there is less competition for the ones who are looking during that time. The spring market is a prime season for multiple-offer situations and bidding wars, meaning youâll have to work that much harder for sellers to accept your offer over another buyerâs.âThe spring market is a prime season for multiple-offer situations and bidding wars, meaning youâll have to work that much harder for sellers to accept your offer over another buyerâs.âThe main question you need to ask yourself is whether or not youâre ready to buy a home. Are you qualified? Are you comfortable moving forward with a transaction right now? Are you in a position where it will be feasible to move? If your answers to these questions are yes, then why wait?Yes, people donât typically want to move while itâs cold or while thereâs snow on the ground, but the reality is that, if you prepare for it properly, moving will only take a half a dayâso there shouldnât be much of a barrier.And to be honest, this is our favorite time of year to show homes. Itâs a lot of fun to go through and see all the houses decorated for the holidays.If you have any questions about this topic or about buying or selling a home in general, donât be afraid to reach out to us for all your real estate needs.

        "content": "We lose purchasing power as interest rates rise. Let&rsquo;s talk about what this means for you.Â As you may know, the cost of financing a home has been going up. The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates in recent months, and with more increases on the horizon, today weâll be talking about what this means for you as a buyer or seller.Utahâs economy is growing rapidly right now, partially due to our many great job opportunities. The Fed will take this into consideration when they increase interest rates, which subsequently affects our housing market and available opportunities for homebuyers and sellers.As rates rise, buyers canât qualify for the same homes they previously could. For sellers, this makes it important to sell homes quickly. Because the buyer pool for your home will begin to drain due to increased interest, you wonât be able to get as much for your home and fewer buyers will qualify to begin with.âThereâs a direct relationship where we lose purchasing power as interest rates rise.âSimilarly for buyers, the amount you can qualify for is lower. Thereâs a direct relationship where we lose purchasing power as interest rates rise. If rates lowered, weâd see an increase in purchasing power, but this is incredibly unlikely to happen. This is illustrated on the graph below.Feel free to reach out to us if youâre looking to buy or sell a home, have any questions that youâd like answers, or would simply like some further information.

It doesnât mean people donât want to buy or sell; it just means there are fewer buyers out there for a variety of reasons (colder weather, the start of the school year, etc.).Because of this, the remaining buyers are more serious. This means less tire-kicking and more people who are ready to make a deal. In fact, most fall buyers want to get into a home before the first snowfall.âNowâs an especially great time to sell if youâre looking to move up.âMost times, we also see less competition in the higher price ranges from other sellers during the fall, so nowâs an especially great time to sell if youâre looking to move up.If youâd like to put your home on the market before the snow starts falling or you have any other questions about our market, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

        "content": "In our market right now, conditions are split based on price point. And today we&rsquo;d like to explain how this will impact your goals as a buyer or seller.Â When it comes to our market, thereâs more than one story to be told. We like to explain our current conditions as being the âTale of Two Tales.â Thankfully, though, the only Dickensian thing about this update is the name.To give you a better idea of what weâre talking about, letâs take a look at how our market has been faring recently.First, homes below $350,000 are still selling relatively fast. But, as the name of todayâs update implies, this only tells half of the story of todayâs market.Unlike their lower-priced counterparts, homes listed above $400,000 have actually been spending longer on the market and seeing lower offers than in the recent past.So what do these two tales of our market mean for sellers?âThe things that are happening in the market on a broad scale donât tell the whole story.âWell, while those with homes in lower price ranges will have an easier time achieving selling success, those listing their home at or above the $400,000 will need to exert a little more effort.For those listed in these less active upper price ranges, staging will be key. You will need to present your home in the best possible light to attract buyer interest and earn the best possible deal.With this in mind, todayâs buyers will also need to strategize according to the price point theyâre searching in. Those looking in lower price ranges, where homes are moving more quickly, shouldnât be afraid to get a little aggressive with their offers. Donât forget to include favorable terms. Price is not the only component to consider when making an offer on a home.Ultimately, buyers and sellers alike should be mindful of how market conditions will impact their success. Remember: The things that are happening in the market on a broad scale donât tell the whole story.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

Poor communication is high on the list. Poor communication with your agent, or loan officer, or the seller will slow the process down. Having too many contingencies with the appraisal, the inspection, or anything else will do the same thing.What can speed up the process?

No matter what you choose, youâre paying a mortgage.Some people are scared of the word âmortgageâ because of the commitment. Even if you donât technically have one, youâre paying for one if youâre renting. Youâre actually paying more than a mortgage would cost and making your landlord money in the process.Renting does have some benefits, but only as a temporary solution. The goal should be to own the roof over your own head. If you donât, youâre just paying for somebody else to own the roof over your head.âRenting has benefits, but itâs only a temporary solution.âThose that own homes tend to have a much higher net worth than those who donât. A mortgage also gives you a fixed rate that you can use to predict what your payments will be now and in the future. The price and payment stay fixed in this case. If youâre renting, youâre at the mercy of the market and the landlordâs decision. Rental rates have gone up much higher than home prices in the last few years.If you have any questions for us about this topic or anything else related to real estate, give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "Should you keep saving to purchase a home, or should you buy a home now?Â This is a great question, and it all comes down to how much you are saving and whether your savings are outpacing the rate at which the market is appreciating. For example, if youâre saving $1,000 a month and the market is appreciating at $500 a month, it makes sense to save your money to buy a house.Â Unfortunately, our market is growing at a faster rate than most people are able to save right now.Â In our last video, we mentioned that appreciation is going to be anywhere from 6% to 8% in 2018, so keep that in mind.Â If weâre at a pace of 6% appreciation and youâre not able to keep up with your savings, itâs probably wise to buy a home sooner rather than later. That way, youâll end up ahead.Â You should also keep an eye on interest rates. Weâre in an environment where they have been talking about raising interest rates for a long time, and they are starting to do that now. As rates go up, a buyerâs purchasing power is going to be greatly limited.Â âInterest rates are the single greatest factor that can influence your monthly payment.âFor every 1% increase in interest rates, your mortgage payment goes up about $200. Interest rates are the single greatest factor that can influence a monthly payment.Â The good news is that there are some really favorable loan programs right now with low down payments or no down payment at all. In a market thatâs appreciating like ours, itâs a good idea to take advantage of some of these programs to buy a home. There are also some grant programs that provide money for down payments. So, there are some favorable options out there if you donât quite have the money you think you need.Â If you have any questions, please donât hesitate to reach out to us. We are well-versed in whatâs going on in the market, and weâd love to help you.Â Â ",

        "content": "Today weâre excited to bring you the first installment of a two-part series on what you should do when your appraisal comes in low.Â Weâre in a strong sellerâs market right now. Certain price ranges are generating multiple offers for the listings that are out there, so sometimes an appraiser will enter the picture and disagree with the price that is listed on the contract. Â From a buyerâs perspective, the first thing to remember is that you always have the right to cancel the contract if the appraisal comes in low. This is the easy solution, but it doesnât get you the house.Typically when an appraisal comes in low, most people will try to renegotiate. This may mean that the buyer will have to come up with some extra funds or get rid of some closing costs that have been previously negotiated with the seller.Â Usually, there is an attempt by both parties to make it work out for everyone.Â âSometimes an appraiser will enter the picture and disagree with the price that is listed on the contract.âIf it was an FHA appraisal, then the appraisal stays with the property whether the deal works out or not.Â During the process of renegotiating, itâs important that everyone pays attention to the contract deadline. Buyers especially need to realize that you must negotiate within this deadline if you want to get your earnest money back in the event the deal falls through. If you negotiate outside of the deadlines, the earnest money can be lost.Â If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "What can you expect from the 2018 real estate market? We want to share our forecast with you today.Â Since the real estate market was strong in Â 2017 and we expect it to continue to be strong in 2018, interest rates should go up. The Fed will probably raise interest rates two or three times in 2018.Â According to what we saw in 2017, you can expect more low inventory in 2018. We will continue in a strong sellerâs market because of strong buyer demand.Â As we continue to add more people to the Wasatch Front through job growth or people having children, we are going to continue to see strong demand going forward, which will also cause prices to continue to go up. Â If you plan on selling your home, you want to make sure that you justify your pricing, even if you are in a strong sellerâs market. Reach out to a real estate professional like us. We can definitely help you with pricing.Â âStrong demand will cause prices to go up in 2018.âWhen you sell your home, chances are your buyer will use financing to purchase the house. That means you are selling your house twice, once to the buyer and once to the appraiser. The home has to appraise, or else nobody wins.Â If you are a first-time buyer in the $200,000 to $300,000 price range, itâs especially important that you are prepared to be very competitive with your offer. You need to be able to move fast. We have a number of different tips that you can help you succeed in this market.Â This is a general forecast for our local real estate market.

This shows that prices are going up. It is important to keep in mind that price per square foot isnât the best way to measure value, but it is an indicator of where values are going.Â We are also seeing what youâd expect when prices per square foot go upâthe median sales price is also up from $268,000 to $299,000.âThe rising price per square foot indicates that home values are on the rise.âInventory remains low, especially in lower price ranges. We see inventories of two months or fewer across the board. When you have lower inventory like weâve seen, it will also reduce the days on market. On average in 2017, the days on market was 20 days. This will vary a bit based on the price point of the home or where itâs located.This is just a snapshot of what we observed over the past year. As always, if you have any questions about the market or real estate in general, please feel free to contact your Colemere Realty team member.

Today, we want to go over some of the biggest mistakes people can make when selling their homes.First off is asking too much money for your property. Even in a sellerâs market, this can be a mistake people make.Our market is experiencing a slight shift, so overpricing can become very frustrating for everyone involved in the transaction. Listing your home too high will only lead to price reduction after price reduction.The next mistake sellers commonly make is advertising too little. There tends to be an assumption that just because youâve hired a Realtor, youâre in the clear.âPutting your home on the market and waiting isnât enough to successfully sell.âThe truth is that merely putting your home on the market and waiting isnât enough. You will need a detailed marketing strategy to expose your home to the most buyers possible.The last mistake weâd like to talk about is not preparing your home adequately for sale. Once a home is on the market, it is no longer just a place to live in. A home thatâs listed on the market needs to be ready at a momentâs notice for buyers to view it.

Donât just observe it when you visit the home. Check out what traffic is like during rush hour or after school.2. Pay attention to your daily commute.3. Know your neighborhood codes and restrictions. This is especially important in neighborhoods that have HOAs (homeowners associations).4. Donât overlook the bedroom/bathroom count. If you are looking at a 4-bedroom home, for example, make sure it doesnât have just one bathroom.5. Make note of any specialty inspections. We always recommend a general home inspection but depending on the home youâre looking at, you might want to order a radon inspection, a termite inspection, or a number of other specialty inspections.6. Pay attention to the things that canât be changed about the home. This includes the lot size, the location, and the floor layout.Â 7. Make note of the homeâs resale value. Sometimes buyers can get too excited and forget to pay attention to any barriers that would make the home harder to sell than normal.8. Is there room to grow into the home? This depends on your individual circumstances, obviously, but should be considered no matter what those circumstances are.âDonât buy a 4-bedroom home with one bathroom.âWe hope this list is helpful to you.

We totally understand thatâwe spent a lot of time in our careers as single agents, and we believe that a team is a valuable way to get out of the agent rat race.Â One of the myths itâs easy to talk yourself into if youâre a single agent is that you can do everything and skip paying for things like transaction coordination, communicating with title companies, and other services.Â When it comes to this myth and agent activities, single agents like to believe their time isnât worth what it should be worth. What they end up doing when they meet with a client who tries to beat them up over their commission is offer a discountâthey discount themselves, their service, and their fees. They then stay in the rat race by convincing themselves they only need to work harder and put more time in.Â âWe all only have 24 hours in a day.âThe reality is, we all only have 24 hours in a day. As much as some of us want to think weâre Superman, there is not enough time in the day to increase business volume to what we think weâre capable of doing. This philosophy leads to agent burnout.Â You can spend your time scurrying around, putting up signs, and hanging lock boxes if you want. On a team, though, you have someone else doing those jobs so you can focus on writing purchase agreements, getting contracts signed, and prospecting.Â You can work hard and be effective as a single agent, but you will cap out at a certain volume because you donât have enough time in the day to do it all.Â If you have any questions about our team or are interested in attending some of our training sessions, donât hesitate to contact us.

We recommend hiring a third-party management company to handle the essential maintenance tasks so that doesnât become a full-time job for you.  Having an exit strategy in place: Specifically, there are two strategies we want to mention. First, make sure that if short-term rentals become unavailable, the property can still generate cash flow in a long-term rental scenario. Second, if the property doesnât work out and you need to sell quickly, make sure you buy into an area with enough appreciation that you wonât lose money during that quick sale.Â âHire a management company so maintaining your Airbnb property doesnât become a full-time job.âIf you have any questions about investing in real estate, please donât hesitate to give us a call.

        "content": "Inventory has been shrinking recently and a lot of buyers are turning to building new homes instead.When buyers do this, though, they need to ensure they are being well-represented.Â Today, weâd like to share three reasons why that is.Â First of all, when a buyer enters a model home the agent they are greeted by is actually representing the builder. This agent is focused on the builderâs money and best interest as opposed to the buyerâs. Â While they are usually very friendly and donât mean ill will toward the buyer, it is important to be represented nonetheless.Â Next, buyers should remember that many builders use their own purchase agreement. Weâve personally seen these contracts and know that they can be upwards of 30 to 40 pages long.Â âItâs nice to have someone around who is familiar with the ins and outs of the process.âSo having someone who is representing you available to read and interpret these kinds of documents will be very important to the process and your understanding of it.Finally, the purchase of a home is an emotional decision. All else aside, a home is somewhere you are going to put down roots, make memories, and spend time with your family. It can be hard to separate yourself from this emotion, so having someone who will be able to help you do so is greatly helpful.Â Ultimately itâs nice to have someone around who is familiar with the ins and outs of the process and can help you make the many decisions associated with homeownership.If youâd like more information or have any other questions feel free to get in touch by giving us a call or sending an email. We look forward to hearing from you.",

        "content": "Weâve had to deal with quite a few multiple offer situations recently. These can get tricky, but we have been able to find consistent success in getting buyers the home they want while competing against other buyers who want the same home. We are here to share some of our best tips with you today.Â The first important thing is to make sure your agent tells the sellers your story. Striking an emotional chord with a seller will go a long way when it comes time for them to accept an offer. A lot of sellers are interested in the buyer who will live in their home next. You want your agent to present your case to the sellers as strongly as possible.Â âMake sure the seller knows your story.âÂ We recently had a buyer who was a nurse at a local hospital and ended up getting her offer accepted because of the sellerâs connection to the nurses at that hospital. Making sure the deadlines on the offer are nice and tight is another good strategy.Â Finally, you need to have a solid pre-qualification letter from a lender that your agent has a relationship with. If they have closed many transactions with that lender, you can rest assured that you wonât be led astray.Â Â If you have any questions for us about real estate or you know anyone who is interested in buying or selling a home, feel free to give us a call or send us an email anytime.

The 1031 can be a little tricky, but there are some basic rules to follow:Â Â First of all, once you close on the property that youâre using the 1031 on, you have 45 days to identify three properties of interest. From there, you have 180 days to close one one of those properties. You can also close on multiple properties.Â Â In the meantime, you canât have any boot. That means you cannot take any money from the sale and put it in your pocket or else you will be taxed on that.âRemember, third parties are necessary.âÂ The last thing to keep in mind is that third parties are necessary. You need to use a third-party intermediary to handle the exchange on your behalf. Remember, you cannot touch the money from the sale of the property going into the exchanged property. That has to be handled by a third-party intermediary.Â Â We have great resources to help you find that third-party and we can answer any other questions you might have about the 1031 exchange.

You also need to have cash reserves in the bank.2.Â Cash financing. If you donât have all the cash in your bank account, you can use a 1030 exchange in order to get cash as well. Ask us more about this option if youâre curious.3.Â Seller financing. This is where you get a little creative.

Click here to view a .pdf of investment formulas to help you out!Now that youâve found a property you like, what happens next? Next, you have to evaluate that property, and there are three important factors to take into consideration.The first is location. Weâve all heard the saying âlocation, location, location,â and it certainly applies to real estate investment as well. For example, a busy road can be a positive thing when it comes to real estate investment. Whether the property in question is located in an affluent area or one with a high crime rate is an example of the risk versus reward issue you must deal with when considering the location of your investment property.This leads us to the second thing you must factor in: the age and condition of the property. We always advise people in this situation to order a home inspection. From that report, youâll be able to determine what repairs are needed. This can also be a huge negotiating point for driving the price of the property down. You also need to consider the long-term objective of the property. Will the roof need to be replaced in five years? How are the water heater and the furnace?âThe numbers in investment real estate are critical.âThe last thing you want to factor in is how to run the numbers. The numbers in investment real estate are critical. This means things like the analysis of cash on cash, your return on investment, and the cap rate analysis. In the video above, we have a link attached providing examples of these forms and information on how to calculate them.Stay tuned for the last part in our series about investment properties.

If youâre thinking about buying an investment property, there are three points you need to consider before following through.First, whatâs your overall objective in buying an investment property? Most people buy them for one of four different reasons:  They want an additional monthly cash flow.  They want to buy a property in a very strong area thatâs appreciating in value.  They need a tax shelter for their income.  They need something to do with their time and want one as a hobby.Second, remember that becoming a landlord is a business, not a charity.Make sure youâre using the proper contracts and youâre following them. Tenants will definitely try to take every advantage they can if they see that youâre not running your investment property as a business. We have the proper contracts and forms and weâd be happy to supply them to you if you like.âBecoming a landlord is a business, not a charity.âLastly, begin with the end in mind. Whatâs your overall purpose? Do you want to fix and flip and make a quick dollar on the sale or are you in a long-term, buy-and-hold strategy to create a cash flow for yourself?

        "category": "",
        "content": "One of the worst things that can happen during a real estate transaction is a bad appraisal. You are already under contract, things are rolling along, and suddenly, everything stops because the appraisal didnât meet the purchase price.Â If the home does not appraise, the home will not be able to be sold for the agreed upon purchase price. This is bad news for both the buyer and the seller. However, there are a few things you can do to make it to the closing table:Â First, the buyer can come up with the money to meet the appraisal price. Most buyers donât want to do that. However, we are in a hot sellerâs market right now, and many homes are drawing multiple offers. As a buyer, you might just have to bite the bullet and come up with the money.Â âWe are in a sellerâs market, so buyers may just have to come up with the extra cash.âThe other option is for the seller to come down a bit on the asking price. Again, in this market, that is unlikely.Â The third option is to renegotiate the terms of the contract. As a buyer, go to the lender and see if there is any room for adjustment in the interest rate. If the seller is paying for the closing costs, offer to cover them yourself. Ultimately, you can renegotiate to try and make the deal go through in a way that works out for everyone.Â If you have any other questions about how to handle a bad appraisal or if you want to know more about our current real estate market, give us a call or send us an email.

Once they go up, we will see a slight decrease in affordability, although home values will continue to rise.Another thing to note about the 2017 market is that we will see a lot more millennials in the market. Utah actually leads the nation in the number of millennials. We love millennials and love working with millennials. It will be great to see even more millennials buying homes this year. This will contribute to the overall health of our market.Scarcity of listings was a big theme in 2016. We expect the supply to improve this year, but donât expect it to go too high, as demand for homes is still very strong.Finally, we expect to see a moderate increase in home prices. We wonât see double digit increases, but we will see a nice, healthy appreciation of home values.âWe love working with millennials.âThere is some uncertainty about the housing market on a national level.

Itâs hard for buyers to get excited about wallpaper because they will most likely tear it down anyway.  Stay away from lavish lighting fixtures. If you have an elaborate chandelier made of glass or deer antlers, replace it with something neutral while youâre in the process of selling.  Textured surfaces. Whether itâs your walls, ceilings, or other surfaces, buyers donât tend to care much for them.  Using the wrong flooring. Replacing your flooring with the cheapest option might actually hurt your value more than it will help it.Â   Too much carpet. Carpeted bedrooms and living areas are normal- carpeted bathrooms and kitchens are not. Most buyers want hardwood or tile floors in those areas.  Bold wall colors may turn buyers off. When in doubt, go neutral with your wall colors.  Pools and hot tubs donât add much value. While they may add value to you while you are living there, most buyers donât necessarily want to take on the cost of owning and maintaining these items and continuing to pay for them.âFollow this advice, and your home will be much more attractive to potential buyers.
