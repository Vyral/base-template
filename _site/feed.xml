        <title>How Can an Escrow Repair Holdback Help Homebuyers and Sellers?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/X0aseIbfSWI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we’re going to talk about escrow repair holdbacks, what they are, and how they work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes in a mortgage transaction, a buyer will find something that will need to be fixed before closing. If a buyer or seller doesn’t have the funds, they might switch over to a renovation loan. &lt;strong&gt;However, a renovation loan usually brings a higher interest rate and higher fees.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=This option allows us to avoid a renovation loan, which usually has a higher interest rate.%20http://localhost:4000/how-can-an-escrow-repair-holdback-help-homebuyers-and-sellers.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“This option allows us to avoid a renovation loan, which usually has a higher interest rate.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If it’s just one or two repairs that need to be made, we can do what’s called an escrow repair holdback.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, let’s say the roof needs to be repaired. We would require two quotes from different roofing companies to get an estimate of the repair. Then, we would require that 150% of the highest quote would be held in escrow at closing to pay for repairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the repairs are finished and the final invoice is provided, we would send the appraiser back out for a final inspection. We also pay out the final invoice after we confirm that the repairs are made within 60 days after closing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After the roofer has been paid, we release the rest of the funds out to whoever provided them originally and no additional fees have to be collected.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me about escrow repairs holdbacks or anything else relating to your mortgage, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Does the Appraisal Process Work When Buying?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/J6ZwQcDBunA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to talk with you about how the appraisal process and the mortgage loan application process work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the purchase contract comes in, all initial loan disclosures have been signed, and we have the intent to proceed as a lender, &lt;strong&gt;we will order an appraisal on the property.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Dodd-Frank and mortgage reform, all mortgage lenders have to go through an appraisal management company. We will place our order through the appraisal management company and then they will contract with the appraiser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Since Dodd-Frank and mortgage reform, all mortgage lenders have to go through an appraisal management company.%20http://localhost:4000/how-does-the-appraisal-process-work-when-buying.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Since Dodd-Frank and mortgage reform, all mortgage lenders have to go through an appraisal management company.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the lender, we will not know who the appraiser is on the property until we actually get the report. This ensures that there is no coercion of value. Also, it guarantees nobody has reached out to the appraiser and provided any information that could sway their opinion of value. This makes it so the lender can be sure that they are getting the most accurate depiction of the value of the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process also protects the buyer as well from any coercion of value from either side of the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once the appraisal comes back, it is reviewed and then it can be released to all parties in the transaction for review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about the appraisal process or the cost of an appraisal in the home buying process, please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I would be happy to speak with you about it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Do You Finance Home Renovations?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OvSL98Zv2yc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can you do to finance renovations in your current home or in the home you’ve just purchased?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, there are two loan programs that we look at when someone is looking to do a renovation loan: &lt;strong&gt;the 203(k) loan&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the FHA’s version of the loan, or the conventional version of a renovation loan, which is also called &lt;strong&gt;Fannie Mae’s homestyle renovation loan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We take the purchase price of the home, plus the estimated cost of repairs, plus whatever down payment is required by the program to determine what we will lend.%20http://localhost:4000/how-do-you-finance-home-renovations.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We take the purchase price of the home, plus the estimated cost of repairs, plus whatever down payment is required by the program to determine what we will lend.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As lenders, we would take the purchase price of the home plus the estimated cost of repairs, which is done via a home inspection, as well as whatever down payment is required by the program to determine what we will lend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let’s say the purchase price of a home is $100,000. We would take the purchase price plus the cost of repairs (say, $20,000) and lend, for an FHA loan, 96.5% of that $120,000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are many benefits provided by a renovation loan&lt;/strong&gt;, especially as purchase prices and interest rates continue to climb. A lot of first-time homebuyers are being priced out of the market, so having a renovation option allows them to look at cheaper homes that may need some work. They wouldn’t qualify for traditional financing, so &lt;strong&gt;they would need a renovation loan to make the home livable&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you or anyone you know have questions regarding renovation loans or how to finance them, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to discuss the subject in more detail with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Which Is Better: Being Pre-Qualified or Being Pre-Approved?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZRMq4PAgncs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being commonly confused, pre-qualification letters and pre-approval letters are two distinct documents. Today I’d like to talk about the difference between them and, also, which is better for buyers to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, what is a pre-qualification letter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pre-qualification letter is a document containing information from a mortgage loan application.&lt;/strong&gt; However, little of the information listed on this document has been verified. This means pre-qualification letters are not reliable evidence in the eyes of a seller, since only the buyer’s credit score has been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-approval letters, on the other hand, contain verified information about the buyer&lt;/strong&gt;. All documentation has been collected, and the underwriter has reviewed and approved the loan file. For this reason, buyers with a pre-approval letter should be viewed as cash buyers when it comes to multiple offer situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as the property appraises and nothing pertaining to the buyers’ financial situation changes drastically during escrow, the approval process should go quickly for buyers with a pre-approval letter. &lt;strong&gt;Having a pre-approval letter is very important in the mortgage lending process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=For this reason, buyers with a pre-approval letter should be viewed as cash buyers when it comes to multiple offer situations.%20http://localhost:4000/which-is-better-being-pre-qualified-or-being-pre-approved.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“For this reason, buyers with a pre-approval letter should be viewed as cash buyers when it comes to multiple offer situations.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Will the Upcoming USDA Changes Affect You?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/T_GB2tgWgD0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 4, 2018 will be a big day in the mortgage world. It’s the day that the new maps from the USDA come into effect for the 2018 fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may already know, the three main qualifications for a USDA loan are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must have at least a 620 credit score&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must be purchasing in a USDA-eligible area&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must meet annual household income requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Until June 4, we’ll be working based on the old maps&lt;/strong&gt;. In Lake County, the entire county is still eligible. However, this change means that you have until June 3 to get your purchase contracts in under the old eligibility maps to guarantee that we can close your client’s new home under those parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You have until June 3 to get your purchase contracts in under the old eligibility maps to guarantee that we can close your client’s new home under those parameters.%20http://localhost:4000/will-the-upcoming-usda-changes-affect-you.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“You have until June 3 to get your purchase contracts in under the old eligibility maps to guarantee that we can close your client’s new home under those parameters.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything that comes in on June 4 or after would be subject to the new USDA property maps.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you or anyone you know has any questions regarding this change, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to sort out any confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Are the New Loan Limits for 2018?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fNNExzPq-Pg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year, the Housing and Recovery Act requires that the baseline conforming loan limit be adjusted to reflect the sales price of the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, &lt;strong&gt;the conforming loan limit rose to $453,100. The VA and USDA limits also rose to this amount.&lt;/strong&gt; For our local area, the base FHA loan limit rose to $294,515. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=These loan limit increases help programs to stay up-to-date.%20http://localhost:4000/what-are-the-new-loan-limits-for-2018.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“These loan limit increases help programs to stay up-to-date.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These loan limit increases help programs to stay up-to-date in relation to current sales prices in our market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Be Careful About Pulling Your Credit</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sNP19D4K_pc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we’re here to answer a few questions about why it’s never a good idea to let anybody pull your credit during the mortgage loan process without consulting with your mortgage loan officer first. Let’s get right to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do credit inquiries affect your credit score?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you apply for credit, it’s considered a “hard inquiry.” All hard inquiries result in a reduction of your credit score. However, inquiries are weighted. Mortgage and car loans will reduce your credit score by fewer points than a store or airline credit card. Each credit union will give you a different score, but hard inquiries result in a reduction in each case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are switching utilities. What if they pull our credit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Utilities are a little bit different than a credit card or car loan. It’s considered a soft pull. They will pull your payment history and they may pull a credit score on their site, but it’s not an actual hard inquiry. We won’t see a reduction or anything on our side from the utility companies. So, getting your credit pulled from the utility company won’t affect your mortgage loan application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You should avoid hard inquiries as much as possible.%20http://localhost:4000/be-careful-about-pulling-your-credit.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“You should avoid hard inquiries as much as possible.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What services and companies should you give permission to pull credit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s going to come down to the things you need to have in place when you moved into your new home. Your utilities, cable, phone, internet, etc. You never want to have any hard inquiries unless they are absolutely necessary. That’s why it’s important to have a great one-on-one relationship with your loan officer so you can talk these situations out and find a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do lenders run a second credit check before closing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some loan programs do require a soft pull or a second credit check prior to closing. It isn’t a hard inquiry, so you won’t see a reduction in your score. You always want to err on the side of caution. If you’re planning on buying a home, pay extra attention to your security, because even little mistakes could cause you to lose out on a loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me or anyone on my team, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why New Furniture Could Cost You Your Home Loan</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XQIC6Hd0_fo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, families going through the loan process are so excited about the prospect of purchasing a home and how that home will look that they jump the gun and either make a major purchase with their credit card or open a new credit card to make some major purchases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As we’ve discussed in previous videos, this can have a detrimental impact on your credit.&lt;/strong&gt; There are some loan programs that require us to do a soft credit pull prior to closing, so we’ll see any credit inquiries for large purchases. Depending on the purchase amount and what it does to your credit score, this could affect your qualification and eventual closing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though furniture stores can offer you 0% financing for 60 months, what they’re essentially doing is providing you a credit card, which is a revolving credit line that will report to all three major credit bureaus. When you apply for the store’s financing, that will show up on your credit history and, in turn, drop your credit score because a computer doesn’t understand the circumstances involved. It doesn’t know whether you’re credit-seeking or you’ve perhaps fallen on hard times and you’re trying to take out a card and max it out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re given $1,000 worth of credit and you spend all of it, not only will that inquiry drop your credit score, but you will have also maxed out another account. Even though that $1,000 sum requires 0% interest or doesn’t require any payments for the first six months, it will still show up on your credit report, which could affect your debt-to-income ratio. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Wait until after you’ve closed on your home to start buying furniture for it.%20http://localhost:4000/why-new-furniture-could-cost-you-your-home-loan.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Wait until after you’ve closed on your home to start buying furniture for it.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying furniture for your new home is something that needs to be done, but you don’t want the furniture truck to show up in the driveway the day of your closing because that means your furniture store account would’ve had to have been opened and financed prior to that closing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paying for new furniture with cash before you close on your home, on the other hand, won’t hurt anything unless you use the money you set aside for your down payment and closing costs. It’s your money and you can do what you want with it, just be cognizant of what you’ll need at the closing table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best time to purchase new furniture for your home is anytime after you close.&lt;/strong&gt; Us lenders won’t verify what happened after the day of your closing, so if you need to sign up for a line of credit from a furniture store, make sure you do it after you close. That way, you actually have a home to put your furniture in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about this topic or anything else about the mortgage loan process, don’t hesitate to reach out to me and my team. We’d love to help you. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Buying a Car Can Affect Your Pre-Approval</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vk7FB-wsB9A?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will purchasing a car affect your ability to buy a home? Yes, and there are a few different ways a car purchase can impact your chances of being approved for a mortgage or closing on a new home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter if you buy a $20,000 car or a $100,000 car. In the grand scheme of things, the amount of debt is not as important as the monthly debt that goes along with purchasing a car. Your car payment will get calculated into your debt-to-income ratio, and some loan programs have higher debt-to-income ratio qualifications than others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are pre-approved and already looking at homes at the top of your budget without that monthly car payment, buying a car could affect your ability to qualify. &lt;strong&gt;We will not close on a loan that does not meet the debt-to-income ratio requirements.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying a car can also impact your funds for closing. Sometimes when you buy a car, they require some sort of down payment to get into the vehicle. You might end up using funds that you had set aside for a down payment or closing costs. If you don’t have those funds available, you may not be able to close on the home that you are looking to buy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that you need to buy a car. What can you do so that you don’t hurt your chances of buying a home? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing we can do is look at the numbers and see what you could qualify for, what you’re looking for in a home, and what you need in a car. From there, we can see what that payment equates to in your debt-to-income ratio. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every $50 in a monthly car payment can affect your buying power by about $10,000.&lt;/strong&gt; If you get a $200 monthly car payment, you may have limited your mortgage by $40,000, and that’s a lot of house. It really depends on what you need and what works for you and your family. We can kind of reverse those numbers to make it work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You don’t want to buy a car, truck, or van during the mortgage loan process—unless you want to end up living in it.%20http://localhost:4000/how-buying-a-car-can-affect-your-pre-approval.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“You don’t want to buy a car, truck, or van during the mortgage loan process—unless you want to end up living in it.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing to consider when you go to buy a car is that the dealership will pull your credit. Some dealerships pull your credit 10 or 12 different times in order to get you the best rate or payment, and those are hard inquiries. If you come to us after you purchase a car, your credit score could be substantially lower. We also pull your credit during the mortgage process; interest rates are calculated largely based on your credit score. You may end up paying a higher interest rate because buying a car has lowered your credit score. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you pay cash for the vehicle? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you pay cash, it’s not going to affect your mortgage loan whatsoever.&lt;/strong&gt; We’re not going to see that on the credit report. Just make sure that you have set aside enough funds or assets for the down payment and closing costs for your home. Don’t deplete those to pay cash for a new vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a difference between buying, leasing, or financing a vehicle? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There really isn’t a difference as far as qualifying for a new home. &lt;strong&gt;We’ll look at a monthly lease payment or car payment and calculate that in your debt-to-income ratio.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you’ve had a lease for four years and the lease is about to be up. Even if you weren’t going to get a new lease, as your mortgage lender, we would still have to count that lease against you. Even if you only have a couple of payments left, you will have to get a new car somehow in order to get back and forth from work. The only way that would work would be if we could prove that you were paying cash for a new car. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it may benefit you to wait until you close on your new home before you start looking for a new car. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about what you can and can’t do during the mortgage loan process, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Managing Your Money and Accounts During the Loan Process</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/aX7nyXaECd4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we’re going to be talking about large deposits and why you shouldn’t make any large deposits into your bank account, switch banks, or transfer money between accounts during the mortgage loan process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What constitutes a large deposit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every loan program has their own guidance on what constitutes a large deposit. For example, in a conventional loan, a large deposit would be considered anything over 50% of the monthly qualifying income. For government loan programs, it would be 1% or more of the purchase price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the underwriters have the final say. Even though we have some guidance from the secondary market investors and government agencies about what they expect, underwriters can always question or require explanations for any deposits that seem out of the ordinary in the mortgage loan process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if you were given a financial gift?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gift funds are always acceptable if they’re from a first-generation relative and as long as they’re verified properly. By that, I mean that each loan program will have its own verification requirements. According to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, VA, and USDA, to document the gifts, we have to have a signed gift letter that we provide at application, which states that the funds are gifts and that no repayment is expected. This is signed by the one who gave the gift and yourself. We also need to see the donor’s most recent bank statements with no blackouts or altered account numbers, proving that they have the funds to give.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the underwriters will look through the donor’s bank statements for any unusually large deposits that might be constituted as suspicious. It’s their job to look for and report any signs of money laundering. After that, you’ll need a copy of the canceled check or the wire confirmation of the donor wiring the funds to your account so that we can see the funds coming from their account and going into yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Everything requires a paper trail in the mortgage loan process.%20http://localhost:4000/managing-your-money-and-accounts-during-the-loan-process.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Everything requires a paper trail in the mortgage loan process.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will switching banks hurt your chances of closing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switching banks isn’t necessarily as bad as having unsourced cash deposits. The important thing about switching banks is being able to demonstrate that the exact same amount of money from your old bank is transferred to your new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything requires a paper trail in the mortgage loan process. There are a lot of bad things that people try to use mortgage transactions for, like terrorism and laundering, so if you’re changing banks, just make sure that you’re saving all your paperwork from the closure of your previous account and the opening of the new one. It might be a good idea to start your new account with a cashier’s check from the old account instead of a cash deposit, just so that we can document and source it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will an overdrawn checking account hurt your chances of closing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mortgage loan process, we are looking for non-sufficient funds and overdrafts, as well as anything that will reflect on your ability to make your mortgage payment timely every month. Explainable overdrafts won’t necessarily be bad, but underwriters will look for numerous overdraft fees. If you’re consistently overdrawing your account, they may question your ability to make that payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s always best to manage your money and watch your bank account through the loan process. Your full financial history over the last couple years is being assessed, so you’ll need to have your best foot forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about the mortgage loan process or your financial account history, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help and advise you however we can.&lt;/p&gt;
