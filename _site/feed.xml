        <title>The Secret to Our Open House Success</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LpiywJxgHbI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had a lot of agents ask me recently about how we have such success with our mega open houses, so I wanted to explain our strategy today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start advertising for our open houses about a week in advance. &lt;strong&gt;When we decide to hold an open house, the home has to be right.&lt;/strong&gt; It has to have awesome curb appeal, and be within a few miles of some major traffic areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is the marketing. We start that one week in advance on all the major websites. We have our ISAs circle prospect the neighborhood, let the neighbors know, and we send some direct mail pieces out as well. &lt;strong&gt;We also do a lot of email marketing to our database of over 60,000 in addition to social media marketing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day of the open house, the most critical thing is that we put out a lot of signs. We hire couriers to go out and place signs, so all our agents have to do is show up to the open house, smile, and create some great relationships with some future prospects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We’ve had over 85 potential clients register at one of our open houses.%20http://davefriedmancoaching.com/the-secret-to-our-open-house-success.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We’ve had over 85 potential clients register at one of our open houses.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even if nobody buys the home or makes an offer,  you’ll still have the opportunity to work with some new buyers.&lt;/strong&gt; We average about one new buyer per open house who actually ends up doing business and closing on a purchase with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the open house is done, the couriers take down the signs, and you can follow up with all of the great contacts you made at the open house. &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’ve had over 85 people register with us at one of these open houses before.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open houses are still useful in today’s market and can really help you take your business to the next level. If you want to learn more about our strategy or if you just have any questions, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why My Team Uses Trello and We Recommend That You Do Too</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/T21ehL7jlG0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is Trello? Why do we at the Dave Friedman Team swear by it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trello is a simple and accessible web-based operations tool we use to manage all of our transactions. But how does it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time one of our agents sets an appointment (or an ISA sets an appointment for them), our operations team creates a card on Trello that details important information about the client the appointment is for. They also attach to the card whichever agent or ISA set the appointment. Once the agent meets with the client and they sign a buyer agency or listing agency agreement, they can then move that card from “set” to “met” to “signed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The card can then be moved to our “active listing” or “active buyer” board. When it moves to one of these boards, a whole checklist of tasks (e.g., taking pictures of the home) gets added to it that helps us help that client. In addition, our operations team does all kinds of customer service tasks on behalf of our agents so that they can focus on home sales and develop more business. Every time our operations team checks off a task box on that card, the corresponding agent is notified every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Trello is free, so you know it’s the right price.%20http://davefriedmancoaching.com/why-my-team-uses-trello-and-we-recommend-that-you-do-too.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Trello is free, so you know it’s the right price.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the client goes under contract, their card gets moved from the active listing or active buyer board to the “contract to close” board. Once it gets moved there, the agent is continuously notified as more tasks (e.g., home inspections) get checked off until closing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it all happens through this amazing operations tool. &lt;strong&gt;I highly recommend you check out Trello.&lt;/strong&gt; If you need more examples of how we use Trello to facilitate or home buying and home purchasing processes, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to share them with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, just call or email me anytime if you have any questions. I look forward to speaking with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Answering Your Questions About Zillow as a Lead Source</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oq0wxIQbg_8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I’ve been getting a lot of questions about  Zillow, including whether I use it to purchase leads, what kind of ROI it brings, and whether the site is worthwhile as an advertising tool at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zillow is a great, user-friendly platform, but it does have some drawbacks. It doesn’t update in real time, for instance. &lt;strong&gt;There are a lot of listings our buyer clients might find on there that are shown as active on the site despite already actually being under contract or closed.&lt;/strong&gt; This can cause a lot of frustration for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for whether it’s worth it to purchase leads on Zillow, it depends on your market. I can tell you that if you visit the site’s advertising portal, it’ll actually show you the availability for each ZIP code as well as ROI projections based on how much you spend. I’ve found that these ROI calculations are pretty accurate. They have a lot of data to draw upon. According to Zillow, the average Realtor who purchases ZIP code leads through their site will see a 3% to 4% conversion rate. In other words, an agent purchasing a hundred leads would end up closing on three to four of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Zillow representatives have even claimed to see a conversion rate of up to 10%. This is fantastic, but you would really have to work your leads to see such high conversion. Having said that, the ROI Zillow estimates you will make on a specific ZIP code is based on a few different factors.  &lt;strong&gt;It’s based on the average price point for the area and also the assumption that you are seeing a conversion rate of 3% or 4%.&lt;/strong&gt;In addition, it also depends on how many leads you’re purchasing and how much those leads cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our area, the average ROI that is shown across local ZIP codes is usually about 2.2x to 3.5x. The more expensive the ZIP code, the higher the cost per lead is. Consumers in these more affluent areas, though, may be more careful about giving out personal information and therefore more difficult to reach. It can be easier to convert leads in ZIP codes with lower price points, but you have to convert more leads to make the same amount of money when working with lower price points as opposed to higher ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The ROI you are willing to earn in your business is completely up to you.%20http://davefriedmancoaching.com/answering-your-questions-about-zillow-as-a-lead-source.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The ROI you are willing to earn in your business is completely up to you.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ROI you are willing to earn in your business is completely up to you. &lt;strong&gt;It’s all relative to the lead sources you could, or already do, invest in.&lt;/strong&gt; However, returns look much different for single agents versus teams. Let’s say an average team will pay out 50% of their commissions to an agent. If that commission check is $10,000 and the ROI is 3x. If you’re investing $3,300 into 16 Zillow leads and you’re able to convert one, that $10,000 commission check is essentially a 3x return for a single agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if a team owner invests $3,300 into 16 Zillow leads and converts one, this is a pretty high conversion. The $10,000 commission check is then split between the agent and the team owner. So the agent gets $5,000 and the team leader gets $5,000. But if you look at the true revenue, which subtracts expenses from the net total, your ROI ends up only being 1.5x. &lt;strong&gt;In other words, you would be spending $3,300 to be making approximately $5,000 in total. For most teams, this simply isn’t worth it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of lead sources out there that can bring returns as high as 30x to 40x. A source that brings you a consistent rate of return is the obvious choice. It doesn’t make sense to allocate your resources into an investment that brings smaller returns. If you do plan on investing in Zillow, make sure you negotiate with them on getting either your 10 most expensive or 10 most recent listings for free. Getting the ROI on ZIP code leads from Zillow is all about striking an equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Should You Be Advertising on Realtor.com?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/syMIVMgh9bU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste present-before-paste&quot;&gt;A lot of people have been asking me recently about how to advertise on Realtor.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;There are actually two different ways to advertise on this website: Connections With Buyers and Advantage Pro. Today, I’ll start with some of the things I like and dislike about each of these options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;Let’s start with Advantage Pro. In my opinion, Advantage Pro is something every Realtor should be paying for. It’s pretty simple. You’re paying to get the leads from your listings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The way Realtor.com charges depends on how many listings you carry, the average price point of those listings, and how many of listings you sell.&lt;/strong&gt;These and other factors are put into an algorithm to give you the price you’ll end up paying for this service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;Think of it this way: An agent in California who is selling $2 million properties should probably be paying more for their leads than an agent in our local area selling properties at an average list price of $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;For me and my market, I have an average price point of $285,000. So, I’m paying about $40 to $43 per lead through Advantage Pro. At the end of the day, I’m getting a 4.5x return on my investment. &lt;strong&gt;When you buy an Advantage Pro lead, you are the only agent who has access to that lead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;These Realtor.com leads also often convert a lot faster than leads you get from other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;The other way to invest in Realtor.com is by using Connections With Buyers, which is where you are purchasing ZIP code leads. There are two ways to use this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Advantage Pro is something every Realtor should be paying for.%20http://davefriedmancoaching.com/should-you-be-advertising-on-realtor-com.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Advantage Pro is something every Realtor should be paying for.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste present-before-paste&quot;&gt;You can either purchase a lead and be the only agent who receives that specific lead, or you can share the lead with another Realtor. In the latter option, you and another Realtor, chosen at random, have an equal opportunity to capture the lead. It all comes down to who is able to reach out more quickly. Splitting leads as opposed to having sole access actually makes the investment more cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;If you’re really good at lead conversion and have a quick response time, there’s no reason you shouldn’t be splitting leads when using this service. In fact, the ROI on these leads is higher when you split them. When you split these leads, the ROI can be between 3.5x or 4x your investment. If you aren’t splitting them, the ROI on those leads is about 2.5x your investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I personally don’t invest in Connections With Buyers anymore, though. In my opinion, it just isn’t worth it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Realtor’s Guide to the Industry: How to Get Online Reviews</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7j9fmQFnCyA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can you get online reviews from mainstream websites such as Zillow, Realtor.com, Google, and others that potential buyers and sellers are likely to use?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, Realtor.com doesn’t have any client testimonials. Homes.com, on the other hand, allows you to copy testimonials you may have from other websites and place them on their site. Sites like Zillow require the client to put a review into their systems. They have validation techniques to make sure that people aren’t fabricating reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can take advantage of the closing process to get reviews from clients.&lt;/strong&gt; Have your Zillow or Google profile pulled up while you’re at the closing table and, in the middle of your conversation about their experience, simply ask your clients to leave a review for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our team, we like to hold &lt;strong&gt;review contests&lt;/strong&gt;. These are best done on a quarterly basis, and usually result in a flurry of reviews. You don’t have to choose incredibly expensive prizes and gifts to incentivize clients, but in order to see whether or not that affects the outcome, we are offering up an iPad Mini, an Amazon Echo, and also an Apple Watch for our next contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these contests, &lt;strong&gt;we call up past clients and ask them to participate in the review contest.&lt;/strong&gt; One review on Zillow or Google, for example, will equal one entry into the drawing per site. If they leave a review on both websites, it will equal three entries. The contest lasts about three months, and when it’s over, we’ll draw three winners and announce them to our database. It will help to incorporate the news of these contests into your videos. For example, in some of my own videos, I will attach the announcement to a market update video, with the announcement gaining more urgency as the contest draws to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Consumers will choose the Realtors that they want to work with based on online reviews, much the same way that people choose restaurants or other establishments.%20http://davefriedmancoaching.com/a-realtors-guide-to-the-industry-how-to-get-online-reviews.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Consumers will choose the Realtors that they want to work with based on online reviews, much the same way that people choose restaurants or other establishments.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers will choose the Realtors that they want to work with based on online reviews, much the same way that people choose restaurants or other establishments. &lt;strong&gt;Getting a five-star review is critical.&lt;/strong&gt; Anything less than that could hurt you substantially. Using these contests is a way for you to get more five-star ratings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Websites like Yelp are a little more difficult. It’s not quite as popular in Charleston as it in California. If a client happens to use Yelp, their review will only stay on the site if they are an active user. Reviews that are left by one-time users appear suspicious to the site, which might assume that a business person created their own profile to leave reviews and boost their own business. &lt;strong&gt;In these cases, reviews are removed after a certain amount of time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s so critical to have a strong online presence with reviews. People will research you and your company to make sure that you have a good reputation and brand. It’s especially critical if you do invest money in websites such as Zillow to get leads because they’re advertising multiple people on the same listing; &lt;strong&gt;if you have more reviews than the other agents listed, then it’s more likely that someone will reach out to you for a question.&lt;/strong&gt; The same is true for agents with more detailed profiles set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this information can help you garner more reviews which are so essential to the business. If you have any more questions, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’d be more than happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Few Tips &amp; Tricks to Grow Your Database</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Up1TASa8FGo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in growing your database, here are a few tips I used right off the bat with my own database that will help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first place you should go is &lt;strong&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/strong&gt;. There’s a feature you can use that can export all of your contacts out of LinkedIn, along with those contacts’ phone numbers, names, work addresses, and email addresses. Those are all critical pieces of information you need in order to communicate value to those contacts through your database marketing plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next place to look is &lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;. Facebook has made some changes that have made exporting your contacts through them more difficult, but if you have a Yahoo email account, there’s a way to sync it with your Facebook account so all your Facebook contacts can be exported into your Yahoo contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=LinkedIn is a great place to start building your database.%20http://davefriedmancoaching.com/a-few-tips-tricks-to-grow-your-database.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“LinkedIn is a great place to start building your database.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aside from those two avenues, we also all use multiple email accounts&lt;/strong&gt;, including spam accounts, personal accounts, and business accounts, that each have the capacity to export all of your contacts. Most of these accounts are pretty reliable when it comes to saving contacts as you communicate with people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other methods we used to build up our database as well, so if you’d like to know more about this topic or you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever your goals for your business are in the coming new year, I’ve got a great tool to share with you that can help you achieve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tool is a spreadsheet that will tell you exactly what your activities must be throughout the year to reach a certain income. &lt;strong&gt;I’ve used this goal calculator for years and am actually going to be teaching a course on it soon&lt;/strong&gt;. If you’re interested in joining that class, let me know so I can get you enrolled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works. You input your income goals into the calculator along with a breakdown of your business and a couple of easy conversions. For example, what percentage of your listings go under contract? &lt;!--base32-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-base32--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This calculator breaks down your lead generation activities on the seller side of things as well as the number of clients you’ll need to work with on the buyer’s side to reach your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have all the metrics we’ve been measuring on my team for the last four years, so I can share those metrics with you if it would help. I can also give you some tips and tricks forleveling up your conversions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This calculator gives you an exact plan for meeting your goals.&lt;/strong&gt; It will also help you budget all the necessary expenses to run your business.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How the Abelson DISC Assessment Helps Our Team Find New Members</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_-hhl_2akFU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have been asking me recently how we find our new team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While behavioral assessments are a big part of this process, it’s important to note that the Tony Robbins DISC assessment is not geared toward use for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the best thing to use is something called the Abelson DISC. By using this route, you can assess people based on a specific area of business. There is a sales DISC assessment, a management DISC assessment, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The Tony Robbins DISC assessment is not geared toward use for business.%20http://davefriedmancoaching.com/how-the-abelson-disc-assessment-helps-our-team-find-new-members.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The Tony Robbins DISC assessment is not geared toward use for business.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People are scored based on different categories directly pertaining to how well they might function within a role at a business.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team has actually developed benchmarks for every position we have that are based on categories related to this assessment. I can send you these benchmarks if you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.&lt;/p&gt;
