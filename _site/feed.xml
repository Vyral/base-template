        <title>What Does the Fed’s Recent Interest Rate Hike Mean for You?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mRvxMsxg3Mc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m joined today by my preferred lender, Brian McKim over at SkyLine Home Plans, to talk about the Fed’s recent interest rate increase and how it’s going to affect you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In case you haven’t heard already, the FED raised rates by .25% this week.&lt;/strong&gt; However, this has been long expected and has been priced into the market for the last few months. The FED also announced that they would probably raise rates again two or three times in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even though the FED has increased their rates, mortgage interest rates have not been affected.&lt;/strong&gt;They remain excellent and still near historic lows. We don’t expect any major changes in the mortgage rate market for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions in the meantime, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Help Others in Burbank Celebrate Thanksgiving!</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kuG2-c9xdHI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are very fortunate to have great families, good jobs, and warm homes to go to during the Holidays. Unfortunately, this isn’t a reality for everyone in our area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we always help the Burbank Temporary Aid Center. Every year, they provide over 1,000 turkeys to families in need. This is our seventh year in a row, and we don’t plan on stopping anytime soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need your help! If you’d like to donate your time or some turkeys, please get in touch with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, refer to us as your No. 1 resource for real estate in the LA area!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What’s Our Fall Market Outlook?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mHSExP3Cgn0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy fall!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the season has changed, it’s time to look back on our market and update you on what’s happening now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, we had a phenomenal summer. &lt;strong&gt;Interest rates dropped back down to historic lows, and buyers are out there still buying away.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Homes are still very much in demand.%20lasells.com/whats-our-fall-market-outlook.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Homes are still very much in demand.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, properties are moving off the shelves in the lower and medium-priced markets. There’s a bit of a softening in the higher-end markets, but homes are still very much in demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about our LA market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Are You Ready to Join an HOA?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bzayk42ZXEk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Courtney Korb with the Brad Korb Real Estate Group today I’d like to answer 5 important questions about HOAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, what are the costs involved? &lt;strong&gt;Membership in an HOA requires a monthly fee that you’ll pay on top of your mortgage payment.&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure that you’re financially comfortable adding this fee to your monthly budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, know what is being covered. Are they covering water? Are they covering landscaping? Depending on the complex, different items will be included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=HOAs are always looking for new residents with new ideas to take part in the committees to try to make their community look even better.%20lasells.com/are-you-ready-to-join-an-hoa.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“HOAs are always looking for new residents with new ideas to take part in the committees to try to make their community look even better.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, what are the rules of the HOA? Many will have guidelines concerning pets, how many units are allowed to be rented out, etc. Be sure to ask about any restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, are you happy with how the complex looks? The HOA is responsible for appearances. Are the trees trimmed? Is the paint there? Are everyone’s patios looking nice? Consider these factors as a potential new resident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, can you get involved? &lt;strong&gt;Every HOA has a board of directors made up entirely of members living in the community.&lt;/strong&gt; Are you willing to step up? HOAs are always looking for new residents with new ideas to take part in the committees to try to make their community look even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about HOAs, or are looking at townhomes or condos, we would love to help you. Please give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to speaking with you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Essential Components of a Successful Home Purchase</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ZcW6b0mwWg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a homebuyer in today’s market, you need to focus on doing five specific things in order to have the smoothest and most profitable transaction possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Move quickly.&lt;/strong&gt; When you see something you like, you’ve got to be able to write an offer right away. If you wait a few days to make an offer, the property might be long gone by then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Understand the seller’s needs.&lt;/strong&gt; You can have your agent reach out to the seller’s agent and ask them what they’re looking for. Do they want a longer escrow period or a larger earnest money deposit? Whatever the case, you can craft your offer to the seller’s liking once you have this information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The more you know about the seller, the better offer you can craft.%20lasells.com/5-essential-components-of-a-successful-home-purchase.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The more you know about the seller, the better offer you can craft.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Have your loan officer call the listing agent.&lt;/strong&gt; If your loan officer lets the listing agent know personally that you are fully approved and ready to go, it can make a world of difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Be aggressive with your terms and pricing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Work with an experienced real estate agent.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve been in the business since 1979 and last year, my team sold 169 properties. You want an experienced agent that knows this market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to apply for the job of helping you buy your next home. If you need my help or if you just have any questions, you can give me a call or send me an email anytime. I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Does Our Summertime LA Market Look?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lsiwBz1xEeM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s been going on in our summertime market lately?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have very limited inventory, and the good news for sellers is homes are selling with multiple bids and for more than their listed price—sometimes even above their appraised value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The news is good for sellers in our market.%20lasells.com/how-does-our-summertime-la-market-look.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The news is good for sellers in our market.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our average days on market is fewer than 30 days, home prices are 5% to 7% higher compared to this time last year, and &lt;strong&gt;this momentum doesn’t seem like it will slow down for the rest of the summer or the foreseeable future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about the state of our current market or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to assist you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Announcing a Change with Your Credit</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/N8-rMP_UVf0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I wanted to talk to you about some exciting news that I just heard about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three credit agencies are changing the way that they’re reviewing credit scores, so &lt;strong&gt;12 million people are going to their scores boosted anywhere from 10 to 20 points.&lt;/strong&gt; This is exciting news for the consumers. With a higher credit score, you can get a lower interest rate and with a lower rate, you have more buying power to get a more expensive home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=With a lower rate, you have more buying power to get the home of your dreams.%20lasells.com/announcing-a-change-with-your-credit.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“With a lower rate, you have more buying power to get the home of your dreams.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is a brand-new opportunity that just came this July that I wanted to pass on to you. This way we can help you get qualified for a bigger loan amount and help you get that home that you’ve been looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or you’re looking to buy or sell your home, give me a call. I’d be happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thinking About Investing in Real Estate?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qC2jnwOJ0ac?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of my clients have been speaking with me recently about the fact that the stock market is at an all-time high and they are worried that a market correction is imminent. No matter when or if this correction comes, it’s smart to have a balanced portfolio. &lt;strong&gt;That means having money in the stock market and in other places, like real estate investments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I’d be happy to sit down with you.%20lasells.com/thinking-about-investing-in-real-estate.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“I’d be happy to sit down with you.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of information to understand when investing in real estate and it can get confusing. Knowing about cap rates, gross rate multipliers, and how they affect your numbers is important but can be tricky. I’ve been dealing with these types of investments for 37 years now and have many investment properties myself. If you have any questions about them, I can surely answer them. &lt;strong&gt;I’d be happy to sit down with you and explain to you how these things work and how you can use the information to make a smart decision.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me or just want to talk, give me a call or send me an email. I would be glad to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Grow Your Garden &amp; Add Color to Your Yard</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OPc2m_Bc5Is?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does your yard look like this spring?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve once again enlisted the advice from Mike of Mike’s Custom Lawn Care to give you some pointers on gardening and lawn care. This is the prime season to plant your vegetable garden and add some color around the exterior of your property with flowers. We had a great winter that produced lots of water, so if you haven’t done so already, now is the time to get started on these items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you want to &lt;strong&gt;prepare your soil with fertilizers and mulches.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s also a great time to plant your annuals so your summer color can go into effect. Pansies, primroses, primulas, and snapdragons are all great at adding color to small areas with bare spots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Now is the time to add some color to your property.%20lasells.com/how-to-grow-your-garden-add-color-to-your-yard.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Now is the time to add some color to your property.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also a good idea to &lt;strong&gt;check your sprinklers&lt;/strong&gt; and readjust your timers to prevent overwatering and make sure they’re watering the areas they’re intended for and not producing any runoff that might go into the street or a neighboring property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about gardening and/or maintaining your yard this time of year, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. You can also reach Mike at (818) 842-2660. We’d be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;
