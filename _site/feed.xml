        <title>How Does Square Footage Affect Your Home’s Value?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/63uDhIFt3zo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much does your home’s square footage affect its value? There are several factors to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you own a two-story, 3,000 square foot home that Zillow says is only worth $275,000 and you’re comparing it to a home across the street that’s also 3,000 square feet but has just sold for $350,000, why is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the home across the street is a ranch-style home where all 3,000 square feet are on one level instead of two, your home won’t sell for the same price. One reason for this is &lt;strong&gt;ranches are much more desirable in our Charlotte market.&lt;/strong&gt; Secondly, ranches are more expensive to build. The base of a ranch home is much larger, and it’s more expensive to build out than it is to build up because that involves more concrete, more plumbing, and more structure to be built around the property. This is why when you see homes that are $20 or $30 more per square foot for a single level, you can’t compare that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about homes with basements? What if your home is 6,000 square feet with two stories and a basement and all the other two-story, 6,000 square foot homes without basements are selling for $125 per square foot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=When it comes to calculating your home’s market value, you have to do a full equity evaluation.%20http://www.listwithdanjonesblog.com/how-does-square-footage-affect-your-homes-value.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“When it comes to calculating your home’s market value, you have to do a full equity evaluation.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your basement doesn’t cost as much to purchase as a home whose two stories account for all 6,000 square feet because your home’s square footage is 4,000 feet above ground and 2,000 feet below. That basement in general, depending on what sort of finishes it has, could be 30%, 40%, or 50% of the actual square footage cost of a home that has two stories instead of three.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If a home across the street sells for $500,000 and it’s the same square footage as yours, be careful in assuming yours will sell for $500,000 too.&lt;/strong&gt; You don’t know what upgrades that home has had or if the previous homeowners made any structural differences to make it a completely open floor plan. If both of your homes were built at the same time, that kind of renovation and other kinds of renovations might make it look newer than yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to making sure you know what your home is worth, you have to do a full equity evaluation that will account for square footage to a certain degree, but also &lt;strong&gt;the overall condition of a home, what upgrades have or have not been done, the location, and—most importantly—supply and demand. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the square footage, all of those factors determine the value of your home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this topic or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in the Charlotte area, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thinking of Listing on Your Own? You May Want to Reconsider</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/C9rM9gjsNy0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people ask me whether selling For Sale By Owner (or FSBO) is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you list FSBO, the people who come to your home wanting to negotiate a deal are generally unqualified. They’ll come to your door without an agent and without a pre-qualification letter. In fact, most FSBO buyers need owner financing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people who want to sell their home simply can’t do owner financing, since they typically want to buy another home with what they earn from their listing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, these kinds of buyers aren’t bringing great offers to the table. People who know that you’re listing FSBO will be well aware of the fact that you aren’t being represented. Therefore, you can be sure &lt;strong&gt;they’re going to try to take advantage of this fact by giving you a lowball offer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the National Association of Realtors did up the percentage of successful FSBO listings from 2% or 3% to 5% or 6% depending on the part of the country. Still, this leaves FSBO sellers with just a 6% chance at best to sell their homes on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Don’t get caught without representation.%20http://www.listwithdanjonesblog.com/thinking-of-listing-on-your-own-you-may-want-to-reconsider.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Don’t get caught without representation.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, &lt;strong&gt;those 6% of successful closings really aren’t that successful at all,&lt;/strong&gt; since the final sale price is almost always far below the home’s true value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People sometimes falsely assume that they’re saving money by not working with a Realtor, but the truth is that FSBO sellers ultimately walk away with much less money. You really need to be careful trying to list on your own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, my team and I encountered a FSBO seller who only wanted $525,000 for a property. We were of course able to find a client willing to give that amount, but the home actually appraised for $615,000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seller was ecstatic at closing, since they believed they had gotten a great deal. From the perspective of our team, though, we saw that they actually still left a lot of money on the table. This could’ve been prevented with the help of a qualified agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get caught without representation. The chances of success aren’t good, and &lt;strong&gt;people who are successful in listing FSBO still end up receiving 5%, 10%, or 15% less for their homes.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Don't Break the Bank With a Big Down Payment</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BD4BIKUFz24?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a common misconception that you need a down payment of 10%, 15%, or 20% in order to purchase a home. However, there are actually a few options out there that allow buyers to put zero down on their home purchase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first option pertains specifically to people who are serving, or have previously served, in the military. As a way to thank our veterans and active duty military members for their service, &lt;strong&gt;the VA loan allows them to purchase a home for no money down and with a very low interest rate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who aren’t in the military, there are still options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USDA loan, for example, is a great route for anyone considering living in a rural area. There are a few different applicable areas around the outskirts of Charlottesville, Belmont, Mount Holly, Troutman, and certain other places all qualify. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This loan is a great option, since it has low interest rates, no down payment, and requires no PMI—which is mortgage insurance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If neither of these programs is applicable to you, there are still options. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=There are a few options out there that allow buyers to put zero money down for their home purchase.%20http://www.listwithdanjonesblog.com/dont-break-the-bank-with-a-big-down-payment.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“There are a few options out there that allow buyers to put zero money down for their home purchase.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain programs exist that allow you to pay as low as 1% down. A couple of our in-house lenders &lt;strong&gt;actually allow buyers to qualify for a conventional loan with just a 1% down payment.&lt;/strong&gt; To qualify for this, you do need a credit score above 640 to 660 depending on your job and assets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, grant programs through the state can also provide down payment assistance. &lt;strong&gt;The North Carolina Grant Program is still offering $15,000 for first-time homebuyers.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a great program. If you are a new buyer or haven’t bought a home in a few years, we’d love to help you look into this product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, making sure that you have the best financing options is incredibly important and could save you hundreds on a monthly basis. When you work with us, we do our best to make sure you get the best rates, terms, and conditions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Generate Multiple Offers the Right Way</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pERMP-PLVtY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the key to getting multiple offers on your property?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people assume they have to price their home $20,000 or $30,000 below market value, but that’s not true. What you do have to know, though, is how your home will fit into today’s market. To find this out, &lt;strong&gt;you have to do a full equity valuation on your property and a market absorption analysis to calculate its true market value. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average person in our area does a CMA, or comparative market analysis, to calculate a home’s market value. This is an old-fashioned, real-estate-101 process that typically uses as little as three sold properties to come up with a number your home might be worth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you allow a CMA to determine the market value for your home, you’re in trouble.%20http://www.listwithdanjonesblog.com/how-to-generate-multiple-offers-the-right-way.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you allow a CMA to determine the market value for your home, you’re in trouble.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CMAs offer a little value, but when it comes to knowing the market, the problem with a CMA is you don’t know what happened with those three sold properties. Were they relocation homes? Was one of the properties a distressed home? Was there a divorce involved somewhere? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you allow a CMA to determine the market value for your home, you’re in trouble.&lt;/strong&gt; You might get multiple offers, but they’ll likely be for $20,000 or $30,000 less than what your home’s actually worth and you’ll end up leaving money on the table. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flipside, you can’t price your home extremely high, either. Regardless of the quality of your home’s marketing, overpricing it will turn off a large segment of buyers and force you to eventually reduce its price. Doing that will also cause buyers to wonder what might be wrong with your home. By the time you do finally reduce your home’s price to where it should’ve been in the first place, you’ll earn 5% to 10% less because buyers will deduct you for the number of days the home spent on the market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To generate multiple offers the right way, &lt;strong&gt;I recommend hiring a professional team of agents like us to help you.&lt;/strong&gt; We can come into your home, give it a full equity evaluation, and price it appropriately. From there, we’ll use aggressive marketing to attract a lot of offers from qualified buyers within a handful of days your home gets listed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about getting multiple offers on your property, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to seeing you at the closing table.

        <title>Are We in a Bubble?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9vx2BdIbygM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people are asking if we’re in a bubble. To figure that out, the first place we should look is at the numbers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have been asking if right now is a good time to buy or sell. But, another broader question I’m hearing a lot is, “Are we in a bubble?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To figure that out, I think it’s important to look at the numbers. Over the last three years, **the market has seen consistent growth and the interest rates have generally stayed low. **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see from this that there isn’t a very high likelihood that the Feds will be raising interest rates in a significant way. In fact, some people are saying interest rates could even drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lower interest rates are, the more people can afford. This is especially important since the somewhat drastic increases we’ve seen in prices over the last two to three years. Right now in our area, we’re starting to see prices similar to those we saw in 2006, 2007, and 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though interest rates typically rise along with price, this isn’t a trend we’re currently seeing. We can expect prices to continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**We’re also seeing homes spending fewer days on market, as well as lower inventory overall. **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=IF YOU’RE THINKING OF BUYING, NOW IS STILL A GOOD TIME.%20http://www.listwithdanjonesblog.com/are-we-in-bubble.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“IF YOU’RE THINKING OF BUYING, NOW IS STILL A GOOD TIME.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you’re thinking of buying, now is still a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re considering selling, the most important thing is to pay attention to supply and demand within the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I’d have to say that most people would not agree that we’re in a bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Do You Choose a Quality Agent?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uy7gry9yqxo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are looking for an agent to help with your real estate transaction, how can you know if they will do a good job?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the recent influx of agents into our area’s market, a lot of people have come to me asking, “How do I find the right agent?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer depends on what kind of real estate transaction you’re about to undertake. If you are in the market to purchase a home you should be looking for a lender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t settle for your first encounter, be sure to shop around to get the best rates and the best terms and conditions on your mortgage. You should also get a buyer’s roadmap. A buyer’s roadmap will show you how we get priority access to all the best deals on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will help you win out against the competition. Having the roadmap will be your guide to success as a buyer, but you’ll still need a quality agent. When looking for the right agent, be sure to ask how many homes they sell per year, how well they know the area, and how well they know financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sellers will need a game plan, as well. Having a selling guide and using high-quality marketing will be key. **My team and I offer a 151-step marketing guide that can help you have as smooth and successful a transaction as possible. **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=VERY FEW OTHER AGENTS, OR TEAMS OF AGENTS, CAN DO WHAT WE CAN.%20http://www.listwithdanjonesblog.com/how-do-you-choose-quality-agent.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“VERY FEW OTHER AGENTS, OR TEAMS OF AGENTS, CAN DO WHAT WE CAN.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full-disclosure, full-detail marketing strategies are also something we do. From 3D tours to aerial drone shots and more, we have all the resources to help our sellers make their listing as attractive as possible. We also offer a 75-point photography checklist designed to ensure that your home is being presented in the best light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very few other agents, or teams of agents, can do what we can—let alone at such a high level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out if an agent will be able to get you top dollar, there are a few questions you should ask as a seller. How many homes have they sold this year? Do they have a resume?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With as many agents as are coming in our area, we’re seeing a few of them underpricing homes and therefore only selling between two to four properties a year. &lt;strong&gt;Selling quickly isn’t worth it if an agent is undercutting their client’s profit by thousands.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that sets my team apart is that we only accept full price offers for our clients. You need an agent who has a game plan for getting you at or above list price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Who Can You Trust to Sell Your Rental Property?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iugDiZMuHQQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to sell your home that’s currently being rented, should you try to sell it through the leasing company? Here’s why I advise against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few common questions I’ve received in recent weeks that I wanted to address for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Is there any benefit to choosing a team of real estate agents versus a leasing company?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: A client had a home rented and was looking to sell it. The people leasing the home really wanted to list the house. I told them that the problem was that they wanted to list the house—not try to find a buyer and sell it in a reasonable amount of time for top dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=DON'T ASK SOMEONE TO SELL YOUR HOME UNLESS THEY SELL HOMES REGULARLY AT A HIGH LEVEL.%20http://www.listwithdanjonesblog.com/who-can-you-trust-to-sell-your-rental.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“DON’T ASK SOMEONE TO SELL YOUR HOME UNLESS THEY SELL HOMES REGULARLY AT A HIGH LEVEL.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone once told me that when you ask someone to do something they don’t normally do at a very high level, you probably won’t get the best results. Just like you wouldn’t call your kids’ orthodontist for a root canal, you shouldn’t call your leasing company to sell your house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a home that’s rented that you’re looking to sell, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Few Things to Know Before Buying New Construction</title>

&lt;p&gt;Whatever you do, don’t start the new home building process without an agent’s help. You could be setting yourself up for failure without even trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been noticing that a lot of our clients over the years have misconceptions about how buying new construction homes work. We wanted to go through the process and clarify any questions you may have today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re considering building a new home, it’s always best to go into the process with an agent who has experience working with and negotiating these kinds of deals.&lt;/strong&gt; You might think that you could save some money as a buyer by not using an agent, but you would be completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a builder knows you don’t have representation, they are going to run you over and you will end up overpaying for a property. Until you have an agent who knows what they’re doing when it comes to negotiating with these builders, you won’t have as successful of a home purchase as you could have had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=AN AGENT CAN HELP YOU GET A LOWER INTEREST RATE AND BETTER UPGRADES.%20http://www.listwithdanjonesblog.com/a-few-things-to-know-before-buying-new.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“AN AGENT CAN HELP YOU GET A LOWER INTEREST RATE AND BETTER UPGRADES.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By working with an agent, you can get a lower interest rate, better upgrades, and other discounts that you wouldn’t be able to get on your own. &lt;strong&gt;The expertise of an agent really pays off in situations like this.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re working with one of our buyer’s agents here at the Dan Jones Team, let them know if you’re interested in this kind of property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of our great agents, let me give a shout out to one of our new agents, Karen, who has been doing fantastic as of late putting homes under contract and is working with several new construction buyers right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, if you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Latest News From the Charlotte Real Estate Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nS0G8Uret6s?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not summer yet, but the Charlotte real estate market is the hottest market we have ever seen. I’ll go over more details for you today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are thinking about selling a home in the next three to six months, you should know that **the real estate market is on fire right now. **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the hottest market that we’ve seen. Homes are selling after 30 to 40 days on the market; some homes are selling in 60 to 70 days. This is a much faster pace than the usual 130 to 140 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=ON AVERAGE, HOMES ARE SELLING IN 30 TO 40 DAYS.%20http://www.listwithdanjonesblog.com/the-latest-news-from-charlotte-real.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“ON AVERAGE, HOMES ARE SELLING IN 30 TO 40 DAYS.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are thinking of buying or selling a home, we would love to show you what we do differently to help you reach your real estate goals. We can sell houses in half of the average days on market; in other words, **we can sell your home in 15 to 20 days. **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One marketing tool we like to implement is our “Full Price Offers Only” sign that we put on each of our listings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For buyers, interest rates are still incredibly low, but they are starting to creep up a bit. Now is a great time to jump into the market while rates are still low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about navigating our current market, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why You Should Hire Us to Sell Your House</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/59HZOzoD3LE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking about selling your house this year, you need to reach out to us. Allow me to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking about selling your house this year, you need to reach out to our company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do a lot of things to sell your house quickly and for top dollar, including our &lt;strong&gt;VIP Seller Program.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a ‘coming soon’ type of program that markets your home to thousands of people before it even hits the market. Our average days on market has been cut in half simply because of this program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be the difference in you needing to make an extra mortgage payment or two on your home while you sell, and that’s huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also offer a 151-step marketing tool, which we’ll happily send you. Whether you’ve sold a home recently or not, you’d be surprised at all the things we do to sell your house for top dollar every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d also be happy to send you our 2016 resume. **We sold more than 200 homes last year, and we’re well on our way to 250 to 300 sales this year. **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=WE SOLD MORE THAN 200 HOMES IN 2016 AND WE’RE WELL ON OUR WAY TO 250 THIS YEAR.%20http://www.listwithdanjonesblog.com/why-you-should-hire-us-to-sell-your.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“WE SOLD MORE THAN 200 HOMES IN 2016 AND WE’RE WELL ON OUR WAY TO 250 THIS YEAR.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you sell your house, most agents will come out for a comparative market analysis (CMA) based on square footage, but it’s impossible to know the exact condition that every single home sold under. It could have been the result of a divorce, an estate sale, or a short sale, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do a full equity evaluation based on a market absorption sheet. We’ll look at everything that’s happened in the last 12 to 24 months to figure out where we need to be and what we need to do to sell your house for top dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking about selling, it’s a must. Just give us a call or send us an email if you’re thinking about selling, we’d love to help.&lt;/p&gt;
