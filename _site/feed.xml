        <title>What Should You Know About New Construction in Savannah?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/r-XD503lU18?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey there, I just wanted to take a second and say thanks for joining us on our blog. I wanted to talk for a few minutes today about new construction here in Savannah. Now that the real estate market is booming once again, we are seeing more and more new construction out there, pretty much anywhere you can think of in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking at purchasing a new construction property, that’s great. However, you should know that if you aren’t represented by a Realtor, you are making yourself very vulnerable. While the builder’s agent is credible, they are still looking out for the builder’s best interest. You need a professional on your side to counteract this, and protect your best interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this gives you a little bit of insight into new construction. If you have any questions about this or about any other topic, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. We look forward to speaking with you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Where Is the Savannah Market Heading?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lzGny4HgMRI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to give you a quick update on the Savannah market, so you can make informed real estate decisions this summer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conditions are great in our area right now; we’re seeing a lot of activity and values are on the rise. The good news is that not only are home values increasing, but they’re increasing at a sustainable rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been fortunate to see incredibly low interest rates for an extended period of time and they are still quite low. However, rates are beginning their upward climb and are likely to jump significantly over the next year or two, making now a great opportunity to lock in low monthly payments on a new home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about the market in your neighborhood, or if you want to explore your options in real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’re always happy to talk with you, and encourage you to do so soon!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>4 Ways to Get More Money for Your Savannah Home</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DaUKqqRcRHk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time, I touched briefly on the great market conditions we’ve had here in Savannah. Today, I want to follow up with some tips about this exciting spring season! If you’re considering selling, there are some things you can do to increase your chances of a successful home sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plan: There are always tons of little things that need to be done around the home. If you plan well enough, you can list your home before the market gets too busy, which will generate interest and attract buyers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Landscaping: This is something that needs to be addressed every season. Anything you can do to increase your curb appeal should be done!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stage your home: Having a professional stager come in and make your home look fantastic will give you a huge advantage in the marketplace. Staging will show buyers the space in your home to its fullest potential.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Touch up and make little repairs: Fix stains in the carpets and dents in the wall. New construction is making a comeback in Savannah, so many of the homes you’ll be competing against will be brand new. Having your home looking the best is going to increase your chances of standing out in a crowded market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about preparing your home for the market, or if you would like our assistance for any of your real estate needs, give us a call or shoot us an email. We look forward to helping you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What You Can Expect from the Savannah Marketplace</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dwTYaj-YOzQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m going to give you a quick recap of the Savannah real estate market!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market has been incredibly active over the last few months and we’ve kept very busy. In 2014, the market continued its steady growth and price levels continued to rise as well. Since the turn of the new year, the positive signs we were seeing have only accelerated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know, real estate is all about supply and demand. Homes are flying off the shelf when they’re priced well, staged well, and marketed well. As far as interest rates are concerned, most experts are predicting an increase in interest rates around May or June, which may have an affect on our market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it stands, we’re heading into spring with our hands full. The market is active, and we’re expecting it to get even busier as the year moves along!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about our market, or if you could use our help in any way, give us a call or shoot us an email at www.McIntoshRealtyTeam.com. We look forward to hearing from you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title> Is an Open House a Good Idea When Selling Your Savannah Home?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZoqD2jFgVsU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the spring selling season just around the corner, we figured it would be a good time to discuss open houses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are they worth it? If so, what value do they provide?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we’ll answer those questions, so you can make informed decisions when selling your Savannah home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The McIntosh Team often holds open houses, but we prefer to do them when the home is vacant. The reason we prefer showing an empty or properly staged house is because a lot of people will come through. If you have valuables or cherished family items, you put them at risk during an open house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases, you’ll only have a few Realtors watching your home. If five different people show up at the same time, you may have strangers wandering through your home, which is never a good thing. Obviously, we try to do the best we can to keep an eye on everyone, but it can be very difficult. The biggest risk of having an open house, then, is how uncontrollable it can be. While rare, it’s something to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are many advantages to having an open house. Any exposure is good exposure when it comes to selling your home. Will their be tire kickers, neighbors, and professional lookers? Of course, but they might have friends, family, or coworkers who are looking to buy. The chance that they might spread the word about your home makes an open house completely worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all about weighing the risks against the rewards of having an open house. Ultimately, it comes down to your specific situation. If you have questions about whether an open house is the right move for you, give us a call or shoot us an email. We would love to help you make the decision that will benefit your home sale!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Avoid Being Surprised by HOA Fees When Selling Your Savannah Home </title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/f3sDdqinZ_U?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, we’ve received many questions from those of you who watch our videos, and we are going to do everything in our power to answer them in future videos. Today, we want to address the questions of HOA fees and how they can affect you, whether you’re buying or selling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, we worked with a seller who ran into HOA fees and was taken by surprise. When we first listed their home, we looked at the mortgage payoff, property taxes, real estate commission, and all the things that are usually figured in to help sellers understand what to expect on the HUD statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing the seller was not aware of was a HOA fee in the amount of $850. He didn’t realize that he had agreed to it back when he purchased the house. Any time the title is transferred, under the agreement he made, he had to pay an $850 fee to the homeowners’ association in order to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just want this to be a warning to you, so you aren’t caught off guard when selling a home. You need to be aware of the homeowners’ association fees you agreed to years ago when you first purchased your home. It’s something you’ll want to keep in mind and think about when budgeting for your move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the buyer side of things, be aware that you may have to pay an initiation fee to join the homeowners’ association in your new neighborhood. They’re typically not too expensive, but you need to keep an eye out for them as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this topic, or would like real estate assistance of any kind, don’t hesitate to give us a call or shoot us an email at any time. We would love to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Do Changing Conditions Mean for You?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dmy0W-Dp3cE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of the year is right around the corner, so we thought we would take this time to recap what we saw in Savannah real estate this year, as well as make our predictions for 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, 2014 was a fantastic year for real estate in our area. Sales rose in all but one price point, with the $250,000-$500,000 price range leading the way with a 10% increase in sales! The only price point that saw a loss in sales was the $0-$100,000 range, which saw a drop in sales of 7.4% in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as interest rates are concerned, we’ve been hovering just under 4% all year long, which is fantastically low. According to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Mortgage Banker Association, and the National Association of Realtors, interest rates are predicted to rise to anywhere from 4.7% to 5.4% by the fourth quarter of next year. That increase in rates may seem small, but it will make a significant difference in your mortgage payments and your ability to qualify for a loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another topic worth discussing is distressed property sales. Back in 2011, 35% of sales in our market were distressed properties. As of September of 2014, we’re down to 10%! It’s great that the number of distressed properties is falling, as they adversely affect varying price points. We expect that percentage to drop even lower next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foot traffic rose substantially in 2014, when compared to the same time period in 2013. We’re expecting yet another increase in 2015, which is a great indicator of how active the market is going to be. Let’s just say we’re excited for what the new year is going to bring us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about market conditions, or would like real estate advice of any kind, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to help you solve your real estate problems!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you have a safe and happy Christmas and New Year! We look forward to talking to you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fall is here and winter is coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is colder weather, and if you aren’t prepared, you could wind up paying a ton of money to keep warm this winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should definitely get a maintenance check on your heater, as well as replace high wattage light bulbs with energy efficient ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are selling your home, you want a buyer who will offer you a good price for your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are some relatively unknown pitfalls you should be aware of with buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one, you need to make sure that the buyer is pre-qualified before they submit an offer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>4 Easy Steps to Find Yourself the Perfect Home</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/40ndmCoX690?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an exciting time of year for us in Savannah as the weather warms up and our buyers and sellers enter the market. Today’s topic will actually be more focused on our buyer’s side. We have a lot of questions coming in, especially from first time home buyers. We’re going to briefly list some things that first time buyers can do to prepare to buy a home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contact a Lender: You need to have an idea of what kind of home you will be able to buy so that we can narrow your search options and find you the best available home. We can refer you to a lender to start your home search. Your lender will let you know what you qualify for and how you can prepare to buy a home.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Lenders can also give you an idea about what your monthly payments would be and what price point you would then fall under so you don’t waste time looking at properties that you cannot afford.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make a Wish List: After talking to a lender, sit down and make wish list of what you would like to see in your next home. Highlight on that list the things that are ‘must-haves’ such as a good school district or a large backyard. The more you can narrow down what you want in a home, the easier it is for us to find what you want. Keep in mind that some of these ‘must-haves’ can be added on to your property after a purchase, like a fence or a shed, for example.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a Realtor: You want to make sure you’re partnering with someone that you can trust and someone that will be looking out for your best interests. There is no cost associated with having a buyer’s agent, because those costs are included in the seller’s expenses. The buyers agent will be working in your favor, and will help to find you the right home at the right price.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start Looking: After you have completed these steps, you can then begin to start looking for a suitable home. Your agent can search the MLS for the features that you want in your home and you can get signed up to be notified when a suitable property becomes available on the MLS. Always refer to your agent for any questions about homes you’re looking to buy.
If you’re looking to buy a home, please contact us and we would be glad to aid you in your home search. We have all the best systems in place to find you the best homes at the best available prices. We are here to serve all of your Savannah real estate needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
