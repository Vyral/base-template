        <title>Why You Should Avoid Pricing Your Home Too High</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JA5PD3XpHGY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be sure to avoid these three pitfalls created when you overprice your home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it a bad idea to overprice your home when you put it on the market?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, remember that people who browse for homes online can see how long a home has been on the market&lt;/strong&gt;. When a home is overpriced, it tends to stagnate on the market, and when buyers see that, they’ll probably think that something’s wrong with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another danger of overpricing your home is getting burnt out. The longer your home is on the market, the more worn down you’ll get having to clean your house at a moment’s notice to prepare for a showing—especially if you have kids and/or pets. &lt;strong&gt;Your hopes may get high that each buyer who visits will be the last, but if they’re aware that your home is overpriced, you might be in for a disappointment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Chances are you won’t be able to fool the buyer about the value of your home.%20http://colemererealtyvideoblog.com/why-you-should-avoid-pricing-your-home-too-high.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Chances are you won’t be able to fool the buyer about the value of your home.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, it’s worth noting that buyers today have more information at their fingertips than they ever have before. They’re both astute and diligent about comparing homes to others they’ve seen in the market.  Even if they don’t have the exact data on your home, they do think about the general cleanliness of the home, what upgrades it has, and what features it has compared to homes that are priced lower than yours. &lt;strong&gt;Chances are you won’t be able to fool the buyer about the value of your home&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this topic or real estate in general, reach out to your Colemere Realty specialists. We’d love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Understanding the Importance of Getting a Home Inspection</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UF0r43ywUVQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss why a home inspection is vitally important to those buying a home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes an inspection such a necessary part of the real estate transaction for homebuyers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you go under contract for the purchase of a home, included in your agreement is a timetable for any due diligence you’d like to conduct. Consider this your opportunity to inspect the property to the fullest extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you hire a home inspector, they’ll come with a checklist of items, and they’ll examine those items to ensure sufficient functionality of each&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, you may get swept up in all the excitement of going under contract on your new home, only to have an inspector identify some issues. That’s why it’s so important to have a professional inspector come in—&lt;strong&gt;their preset checklist will be comprised of around 300 items, and they’ll document every problem area they uncover in a thorough fashion&lt;/strong&gt;. This way, you’re not surprised by the actual condition of the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The inspection is instrumental in letting you know the exact condition of the home and about anything you weren’t aware of beforehand.%20http://colemererealtyvideoblog.com/understanding-the-importance-of-getting-a-home-inspection.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The inspection is instrumental in letting you know the exact condition of the home and about anything you weren’t aware of beforehand.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a checklist of this length, an inspector is bound to find flaws or areas that need servicing in the home. We’ve even seen cases where inspectors have found issues in new construction properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If and when issues arise out of the inspection, as the buyer, &lt;strong&gt;you’ll need to identify the biggest concerns&lt;/strong&gt; and ask yourself: If any issues were to go unaddressed, how would it impede my ability to move forward smoothly? From there, &lt;strong&gt;you’ll essentially renegotiate with the seller to either make those repairs or give you a credit toward the repairs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the inspection is instrumental in letting you know the exact condition of the home and about anything you weren’t aware of beforehand, so you’ll be comfortable with what you’re getting into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about today’s topic or anything else real estate-related, please feel free to reach out to your Colemere Realty specialist. We’d love to help you however we can!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Are There Opportunities to Buy With a Low Down Payment?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yhgSBDdE2qU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;You aren&amp;rsquo;t doomed to pay 20% down. Here are some of the options you have.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get this question a lot: Are there opportunities to buy a home with low or no money down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various news outlets have claimed that you need a 20% down payment in order to purchase a home, but it’s not true—&lt;strong&gt;you can certainly buy a home with zero down&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several loan programs out there, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://utahhousingcorp.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Utah Housing Corporation&lt;/a&gt; loan or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://eligibility.sc.egov.usda.gov/eligibility/welcomeAction.do&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt; loan, that help you buy with either nothing down or a very low amount. However, each program does have requirements. &lt;strong&gt;These may include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Income&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Size of household&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Location&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Home condition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=There are many factors that go into this, and a lot of them depend on your specific situation.%20http://colemererealtyvideoblog.com/are-there-opportunities-to-buy-with-a-low-down-payment.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“There are many factors that go into this, and a lot of them depend on your specific situation.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many factors that go into this, and a lot of them depend on your specific situation. &lt;strong&gt;Your best bet is to speak with a professional real estate agent&lt;/strong&gt;, and we’d be more than happy to have a conversation and figure out what works best for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, would like more information, or are ready to talk about loan options, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What to Know as We Kick off the Spring Selling Season</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fKuB0aktmGs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are things headed in our real estate market as spring begins? Keep reading to find out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we’re going to give you a bit of a recap on the first quarter of the year and what to expect as we move into spring and summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re ready to kick off the spring selling season after a slight slowdown toward the end of the last year&lt;/strong&gt;. Even though the number of units sold has gone down lately, that has to do more with a lack of inventory than it does with the health of our market. We’re still in a healthy, strong seller’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, the median price in the single-family home market is up to $355,000 and we’re seeing an appreciation rate of around 8%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We’re still in a healthy, strong seller’s market.%20http://colemererealtyvideoblog.com/what-to-know-as-we-kick-off-the-spring-selling-season.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We’re still in a healthy, strong seller’s market.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What economic factors have led to this? One of them is a bit of a slowdown in terms of job growth. &lt;strong&gt;At the same time, we’re not seeing as many people move to the state of Utah, and wage growth isn’t necessarily keeping up with how fast real estate is evolving&lt;/strong&gt;. A wage increase is not expected this year, but it’s something we’d really like to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this mean to you? Well, if you’re thinking about buying or selling this spring, you might want to jump in early and get ahead of the summer rush. &lt;strong&gt;If you get in now while prices are still high, inventory is still extremely low, and the rush has yet to enter the fray, you could stand to get a better deal&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for us about real estate in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>You’re Invited to Our Founder’s Day Celebration This March</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ljS5TRHo2YA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;2019 is our 66-year anniversary of being in the real estate business, and to celebrate, we&amp;rsquo;re hosting our very own Founder&amp;rsquo;s Day celebration this March.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019 marks the 66th year that Colemere Realty has been in business, and we’ve decided to throw a party to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we’ve brought in our father (and previous owner of Colemere Realty) Tom Colemere to tell the story of how our brokerage got started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our grandfather founded Colemere Realty in 1953. He originally worked in the furniture and appliance business, but a fire damaged his establishment and left him in debt. To pay off that debt, he became a real estate agent. A short time after, he became his own boss. We joined the family business many years later, and a large part of our continued success is due to our father Tom being a great mentor to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you plan on attending, please RSVP.%20http://colemererealtyvideoblog.com/youre-invited-to-our-founders-day-celebration-this-march.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you plan on attending, please RSVP.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to commemorate our 66th year in business, &lt;strong&gt;we want to invite you to our Founder’s Day celebration on March 8 right here at our office from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you plan on attending, please &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bNk_MKQdtn1tFByN8kc2A6Ihm3lUC9LSFcxjOlbtWHA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RSVP here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;with your name, number, and what kind of pie you would like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for us in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to speak with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Check With Your Local Municipality Before Renting Out an ADU</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zEiXerPGQyo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accessory dwelling units represent a great opportunity for homeowners, but there are rules for renting them out that you need to pay attention to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may know, Salt Lake City passed an ordinance last October that allowed all homeowners to have accessory dwelling units (ADUs) on their property. If you’re looking to make some extra money through real estate investing or you’d like to have additional family members (such as in-laws) live on your property, ADUs are a great option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, today we want to remind you that there are different types of legislation being considered for different cities regarding ADUs, so &lt;strong&gt;it’s important that you check with your local municipality before deciding to rent one&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason we mention this is because companies that specialize in ADUs, such as Airbnb and VRBO, were market disruptors when they first came on the scene. They gave homeowners a platform to rent their ADUs, and as more and more started doing it, state and city governments became concerned that a surplus of ADUs would become a potential neighborhood nuisance. They don’t want streets to become overcrowded with cars or households with ADUs to become disruptive, so they stepped in and established some ground rules for renting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=There are a lot of great opportunities to be had with ADUs, but you need to make sure that you follow these rules before adding one to your property.%20http://colemererealtyvideoblog.com/check-with-your-local-municipality-before-renting-out-an-adu.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“There are a lot of great opportunities to be had with ADUs, but you need to make sure that you follow these rules before adding one to your property.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of great opportunities to be had with ADUs, but you need to make sure that you follow these rules before adding one to your property. Also, &lt;strong&gt;you should consider the management aspect of renting out an ADU because that responsibility falls on you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any more questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today we&amp;rsquo;d like to shed some light on the hot topic of accessory dwelling units.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in making some extra money through real estate investing, or simply how to have your mother-in-law (legally) live with you, then having an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) on your property may be the perfect solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADUs, which can be attached or detached, allow one additional family to reside on your lot&lt;/strong&gt;. This can be a wonderful option for those with elderly parents moving in or if you have adult children coming back to live with you temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Our team would be happy to assist if you are curious about how to pursue this option.%20http://colemererealtyvideoblog.com/check-out-this-quick-guide-to-accessory-dwelling-units.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Our team would be happy to assist if you are curious about how to pursue this option.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you so choose, you can charge rent for those living in your ADU, as we mentioned earlier. So, in the light of recent legislation pertaining to this subject, our team would be happy to assist if you are curious about how to pursue this option.&lt;/p&gt;
