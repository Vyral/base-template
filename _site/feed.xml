        <title>Sellers: Don't Make This Common Mistake</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EmgU5u4kITA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, we’re in the prime selling season here in Chicago. But, if you have plans to put your home on the market, there is one mistake you must avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many sellers hire the agent who estimates the highest price for their home.&lt;/strong&gt; If one agent tells them they should list for $550,000 and another tells them they should list for $500,000, most sellers will, unfortunately, choose the agent who gave that higher price. However, this is actually the No.1 listing mistake a seller could make in our market. The market, not your agent, dictates price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, sellers should hire an agent they like and trust. They should hire an agent with whom they have a good rapport and who has a proven marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of working with the right agent, it’s also important to be informed about our current market. &lt;strong&gt;One of the most important things to understand is how current supply impacts the traction you’ll have as a seller in our market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A market with more than seven months of supply is a buyer’s market, a market with five or six months of supply is an even market, and a market with between one and four months of supply is a seller’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The market, not your agent, dictates price.%20http://luxeredefined.com/sellers-dont-make-this-common-mistake.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The market, not your agent, dictates price.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to gauge the market is by examining the list-to-sale price ratio in your price range. This is important because while your area might be a seller’s market, your specific price range could still be favoring buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the spring market is a great time to sell. So &lt;strong&gt;if you have been thinking of listing, now is the time to do so.&lt;/strong&gt; I recommend you start interviewing agents as soon as possible. Also, if your home is already on the market, the next 90 days are vital. You should ideally have your home under contract before July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want help with your home sale, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Overcome the Difficulties of Pricing High-End Homes</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DkOMLH8qXu4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luxury homes, defined as those which are at least three times the average sales price for a given market, can be difficult to price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is the case with any real estate listing, it’s important not to rely on Zillow or other online estimates when determining home value. &lt;strong&gt;Virtual tools like these may be adequate for pricing properties in cookie-cutter neighborhoods, but they should otherwise be avoided.&lt;/strong&gt; High-end properties require more sophisticated methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy you use to determine home value should reflect the property you’re working with. For example, a comparative market analysis may be effective in some circumstances, but will often be insufficient when pricing a luxury home. This is because comparative market analyses rely on data from comparable properties, and so luxury properties are often too unique for this to be a viable strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The strategy you use to determine home value should reflect the property you’re working with.%20http://luxeredefined.com/how-to-overcome-the-difficulties-of-pricing-high-end-homes.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The strategy you use to determine home value should reflect the property you’re working with.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if not by using a comparative market analysis, what is the best way for an agent to price a luxury home? First, &lt;strong&gt;d&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;o not prepare a pricing estimate ahead of the listing appointment.&lt;/strong&gt; Instead, let the seller know that, given the highly customized nature of their home, you wanted to examine the property in-person before passing judgment on its value. That said, don’t show up empty-handed. Come prepared to the listing appointment with a market analysis report (MAR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market analysis reports essentially provide a snapshot of how other luxury homes in the area are performing in the market. &lt;strong&gt;By referencing this report and ordering a private appraisal, sellers will glean a much clearer picture of their home’s true value.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of this in mind, it’s also essential to remember the impact of the overall market. It’s crucial to keep market trends in mind when pricing a luxury home, just as you would for any other property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Can You Name the 4 Price Points in Your Market?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ExUME-xnY_E?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter where you live, there are four price points in every market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I say price points, I don’t mean rental pricing—I mean the average closing price points of all home sales. &lt;strong&gt;These price points can vary within your particular market, so you need to know what they are.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and lowest price point contains the entry-level homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second price point, or the one just above entry-level, contains the average price point homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third price point features the high-end homes. We define high-end homes as those that are worth twice as much as the average sale price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth and final price point is for the luxury homes. We define luxury homes as those that are worth three times the average sale price. It’s important to remember that luxury homes, like entry-level homes, are defined differently for each market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=There are four price points in any market.%20http://luxeredefined.com/can-you-name-the-4-price-points-in-your-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“There are four price points in any market.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re an agent and you specialize in entry-level and average price point homes, &lt;strong&gt;I suggest you diversify your real estate portfolio to include more high-end and luxury homes.&lt;/strong&gt; This is what we teach in our Luxury Listing Specialist Certification Program. Our goal is to get you to increase the average sale price of the homes you represent and make more money by working smarter, not harder. We want you to increase your income level by 30% by adding more high-end and luxury homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any more questions about knowing your price points or want to learn more about diversifying your portfolio, don’t hesitate to call or email me anytime.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The New Approach to Selling Your Luxury Listings</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3YEev1slVNc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we are going to talk about a different approach to getting your stale listing sold. If you have a listing that is not getting activity for whatever reason, &lt;strong&gt;there are two types of approaches that will help expedite the sale.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old approach involves going back to the agent and telling them that your seller is motivated and all offers will be considered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new approach is what I call the “ROS” or Reverse Offer Strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; Here is an example of how it works in action. We recently helped an owner sell their home and went back to a buyer who had seen the home about three weeks previously but had not pulled the trigger. In real estate, time is the killer of all deals, and we knew that the home was not top of mind for the buyer or their agent. &lt;strong&gt;So, we went back to these buyers and made an offer to them.&lt;/strong&gt; We ended up getting a deal together, all thanks to the ROS strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, we are helping an agent market a $6.5 million property out in Scottsdale. There are four interested parties, but a few of them have not been returning calls or texts for a while. Using the ROS strategy, we made each of these buyers an offer and are hopeful to get a deal done quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Not only do you get to control the sale price, but it also eliminates any lowball offers.%20http://luxeredefined.com/the-new-approach-to-selling-your-luxury-listings.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Not only do you get to control the sale price, but it also eliminates any lowball offers.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is a hypothetical situation where the ROS strategy would work quite well.&lt;/strong&gt; Let’s say you have a $2 million dollar listing in a market where these homes are selling at an average of 90% of their asking price. 90% of $2 million is $1.8 million. &lt;strong&gt;You might be able to go back to the buyer and make them an offer of $1.895 million with a $25,000 bonus to the buyer’s agent if it closes by a certain date.&lt;/strong&gt; In essence, the seller will net $1.87 million, which is well above the 90% list-to-sale ratio. But how do you present this offer to the buyer’s agent? Here’s how that conversation will go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Hey there. You showed my listing previously and mentioned your client is no longer interested. Well, my client actually wants to make your client the offer and would be willing to sell the property for $1.895 million. If we can get a deal done, we would give you a $25,000 bonus on top of your commission. I wanted to let you know about this so please present it to your client and get back to us.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not bring up percentages with the buyer’s agent or buyer,&lt;/strong&gt; but make sure they know the price you are giving them is lower than your list price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the new way of doing things. If you have any questions for me or want to learn more about the reverse offer strategy, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email at any time. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Want to Be More Productive? Put Down the Smartphone</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yUluaq1m3fg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a real estate agent, a team leader, and a broker-owner, being productive is essential to getting more out of your day and helping people buy and sell more properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you be more productive, though?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you should do is plan your day out. The night before, prioritize your schedule and focus on where you need to time-block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your real focus, though, should be something I call “MOLO”—what you can do more of, and what you can do less of to be more productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Be more productive, reclaim your focus, and put the smartphone down.%20http://luxeredefined.com/want-to-be-more-productive-put-down-the-smartphone.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Be more productive, reclaim your focus, and put the smartphone down.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need to do less of is &lt;strong&gt;being on your smartphone.&lt;/strong&gt; Put the smartphone down and put it on mute. According to recent studies, the average smartphone user unlocks their phone 150 times a day. Checking your phone 150 times a day to see if someone texted you takes away from your focus. It only takes 2.2 seconds to unlock your smartphone, but if you’re in the middle of doing something productive, it takes an average of 11 minutes to regain the focus you had before you let your smartphone distract you. Many times, putting your smartphone out of sight helps even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently attended a Keller Williams Luxury conference where author Amy Blankson talked about her book “The Future of Happiness” and addressed the topic of how much time our smartphones take away from us. Here are a few statistics I learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;77% of parents think their kids are addicted to their smartphones. As bad as that is, 41% of kids think their parents are addicted to their smartphones.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;54% of people think it’s okay to check their smartphone during dinner.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;57% of people think it’s okay to check their smartphone while they’re in the bathroom.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;33% of people think it’s okay to check their smartphone during sex (don’t ask me how they came up with that number).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If something like your smartphone is distracting you and taking your time away, you need to put it down and reclaim your focus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many times, broker-owners and team leaders are also more productive when they close their office door because people are not always asking them about things they can probably figure out themselves. In fact, someone once told me that they put a sign up on their door that read “Stop, think about it, and go away.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to talk more about how you can be more productive or, if you have another topic in mind you would like to see me cover, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to speak with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>All Your Real Estate Photography Needs Are About to Be Met</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mw3PSFTqpY4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professional photography is an incredibly important element in any real estate transaction, but especially when it comes to the luxury market. And today’s special guest is an absolute rockstar in the realm of real estate photography. Allow me to introduce my good friend Brad Filliponi, who is joining us all the way from Australia, &lt;strong&gt;where he’s been in business with his company, Boxbrownie.com, for 15 years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re anything like me, Brad’s company name may have struck you as a little out there. The story behind it, though, is actually very interesting. Back in 1903, Kodak introduced the first mass-produced camera. It was called the “brownie camera.” So, this product name, combined with a reference to the product’s boxy shape, is what would come to inspire Brad’s own company name. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you might expect, Brad’s creativity extends well beyond his company name. His work is carried out with quality in mind. And Brad knows full well that when photographing homes, &lt;strong&gt;the quality of the photos is as important as what the photographer takes in the photo.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is why Brad recommends people look at his &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/Mike+LaFido/Pre+Photography+Checklist+Co-branded+(1)+(1).pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pre-photography checklist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and prepare their homes accordingly before he comes in with his camera. Following this pre-photography checklist not only helps get homes into photo-ready shape, it also helps people improve how their property may perform during an inspection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few simple preparations are all it takes for Brad to extract a home’s full potential from behind his camera lens. Once it’s time to take photos, Brad does so knowing that there is one major rule of thumb to keep in mind regarding real estate photography. That rule? &lt;strong&gt;Get people’s attention.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But taking great photos isn’t all Brad and his company are capable of—they also do photo enhancement. They can make a picture taken on a cloudy day look like it was captured during blue skies, for example. They can also green up grass, remove cars from driveways, and even digitally stage a home. You can find out more about Brad’s company and enjoy any of the services they offer by visiting &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boxbrownie.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.boxbrownie.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/Mike+LaFido/boxbrownie+offer+image.png&quot;&gt;You can also enjoy $40 free credit by using my special code by clicking here. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The little touches Boxbrownie.com makes to enhance home photos really add up.%20http://luxeredefined.com/all-your-real-estate-photography-needs-are-about-to-be-met.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The little touches Boxbrownie.com makes to enhance home photos really add up.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazing results aren’t the only thing you can expect when working with Brad and his company. The prices you pay for these services are also very reasonable. Some services, like adding blue skies to a photo, cost as low as $2. And their No.1-selling enhancement, digitally staging, costs just $32. Boxbrownie.com is truly the go-to place for all of your real estate photography needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little touches Boxbrownie.com makes to enhance home photos really add up. &lt;strong&gt;“You get one chance at a first impression,” says Brad. “You might as well make it last.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, as I always say: It’s not the marketing, it’s the market. While Brad handles the photography end of things, my group and I are experts on all things luxury real estate. And you could be too. When you sign up for our certification class, you too can set yourself on the path to becoming a certified luxury listing specialist.

        <title>4 Statistics Agents in the Luxury Market Must Know</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kixuRCXK06Y?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four vital statistics that every agent needs to know when selling luxury properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand what luxury home prices start at in your market.&lt;/strong&gt; I know certain people define luxury properties as anything above $1 million across the board. But, this simply isn’t fair. $1 million in Silicon Valley will get you a lot less than $1 million in Iowa. That being said, you need to understand the analytics for your market. My own team and I define the luxury market as anything that is at least three times the average sale price for a given market.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know how many months of inventory there are for luxury homes in your market.&lt;/strong&gt; A given area might be a seller’s market overall, but the luxury market within that area could be seeing completely different conditions. While the market in general for a certain location might have very little inventory, for example, the luxury market in that area might have 12 to 16 months of inventory. As a reminder: a buyer’s market is any market where there are seven months of inventory or more; a seller’s market is a market with inventory levels at four or fewer months; and an even market has between five and six months of inventory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know what price point a buyer’s market starts at.&lt;/strong&gt; This could be a price point above or below the threshold of the luxury market, but most markets will have a point where buyers are in control.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand list-to-sale ratios.&lt;/strong&gt;In other words, if a home is listed at $1 million and it sells for an $850,000, that would constitute a 85% list-to-sale ratio. It’s important to be informed about current list-to-sale ratios in both the luxury and general market.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Use the Season to Your Advantage: Take Your Home Photos Now</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/S6r0_hzrH-c?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’d like to talk about the importance of taking photos of the outside of your house now if you’re thinking of selling in the winter or the Spring of 2018.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to sell your home in the spring as many sellers do, I recommend you get your exterior photos taken now while there are still some green leaves on the trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I was contacted by a homeowner that listed with another agent in March of 2017. Their contract was up, and they were unhappy with their agent, so they interviewed me. Taking a look at the photos they’d had, I noticed they hadn’t been updated from March when they were originally taken.&lt;strong&gt; It was a gloomy day, and there were no leaves on the trees.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being proactive, I quickly had photos taken of the home with a drone, even though their home wasn’t going on the market right away. However, you only get one chance to make a first impression, so exterior photos are really important. If the exterior photos are drab and dreary, buyers may not want to see the photos of inside and ultimately move onto a different listing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You only get one chance to make a first impression, so exterior photos are really important%20http://luxeredefined.com/use-the-season-to-your-advantage-take-your-home-photos-now.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“You only get one chance to make a first impression, so exterior photos are really important”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your home isn’t currently on the market, or if it is but you plan to make changes to your listing, be proactive.&lt;strong&gt; Interview your agents now, and take your photos now.&lt;/strong&gt; I talk about this among many other things in my new book “Luxury Listing Specialist”. This fall we attended many conferences where we were rubbing elbows with some of the top agents from around the world, so I could come back to my marketplace to serve my clients more effectively with cutting-edge marketing, both online and offline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a second opinion on your real estate transaction, you’re thinking of selling, or you have any real estate questions at all, please reach out to us. Let’s keep up the momentum and finish 2017 strong.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using Art to Market Luxury Homes</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/In3ms5FP-H8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the video above which is geared more towards real estate agents, you will see an amazing property that we are marketing right now at just under $3 million. It has some amazing features such as an indoor saltwater pool, but we wanted to make these features pop on camera and video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To do that, we decided to showcase some amazing artwork from IKONICK,&lt;/strong&gt; and these big canvas portraits are all over the property catching the eyes of buyers and their agents.  This artwork company took several professional photo’s and leveraged those photo’s on social media which lead to an online spike in activity for this particular home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=As you can see, the artwork is visually stunning.%20http://luxeredefined.com/using-art-to-market-luxury-homes.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“As you can see, the artwork is visually stunning.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the art is visually stunning. Time is money, and with marketing like this, we decrease the time a luxury home spends on the market before selling. Adding this beautiful art to an already beautiful home really brings it all together and shows prospective buyers the unique features of the home by tying in the artwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we’ve seen time and time again, marketing your luxury home properly will lead to more offers, higher offers, and a quicker sale. &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;t might take a bit of an investment, but that investment will be worth it when the deal is closed and you no longer have to worry about selling or even maintaining the property.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me about how to successfully market your home for sale, don’t hesitate to give me a call or sending me an email. I would love to hear from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Can Matched Pairs Tell Us About Resale Value When Selling A Home?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hx5_5F1aWdU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matched pairs is a term you probably haven’t heard of. If you’re thinking of selling your home, it’s always wise to consider making improvements and upgrades.  However, you’ve got to know where to spend your money in order to get the highest possible return. &lt;strong&gt;Recently, I had a client who spent about $20,000 on leaf guards that were nice but didn’t really add any value to his home. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do when selling your home is to consult a professional like myself who knows what they’re doing. That being said, it’s always best to do a few cosmetic improvements at least. For unique properties or properties where there aren’t a lot of comparables, we recommend an appraisal prior to going on the market as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work with one of the best appraisers in the Midwest, and he recently put together a thorough report about matched pairs. He wrote a report that compared five properties to five similar properties. That brings us back to the term matched pairs. &lt;strong&gt;These “matched pairs” were then compared to each other.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=%20http://luxeredefined.com/what-can-matched-pairs-tell-us-about-resale-value-when-selling-a-home.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half of the properties had minimal fixes. The other half were situations where the owner put in a significant amount of money to improve the home before selling. Some of the owners put in as much as $25,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The homes that had money put in to make significant improvements ended up selling a lot quicker and for a lot more money.  Some owners invested $25,000 and ended up selling the home for $50,000 more than the owner who only put $5,000 into their home. &lt;strong&gt;A lot of those homes that weren’t invested in too much probably sat on the market for quite a while due to price adjustments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me or you’re thinking of putting your home on the market anytime soon, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
