        <title>How the Abelson DISC Assessment Helps Our Team Find New Members</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_-hhl_2akFU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have been asking me recently how we find our new team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While behavioral assessments are a big part of this process, it’s important to note that the Tony Robbins DISC assessment is not geared toward use for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the best thing to use is something called the Abelson DISC. By using this route, you can assess people based on a specific area of business. There is a sales DISC assessment, a management DISC assessment, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The Tony Robbins DISC assessment is not geared toward use for business.%20http://davefriedmancoaching.com/how-the-abelson-disc-assessment-helps-our-team-find-new-members.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The Tony Robbins DISC assessment is not geared toward use for business.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People are scored based on different categories directly pertaining to how well they might function within a role at a business.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team has actually developed benchmarks for every position we have that are based on categories related to this assessment. I can send you these benchmarks if you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>These 5 Books Can Help You Develop the Perfect Business Plan</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EHoVkFSW9Jc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have been asking me how to develop a great business plan. As I started writing down notes on the subject, I reflected on the steps I took to create my business plan and what it took to follow through on it. Today, I’d like to discuss this subject and also tell you about five books I believe will help your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are seven components I wrote down pertaining to the development of a great business plan. The first is to have a vision. You need to understand why it is you want your business to be successful. For some further reading on this point, &lt;strong&gt;I recommend checking out Simon Sinek’s “Start With Why.”&lt;/strong&gt; This will help you develop the mission of your business, which will then carry through to helping you create a culture and energy that fits your vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next book I recommend is “The SWOT Analysis” by Lawrence G. Fine. &lt;strong&gt;SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats&lt;/strong&gt;. The first two components are internal qualities you should examine within yourself, and the last two components refer to external factors. Thinking critically about these components will help you narrow down the purpose of your business and how you want to target that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=In order to reach your goals, you’ll need a strategic plan.%20http://davefriedmancoaching.com/these-5-books-can-help-you-develop-the-perfect-business-plan.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“In order to reach your goals, you’ll need a strategic plan.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another book I think you should check out is “SMART Goals” by Jacob Gudger. This book specifically will help you set and reach goals in a practical manner. &lt;strong&gt;SMART stands for specific, measurable, attainable,  realistic, and timely.&lt;/strong&gt; These are all qualities that a good goal should have. An example of a good goal would be wanting to earn $100,000 in real estate from ‘X’ number of homes at an average commission over the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in order to reach these goals, you’ll need a strategic plan. For this, I recommend reading “Mastering the Rockefeller Habits” by Vern Harnish. (You could also read “Traction” by Gino Wickman, and/or “Rocket Fuel” by Gino Wickman and Marc C. Winters.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you want to consider the time frame. Develop your plan for moving forward by dividing goals and projects into the next one, three, and five years. &lt;strong&gt;If you just develop three to five goals you need to accomplish each quarter, you will reach your goal in five years.&lt;/strong&gt; Gary Keller’s “The One Thing” is a good read that covers this subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final thing you should do is to develop systems and processes. The best thing you can do is to stay in production, but hire an admin to help you develop these things while you’re continuing to produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Can You Establish Your Personal Brand as a New Agent?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cw1ymvS_PMA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can you establish your personal brand as a new agent? It’s not as difficult as you think it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, you have to &lt;strong&gt;define why you are doing what you’re doing.&lt;/strong&gt;  From there, you can establish the values you have within your team or within your business if you want to be a solo agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about the people you want to impact, why you want to impact them, and what kind of market you want to work in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you define that, you can develop your own personal image. Since you don’t have anything to fall back on as far as your business image, it’s a great time to recreate that for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pick things for your logo that are emblematic of your own values. That will ring true for the culture you have for your business when you meet with new clients or hire new people. It’s really important to identify those values and make sure people see them through your marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Define why you are doing what you do.%20http://davefriedmancoaching.com/how-can-you-establish-your-personal-brand-as-a-new-agent.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Define why you are doing what you do.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, determine your unique selling proposition as a Realtor.&lt;/strong&gt; What makes you unique? Why would someone hire you as opposed to a different Realtor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many things you can offer to set yourself apart. We offer different guarantees so that our consumers know we have a higher level of accountability. Some people decide to work within a defined area and become an expert in that area. No matter what it is, choose something that makes you unique and differentiates you from other Realtors out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a relative or friend in real estate. You need to make sure that you stand out from the crowd and come up with good reasons why people would like to work with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about establishing your brand, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Check Out My Full Appearance on Real Estate Uncensored</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had the pleasure of being a guest on the Real Estate Uncensored podcast with Greg McDaniel and Matt Johnson. We had a wide-ranging discussion that touched on a number of topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main area of focus was how I went from being a solo agent doing 40 deals a year to being a team leader who was doing 400 deals a year in a short time. I also had some time to answer questions, both from the viewers and from Matt and Greg about my business. &lt;strong&gt;Here’s a summary of our discussions with timestamps so you can skip ahead if any part particularly interests you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3:30- How I like to handle hesitant clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12:00- How I developed my method for getting more referrals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25:30- How my 71-touch program is getting me a 55x ROI and making up a third of my business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;33:00- Why discipline and culture are the two keys to our dramatic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Discipline and culture are the two biggest keys to our growth.%20http://davefriedmancoaching.com/check-out-my-full-appearance-on-real-estate-uncensored.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Discipline and culture are the two biggest keys to our growth.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;36:00- How we discovered our team members’ motivations and how that has impacted the culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;43:00- What motivates me today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;47:00- How letting my system take over improved my business and my life in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;52:00- Hungry and humble is the name of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Our Comprehensive Open House Marketing Plan</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SuQk4ztORnI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many sellers have recently asked me how we have such great turnout at our open houses, so I wanted to share some quick advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have a 15-page marketing page that explains our whole open house process&lt;/strong&gt; that I’d be happy to send to you, but for now, I wanted to give you the main points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by keeping the home clean and maximizing the curb appeal. The home should be completely decluttered and the curb appeal should be 10/10 because it means everything. People will drive up to the house, take a look, and keep on driving if the curb appeal isn’t up to par. If it needs to be painted, get it painted. If it needs pine straw or mulch, get some. To get people inside the home, the outside has to be beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It takes about 90 minutes to prepare for our open houses because we put up more than 100 signs.&lt;/strong&gt; We’ll put one sign per turn in the neighborhood, and once we get to the major arteries outside the neighborhood, we’ll put 10 directional signs pointing to your neighborhood from one direction and 10 more from the other direction. That way, traffic on both sides of the street can see the signage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=To get people inside the home, the outside has to be beautiful.%20http://davefriedmancoaching.com/our-comprehensive-open-house-marketing-plan.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“To get people inside the home, the outside has to be beautiful.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we generate a lot of interest with our digital marketing. We have a database of more 800 active buyers looking to buy a home, so we’ll not only market to them, but target people on social media who are likely to make a move. We run marketing campaigns for about a week in advance to drum up interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publications also work great, so I publish a 15-page real estate-related newspaper that goes to 28,000 homes with an open house section where we feature homes. Finally, we try to get everyone to register once they come in so we can follow up with them and ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, if you’d like our full 15-page document, I’d be happy to share it with you. If you have any questions about open houses or anything in your real estate career, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I hope to hear from you soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above, you’ll find a replay of my full discussion with Frank Klesitz of Vyral Marketing. &lt;strong&gt;Here is what we covered with timestamps so you can jump to the section that most interests you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(0:50) My professional story. How I got into real estate and built my company from the ground up.
&lt;br /&gt;(5:00) How I took the next step in my business by implementing different systems.
&lt;br /&gt;(8:05) How many people I talk to a week and how I went from three to 30 sales a year from my database.
&lt;br /&gt;(10:25) How many opt-ins I get every week.
&lt;br /&gt;(15:20) What caused my recent increase in production? The conversion of previous leads we already had or the increased attention to my database?
&lt;br /&gt;(20:00) How to avoid spam when marketing online.
&lt;br /&gt;(21: 50) My take on traditional real estate farming.
&lt;br /&gt;(26:45) What do I recommend for you to feed your database?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Our Team Finds Success With This Unique Tool</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8pdA2eQPuu4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people want to know how our team is able to be so productive. Our agents’ 40 transactions per year, do over $10 million in volume, and take home big paychecks. How are they able to do this? A lot of their success is due to one simple tool that will change the way you approach your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a simple form called “Dominate your day, win your week!” and it’s something our team members fill out each day. It helps you plan out your day to make it as productive as possible. &lt;strong&gt;There are six steps to personal productivity mastery:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus, do not multi-task, and eliminate distractions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make lists based on dollar-producing activities. 20% of your activities will produce 80% of the results.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prioritize everything you do based on your goals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Protect your time blocks. Plan your day in 30-minute increments and don’t let anything interfere.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eliminate clutter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plan your week on Sunday and plan each day in advance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you figure out what your top money making activities are, put those on your list first. Then, you can fill out the different time slots, noting when you plan to start and stop. As we move down the form, you have sections for determining how much each activity is worth to you so you can wrap your head around what it will cost you to neglect those activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also a section on there for you to write down your “10 wins for the day” to give yourself a more positive focus. &lt;strong&gt;Sometimes a win is setting an appointment. Sometimes it’s having lunch with your spouse.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s important to keep things in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there’s a section on the form for you to write down notes. Anything that comes to mind during the day can be written, including notes for the day and things you might need to add to your dollar-producing activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this form or would like to get a copy of your own, just give me a call or send me an email and I’d be happy to get you one. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send me an email and I’d be happy to get you one. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What’s Sexy About Consistency?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had the pleasure of being a guest on Patrick Lilly’s Real Estate Success Rocks podcast. Patrick puts on phenomenal masterminds with a select group of top-producing real estate agents across North America; his podcasts are a great way to get a sneak peek into those masterminds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was on his show, Patrick and I discussed the importance of consistency in your business. Here are a few things we went over:When I was on his show, Patrick and I discussed the importance of consistency in your business. Here are a few things we went over:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Miracle Morning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tell Me Something Good call&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dominate your day&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Hopper system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weekly one-on-one meetings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weekly team meetings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our 70-touch system for our database&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using quarterly lookbacks and a business grading score card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Patrick likes to say, there is nothing sexier than consistency. You can listen to the full episode &lt;a href=&quot;http://repodcast.rocks/096-consistency-is-sexy-with-dave-friedman/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Do You Build a Winning Real Estate Team? </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had the pleasure of appearing on Pat Hiban’s Real Estate Rockstars Radio, where Pat interviews the top voices in the real estate industry. On this episode, you’ll learn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A bit of my business background.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why I decided to build a real estate team instead of becoming an individual agent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How I close a deal per open house.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How long it took me to build a team.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How my ISA helps drive my business.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How many appointments I get thanks to the systems I set up within my team.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The biggest part of my business.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to break through your goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
