        <title>My Team Is Putting Our Money Where Our Mouth Is for Our Sellers</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/AeUpsaOO0OI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I wanted to take a minute to tell you all about our Guaranteed Sale Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we’re currently in a seller’s market, this isn’t something that has been coming into play all that often. Nevertheless, I wanted to give you an idea of what it is and how it works. &lt;strong&gt;I personally like to give sellers what I think are the pros and cons of their situation&lt;/strong&gt;, and what the best and worst-case scenarios are in any given circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I like to provide this information and feedback, I still want to give sellers the freedom to choose their own initial list price—within reason. Still, a lot of sellers ask me what I would do if I were in their shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the Guaranteed Sale Program comes into play. This program lets me put my money where my mouth is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If we can't sell your home for you within 60 days for a price you're happy with, we will sell it for free!%20http://wpghomeblog.com/my-team-is-putting-our-money-where-our-mouth-is-for-our-sellers.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If we can’t sell your home for you within 60 days for a price you’re happy with, we will sell it for free!”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the seller lists their home at a price my team and I recommend and agree with and doesn’t sell within 30 days, the listing will undergo an agreed-upon price reduction. This reduction is usually about 3%. &lt;strong&gt;If the listing still doesn’t sell within 60 days, we will continue to market your property at no cost.&lt;/strong&gt; Though we’ll still need to pay the buyer’s agent, my team and I will basically be working for free at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guarantee does not include short sales or tenant-occupied properties, and there needs to be equity in the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-appraisals and pre-inspections are both required for the Guaranteed Sale Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows us to be totally transparent with any potential buyers. This also allows us to take care of any issues that arise in the report ahead of time. &lt;strong&gt;With a pre-inspection, a lot of surprises are taken out of the transaction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program also requires that you meet with our in-house stager Rose, and agree to any of her recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Has Technology Changed the World of Lending?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cVcN-B949Wc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m joined by a special guest, Andy Duda from Caliber Home Loans, to talk about the current state of mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been in the business for 13 years, but Andy has been helping me with loans even before then. &lt;strong&gt;In the time we’ve known each other, Andy has assisted me with hundreds of loans.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a big deal for my team and I to have lenders that we trust, so professionals like Andy are a huge resource to us. We try to introduce Andy to as many of our clients as possible when they are in need of his services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lending has changed a little bit over the year. I always tell people that lending in 2017 is somewhat vanilla. Most lenders have the same products, so the real difference comes down to interest rates and customer service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Andy, the world of lending ultimately changed after the economic crisis in 2007. Ultimately, traditional financing is king. There are niche programs out there, but most people tend to go more standard routes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=As technology moves forward, so does the world of real estate.%20http://wpghomeblog.com/how-has-technology-changed-the-world-of-lending.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“As technology moves forward, so does the world of real estate.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the most important things is to talk to your lender early on in the process.&lt;/strong&gt; Doing so will help you determine what price range you should be shopping in and what programs will be the best fit for you. Having this information will also help your Realtor service you to the highest level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though most loan products are fairly standardized, there are some neat features available these days. For example, Caliber Home Loans has introduced the possibility of a digital mortgage for buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows the company to digitally verify income and assets without the hassle of a lot of paperwork. &lt;strong&gt;People can become fully approved and can close without ever having to dig up paystubs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not all employers will facilitate this as a possibility, it is a great option for those who can make use of it. As technology moves forward, so does the world of real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Great News About Our Zillow Reviews and a Quick Market Update</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/aNkp5Uqul5A?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the latest word on our Baltimore market as we head into fall?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I have some great news to share with you. Our team has reached 200 reviews on Zillow. It’s taken us years to accumulate this number, and it’s a milestone we’re extremely proud of. If you’re a past client of ours and you contributed one of those reviews, I want to personally thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I want to remind you &lt;strong&gt;that we’re hosting an outdoor cookout for all of our past clients on September 23rd at the Columbia Sports Park at 5 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt; My wife’s been putting a lot of effort into planning this event, so if you’re a past client and you haven’t gotten your invitation in the mail, we’d love for you to come join us. We’ll have a live DJ, an open bar, and plenty of fun activities for the whole family to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We’ll see an uptick in the market in the next 60 to 75 days.%20http://wpghomeblog.com/great-news-about-our-zillow-reviews-and-a-quick-market-update.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We’ll see an uptick in the market in the next 60 to 75 days.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, onto the latest real estate news. The Baltimore market experienced a little bit of a slowdown this past August because of people vacationing later in the year due to a later school year start date. This has caused some frustration among the active buyers out there because of the available inventory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news if you’re a buyer, however, is that &lt;strong&gt;you’ll see a new wave of homes coming on the market next week&lt;/strong&gt;—our team alone has about 10 homes being listed next Wednesday or Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news if you’re a seller is that &lt;strong&gt;we’ll see an uptick in the market in the next 60 to 75 days&lt;/strong&gt;, which will provide you a great window to sell your home. It’s arguably a better time to sell during this timespan than the spring months because—from an appraisal standpoint—you have great comparables of homes that sold in May, June, and July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about our market or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Where Does Our Baltimore Market Stand for Buyers and Sellers?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/p9gGoP72JSY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the latest news from our Baltimore metro area market?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s start by sharing some statistics from the month of June:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The median sale price was just shy of $279,000, which is the highest it’s been since July 2007.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There were 4,509 closed sales and 4,313 pending sales—the highest number for either category in a decade.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Active inventory continued to decline by double digits for the twelfth consecutive month, and ended at 11,097 homes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a more in-depth look at how our market fared in June, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rbintel.com/blog/baltimore-area-hits-highest-monthly-tally-decade-over-4500-homes-sold-june&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by Real Estate Business Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you’ve missed out on a home, August might be a great time to find a good value.%20http://wpghomeblog.com/where-does-our-baltimore-market-stand-for-buyers-and-sellers.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you’ve missed out on a home, August might be a great time to find a good value.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One trend I’ve noticed lately is that many buyers who’ve been trying to secure a home before summer ends and school starts have found what they were looking for. The market tends to slow down in August and then pick back up after Labor Day. I always say &lt;strong&gt;this window is the second-best time period to sell your home, after the spring market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the buyer side, if you’ve missed out on a home in the last few months, August might present some valuable opportunities since fewer buyers will be in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a different note, we have a client appreciation event coming up on September 23rd at the Columbia Sports Park from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m., so keep your eyes peeled for an upcoming invitation. It should be a great time for everyone involved, so we hope to see you then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, if you have any questions about our market or are thinking of buying or selling a home, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to speak with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How You Can Take Advantage of a Great Jumbo Mortgage Program</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6sTt8WLrqqY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realtrends.com/&quot;&gt;Realtrends.com&lt;/a&gt; came out with their list of the top agents in the country recently, and while we weren’t quite able to make the top 1,000 real estate agents in the country, we are excited to announce that we were ranked No. 20 in the state of Maryland for 2016 in terms of all units sold. Considering that there are around 26,000 agents in Maryland and D.C., we are pretty proud of that accomplishment and wanted to thank all of our clients for supporting us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to take a little bit to talk about jumbo mortgages and what’s going on in the jumbo mortgage industry. Traditionally, if you wanted to borrow anywhere from $500,000 to $1 million, it would’ve been more expensive in the Maryland area to borrow $1 million than a couple hundred thousand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It actually hasn’t been that way for the last couple of years. In Maryland, if you were to borrow under $424,000 with a conventional mortgage with 5% down, your interest rate would be right around 4.5%. If you were to move into the jumbo category and borrow more than $424,000 with 10% down, your interest rate would be about 4.25% and you wouldn’t need mortgage insurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Interest rates do get better as you have a larger down payment.%20http://wpghomeblog.com/how-you-can-take-advantage-of-a-great-jumbo-mortgage-program.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Interest rates do get better as you have a larger down payment.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to put down 20% for a jumbo mortgage in order to get mortgage insurance out of your life, but &lt;strong&gt;it’s cheaper to borrow $1 million at 10% down than it is to borrow $200,000 at 5% down.&lt;/strong&gt; Interest rates do get better as you have a larger down payment, and there are a lot of banks that have programs that are geared toward the more affluent buyer and offer incentives to take your banking to these particular banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a popular program geared toward people who are looking to buy new construction but have a home to sell.​&lt;/strong&gt; If a buyer is willing to put 10% down on a mortgage for a new build and are able to sell their home within six months, they can then recast their mortgage, put an additional 10% with the money they gained from selling the house, and then have their interest rate lowered by 3/8ths of a point. It’s actually a free refinance and you can keep the original interest rate that you locked in when you first acquired the mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this topic or need recommendations for some lenders to talk to, please give me a call. I’d be happy to help!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Navigate Our Market as a Move-Up Buyer</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DzIlXi2W2nc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the clients I’ve been working with lately are what you call “move-up buyers.” Who are move-up buyers? What are they trying to achieve?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move-up buyers are often living in their first home and are hitting a point where they need a little bit more space&lt;/strong&gt; or have different family goals. Hence, they’re seeking a fresh start and a new home. When I meet with these buyers, I’ll ask them a few important questions, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are there homes out there that excite you?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you already know the home you want to purchase or do you need to get out there and see what the current inventory looks like?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you need to sell to buy?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is your timeline?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those questions help us put a plan together, and after that initial discussion I typically see three common scenarios. The first is putting a contingent offer on a new home, then settling on the old home and new home on the same day. The second is selling first and then buying. The third is buying first and then selling. &lt;strong&gt;Each option has its advantages and disadvantages.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Having good people in place will help you make good decisions.%20http://wpghomeblog.com/how-to-navigate-our-market-as-a-move-up-buyer.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Having good people in place will help you make good decisions.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first option means the purchase of your next home is contingent on the sale of your current home. A couple dominos have to fall in this scenario. It represents the least amount of risk for move-up buyers, but it’s also the least attractive option to sellers—especially when we’re in a seller’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second option occurs when people want to buy in a specific area and there’s a unique type of home they’re looking for so they sell their current home and move in with friends or relocate to a short-term rental. When that home does come on the market, they can be very nimble, and they can also put a non-contingent offer on it, which makes their offer more attractive to the seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last option happens more than you think. This tends to occur with families with kids or pets and there are a lot of barriers to get their home ready and approved for showings once it’s on the market. By moving into their new home, they can get their old home ready for the market. Once it’s listed, they can approve every showing because they aren’t living there anymore. The downside of this is that family may have to carry two mortgages for a month or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a move-up buyer (or any type of homebuyer), the best advice we can give you is this: &lt;strong&gt;set a big goal and make a date when you want to move into your new home.&lt;/strong&gt; Once you establish that big goal, break it down into smaller micro-goals and collaborate with your agent to put a strategic plan into place to make sure you’re taking the right steps and maximize your potential once you hit the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, have trusted partners you can rely on. Whether it’s a lender, an inspector, or a staging consultant, having good people in place will help you make good decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or are looking to make a move in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What You Can Learn From Zillow's Lawsuit</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBW3-ySnun0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Zillow and their Zestimate have been in the news because of a homeowner taking issue with how the Zestimate has negatively affected her home sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This homeowner paid $626,000 for the home six years ago and tried to sell it for a similar price. The Zillow Zestimate valued the property at $564,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument by the homeowner (which hasn’t quite gone to court yet) is that Zillow is acting as if they are an appraiser in this situation. Zillow is adamant that the Zestimate is just an estimate, but they had an average error rate of about 6% in 2016. That can get pretty significant in higher price points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Zestimate is meant to be just a starting point for buyers, but many look at it as more of an appraisal, which is not how it intended to be.&lt;/strong&gt; This homeowner isn’t seeking damages, but rather just to get Zillow out of the appraisal side of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The Zestimate is meant to be just a starting point for buyers.%20http://wpghomeblog.com/what-you-can-learn-from-zillows-lawsuit.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The Zestimate is meant to be just a starting point for buyers.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know what your home is worth, you can use a website like Zillow or you can hire a licensed appraiser, and there is an argument to be made for both. &lt;strong&gt;A licensed appraiser will take a more analytical approach by accounting for price per square foot and make adjustments for amenities.&lt;/strong&gt;However, many times, the appraiser hasn’t actually seen the homes they compare yours to when coming up with a value. They don’t know if the home had a strong odor, backed up to power lines, or sat on the market for a long time, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An appraiser doesn’t have their finger on the pulse of the active market like a real estate agent who has been in the majority of homes that you’re comparing it to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about finding your home’s value or you want to know what it’s worth, we’d love to help you out. Just give me a call or send me an email soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QTxIsx1VMBM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you met our expert stager/designer, Rose Bennett?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rose has been with us almost six months and is a big part of our listing process.&lt;/strong&gt;She decided to work here because it gave her the unique opportunity to combine her background in interior design with real estate. She works on the listing side of the team helping sellers stage and design their homes for the market and staying with them all the way through settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her duties consist of coming out to the home and writing up a full staging report so the homeowner knows everything they need to do to prepare the home for the market. &lt;strong&gt;With Rose on the team, staged homes have been selling 43% faster than vacant homes&lt;/strong&gt; and at an average of 97% of the listing price once we’ve gone through the process of getting them ready. Our average days on market is also down to just 16 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I highly recommend using Rose to help you prepare your home for the market.%20http://wpghomeblog.com/introducing-our-newest-staging-design-expert.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“I highly recommend using Rose to help you prepare your home for the market.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rose’s design background was the perfect match for what we were looking for in her position. She designed model homes for quite some time and has a great sense of style and what’s popular now within the new construction community. She also does design work on her own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re working to bring all of our resources in-house and develop a better process and value for you, and Rose has been a big part of this endeavor. In addition to staging, we also have a licensed contractor who works in conjunction with Rose so she can allocate time management. If you’re thinking about making renovations to your property, I highly recommend reaching out to her. She even helped me design the improvements I made to my home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to reach out to Rose directly, you can email her at Rose@WesPetersGroup.com. If you have any questions or are considering buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give us a call or shoot us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What National Market Trends Could Mean for Baltimore</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qrlg6j-MIO0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we’ve got an update for you on the national real estate market and how it affects our local market here in the Baltimore metro area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read recently that the collective national real estate average price is higher than it has ever been. The National Association of Realtors also reported that inventory is the lowest it has been since they started tracking it in 1999. With supply and demand, most would expect prices to go up. Because of the low inventory, many economists predict that prices will go down, but so will the number of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home builder confidence is at an all-time high, which has to do with expecting decreased regulations. They’re hoping it will make it less expensive and easier to build homes, basically. Job reports look strong; we added 235,000 new jobs in February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Our shortage of inventory makes it more important than ever to work with an experienced real estate expert.%20http://wpghomeblog.com/what-national-market-trends-could-mean-for-baltimore.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Our shortage of inventory makes it more important than ever to work with an experienced real estate expert.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there’s a lot of encouraging news going on nationally, but what does it mean to our local market?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand this, I think it’s important to understand the history of the recent market crash. A lot of things went south in cities like New York and Miami, despite the thought that real estate trends start on the West Coast and move east. However, I believe that’s what’s going on right now. Although national real estate prices are at an all-time high (and up 20% in the last three years), we haven’t seen that in the Baltimore market. I think that’s because we’re typically behind about two to three years. During the market crash prices didn’t bottom out until 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at prices in the metro area for the last few years, we’ve been pretty flat. Now though, we’re starting to see that appreciation that everyone has been hoping and waiting for. &lt;strong&gt;I think it’s reasonable to believe that we’re two or three years behind the appreciation trend and that we’re just now starting to see the start of some really good times in our market with prices going up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We definitely have an inventory issue, which makes working with an experienced real estate agent extremely important right now if you plan to buy or sell a home. If you’re interested in finding out what your house is worth and what it might look like in the next three or four years, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be glad to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>An Update on Our Team and the Local Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/P_ZVjmDCtDQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife Jennifer joined our real estate team about six months ago. She was a teacher at Hillcrest Elementary for 11 years and since she made the switch, she has been a huge part of our growth and success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jen helps out behind the scenes&lt;/strong&gt; with a lot of contract-to-close issues, client functions, and community involvement. In fact, we are excited to announce that we are partnering with the Cool Kids Campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With every real estate transaction this year, we will make a $50 donation to the Cool Kids Campaign. As a former teacher and parent of two young kids, Jen wanted to find a strong, local charity that helped kids. The Cool Kids Campaign improves the lives of children with cancer and lends support to their families. We hope to contribute over $10,000 to the Cool Kids Campaigns this year. It is a really good feeling to know that our clients’ real estate success will carry over to support this foundation and our community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We hope to give over $10,000 to the Cool Kids Campaign.%20http://wpghomeblog.com/an-update-on-our-team-and-the-local-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We hope to give over $10,000 to the Cool Kids Campaign.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We plan on selling a lot of houses this year. After all, &lt;strong&gt;the more homes we sell, the more money we can give to the Cool Kids Campaign.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also want to give a quick shout out to Kristen and Dan, who just bought their first house. We were able to save them about $3,000 in moving expenses thanks to our moving truck! We are offering some great services this year and the moving truck is one of them, so spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the weather has been a little crazy lately, the real estate market is on fire. We sold 13 homes last week and almost every one of those had multiple offers and sold at list price. Inventory is also incredibly low. If the market wasn’t crazy enough already, the Federal Reserve just raised their interest rate by 0.25%. Luckily, the market already anticipated that rise, and mortgage interest rates actually went down a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, we want to invite you to our happy hour&lt;/strong&gt;, organized by Jen, on April 27th at Union Jack’s in Columbia. We hope to see you all there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, if you have any questions about real estate or if you would like to learn more about our current market, give us a call. We look forward to speaking with you!&lt;/p&gt;
