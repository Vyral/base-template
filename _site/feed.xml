        <title>How Has the Bright MLS Changed the Way We Work?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfD3PEAOTks?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How has the Bright MLS changed the way my team works?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I’d like to clarify that Bright isn’t paying me to write this blog. I just wanted to share some information about the Bright system that my team and I have learned over the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be the first to admit that when the Bright change first took place, there were a lot of kinks in the system. A lot of our properties didn’t show up on consumer sites, and some didn’t show up on my own website. Searching was also difficult; results didn’t come up the way they should have, especially in the first week or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although a lot of organizations stick their heads in the sand when they go through changes, &lt;strong&gt;I was impressed by how responsive Bright’s staff was.&lt;/strong&gt; Whenever we needed assistance or there was a technical issue, they would tell us where it was in the queue and when they expected the issue to be worked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also held private trainings at our office, and we went to Harrisburg for additional trainings. There were five or six trainings as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bright even sends daily updates about technical difficulties or where problems were in the queue. Bright was incredibly responsive, and most of the kinks have been worked out at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=With the Bright MLS, I have access to data that I couldn’t get before.%20http://davehookecoaching.com/how-has-the-bright-mls-changed-the-way-we-work.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“With the Bright MLS, I have access to data that I couldn’t get before.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve had time to learn the system and get feedback from my agents and staff, I’ve been able to see that this system has a real positive impact, and I’m extremely grateful for that. &lt;strong&gt;Here are a few important things that Bright has been able to do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) I am able to get data in areas that I wasn’t able to before. I remember often feeling stupid because a customer was able to go on Realtor.com and give me property information that I had to struggle to find in the system. Now, I can just jump on Bright and get information on a market that’s 45 minutes away. I can even get more information than the customer can, which allows me to offer them some value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) I don’t have to pay for and learn a multiple systems. Since Bright is a large, regional system, I can look in the same system, pay the same dues, and save all that time and energy that I would have spent learning a new system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) There are many useful tips and tricks that have made us more efficient and saved us a huge amount of time. For example, the web mapping search allows us to look at flood zones, public record information, and more. &lt;strong&gt;I’ve been incredibly impressed with the owner information available for properties that aren’t listed,&lt;/strong&gt; including the assessed value. There are many tips and tricks this system offers that Paragon didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am incredibly grateful to Bright and their staff for the dedication they put into the transition. I think the Bright MLS will improve my life, my team’s lives, and my client’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear any feedback or tips that you’ve discovered that impact your business. Just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What’s the Best Way to Structure a Listing Appointment?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/518sYreq21k?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the best way to structure a listing appointment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people in the office have been asking about it, and I’ve been meaning to put together a training video together for listing appointments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I can’t say I have the best way to structure a listing appointment, but over the last 15 years, I’ve been on over 1,000 of them. I’ve also learned things from other agents both inside and outside of the market. As a result, I’ve been able to put together a good, professional listing appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During the intake call, we fill out a seller information sheet.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a proven process that helps us learn the needs of the seller as well as their interests. The sheet also helps us learn a bit about their property, what improvements they’ve made to the property, and which features they are most proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, we set the listing appointment. Sometimes we do a one-step appointment, where we walk away from the initial listing appointment with the listing contract signed. Sometimes we have two separate appointments. It really depends on what the seller’s motivation is and what they are looking for from us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing we do is prepare for the appointment. We will pull all of the information from the public record that we can. If possible, we’ll pull a deed. We’ll also look at previous listing information and put together a &lt;strong&gt;listing preparation packet.&lt;/strong&gt; We also add a listing presentation manual; we have 100 of those pre-printed at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I like to make the listing appointment about what the seller can expect from the process.%20http://davehookecoaching.com/whats-the-best-way-to-structure-a-listing-appointment.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“I like to make the listing appointment about what the seller can expect from the process.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, show up at the appointment and ask if they have a kitchen table you can set your things down on. From there, walk through the house with them. This gives you the opportunity to take notes, ask questions, learn more about the seller, and make a connection with them. Remember, it’s important to be super complimentary when you are walking through the home. This is also a good time to ask them what they love most about the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the walk-through, we’ll go back to the kitchen table and review their needs one more time. That’s where the seller information sheet comes in handy; simply review the information you got on the intake call. At that point, you will go through the listing presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I like to make the listing presentation about the seller.&lt;/strong&gt;I tell them what they can expect when they list their home, what showings will look like, and how often we will provide feedback. I also go over exactly what we’ll do to market their property so they know where their home will be advertised.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, we’ll decide if we want to talk about the value of the property. If it makes sense, you can go ahead and list the property. In some cases, the property may be a bit more difficult to price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that’s the case, we’ll set a second appointment at our office. We’ll take a couple of days to run the CMA. At the second appointment, we’ll go over their home’s value. If it makes sense to list their home, we’ll go ahead and do that. If they want to wait for a while or decide to go a different direction, that’s fine too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about how we structure our listing appointments, or if you have any helpful steps to add, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Can You Do To Combat a Slow Business Period?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/p7w1JWvLwtM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the fastest way to generate immediate business if you’re in a bit of a slow season?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question is that it depends—it depends on who you talk to, what area of the world you’re in, and what season it is. Today, I have three of my own top answers that have worked for me year after year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If I do a really high-traffic open house in a great area, I’m bound to generate some quick business and connections that I can follow up with afterwards.%20http://davehookecoaching.com/what-can-you-do-to-combat-a-slow-business-period.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If I do a really high-traffic open house in a great area, I’m bound to generate some quick business and connections that I can follow up with afterwards.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Utilize your sphere of influence and trusted resources.&lt;/strong&gt; If I’m a little slow in business and can project a slow season coming up, I immediately get on the phone with past clients and people that I know and trust, check in and connect with them, and before I hang up, I ask one simple question, “I’m in a bit of a slow season, and I’m just wondering if you could think of anybody you know who might be looking to sell their home in the next six to 12 months?” If I do that consistently, I’m sure to come away with some prospects to follow up on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Prospect for expired listings.&lt;/strong&gt;There are different technologies like Vulcan 7 and RedX that offer expired data for properties that came off the market unsold. If used with consistency, you can generate some quick business. From those calls, you can generate a connection and possibly an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. High-traffic open houses.&lt;/strong&gt; If I do a really high-traffic open house in a great area, I’m bound to generate some quick business and connections that I can follow up with afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or suggestions about strategies that have worked for you when you’re in a slow season, I’d love to hear them. Just give me a call or send and email and we can go over them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Secure an Appointment With a New Potential Homebuyer</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iV56ZVFoI34?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As real estate agents, we get internet inquiries and call-ins all the time. We know that our first initiative is to serve the client the best we can and serve the customer on the other end of the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we also know that these are opportunities to get an appointment with a new potential buyer, and we want to capitalize on those opportunities while serving our listing client, if that’s applicable. If an internet inquiry or a call comes in, we usually call back within five minutes, and &lt;strong&gt;here’s a statement we use for that call that works better for us than just about any others:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hi (client name), this is (agent name) with (name of real estate company). I see you inquired about (property address) through Zillow. What questions can I answer for you about that property and do you have a time that would work for you to preview that home?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking those two questions does two things. First, it addresses the reason they inquired. Second, it opens the door for them to preview the property with you. When someone calls about a property, they typically have a question in mind, but they may not have been thinking about previewing the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, they’ll follow up with the question they called about. Assuming you have factual information, you can answer their question or say you’ll bring the property up and follow up with “As I’m bringing the property up, is there a good time that would work for you to preview this property?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The person wants the appointment, so go ahead and give it to them.%20http://davehookecoaching.com/how-to-secure-an-appointment-with-a-new-potential-homebuyer.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The person wants the appointment, so go ahead and give it to them.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restating that opens up their mind even more. More often than not, they’ll opt into that appointment. Keep in mind that after they elect to have the appointment, if they’re going to be asking opinion-based questions, you still have to do the oral consumer notice and make sure you’re explaining agency relationships. We’re always going to need to qualify that prospect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing—we’re often afraid to set the appointment because we’re putting the cart before the horse. &lt;strong&gt;Oftentimes, though, the person wants the appointment, so go ahead and give it to them.&lt;/strong&gt; After that, make sure you qualify them well, because you don’t want to waste your time, the seller’s time, or the prospect’s time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go through all the typical questions, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Are you already working with another agent?” If they say yes, make sure they get back to their agent so that agent can show them the property.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Have you looked out for or obtained financing yet?” If they haven’t obtained financing, you can simply postpone the home preview and put them in touch with a lender.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, again, start the conversation with why they called and ask if they have time to preview the home.&lt;/strong&gt; Asking those two questions in your first breath will go a long way in helping you get an appointment with every customer who calls in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any more questions about securing appointments, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to chat with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Throw a Great Client Appreciation Event</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qCLhAbv5LGA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 15 years, we’ve tried just about everything related to client appreciation events. Some of them have crashed and burned. Others have been home runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two examples of client appreciation events that have worked for us are our client appreciation cookout and our Thanksgiving pie and pumpkin roll giveaway. We throw both of these events annually and they’re definitely worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To pull off events like these, &lt;strong&gt;we break them down into five manageable steps that you can use as a guide for setting up your own client appreciation event:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Make a list of preferred attendees. We recommend this list be comprised of past clients that have remained local and your local sphere of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Most of our clients really appreciate these events and look forward to them annually.%20http://davehookecoaching.com/how-to-throw-a-great-client-appreciation-event.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Most of our clients really appreciate these events and look forward to them annually.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Contact the vendors you need to support this event and confirm the dates. For example, the client appreciation cookout typically requires a caterer and a band. The Thanksgiving pie and pumpkin roll giveaway typically requires a bakery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Have a print shop print out potential mail invite proofs. Make sure whichever you choose looks professional and has your logo on it. Also include an RSVP date on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Send the invites out to your preferred list and schedule a four- to five-hour prospecting time block so you can get on the phone and contact all of your invites personally. You can make sure they got their invite or you can just ask them if they want to RSVP right then and there. This is a critical point most agents forget about, but sometimes people just get too much mail and forget about invites like this. Attendance will be low if you don’t follow up your invites with a phone call. This is also a great opportunity to reconnect with your database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Make connects with all of your attendees at your event and enjoy your time. You’ll get about two to three hours to connect with people you won’t get a chance to connect with any other time of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When done correctly and with consistency, these events can be invaluable to your business.&lt;/strong&gt; They allow you to connect personally with people you’ve worked with in the past or those who you like and trust. Truthfully, these events also give your clients a great opportunity to make connections they otherwise wouldn’t have a chance to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of our clients really appreciate these events and look forward to them annually. If you have any other questions about this topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to chat with you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Real Estate Agents</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bcR94NoepY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the seven habits of highly effective real estate agents? According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inman.com/2017/08/01/7-habits-of-highly-effective-real-estate-agents/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stephen Covey and Brandon Doyle,&lt;/a&gt; these are the habits every agent should follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Be proactive.&lt;/strong&gt; If you spend your day reacting to everyone else’s whims, your business will run you instead of the other way around. Make sure that you have time blocks and set boundaries around your time. Be proactive about communicating with your clients so they hear from you every week, instead of waiting to touch base after a problem comes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Begin with the end in mind.&lt;/strong&gt; Create a plan for your life and your business. What do you want your life to look like 10, five, or three years from now? What about one year down the road? Figure out where you want to be and map out a strategy to meet these goals. Break that strategy down into bite-sized chunks so you don’t feel overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Communicate with clients proactively instead of waiting for a problem to arise.%20http://davehookecoaching.com/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-real-estate-agents.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Communicate with clients proactively instead of waiting for a problem to arise.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Put first things first each day.&lt;/strong&gt; There are important activities that need to be done. Since they are not urgent matters that need to be done right now, many agents tend to skip important activities like prospecting to grow their business. Spend two hours each morning getting those things accomplished before you get pulled into urgent reactive activities, like replying to emails or handling social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Think win-win.&lt;/strong&gt; Take a collaborative approach to the real estate business in general. Think how you can create a win-win situation that will benefit your client as well as the other agent and their client. If you can do that effectively transaction after transaction, it goes a long way toward making everyone happy at the settlement table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Seek to understand before being understood.&lt;/strong&gt; Empathize with people. Put yourself in their shoes. Understand their needs first. Again, it may seem like more work up front, but it goes a long way to make everything go smoother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Synergize.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if you’re not on a team, there are a lot of people around you. From title companies to attorneys to home inspectors,  you can lean on them and act as a team to make your goals and your client’s goals a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Sharpen the saw.&lt;/strong&gt; What does this mean? According to Stephen Covey, it’s important to keep learning constantly. Watch webinars, read books, and go to seminars that will further your life and your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you utilize these seven habits, you will become a highly effective agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>4 Ways We Improve Client Satisfaction</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8VNBTgN474?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the No. 1 thing that affects customer or client satisfaction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the same thing that affects all interpersonal relationships from friendships and marriages to business partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, if all else is equal—meaning that the agent is honest, genuinely works hard, and is knowledgeable about the market—&lt;strong&gt;this one thing goes the longest way to define customer satisfaction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you guessed that I’m talking about communication, then you are correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We contact all of our clients once every seven days.%20http://davehookecoaching.com/4-ways-we-improve-client-satisfaction.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We contact all of our clients once every seven days.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my team, one of the things we focus on is checking in with our listing or buyer clients once every seven days. When we contact them, we cover these four things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.) Here is what we did last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) Here is what the results were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.) Here is what we’re doing next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.) What can we do differently or better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you can ask those four things every seven days, you will be a proactive agent&lt;/strong&gt; rather than a reactive agent. By being proactive, you will run your business instead of allowing your business to run you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communicating with your clients this way creates happier relationships, happier customers, and more referrals for you and your business down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or if you would like to share something that you do to grow your business, just give me a call or send me an email. I would love to have a conversation with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Creating a For-Profit Business With a Nonprofit Purpose</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEQVC6CQStI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to our business-building blog for high-producing agents on fast-growing teams. Today we’re here to answer the question, &lt;strong&gt;“How do you have a for-profit business with a nonprofit purpose?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been selling homes for a while like I have, you’ve probably been wondering about how you can have a bigger impact on your community. After about a decade in the business, I wasn’t sure if this is what I wanted to do with my life and I was questioning what I wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After talking with my wife and a few other close friends and family members, I came to the realization that I’m uniquely positioned in real estate to learn about people’s needs and serve them on a really deep level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to start a new referral program. I always ask my clients if they know of anybody who is thinking about buying or selling, but I never ask them if they know anyone who might be going through a tough time that we could serve in an anonymous way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=This referral program has brought joy to many people.%20http://davehookecoaching.com/creating-a-for-profit-business-with-a-nonprofit-purpose.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“This referral program has brought joy to many people.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That idea led me to developing the Community Appreciation Program&lt;/strong&gt; that allows us to serve others in the community by using our database as leverage to find them. Here’s how we did it, in five easy steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open up a separate checking account.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put a percentage of every commission check in there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask every client this question: “Who do you know in the community with a random, urgent need whom we might be able to serve?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have the client enter the person’s information in a Google survey or spreadsheet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once you’ve picked someone, call the person who gave you the referral and ask them to partner with you to give the gift. Ask them how it went afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just one easy way to bring purpose back into your real estate business. If you have any questions, or if you have an example of another way you or your team is giving back, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2 Questions to Double Your Business</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Y46VOUASGI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you interested in doubling your business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I’ve got two questions you can ask that can help you do just that. When done at the right time with a genuine attitude, asking these questions can go a long way in developing deep relationships with your customers. It will also help you with future referrals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, as a buyer consultation is coming to a close, ask your buyer the following before either of you leave: &lt;strong&gt;“What are your biggest fears or concerns in the upcoming transaction?”&lt;/strong&gt; In this sometimes intimidating process, people want to feel understood and reassured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a common belief that being a good listener is the best sales skill you can have. Personally, I believe that having empathy is a close second to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As professionals, we deal with the stress and uncertainties that come along with real estate transactions every day—but this likely isn’t the case for your client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Put yourself in your client’s shoes.%20http://davehookecoaching.com/2-questions-to-double-your-business.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Put yourself in your client’s shoes.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to genuinely listen and take a sincere interest in their concerns will not only help to assuage your client’s fears, but also build a better relationship between you in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put yourself in your client’s shoes—doing so will make a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second question you should ask should also be posed at the end of a buyer consultation. That question is: &lt;strong&gt;“Is there anything unrelated to real estate that I can help you with?”&lt;/strong&gt; By asking your client this, you are showing a level of service that extends beyond what they likely expect of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s true that an agent’s job is not to be a therapist, the reality &lt;strong&gt;is that going out of your way to do something nice for your client can really make an impact.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After posing this question, listen to their response and consider taking notes. Empathizing with and caring for your clients will foster strong relationships and build a strong referral business for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What to Look for in a Potential Brokerage</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8b43qsT0ahw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes down to it, we are all independent contractors and like small business owners in many ways. I run into a lot of agents who only focus on gross volume, income, and commission splits as financial indicators of their career. In reality, there are seven key variables to consider that will affect your bottom line when it comes down to deciding where you will practice real estate. &lt;strong&gt;Here are those seven things to pay attention to when looking at brokerages:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Commission splits. &lt;/strong&gt;This is a fairly obvious one. Different brokerages have different splits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Occupancy cost.&lt;/strong&gt; Some brokerages charge expensive desk fees, some have cheap fees, and some have no fees at all. Neither is right or wrong, but it’s important that you understand what kind of support you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Brand recognition. &lt;/strong&gt;This is a little less tangible, but still very important. A company with strong brand recognition in your market will make it easier for you to do more business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Do a thorough job at researching and vetting brokerages.%20http://davehookecoaching.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-potential-brokerage.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Do a thorough job at researching and vetting brokerages.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Administrative support.&lt;/strong&gt; A brokerage could have compliance officials, service coordinators, or even full-time transactional support. When you have a brokerage who focuses on the basics, you can spend more time on the dollar-producing activities that will grow your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Lead generation.&lt;/strong&gt; Do they provide leads or not? Do they offer scripts? Both are important questions to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Some charge for the best tech, some provide it for you, and some don’t provide it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Leadership and accountability. &lt;/strong&gt;It has been proven that coaching programs affect an agent’s bottom line as much as anything else. Some brokers provide this kind of support on their own, while others will point you to a coach and still others won’t offer anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answers to each of these questions will affect where you practice. Make sure you do a thorough job at researching and vetting brokerages before you make your decision. If you have any other questions about any of these variables or how it could affect your bottom line, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;
