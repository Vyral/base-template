        <title>How the Fed’s Recent Rate Hike Impacts Our Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iw5Iqku5FNw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On June 14th, the Federal Reserve increased its federal funds interest rate by 0.25%. They’re also widely expected to raise rates once or twice more over the course of 2017. What does this mean for the real estate market?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While any action by the Fed always garners a lot of attention, I believe these increases will not have any significant impact on our market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, mortgage rates have actually trended lower in the wake of the Fed’s recent announcement. The 30-year mortgage rate recently hit 3.9%, the lowest level in 2017. In fact, it’s a common pattern for the mortgage rate and the Fed rate to move in opposite directions, and the same thing has happened the last two times the Fed raised rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the economy continues to do well. The Fed decided to increase its rate because unemployment and inflation are low, household spending is picking up, and we’ve seen steady growth for the past nine years. This is good news for the real estate market. As expected, we continue to see strong demand and a corresponding increase in home prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=These increases will not have any significant impact on our market.%20http://treugroupsouthflorida.com/how-the-feds-recent-rate-hike-impacts-our-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“These increases will not have any significant impact on our market.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, while the Fed’s rate increase is normally meant to cool off the economy, it might actually stimulate it in this case. Because interest rates were so low for such a long period of time, experts believe the recent increases might ease pressure on the financial system and encourage lending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case in point: since the Fed started raising its rate in December 2016, total mortgages are up 2.5% year over year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while any move by the Fed is likely to lead to a lot of hand-wringing, I believe the real estate market will not be affected and will continue on its own healthy course. Nonetheless, it’s clear that right now is a uniquely good moment for everyone in the real estate market. Today’s low mortgage rates are good for homebuyers because they make homes more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, give me a call at (561) 352-3056 or send me an email at lisa@treugroup.com. I’d love to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why You Need to Take Advantage of the Market Now</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PGjQdBq5NwM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re a buyer or seller, I have important news to share with you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest rates, as we know, have been on the rise. Why does this matter?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a buyer and rates go up just 1%, you’ll lose 10% of your buying power. This means you may have to settle for not living in the neighborhood you want or giving up that pool you wanted. That’s not what you want, right? I know that’s not what I want for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a seller, rising interest rates mean fewer buyers can afford your home. Fewer buyers mean fewer offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY OUR MARKET IS GIVING YOU RIGHT NOW.%20http://treugroupsouthflorida.com/why-you-need-to-take-advantage-of-the-market-now.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY OUR MARKET IS GIVING YOU RIGHT NOW.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a study published recently that no one’s talking about but I think you deserve to know about. The study showed that in South Florida, there’s less than a 10% chance that our real estate prices will decrease in the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a buyer, you might have both higher interest rates and higher prices, and that’s not good for anybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are here to help you capitalize on the opportunity in the current market, so if you have any questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling real estate, don’t hesitate to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Things to Know About the Palm Beach County Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PzqeHzODsAE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real estate market can be a little bit confusing, especially if you’re getting your information from friends, family, or the news. So I wanted to give you some accurate information about the Palm Beach County market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, we had 5.1 months of inventory. &lt;strong&gt;That means we’re still in a seller’s market.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re looking to buy, you’re going to need to be prepared, and if you’re looking to sell, you’re going to be pretty happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;35.7% of all transactions that closed last month were cash. There were no appraisal contingencies and no financing in these transactions. The median price was $327,000 and that number keeps rising. We still have room to grow, as the number when we were at the height of our market was around $375,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question frequently asked is this: “Are you buying or selling in a buyer’s market or seller’s market?” It depends on two things: the area and the price range that you’re in. For example, if you’re buying or selling a single-family home in the $200,000 to $250,000 range, then you’re in a very strong seller’s market. There are only about two months inventory in this price range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=THERE’S ALWAYS AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE MARKET.%20http://treugroupsouthflorida.com/things-to-know-about-palm-beach-county.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“THERE’S ALWAYS AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE MARKET.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you increase your budget and you’re buying or selling in the $300,000 to $400,000 range, then you’re still in a seller’s market and there’s only about three months of inventory. Sellers are receiving multiple offers for these homes and buyers are going to have a hard time beating out the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you move into the luxury market ($600,000 to $1 million range), you’ll see we’re in a buyer’s market. We have nine months of inventory in this market, so if you’re looking to buy then you’ll have plenty to choose from. The same goes for homes that are priced at $1 million or more. We have 16 months of inventory available in this market, making it a strong buyer’s market as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s always an opportunity in the market. The question is how do you capitalize on that? Here at True Group Real Estate, we’ve been helping buyers in the seller’s market get the home of their dreams. If you’re selling, we want to help you get the most money for your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the luxury market and you’re frustrated because your home isn’t selling, we have the right formula to get a sold sign in the yard and you to the closing table. The formula is simple, but it isn’t easy; you need &lt;strong&gt;the right price, the right condition, and the right marketing.&lt;/strong&gt; We can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about real estate, or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, please give a call or shoot us an email. We’d love to help!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Does Zillow Hurt Your Chances of Buying or Selling?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/afYzTzcNUlE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sites like Zillow, Realtor.com, and Trulia can be a challenge for buyers and sellers. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that you are buying a home and looking for your dream home on these sites. If you call the listing agent, &lt;strong&gt;you will probably hear that the property has already sold.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s because there is a delay between what you see on those websites and what professional agents see. As real estate agents, we actually get a head start of up to seven days on the best properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how can you find a listing online that hasn’t already gone under contract?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do one of two things. First, you can search on a site like ours, which pulls information directly from the MLS. That way, when a home hits the market, you will know right away. The other option is to allow us to do all of the hard work for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=OUR WEBSITE PULLS INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM THE MLS.%20http://treugroupsouthflorida.com/does-zillow-hurt-your-chances-of-buying-or-selling.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“OUR WEBSITE PULLS INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM THE MLS.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few buyers we’ve worked with only viewed four homes until they found their dream home. That might not seem very impressive, but one of those buyers had been searching with another agent and on their own for two long years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are selling your home, are those websites your friends? Not really. It’s important to understand how Zillow impacts your pool of buyers. If Zillow has a wrong Zestimate or other incorrect information, it can cost you thousands of dollars. &lt;strong&gt;It may even cost you the home sale.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to understand how these sites work and competitively list your home in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Treu Group real estate, we understand how to help you buy, sell, and, most importantly, how to help you win. If you have any questions, we are here to help you. Just give us a call!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>We Dont Play Games When It Comes to Achieving Results for You</title>

&lt;p&gt;Playgrounds are a lot of fun for kids. They can be fun for us, too. However, you don’t want the job of helping you buy or sell a home becoming a game for your agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to buy or sell here in Palm Beach County, you probably know about some of the many challenges that could cause the deal to fall apart. There are issues with financing and inspections that may need to be solved. Lack of experience could play a role as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=GAMES ARE FUN, BUT SO IS A SUCCESSFUL REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION.%20http://treugroupsouthflorida.com/we-dont-play-games-when-it-comes-to-achieving-results-for-you.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“GAMES ARE FUN, BUT SO IS A SUCCESSFUL REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Treu Group Real Estate, we want you to have a professional on your side that is going to be there for you to help you overcome all of the challenges you might face in order to get you to the closing table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experience matters, and experts say that it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill. We have mastered the skill of doing business in the real estate market, and we’d love to share that skill with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t monkey around with your real estate transaction. If you have any questions or need any help, our team is just a phone call or email away. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 Unique Opportunities in the Market Today</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y36GwtfZey4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are opportunities in every real estate market, and I want to share three of them with you today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, a recent study revealed that almost 50% of all millennials in south Florida live at home. If you want to build wealth in the United States, &lt;strong&gt;the first step in creating wealth is to own your own home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this may not be possible for all millennials right now, some millennials should definitely consider packing up and buying their first home. If you have a great job, a steady income, and you’ve saved some money or have access to gift money, then now is a great time to get into a new property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you a quick story: When I first purchased a home, I got a 13.5% adjustable mortgage rate. Compared to today’s low interest rate, you can see that homes are more affordable. You can ask your friends and your parents what their first home’s interest rates were, and I think you will agree that even a 4% interest rate is an absolute gift to the real estate market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=OWNING A HOME IS THE FIRST STEP IN CREATING YOUR OWN WEALTH.%20http://treugroupsouthflorida.com/3-unique-opportunities-in-market-today.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“OWNING A HOME IS THE FIRST STEP IN CREATING YOUR OWN WEALTH.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, if you already own your first home, &lt;strong&gt;now is a great time to upgrade to your next home or maybe even your dream home.&lt;/strong&gt; Why? If you sell your current home, you are probably selling in a seller’s market. Depending on what price range you are moving up to, you will likely be buying in a buyer’s market. So, the market currently allows you to sell in the best position possible and have more options when you go to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you are ready to retire and want top dollar for your home, you can definitely win in this market, especially if your home lines up with what millennials are interested in. Why? Right now, we have a shortage of great homes in certain price ranges. Anything under $500,000 often receives multiple offers, great prices, and great terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it is time to capitalize on these three great opportunities in our current market. If you have any questions about buying or selling a home, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 Ways We Can Help You Reach Your Real Estate Goals</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ig9k8VN_Gao?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what your goals are in real estate, the Treu Group can help. &lt;strong&gt;Here are three specific ways that our team can assist you in achieving your real estate dreams:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you’re looking to buy.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether it’s your first home, your dream home, or an investment property, we are here to help. We serve the areas of Palm Beach County, Martin County, and even Broward County. If you want to buy something in another state, we can help you out there too with our network of referral partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you want to sell.&lt;/strong&gt; Marketing is really important, and we understand the formula that will get your home sold for top dollar. It involves the right price, the right condition, and the right marketing. We expose your property locally, nationally, and internationally to maximize the number of potential buyers who will see it online.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=YOU DESERVE A TEAM LIKE OURS.%20http://treugroupsouthflorida.com/3-ways-we-can-help-you-reach-your-real.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“YOU DESERVE A TEAM LIKE OURS.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you want to buy new construction.&lt;/strong&gt; Many people are unaware that the builder will happily pay for you to have a buyer’s agent on your side, someone to help you make great decisions in the short and long term. We’ve been able to help our clients make great choices with selections, floor plans, and even upgrades. Builders won’t give you a discount if you walk in by yourself. In fact, they will probably take advantage of that fact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You deserve to have a team like True Group Real Estate by your side whether buying, selling, investing, or building.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have any questions for us or are thinking about making a move yourself, give us a call or send us an email today. We would love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Buying a Home and Making a Difference</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Tf6eLnCCVs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It turns out that the FHA will no longer implement a reduction in fees.&lt;/strong&gt; Because of this change, there are some things you should know about buying a home in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the FHA fee reduction had gone through, it would have saved the average FHA buyer $500 to $600 a year. &lt;strong&gt;That means the loss of that reduction won’t impact your ability to buy a home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Realtor.com reported that in December 2016, the number of people looking at properties increased from 40% to 80% compared to December 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many buyers are trying to purchase a new property before interest rates rise, which is smart as increased interest rates would greatly impact buying power. That’s why if you’re looking to buy, you need to hire the right agent to ensure a quick and successful home purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=YOU CAN STILL BUY A HOME WITHOUT THE REDUCTION IN FHA FEES.%20http://treugroupsouthflorida.com/buying-home-and-making-difference.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“YOU CAN STILL BUY A HOME WITHOUT THE REDUCTION IN FHA FEES.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d also like to talk to you about how $20 can have a huge impact on our community. The Treu Group is doing a diaper drive to help assist the one out of every three families who are struggling to buy diapers. Many members of those low-income families would like to go back to work, but children are not allowed to go attend daycare without diapers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our diaper drive will be taking place in three different locations: Lighthouse Cove Adventure Golf in Jupiter, iHeart Media in West Palm Beach, and the Treu Group Real Estate office in Del Ray Beach.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If none of those are convenient, we can come pick up your donation or even buy the diapers for you if you prefer to make a monetary donation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to buy or sell a home or if you would like more information on our diaper drive, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I would be more than happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zhZS5v8-Gfo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major life change can definitely impact your real estate transaction. When people face trying times, they tend to make mistakes during their real estate transaction. We’re only human after all. Today, I’ll go over a few common mistakes for you to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, if you suddenly lose your job but can afford to keep your home, don’t put it on the market right away. See if you can get a new job in the same area before you sell. If you can’t make your mortgage payments without your job, call us right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another stressful life event that can impact your transaction is a divorce.&lt;/strong&gt; You need to deal with what makes sense. Should you offer a buyout? Should you agree to sell the home? Which option is the best one for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=%20http://treugroupsouthflorida.com/selling-your-home-during-major-life.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people get divorced, they are dealing with a loss of the future. They are thinking about all of the dreams that they planned as a couple and watching them disappear. People try to hold onto that future and make emotional decisions, such as paying too much to retain the home. Sometimes, it makes sense to sell the home and get a new start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The third major life event that can be challenging is when you lose a loved one.&lt;/strong&gt; The biggest mistake I see is that people either sell too quickly or hold on too long. I believe that there is a natural period where you need to have your time to grieve. Don’t do anything now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team and I are here to help you so that you can make the right decisions for your situation. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. We are here to help you come up with the right plan, so if you find yourself in a stressful situation, give us a call. We would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Will You Take Advantage of the 2017 Palm Beach Market?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mnHu_RUf9fI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three groups will have big opportunities in the 2017 Palm Beach real estate market. Today I’ll explain how the groups stand to benefit from market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe there’s always a great opportunity to be had in the real estate market, and you just have to position yourself to take advantage of it. That’s why today, I wanted to talk a bit about some of the great opportunities that will be available in the Palm Beach market in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first opportunity lies with people currently renting homes.&lt;/strong&gt; As a renter, your rent payment goes up when your landlord’s costs go up. By buying a house in 2017, you can lock in two things: your interest rate and your property taxes. If you rent, it’s time to get off the fence and into your new home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Move-up buyers also have big opportunities in 2017. Many homeowners have a home in a seller’s market price range, giving them the perfect chance to move up into their dream home. &lt;strong&gt;If you own a house under $400,000, it’s likely the best time for you to take advantage of the record-low rates and the cooling luxury market.&lt;/strong&gt; You would be selling in a seller’s market and likely moving up to a buyer’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=IF YOU RENT, IT’S TIME TO GET OFF THE FENCE AND INTO YOUR NEW HOME.%20http://treugroupsouthflorida.com/will-you-take-advantage-of-2017-palm.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“IF YOU RENT, IT’S TIME TO GET OFF THE FENCE AND INTO YOUR NEW HOME.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the third big opportunity is for those of you looking to buy real estate as an investment to have tenants and positive cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about how you can take advantage of the market in 2017, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you take a look in the video above, you’ll see that I’m in an iconic part of Palm Beach. Do you know where I am? Send your guess and you might just win a prize! All you have to do is reply to this email with your guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to hear from you soon!&lt;/p&gt;
