        <title>Need to Meet Your Continuing Education Requirements? This Resource Can Help</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiZPbpPgf6s?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the year, I always notice that many agents are scrambling to get their continuing education requirements in for their license renewal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the state of Iowa, agents are required to take 36 hours of continuing education every three years,&lt;/strong&gt; with those hours due by December 31 of the year your license expires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This education includes eight hours of law updates, four hours of ethics, and 24 hours of electives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real estate is a complex industry, so continuing education is extremely important. Knowing industry standards, new laws, and other information helps us, as agents, be the best professionals we can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let’s be honest: it can be difficult to find time for that education when you’re keeping such a busy schedule yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As real estate professionals, we’ve got very unpredictable schedules. Fortunately, there is an alternative in Iowa to in-classroom learning.** In Iowa, up to 24 hours of your continuing education can be done online.**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I was able to schedule my continuing education around my life, instead of scheduling my life around my continuing education.%20http://bebetterdsm.com/need-to-meet-your-continuing-education-requirements-this-resource-can-help.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“I was able to schedule my continuing education around my life, instead of scheduling my life around my continuing education.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I’ve found &lt;a href=&quot;https://realestatece.com/courses/iowa&quot;&gt;www.RealEstateCE.com&lt;/a&gt; to be an amazing resource. It’s very easy to sign up and is full of informational classes relevant to things I experience in my business. Also, it’s inexpensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part of taking classes through this website, though, is that it helped me control my time. I was able to schedule my continuing education around my life, instead of scheduling my life around my continuing education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there is an amazing discount available to Iowa licensees through &lt;a href=&quot;https://realestatece.com/courses/iowa&quot;&gt;www.RealEstateCE.com&lt;/a&gt; that you can find &lt;a href=&quot;https://realestatece.com/courses/iowa&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you’re busy, want to learn, and would like to save money, I definitely recommend checking it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
