        <title>How Does Julie Hopkins Design a Results-Driven Marketing Program?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uj9a_cUn3RM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie Hopkins has achieved enormous success in her real estate business, but how does she design a results-driven marketing program for that business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie entered the real estate field with a considerable background working with Fortune 500 companies. With her MBA and prior sales and marketing experience, &lt;strong&gt;she used that background to drive her business by establishing a brand and being true to that brand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also helps that Julie loves the resort community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was fortunate to grow up in a Colorado resort community and then live in this resort community my whole life,” she says. “And just believing it and having all my marketing centered around that, and understanding my target audience, and trying to sell the resort community through all my communications that sell my business.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie is very good at incorporating all the vendors that support her team in her marketing. Since she loves Park City and how it’s constantly evolving, whenever she sees someone new or a longtime resident starting a business, &lt;strong&gt;she tries to support them with her own business and build a partnership.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I try to differentiate myself by marketing the community and other people’s businesses as well.%20http://parkcityrealestatecareers.com/how-does-julie-hopkins-design-a-results-driven-marketing-program.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“I try to differentiate myself by marketing the community and other people’s businesses as well.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everyone in Park city has been really responsive to that,” she says. “I try to differentiate myself by marketing the community and other people’s businesses as well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fellow KW Park City agent Niki Thomas supports those marketing efforts by handling a lot of the back-end work and delivering and packaging of those marketing items. There are many details to this business and a lot of moving parts when it comes to coordinating with clients and coordinating marketing initiatives, and Niki manages many of those back-end moving parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working at Keller Williams has also helped Julie because it’s given her a certain autonomy to set her brand.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, she works with a designer she’s known for 30 years and previously worked with in corporate America. Working with that designer has helped her continually come up with fun ideas every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie’s marketing is delivering great results for her, and I want to thank her and Niki for joining me today. If you wish to contact Julie, you can email her at &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(106,117,108,105,101,64,106,104,112,97,114,107,99,105,116,121,46,99,111,109))&quot;&gt;julie@jhparkcity.com&lt;/a&gt; or call her at (435) 649-9882.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email as well. I’d be glad to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>An Expert’s Take on the Art of Time Management</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jkIX8ggChZo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fellow KW agent and associate broker Julie Hopkins uses specific time management techniques to perform at a very high level in our industry, and there are a few tips she recommends to help you prioritize your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of times, Julie notes, agents don’t have control of their own days, but &lt;strong&gt;the most important thing for her is holding a deal together.&lt;/strong&gt; “You’ve gone through all the steps to get the deal, and you want to hold it together and get it across the finish line,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a deal across the finish line, the first thing Julie does when she wakes up in the morning is look at what she has under contract and what needs to be done to get that contract to the next step. Her next priority is wherever her next deal is and what can she do in terms of marketing, prospecting, etc., to find the next piece of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Prioritize what needs to be done first.%20http://parkcityrealestatecareers.com/an-experts-take-on-the-art-of-time-management.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Prioritize what needs to be done first.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real estate agents have to deal with a lot of noise, and there are a lot of people knocking on our door asking for things. For Julie, that’s a difficult thing to manage, but it must be done, and she does it at times that are convenient for her. Some of it she doesn’t respond to, and some of it she does decide to politely respond to. As her email inbox fills up, she makes a conscious choice to stay on task, and that’s what you have to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie’s business coach also helps her stay accountable&lt;/strong&gt; by asking her important questions about things like her business plan, as well as by talking her through tricky situations and figuring out how to solve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He puts some perspective on things that help me better manage situations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie also uses the book “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People” as an important resource. It has helped her realize she’s not an effective multitasker, and she’s much better off at picking one task and focusing all of her attention on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I have to remember what Stephen Covey said—first things first.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to give a special thanks to Julie for joining me today. If you wish to contact her, you can call her at (435) 649-9882 or email her at &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(106,117,108,105,101,64,106,104,112,97,114,107,99,105,116,121,46,99,111,109))&quot;&gt;julie@jhparkcity.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Can You Add Leverage to Your Business?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fI-9_6VIb4k?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to our series on getting leverage in your business. To help me discuss today’s topic, I’ll be joined by our No. 1 associate, Julie Hopkins, and her assistant Niki Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an extremely successful agent in our area and across the board, I wanted to talk to Julie about how she personally uses leverage to achieve such amazing results in her business. First, I asked what prompted her to hire an assistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The business got too big for me to handle alone . . . It was time to get support to be able to responsibly handle the business I take on for people,”&lt;/strong&gt; said Julie. Prompted by this response, I wanted to hear from Niki. So, I asked her how she supports Julie in their business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Niki, she runs the day-to-day backend operations. She handles contracts and works closely with coordinating transactions. This is significant, since transactions can have many, many steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Niki and Julie’s day-to-day focus is always changing.%20http://parkcityrealestatecareers.com/how-can-you-add-leverage-to-your-business.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Niki and Julie’s day-to-day focus is always changing.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how exactly has business changed for Julie since hiring Niki and adding more leverage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s wonderful,” Julie says. “It’s awesome, because I have someone to delegate things to.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What needs to be focused on from day to day is always changing. As Niki put it, they take things “One thing at a time.” Not knowing exactly what the focus will be each day is really indicative of the flow of the business. &lt;strong&gt;Being able to keep up with this ever-changing flow is something Julie says she greatly appreciates in Niki.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though she very much likes working on her own without a team, Julie says it’s wonderful having someone like Niki by her side. I definitely applaud the two of them for having such a strong partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How The Wilstein Team Uses Leverage</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lry4jphcfiQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time for part two of The Leverage Series, which explores how building a business with a team might work for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m talking to The Wilstein Team. First, let’s meet Ron Wilstein and Doug Almstedt and see what they have to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ron, you’ve had some version of a team for the 25 years I’ve known you. What prompted you to bring leverage into your business way back when?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ron: I received some good advice from someone who said, “There’s a lot involved in real estate. There are a lot of things you have to do and if you’re doing all of it, then you’re spending a lot of time doing that and not working with buyers and sellers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they basically said that if you can hire someone at a lower wage than your earning power to take care of those tasks that are important, that will put you in front of more buyers and sellers. That is how I know the importance of leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve owned your own brokerage for 10 years. When you decided to get out of running the broker’s side of the world and just focus on the business, why did you choose to move to Keller Williams?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ron: I looked at a number of different, well-respected brokerages in town and they each had their strengths, but I found Keller Williams to be the best combination in part because I do my own distinct marketing. The Keller Williams environment, or culture, allows agents to express and conduct their business in the ways that they want rather than following a cookie cutter mold from a franchise. So, it gave me the greatest amount of latitude to help me be successful and the move was very well-suited for my team members because, frankly, they get better commission splits than the other brokerages allow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please tell me about the composition of your team.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ron: Our team consists of seven members. I am the team leader, and I typically specialize in representing sellers. Doug and I represent sellers, and then we have three buyer’s agents: Dean, Kathy, and Jeremy. Then we have the admin team, Lynette Thorn and Jennifer Lee. Lynette’s been with me 22 years and Jennifer has been with us for 12 years. Jennifer is our transaction coordinator and interacts with buyers and sellers. If you want a fast answer, talk to Jennifer. Lynette has done every job in the business and now handles the marketing while overseeing the entire team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Hire someone to take care of those important tasks so you can stay in front of buyers.%20http://parkcityrealestatecareers.com/how-the-wilstein-team-uses-leverage.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Hire someone to take care of those important tasks so you can stay in front of buyers.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doug, how long have you been on the team and how has being on a team changed your life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doug: I was able to join Ron about four years ago. His team has been an immeasurable help. Going from an independent agent trying to do it all myself and joining Ron’s team with established procedures and a team that takes care of everything has increased my business and give me a lot more free time. I’m a cyclist, so it’s been nice to have more time to train and do the races that I want to be in each year. It’s been extremely beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re also now a director for the Park City Board of Realtors. Congratulations!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doug: I am! So, boss, I may need a little more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ron: We have a political giant on our team, so this is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doug: I am excited to serve on the board of directors for the Park City Board of Realtors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After I met with Doug and Ron, I decided to sit down with the real heart of the organization: the admin team. Jennifer Lee and Lynette Thorn play very important roles on The Wilstein Team, and they took time out of their busy days to answer a few of my questions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jen, I understand that you’ve been with Ron for 12 years as client care and transaction manager. What does that involve?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jen: My job is to manage all of the paperwork, all of the people, and all of the deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the seller side, I am the main point of contact for our clients. They can call me with any questions and I can usually get an answer to them more quickly than the agent can. I manage all of the paperwork and make sure everything’s signed and distributed properly. I also help Lynette with the marketing schedule and handle all of the showings on our properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That includes receiving inquiries from the buyer’s agent, coordinating that appointment with the sellers, and follow up on every showing to get feedback so that we can report back to the seller so that they know what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the buyer side, I make sure the paperwork is submitted to the lender and the title company. I also coordinate the inspection, the appraisal, and serve as the main point of contact for the buyer or buyer’s agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that keeps us on the same page is that we all use a shared calendar so that I can see what everyone is doing, make sure everything happens as it should, and get us to the closing table with paperwork completed and done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, we know that leads to very satisfied clients. Jen, thank you for all of your hard work. Lynette, tell us about the marketing side of the team. How long have you been working with Ron?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lynette: I think it’s going to be 21 years in January. I do work on the marketing side of the team. One of my goals is to have no prospect left behind. I try to get contact info from our agents on all of their prospects. Sometimes I have to beg, borrow, or steal from agents or other sources to get people into our database so we can start disseminating information to them, whether it be an update on a new listing, our newsletter, or the postcards that we send to different neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also keep multiple websites updated with current information and add pages to them so our viewers can have the most recent information available. We also send out hard copies of our newsletters, flyers, magazines, and postcards. I coordinate with Ron on getting those edited, printed, and mailed out. We try to keep them going on a systematic calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next, I’d like to introduce you to two of the three buyer’s agents on The Wilstein Team: Kathy Leitzke and Dean Deleone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kathy, you joined the team a few years back. How has being a buyer’s agent on a team changed your life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kathy: Joining the team allowed me to focus on my clients and my client’s needs. My team takes care of marketing and our web presence, which frees me up to focus on what I like best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dean, I know you had the good fortune of starting with The Wilstein Team right out of business school. I know you had sales experience prior to this in another industry. How has that worked out for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dean: As Kathy mentioned, we have multiple websites that instantly get leads going. I don’t have to market and search for those leads. My past experience means I’m able to cultivate those leads and really hit the ground running, so it’s been a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, Jeremy Wilstein sent in a video with some comments on working on a team as a buyer’s agent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeremey: The support of The Wilstein Team has allowed me to pursue my love of real estate while simultaneously pursuing my love of adventure and travel. Without a doubt, I would not be able to do what I’m doing without the support of my team: my father, Ron; Jennifer; Lynette, Doug, Kathy, and Dean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While traveling, I’ve been able to farm and stay in contact with all of my clients that I’ve developed over the last six or seven years, when I worked full-time in real estate. I’m still able to keep those relationships but if I’m not in town, they can go out and look at a property with another agent on our team. It’s been tremendous for me to continue my real estate business while continuing this love of travel and adventure and not wait until I’m older to experience it in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you to The Wilstein Team for sitting down with me today.&lt;/strong&gt; If you would like to learn more about The Wilstein Team or have any questions for them, check out their website: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.viewparkcityrealestate.com&quot;&gt;http://www.viewparkcityrealestate.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any questions for me, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Meet Elevation 7 Park City Real Estate</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZSlJaO4J038?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m kicking off a new series of videos on leverage. The Leverage Series will cover ways to use leverage in your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re speaking with Nick Caravaglia and Carol Anne Kret from E7 Park City Real Estate to explore how they leverage their partnership in their business. Here’s what they had to say:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When did you two decide to become partners?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick: Back in 2009, I was a relatively new real estate agent. I took a listing with eight new condo properties and thought it was an ideal time to learn from an established agent. I had known Carol for about 20 years, and I knew she was a firecracker and one of the best agents in Park City. So, who better to work with than a longtime friend who I trusted and respected?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the primary benefits of your partnership for both of you as business owners?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carol Anne: There are many benefits to being partners with Nick. We complement each other’s skill sets. There are things I like to do more and things Nick likes to do, so we kind of divide those tasks out. He always puts the open house signs out for me. It’s a simple thing but it’s such a pain for me to do. We’ve got a lot of synergy and we’re able to bounce ideas off of each other, whether it’s a marketing program for a listing, negotiating techniques, responding to counteroffers and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does the partnership affect your business revenue?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carol Anne: Keller Williams has structured the commission structure to encourage partnerships and teams in a financially advantageous way. It encourages leveraging, working together to achieve more, and it makes financial sense as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Nick and Carol Anne complement each other’s skill sets.%20http://parkcityrealestatecareers.com/meet-elevation-7-park-city-real-estate.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Nick and Carol Anne complement each other’s skill sets.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has the quality of your life improved with your partnership?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick: Carol Anne knows that my children are the two most important people in my life. I’ve always believed that once you take a client, you want to treat them with velvet gloves. It’s nice to have a partner like Carol Anne because I know she’ll take care of the client just as I would. I’m also able to spend more time with my children by taking them to school and going to school events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carol Anne: I’m not a morning person. Morning is when I do my workouts or walk my dogs. I like to be in the office in the afternoon. Having Nick as my partner has greatly enriched my ability to have a personal life, and that’s really important. Real estate can be all-consuming. It is a very demanding career and we love it, but it’s a never-ending challenge to find that balance. Having a good solid partner like Nick who’s got my back and will make sure our clients are getting the best possible service is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The two of you have a unique brand. You’re known as Elevation 7 Park City Real Estate. Tell me about E7.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick: Luxury real estate is elevated in Park City, and isn’t everything better over 7,000 feet? One thing that’s great about Keller Williams is that Keller Williams allows us as agents to brand ourselves. We get to create a unique brand within Keller Williams and we still get all of the support and backing from them. Keller Williams is a family that supports our brand, E7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s very creative.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carol Anne: I love our logo and the branding. It’s important to set yourself apart versus being another one of 1,100 agents in town. We are a unique brand. It’s a fun logo, and to be backed by such a strong international brand as Keller Williams makes it all better, makes it work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Strategically Plan Your Showings</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/E6taRK0jpiE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s tight market, you might have to show four or five properties in an afternoon. That’s a lot of work. I just want to offer a few questions and comments for you to ponder before you go ahead and schedule your next home showing tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to think about is how much time you need for each property. It will depend on the size, location, and uniqueness of the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another thing to ponder is how you should approach the neighborhood.&lt;/strong&gt; Use what you’ve found out about your buyer and what’s important to them when planning the tour. Use Google Maps to plug in our addresses so you can plan a good route. Use the route to show amenities in the neighborhood or how easy it is to jump on the freeway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Don’t neglect your buyer’s emotional reactions to homes.%20http://parkcityrealestatecareers.com/how-to-strategically-plan-your-showings.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Don’t neglect your buyer’s emotional reactions to homes.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two schools of thought when it comes to how you should handle showing the best prospective property to your client. Some people say that you should show it first. Others say you should show it last. In our experience, &lt;strong&gt;most buyers want to feel like they’ve been able to shop around at least a little bit.&lt;/strong&gt; Therefore, they are more hesitant to make an offer on the first home they see. I would keep that in mind when planning your tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communicating with listing agents is another skill you’ll have to have. Chances are that you have to make an appointment to see most of these properties. &lt;strong&gt;Many of them require notice at least 24 hours in advance, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, be thoughtful of the emotional reaction your client may have when approaching the property. They’re not just buying sticks and bricks, they’re buying a home. You’ve got to give them enough time to experience the feeling of home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you found these tips helpful. If you have any questions for me at all, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>4 Tips for Helping Your Buyers in Our Highly Competitive Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DSJk9AlkGmM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summertime is here, which means it’s an active buying season in our industry and inventory is tight in the marketplace. Here are a few tips to help guide your buyers through this highly competitive market:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Make sure your buyer is pre-approved if they won’t be paying in cash.&lt;/strong&gt; Also, make sure they’re pre-approved with a local lender. Sellers today are very savvy, and they won’t necessarily view an approval from an out-of-state lender as desirable as a local lender with a track record of being able to close loans in that neighborhood. Counsel your buyers that this step is necessary before they even begin to look at properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Talk to them about their responsiveness.&lt;/strong&gt; If it’s a couple, will they both be available to respond to and sign documents in short order? It’s likely you will have a tight time frame dictated by the seller, so you need to be able to respond quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Preparation is key in this marketplace.%20http://parkcityrealestatecareers.com/4-tips-for-helping-your-buyers-in-our-highly-competitive-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Preparation is key in this marketplace.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Coach your buyer about the reality of multiple offers.&lt;/strong&gt; If they’re making an offer on a property in a high-demand neighborhood, it’s very likely they’ll have to deal with multiple offers. Before you show them any properties, familiarize them with the “Seller’s Notice to Buyers of Multiple Offers” form and the addendum you’ll have to add to the purchase contract. Show them hard copies of these forms so they can read through them and understand what’s expected of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Make sure your buyer is aware of the escalation clause.&lt;/strong&gt; This isn’t an approved form by the division of real estate, but it’s particularly useful for clients who might be traveling who want to put their highest, best offer out there as a percentage over any other price that might come forward. If you do use this clause, though, make sure you’re heeding the advice of an attorney or the blessing of your principal broker. If used properly, this tool can be really helpful in a highly competitive market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about how to guided buyers through a multiple offer situation, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to speak with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Your Clients Should Hire a Certified Inspection Expert</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1DYviR_GCkw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been trained to give the names of three home inspectors when your clients ask for a referral, but I suggest that you &lt;strong&gt;highly encourage them to seek out a certified inspections expert.&lt;/strong&gt; Since home inspectors are not regulated by the department of commerce, so this certification provides valuable benefits to your clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, they provide a &lt;strong&gt;90-day warranty&lt;/strong&gt; for any items that were inspected and deemed to be in good order. This is important because not all of your clients will buy a home warranty plan, even though you recommended it. That 90-day window is critical because many things that can go wrong will go wrong during those first 90 days in the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=CERTIFIED INSPECTIONS COME WITH A NATIONAL RESOURCE LINE THAT HOMEOWNERS CAN CALL FOR ANY QUESTIONS.%20http://parkcityrealestatecareers.com/why-your-clients-should-hire-certified.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“CERTIFIED INSPECTIONS COME WITH A NATIONAL RESOURCE LINE THAT HOMEOWNERS CAN CALL FOR ANY QUESTIONS.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a certified inspection, your clients can also get sewer and septic inspections that use cameras to inspect the pipes and other areas. They can also bridge the gap between the inspection warranty and home warranty, which is another nice added benefit. Additionally, they have a national resource line that homeowners can call with questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also have specific coverages pertaining to mold, which can be an issue sometimes up here in the mountains. They also have very specific &lt;strong&gt;roof leak protection&lt;/strong&gt; that I haven’t seen in the general home inspection process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this topic or you’d like to talk further about how it can benefit your clients, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to talk and help you with your career however I can.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Updates to the Utah Real Estate Purchase Contract</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/J_uUn9A2jRI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have not had a new, updated version of Utah’s real estate purchase contract for about five or six years, but that has finally changed. The new contract will go into effect in September, when Utah Realtors hold their convention in Park City. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I want to let you know about some of the great enhancements that will make our business lives much easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first improvements is that the tax ID number will be delineated separately from the address section. Plus, “included items” now include solar panels, water softeners, TV wall mounts, and any speakers associated with that system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The agreement better addresses issues of personal property.&lt;/strong&gt; Prorations deal very nicely with rental deposits, which is especially important for long-term rental properties. That can be a little trickier with short-term rentals such as Airbnb or HomeAway. These platforms don’t have contracts but allow renters to prepay, so how do you deal with those?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The new REPC will make our business lives much easier.%20http://parkcityrealestatecareers.com/updates-to-the-utah-real-estate-purchase-contract.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The new REPC will make our business lives much easier.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new REPC also cleaned things up on the leasing side and added a FIRPTA clause into the seller disclosure. FIRPTA deals with foreign buyers and their obligation to pay taxes in their home country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important change is that the license number has to be included in the agency disclosure section. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new REPC even nicely addresses changes that happen during the escrow period,&lt;/strong&gt; such as significant construction or the buyer incurring additional debt. The language has been cleaned up to make things more clear to both parties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, these changes are coming this September, so be prepared. Overall, though, I think these changes are good, and I hope you’ll agree. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions in the meantime, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Embrace the Zestimate</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_3agy4NNh3Y?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As most of you know, Zillow is by far the largest consumer facing web portal out there for real estate. Many of your clients use it as they are contemplating selling their homes. &lt;strong&gt;Instead of fully rejecting Zillow and their Zestimate, I challenge you to embrace the concept and allow Zillow to be your friend rather than your foe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Zillow’s home page, you can find what they call their “data accuracy table.” It gives you several points that they use to assess the valuation. This table is your best friend when dealing with sellers who want to take Zillow’s word as law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in Utah, one key thing to note is that we are a non-disclosure state. In other states, Zillow looks at the deed transfer information to get home sale prices. In Utah, they don’t have access to that information. &lt;strong&gt;This means their accuracy will be off significantly, adding more value to your listing presentation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=UTAH IS A NON-DISCLOSURE STATE.%20http://parkcityrealestatecareers.com/embrace-zestimate.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“UTAH IS A NON-DISCLOSURE STATE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you go on a listing presentation, check out the Zestimate for that particular property. Be prepared for the seller to bring that value up, and be prepared to rebut it with facts from the data accuracy table. Show them that Zillow doesn’t take upgrades to their home into account nor does it differentiate between properties with different locations and amenities. &lt;strong&gt;Zillow’s algorithm treats them all the same.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you need to do to embrace Zillow is understand what it does and does not do when it comes to determining a home’s value. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;
