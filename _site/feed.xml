        <title>You’re Invited to Our Founder’s Day Celebration This March</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ljS5TRHo2YA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;2019 is our 66-year anniversary of being in the real estate business, and to celebrate, we&amp;rsquo;re hosting our very own Founder&amp;rsquo;s Day celebration this March.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019 marks the 66th year that Colemere Realty has been in business, and we’ve decided to throw a party to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we’ve brought in our father (and previous owner of Colemere Realty) Tom Colemere to tell the story of how our brokerage got started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our grandfather founded Colemere Realty in 1953. He originally worked in the furniture and appliance business, but a fire damaged his establishment and left him in debt. To pay off that debt, he became a real estate agent. A short time after, he became his own boss. We joined the family business many years later, and a large part of our continued success is due to our father Tom being a great mentor to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you plan on attending, please RSVP.%20http://colemererealtyvideoblog.com/youre-invited-to-our-founders-day-celebration-this-march.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you plan on attending, please RSVP.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to commemorate our 66th year in business, &lt;strong&gt;we want to invite you to our Founder’s Day celebration on March 8 right here at our office from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you plan on attending, please &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bNk_MKQdtn1tFByN8kc2A6Ihm3lUC9LSFcxjOlbtWHA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RSVP here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;with your name, number, and what kind of pie you would like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for us in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to speak with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Check With Your Local Municipality Before Renting Out an ADU</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zEiXerPGQyo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accessory dwelling units represent a great opportunity for homeowners, but there are rules for renting them out that you need to pay attention to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may know, Salt Lake City passed an ordinance last October that allowed all homeowners to have accessory dwelling units (ADUs) on their property. If you’re looking to make some extra money through real estate investing or you’d like to have additional family members (such as in-laws) live on your property, ADUs are a great option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, today we want to remind you that there are different types of legislation being considered for different cities regarding ADUs, so &lt;strong&gt;it’s important that you check with your local municipality before deciding to rent one&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason we mention this is because companies that specialize in ADUs, such as Airbnb and VRBO, were market disruptors when they first came on the scene. They gave homeowners a platform to rent their ADUs, and as more and more started doing it, state and city governments became concerned that a surplus of ADUs would become a potential neighborhood nuisance. They don’t want streets to become overcrowded with cars or households with ADUs to become disruptive, so they stepped in and established some ground rules for renting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=There are a lot of great opportunities to be had with ADUs, but you need to make sure that you follow these rules before adding one to your property.%20http://colemererealtyvideoblog.com/check-with-your-local-municipality-before-renting-out-an-adu.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“There are a lot of great opportunities to be had with ADUs, but you need to make sure that you follow these rules before adding one to your property.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of great opportunities to be had with ADUs, but you need to make sure that you follow these rules before adding one to your property. Also, &lt;strong&gt;you should consider the management aspect of renting out an ADU because that responsibility falls on you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any more questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Check Out This Quick Guide to Accessory Dwelling Units</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5grholfBnq4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today we&amp;rsquo;d like to shed some light on the hot topic of accessory dwelling units.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in making some extra money through real estate investing, or simply how to have your mother-in-law (legally) live with you, then having an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) on your property may be the perfect solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADUs, which can be attached or detached, allow one additional family to reside on your lot&lt;/strong&gt;. This can be a wonderful option for those with elderly parents moving in or if you have adult children coming back to live with you temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Our team would be happy to assist if you are curious about how to pursue this option.%20http://colemererealtyvideoblog.com/check-out-this-quick-guide-to-accessory-dwelling-units.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Our team would be happy to assist if you are curious about how to pursue this option.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you so choose, you can charge rent for those living in your ADU, as we mentioned earlier. So, in the light of recent legislation pertaining to this subject, our team would be happy to assist if you are curious about how to pursue this option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On Waiting Until Spring to Buy a Home</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/j4UgNMSD2yA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today we wanted to discuss waiting until spring to buy a home and why that might not be such a good idea in this market.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hear it all the time: “I’m going to wait until spring to buy a home, rather than try to find one over the holiday season.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though there are typically fewer homes on the market in the fall and winter months, that doesn’t mean waiting until spring is necessarily the best idea—especially in this market. Here are a few reasons why that is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Interest rates are on the rise&lt;/strong&gt;. Increased interest rates will negatively affect a buyer’s purchasing power, meaning they won’t be able to afford the same amount of home if they wait until spring to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Less competition&lt;/strong&gt;. Because there are fewer buyers in the market during the fall and winter, there is less competition for the ones who are looking during that time. The spring market is a prime season for multiple-offer situations and bidding wars, meaning you’ll have to work that much harder for sellers to accept your offer over another buyer’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The spring market is a prime season for multiple-offer situations and bidding wars, meaning you’ll have to work that much harder for sellers to accept your offer over another buyer’s.%20http://colemererealtyvideoblog.com/on-waiting-until-spring-to-buy-a-home.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The spring market is a prime season for multiple-offer situations and bidding wars, meaning you’ll have to work that much harder for sellers to accept your offer over another buyer’s.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main question you need to ask yourself is whether or not you’re ready to buy a home. Are you qualified? Are you comfortable moving forward with a transaction right now? Are you in a position where it will be feasible to move? &lt;strong&gt;If your answers to these questions are yes, then why wait?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, people don’t typically want to move while it’s cold or while there’s snow on the ground, but the reality is that, if you prepare for it properly, moving will only take a half a day—so there shouldn’t be much of a barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to be honest, this is our favorite time of year to show homes. It’s a lot of fun to go through and see all the houses decorated for the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this topic or about buying or selling a home in general, don’t be afraid to reach out to us for all your real estate needs. We’re here to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rising Interest Rates Spell Changes for Homebuyers and Sellers</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7NF4lsMwO9I&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;We lose purchasing power as interest rates rise. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what this means for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may know, the cost of financing a home has been going up. The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates in recent months, and with more increases on the horizon, today we’ll be talking about what this means for you as a buyer or seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utah’s economy is growing rapidly right now, partially due to our many great job opportunities. &lt;strong&gt;The Fed will take this into consideration when they increase interest rates&lt;/strong&gt;, which subsequently affects our housing market and available opportunities for homebuyers and sellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As rates rise, buyers can’t qualify for the same homes they previously could&lt;/strong&gt;. For sellers, this makes it important to sell homes quickly. Because the buyer pool for your home will begin to drain due to increased interest, you won’t be able to get as much for your home and fewer buyers will qualify to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=There’s a direct relationship where we lose purchasing power as interest rates rise.%20http://colemererealtyvideoblog.com/rising-interest-rates-spell-changes-for-homebuyers-and-sellers.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“There’s a direct relationship where we lose purchasing power as interest rates rise.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Similarly for buyers, the amount you can qualify for is lower&lt;/strong&gt;. There’s a direct relationship where we lose purchasing power as interest rates rise. If rates lowered, we’d see an increase in purchasing power, but this is incredibly unlikely to happen. This is illustrated on the graph below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/carnation-fig.cloudvent.net/compressed/ef0843a240d51fce1eeb91d54fcd2505.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;384&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to reach out to us if you’re looking to buy or sell a home, have any questions that you’d like answers, or would simply like some further information. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Makes Fall a Great Time to Put Your Home on the Market?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bxnR50SQO8M&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fall is a great time to sell your home, and there are a few reasons why.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes fall a great time to sell your home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we saw a strong spring and summer in terms of sales volume, but sales typically drop toward the end of the year. It doesn’t mean people don’t want to buy or sell; it just means there are fewer buyers out there for a variety of reasons (colder weather, the start of the school year, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, &lt;strong&gt;the remaining buyers are more serious&lt;/strong&gt;. This means less tire-kicking and more people who are ready to make a deal. In fact, most fall buyers want to get into a home before the first snowfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Now’s an especially great time to sell if you’re looking to move up.%20http://colemererealtyvideoblog.com/what-makes-fall-a-great-time-to-put-your-home-on-the-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Now’s an especially great time to sell if you’re looking to move up.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most times, we also see less competition in the higher price ranges from other sellers during the fall, so &lt;strong&gt;now’s an especially great time to sell if you’re looking to move up&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to put your home on the market before the snow starts falling or you have any other questions about our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pay Attention to the Whole Story When Buying or Selling</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/y5MZMLbldp4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;In our market right now, conditions are split based on price point. And today we&amp;rsquo;d like to explain how this will impact your goals as a buyer or seller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to our market, there’s more than one story to be told. We like to explain our current conditions as being the “Tale of Two Tales.” Thankfully, though, the only Dickensian thing about this update is the name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you a better idea of what we’re talking about, let’s take a look at how our market has been faring recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;homes below $350,000 are still selling relatively fast&lt;/strong&gt;. But, as the name of today’s update implies, this only tells half of the story of today’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike their lower-priced counterparts, homes listed above $400,000 have actually been spending longer on the market and seeing lower offers than in the recent past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do these two tales of our market mean for sellers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The things that are happening in the market on a broad scale don’t tell the whole story.%20http://colemererealtyvideoblog.com/pay-attention-to-the-whole-story-when-buying-or-selling.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The things that are happening in the market on a broad scale don’t tell the whole story.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, while those with homes in lower price ranges will have an easier time achieving selling success, &lt;strong&gt;those listing their home at or above the $400,000 will need to exert a little more effort&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those listed in these less active upper price ranges, staging will be key. You will need to present your home in the best possible light to attract buyer interest and earn the best possible deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, &lt;strong&gt;today’s buyers will also need to strategize according to the price point they’re searching in&lt;/strong&gt;. Those looking in lower price ranges, where homes are moving more quickly, shouldn’t be afraid to get a little aggressive with their offers. Don’t forget to include favorable terms. Price is not the only component to consider when making an offer on a home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, buyers and sellers alike should be mindful of how market conditions will impact their success. Remember: The things that are happening in the market on a broad scale don’t tell the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 Tips to Help You Sell Your Home for Top Dollar</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ftaYyybsi2I&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;To sell your home for top dollar in our market, declutter and clean the inside and make sure the outside has great curb appeal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to sell your home for top dollar, here are three tips that will help you do so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;make sure your home has great curb appeal&lt;/strong&gt; so it gives potential buyers a good first impression. The whole exterior needs to be inviting when buyers pull up, so make sure you keep up with your lawn maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;give your house a deep clean&lt;/strong&gt;—clear the cobwebs out of the corners, open the blinds, clean the baseboards and the carpets, etc. There’s nothing more inviting than stepping into a home that’s clean and fresh-smelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Make sure you keep up with your lawn maintenance.%20http://colemererealtyvideoblog.com/3-tips-to-help-you-sell-your-home-for-top-dollar.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Make sure you keep up with your lawn maintenance.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, &lt;strong&gt;declutter the home and remove any personal items&lt;/strong&gt; so buyers can feel like the home is theirs. Buyers want to see the home—not your stuff. The better the opportunity you can give them to do this, the better the opportunity you give yourself to sell for top dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
