        <title>Agent Highlight: Meet Brandon Evans</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jmr3Maj1fiA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m excited to introduce you to Brandon Evans, one of our real estate agents. The Agent Highlight series will help you get to know some of the agents that you’re working with.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Brandon worked as a police officer for about five years. “I have a lot of respect for police officers, but it just wasn’t my area of expertise,” says Brandon. “I had some good learning experiences, but it just wasn’t my thing.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;“I came across the Keller Williams website, started inquiring more about it, and met with someone in the Riverton office,” Brandon adds. “She sent me down here, and I had several positive conversations that let me know that &lt;strong&gt;this is the place where I wanted to work.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Brandon continued working graveyard shifts while he went through real estate school. “Then I got set up with David and the rest is history,” Brandon says. “I found the right home.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;One of the biggest challenges Brandon faced when he dove in as a full-time real estate agent was the financial aspect. “I spent 20 years working hourly jobs and getting a paycheck every two weeks, and this job is sales,” says Brandon. “I got one deal in three months and it wasn’t that big—I only got $1,200 from it—but everything counts. Then, it started clicking, things started rolling, and I’ve had a pretty steady paycheck since then.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I’ve noticed over the years is that agents get into real estate for two reasons: an unlimited income ceiling and flexibility. However, those are also the two reasons why people leave. They think they will immediately make money and that there won’t be any lag between your efforts and your results.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The truth is that you will work for at least 90 days before you see any income,&lt;/strong&gt; and it will take about six months before you start to see consistent income. If you work through that, you can be a successful agent.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The freedom and flexibility is great, but many agents leave because they are not used to holding themselves accountable. As a result, they don’t keep up with the tasks they need to generate the kind of results that will provide for themselves and their families.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Family is very important to Brandon. “I’ve been married for eight years now, and we have four kids,” says Brandon. “We like to get out and do some motorcycle riding, and I’m a fan of all sports. I love football, and I am a Seahawks fan. Plus, we’re in the process of building our own home, so we’ve got our hands full right now.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;According to Brandon, the best thing about working in real estate is that you have the potential to provide a lifestyle for your family. “I never thought I would be able to come out and build on property,” says Brandon. “Police officers aren’t paid very much. They aren’t paid enough. We see that all the time and it’s unfortunate, but I wanted to be able to build a home and provide a life for my kids. I don’t want to have to say no when they ask to play this sport or go to dance school. &lt;strong&gt;My family is my driving force to get out there, work hard, and be successful.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=My family is my driving force to get out there, work hard, and be successful.%20http://www.canovogroup.tv/agent-highlight-meet-brandon-evans.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“My family is my driving force to get out there, work hard, and be successful.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brandon is a great person and a great real estate agent. I hope this has given you some insight into who he is. If you have any questions about real estate, please don’t hesitate to reach out to Brandon or anyone else on our real estate team.

        <title>Have You Met New Agent Daniel Pust?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/eFfRd8isnpc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today it’s my pleasure to introduce you to one of the new agents on our team, Daniel Pust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel is happily married with a young son in 1st grade. He grew up in the Santaquin/Payson area and still lives there because he loves it. He worked in law enforcement for seven years and eventually became a detective before transitioning into real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically enough, he came into his new profession through a failed transaction, which inspired him to educate himself about our line of work. When he bought his first home in 2004, the market was so hot he hardly remembers even talking to his agent at the time. Three years later, he and his wife had built up quite a bit of equity in that home, and when they found their dream home up in the Santaquin mountains, they decided they wanted to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the two agents who worked on that transaction didn’t know what they were doing and it cost them that home purchase. That experience inspired Daniel to take it upon himself to treat his clients with professionalism, stay on top of what’s going on, and provide them with whatever they need, whether they’re buying a home or selling one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel chose Keller Williams because of the education we provide. As a detective, his job was very demanding, and KW offered training sessions that were compatible with his schedule. He also credits his mentor for taking time out of her busy schedule and encouraging him to stay involved. He ended up here at the Canovo Group through knowing someone who also worked here whose life was transformed positively because of the experience. Working with fellow agents Dane Hill and Ali Garbero on a transaction, which he describes as an “amazing experience,” also sealed the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel’s goal is to establish our brand in South Utah County. He works hard every day and has run into quite a few people who want to move but haven’t put much thought in how they’re going to do it. He enjoys being able to provide a resource for them. Daniel is a person who has both his clients’, friends’, and family’s best interests at heart. He’s full of integrity and will do the right thing regardless of how it impacts him and his business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=DANIEL ALWAYS HAS HIS CLIENTS’ BEST INTERESTS AT HEART.%20http://www.canovogroup.tv/utah-real-estate-agent-meet-one-of-our.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“DANIEL ALWAYS HAS HIS CLIENTS’ BEST INTERESTS AT HEART.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re certainly excited to have him on our team. If you’d like to contact him, you can reach him at (801) 850-5656. If you have any other questions, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. We look forward to serving you in the future!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Has the Utah Real Estate Market Improved over Last Year?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/92i7N5Ko0Wg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first quarter of the year has nearly come and gone, so I wanted to show you some of the most recent numbers from the Utah market and compare them to what we saw in the first quarter of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average days on market for homes listed for sale stayed pretty steady. We went from an average of 33 days in 2016 to an average of 34 days in 2017. Homes are still selling really fast. Home sales have gone down from 6,300 at this point last year to just 6,000 this year. However, inventory is down by around 10% too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, let’s talk about home appreciation. It seems to be the one thing everyone asks about. To determine this, we’ll look at the median sale price in our market. At this point in 2016, it was $230,000. There has been a significant jump since, and the median sale price in our market right now is $251,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have predicted in the past, the market remains strong. As long as rates remain relatively low, we’ll continue to see this trend and we will see anywhere from 4% to 7% appreciation again this year. Some of the top economists in the country have made predictions on the higher end of that spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=AS LONG AS RATES STAY LOW, OUR MARKET WILL CONTINUE ITS RISE.%20http://www.canovogroup.tv/utah-real-estate-agent-comparing-utah.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“AS LONG AS RATES STAY LOW, OUR MARKET WILL CONTINUE ITS RISE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are thinking about taking advantage of current market conditions by buying or selling a home, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Buying Just Got Easier With the NHF Sapphire Program</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8UE2VkAVmFI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, a good friend of mine and my preferred lender, Austin Ingersoll with Academy Mortgage, is joining me to have a chat about a new program that just became available for buyers in our market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s called the NHF Sapphire Program and it’s a true grant program, which means you don’t have to repay the funds that are given to you. You can use the program for a VA, USDA, or an FHA loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your credit score, you can get all the way up to 4.5% of your loan amount given to you. To put that into perspective, on a $300,000 loan, that’s $13,500 which can be used for your down payment and closing costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as requirements go for qualifying, they mirror the loan you are applying for whether it’s an FHA, VA, or a USDA loan. However, to get the most out of this program, you want to have a credit score of at least 680, but you can go as low as 620.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=This program can help get buyers off the sidelines and into their new homes.%20http://www.canovogroup.tv/utah-real-estate-agent-how-nhf-sapphire.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“This program can help get buyers off the sidelines and into their new homes.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all this program is great for buyers out there who are sitting on the sidelines because they may think they don’t have enough money for a down payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see if you qualify for this program or if you have any other real estate questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be more than happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Can You Expect From the 2017 Real Estate Market?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QlGkZbezss0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did our market do in 2016? What can you expect from the 2017 market?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a sense of how the market did overall last year, I wanted to compare some key statistics from the year before. Here’s what happened between 2015 and 2016:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• The average days on market dropped 45% from 53 days to 29 days.
• The number of homes sold rose by 1.7% from 8,400 to 8,550.
• The median sale price increased by 6.9%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We had a great 2016, and it’s all thanks to you.%20http://www.canovogroup.tv/utah-real-estate-agent-2017-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We had a great 2016, and it’s all thanks to you.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a great year for real estate. What about 2017?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, I believe the average days on market will gradually creep back up. I don’t foresee a significant increase, but I do think homes will stay on the market slightly longer than they did in the recent past. Sales, on the other hand, should remain fairly steady and may even drop slightly due to the predicted rise in interest rates and how that will remove a portion of buyers from the market. Overall, though, I predict that we’ll still see some appreciation of between 4% and 7%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market is looking strong for 2017, so if you have any real estate needs at all, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me or anyone on my team. We look forward to helping you and we hope you have a great year!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Should You Sell This Winter?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5REzBrh7qAE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year around this time, we’re asked the same thing by sellers: “Should I sell my home now or wait until spring?” Many of our clients are thinking of hunkering down, waiting out the winter, and selling in the spring. I want to give you four reasons why you might want to consider selling now versus waiting until spring to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More competition during the spring.&lt;/strong&gt; That means less competition right now. While many people have the same thought process as most of our clients and are waiting until spring, you can get a jump on the competition by selling now and taking advantage of the low inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interest rates may be higher in the spring.&lt;/strong&gt; Right now, rates are near all-time lows. With the election passing and the Federal Reserve saying they won’t be making any adjustments in the near future, that’s good news for buyers right now. If rates do tick up a bit this spring, it will eliminate a lot of buyers in the market and diminish the purchasing power of many others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot of job transfers happen at the beginning of the year.&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of these people are looking for homes as we speak. This is just another segment of buyers you won’t be able to capture in the spring and summer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More serious buyers.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re a buyer out looking for homes during the cold, snowy winter months, there is a good reason for doing so. These buyers are likely motivated to get into a home as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=These are just a few reasons to consider selling now.%20http://www.canovogroup.tv/utah-real-estate-agent-should-you-sell_12.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“These are just a few reasons to consider selling now.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just four of the reasons why you should consider selling now to take advantage of the market. If you have any questions for us or are thinking about selling, give us a call or send us an email. We’d be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Can You Keep Your Home Safe During Your Holiday Vacation?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8moaWCzNNo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The holidays are just around the corner, which means you may have a fun family vacation in the works. Here are five tips to keep your home safe while you’re away:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a Wi-Fi doorbell.&lt;/strong&gt; If you don’t already have an alarm system installed in your home, you might want to consider this. How does it work? The doorbell is connected to your smartphone, so anytime someone rings the doorbell, you will be able to see who it is and respond accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add some exterior lighting.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have areas around your property that are dark, you may want to consider installing new lighting fixtures or just double-check that the bulbs in the existing light fixtures work. To go a step further, you may want to also consider installing a motion sensor light.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Extra lighting is an excellent deterrent for potential intruders.%20http://www.canovogroup.tv/utah-real-estate-agent-protecting-your.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Extra lighting is an excellent deterrent for potential intruders.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let a trusted neighbor know that you’ll be gone.&lt;/strong&gt; Tell them when you’re leaving and when you’re coming back so they can keep an eye on things.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjust delivery of your mail and newspapers.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re still one of those people that receives a newspaper, you want to make sure those aren’t accumulating atop your driveway. That’s a surefire indicator to any watchful intruder that nobody’s home. Ditto for mail overflowing out of your mailbox or packages piling up on your front steps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double-check that all doors and windows are locked.&lt;/strong&gt; According to Safewise.com, 30% of all home invasions happen through an unforced entry. This means almost a full third of every home invasion occurs because someone forgot to lock a window or door. Before you leave, check one last time that everything is locked.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about what’s going on in the market or you’re curious about your home’s value, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We hope to talk to you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Every Great Seller's Market Has Its End</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/euTVUuxxqgk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of discussion about the great appreciation and quick home sales we’ve been experiencing in our market lately. No one knows for sure how long this will last, but we do know that markets always shift. &lt;strong&gt;It has happened in the past and it will happen again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got some strategies to share today that are quite useful in a shifting market. Pricing your home is one of the most important aspects of your sale. Here are some strategies that we share with our sellers on how to price appropriately in a shifting market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In an appreciating market, you usually see low inventory and high demand.&lt;/strong&gt; This is what drives prices up. Sellers have the luxury of pricing ahead in this type of market. As long as the market continues in an upward trend, they will get their price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are different in a depreciating market. When supply goes up and demand drops, home prices come back down. If you try to price ahead in a depreciating market, you may find yourself chasing that market down and you may never get your price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Pricing ahead in a depreciating market can be toxic.%20http://www.canovogroup.tv/utah-real-estate-agent-every-great.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Pricing ahead in a depreciating market can be toxic.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We like to consult our clients about what’s happening in the market right now and we are in a funny place today.&lt;/strong&gt; We have seen a lot of sellers get away with pricing ahead, but that is a recipe for disaster if we start to shift to a depreciating market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about how to price your home appropriately in a shifting market, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Much Has Our Market Changed in a Year?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yOroOU7Zcxw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are diving deep into the numbers today. The statistics are in for the third quarter of this year, and we’re going to compare them to the numbers we saw at the same time last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 3rd quarter of 2015, we saw 16,023 homes listed on the market. This year, we saw 16,606 homes listed in the same time frame. &lt;strong&gt;That’s an increase of nearly 4%, which hasn’t happened in a while.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for home sales, the 3rd quarter of 2015 saw 12,661 homes sell. This year, that number was 12,156. This is about a 4% decrease. Inventory is going up and sales are going down. I think this is something we really need to keep an eye on because it may be an indication that things are starting to change in our market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We need to keep an eye on how things progress.%20http://www.canovogroup.tv/utah-real-estate-agent-fantastic.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We need to keep an eye on how things progress.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing we want to focus on is the days on market. We saw a huge 38% drop from 2015 to 2016. In the 3rd quarter of 2015, the average days on market was 24. At the end of the 3rd quarter this year, that number was at 15. &lt;strong&gt;I didn’t think homes could sell any faster than they did last year, but I was wrong.&lt;/strong&gt; Homes that are priced right and in good condition are selling within weeks and sometimes even within days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, let’s talk about home appreciation. At the end of the 3rd quarter in 2015, our median home price was $230,000. This year, that number is at $250,000. &lt;strong&gt;This 8.7% increase is even more good news for sellers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are seeing fantastic conditions for sellers right now, but how long is it going to last? No one knows for sure. What we do know, however, is that increased appreciation and such few days on market is a great recipe for seller success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me or if you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Are Your Utah Property Tax Valuations Too High?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bv5bzcN5CCs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now, you have probably seen your property tax valuation. What happens if the property tax valuation is wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, clients have property tax valuations that are much lower than the appraised value or the fair market value of their home, which means you are probably paying less in property taxes than you should be. If this is the case, you probably don’t want to dispute the property tax valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, if your property tax valuation seems too high, we can help.&lt;/strong&gt; We will do a free home value analysis and provide the paperwork you need to dispute the valuation. Disputing your property taxes may seem like an overwhelming process, but it is actually quite simple, and we are here to guide you through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about your property tax valuation, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;
