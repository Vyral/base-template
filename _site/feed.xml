        <title>The Truth About Investment Properties and LLCs</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hVMgKAw7NhY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things most real estate investors ask when they come to us about financing is, “Can I put the property in some kind of entity, like an LLC, before or after closing?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most residential lenders follow Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac underwriting and servicing guidelines. One of the things Fannie Mae has clarified as recently as November of 2014 is that &lt;strong&gt;no borrower can transfer part or all of the ownership interest of a property into an entity post-closing without violating the dual sales clause&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the answer to this question is, unfortunately, no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to purchase a property in the name of an LLC or in an individual’s name and transfer it into an LLC, that is actually a commercial loan. That is not something that a traditional residential lender can assist with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you want to put the property in an LLC, you will need a commercial loan.%20http://winningwithwade.com/the-truth-about-investment-properties-and-llcs.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you want to put the property in an LLC, you will need a commercial loan.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We do have an outlet that can help you with a commercial loan&lt;/strong&gt;. We will just need to ask you some questions ahead of time to determine your real estate goals so that we can properly tailor this for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know of anyone looking to add to their investment portfolio this year, introduce us to them. We are happy to chat with them about what the requirements are so that they are in the best possible position to make that offer on the investment property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any other questions, just give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to talking with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Answering Your Questions About Purchasing a Second Home</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gj5XjpUzsUs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of our customers contact us with questions about owning a second home. The good news is that &lt;strong&gt;transactions for second homes are treated almost identically to transactions for primary residences&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one big difference is that a lot of lenders will look closely at the distance between your primary and secondary residence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Lenders will pay a lot of attention to the distance between your potential second property and your primary residence.%20http://winningwithwade.com/answering-your-questions-about-purchasing-a-second-home.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Lenders will pay a lot of attention to the distance between your potential second property and your primary residence.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something like a vacation home, located far away from where you currently reside, will make sense. However, a secondary residence in the same, or near the same, neighborhood as your first home isn’t going to pass a sniff test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;strong&gt;talk with your lender ahead of time to develop a roadmap for making a successful offer on your second home&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Loan Limits for the FHA Program Have Increased</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ykSgwDrpvQs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FHA loan limits have recently increased. Due to its flexible approval guidelines, the FHA loan program is a great option for first-time buyers or those with little available for a down payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loan limits will vary by county, but in the DFW Metroplex, the single-unit limit has increased to $386,400. This limit also varies depending on the number of units in a property. For example, the loan limit is $494,650 for duplexes, $597,500 for triplexes, and $743,100 for quads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The FHA loan program is a great option for first-time buyers or those with little available for a down payment.%20http://winningwithwade.com/loan-limits-for-the-fha-program-have-increased.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The FHA loan program is a great option for first-time buyers or those with little available for a down payment.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As long as you occupy one of the units as a primary residence, you can structure a loan on a multi-unit property using the FHA program.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This program is a great option if you or anyone you know is looking to buy a house in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like help obtaining an FHA loan, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 Tax Law Changes to Know</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FmuDDTwLkOE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you’ve probably heard by now, the government has passed sweeping legislation to dramatically change our tax code. A lot of things are going to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before I get started, let me just remind you that if you need individualized tax advice, you should consult your tax advisor&lt;/strong&gt;. However, I want to provide you with some helpful information about how the changes could affect your mortgage and other payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main driver in the changes is that the standard deduction has been increased to $12,000 for an individual and $24,000 for a couple. This is important because it will encourage more people to claim the standard deduction as opposed to itemizing those deductions. &lt;strong&gt;As it relates to real estate and real estate finance, there are three ways the new tax code may affect you. And, one important tax benefit that is staying put&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Mortgage interest deduction&lt;/strong&gt;. Previously, you could deduct the mortgage interest on a loan up to $1 million. That number has been lowered to $750,000. While that’s still a very large number, this change will undoubtedly affect some people at the upper end of the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Equity indebtedness&lt;/strong&gt;. If you’ve taken cash out of your property at some point in the past, there were complex rules about what can and can’t be deducted. Starting in 2018, none of the interest on the equity piece of your loan can be deducted. If this is something that might affect you, I recommend discussing it with your tax advisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The property tax exemption&lt;/strong&gt;. You’re only going to be allowed to deduct up to $10,000 on your property taxes. Although that might sound like a large number, especially in the DFW area, it’s not the largest property assessed value that affects you. Keep that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The capital gains exclusion is still in place.%20http://winningwithwade.com/3-tax-law-changes-to-know.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The capital gains exclusion is still in place.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key benefit that is remaining from the previous tax policy is the capital gains exclusion, allowing you to deduct up to $250,000 in capital gains on the sale of a property if you’re single and $500,000 if you file jointly I know many real estate investors who have greatly benefited from the exclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any concerns about the new tax bill and how it will affect you, it may be worth the time to consult with your tax advisor. If you plan to buy a home in 2018, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call. I am happy to help answer any questions you may have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This New Change Will Be Advantageous to Borrowers</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cztus1rRsTQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pleased to let you know that the government just &lt;strong&gt;recently announced a new maximum conforming loan limit for 2018.&lt;/strong&gt; The reality is that in 2017 the limit was $424,000 and it has now been raised to $453,100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a big deal because &lt;strong&gt;it gives consumers more buying power&lt;/strong&gt;. If you go above the $424,100 threshold, that puts you into the jumbo loan category, and that typically comes with certain downsides such as tighter underwriting guidelines, higher credit minimums, typically higher interest rates, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=This is a big deal because it gives consumers more buying power.%20http://winningwithwade.com/this-new-change-will-be-advantageous-to-borrowers.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“This is a big deal because it gives consumers more buying power.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those downsides are why it’s important that if you’re able to structure it as a conforming loan, you do so, because &lt;strong&gt;it’s just more advantageous for the borrower&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking of purchasing a property or meaning to refinance and you’re in the $500,000 to $600,000 price point range, please reach out to us. We’d be honored to walk you through your options to make sure that we can structure this so that it accomplishes your long- and short-term financial goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s anything else that we can do for you, don’t hesitate to ask either. We’d be happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>4 Reasons Why Your Lender Matters</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2COKY9-dYdI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s topic is about why your lender matters in a competitive market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talk to a lot of Realtors in my profession, and frankly, they tell me there are about four key things that make a difference in the likelihood of an offer getting accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.) Local lenders. &lt;strong&gt;Listing agents routinely look for local lenders&lt;/strong&gt;; they prefer not to work with large national banks or internet lenders. They want to be able to contact someone local if there’s an issue and someone who has local appraisers on their panel. Choose who you work with carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) Pre-approval letters. In the state of Texas, pre-approval letters are required to list what documents have and have not been verified, so if the letter that you’re looking at doesn’t have those items on there, I’d encourage you to ask your lender why, or find a different lender. &lt;strong&gt;Make sure the lender has actually looked at some documents.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.) Have the underwriter sign off. Have the lender take the process a step further and have the underwriter sign off on the pre-approval letter. Even though it takes a little bit more time for the lender, it’s a much more thorough way to go about it. &lt;strong&gt;It gives the listing agent certainty that you can actually close on the financing that you’re applying for&lt;/strong&gt; because the underwriters actually sign off on it. As long as you don’t lose a job or blow your down payment money in Las Vegas, you’ll be able to close on the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.) &lt;strong&gt;Have your loan officer contact the listing agent to talk up your offer.&lt;/strong&gt; Frankly, that type of call goes over very, very well with the listing agent. This can be the thing that pushes you over the edge in a multiple offer situation. I had a client just last week who was one of 22 offers on a property, and the seller took our offer because I called them—even though it was $8,000 less than the highest offer. &lt;strong&gt;We’re a local lender with a good reputation, and they knew we were communicative about having the underwrite on the file.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, that type of call goes over very, very well with the listing agent. This can be the thing that pushes you over the edge in a multiple offer situation. I had a client just last week who was one of 22 offers on a property, and the seller took our offer because I called them—even though it was $8,000 less than the highest offer. We’re a local lender with a good reputation, and they knew we were communicative about having the underwrite on the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=When you find your dream home, you need to be working with a lender that will do whatever it takes to get you into that home.%20http://winningwithwade.com/4-reasons-why-your-lender-matters.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“When you find your dream home, you need to be working with a lender that will do whatever it takes to get you into that home.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These measures can really put you in the driver’s seat with your offers, because let’s face it, you’re not in the market to just make offer after offer and not get a property under contract. When you find your dream home, you need to be working with a lender that will do whatever it takes to get you into that home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you or someone you know is looking for that type of service, please contact us. We’d be honored to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Things to Know About Flood Insurance</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9PsW2QGAVHQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the devastating hurricanes, we have a unique situation out there in the insurance world. I wanted to take just a minute to talk about flood insurance here in Texas and how it relates to your mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you take out a home loan, your lender is required to pull a flood certification to see if your property is in a flood zone.&lt;/strong&gt; If you are, you’ll be required to take out a flood insurance policy. These can get quite pricey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to pay for them in full prior to closing, and you have to have them escrowed in your account regardless of whether you’re escrowed for taxes or insurance. It’s very important that if you are in a flood zone or looking at a home in a flood zone, you learn about it early on in the process so you can have time to make an educated decision on how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Many of them don’t protect against water damage at all.%20http://winningwithwade.com/things-to-know-about-flood-insurance.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Many of them don’t protect against water damage at all.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being from New Orleans and having to go through Hurricane Katrina, I have deep sympathy for all of our friends in Houston and Florida. &lt;strong&gt;I’ve learned from first-hand experience that the biggest floods tend to happen in non-flood zones.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if your home isn’t in one, I encourage you to at least have a conversation with your insurance professional about what exactly your policy covers. Many of them don’t protect against water damage at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions in the meantime or if you know anyone looking to buy a home in the near future, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why You Shouldn’t Be Scared of ARMs</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cyug6rA_5Pw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people associate an adjustable-rate mortgage, or ARM, with the market crash of 2008. In reality, ARMs were misrepresented to the public during that time and people have been slow to come back to them. However, they have a purpose. An ARM could be the perfect thing for you, depending on what your goals are as a homeowner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=There is some risk involved, but it can be a very useful tool.%20http://winningwithwade.com/why-you-shouldnt-be-scared-of-arms.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“There is some risk involved, but it can be a very useful tool.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re going to be in a home for a set period of time, let’s say four or five years, it behooves you to look at an ARM mortgage&lt;/strong&gt; because it could actually save you a lot of money. While ARMs are known for adjusted rates, they usually have a fixed period at the beginning of the loan. This means for a certain time, the interest rate is lower on that mortgage than it would have been on a traditional 15 or 30-year loan. After the “fixed period,” the rate will adjust up or down depending on what you agreed to on the front end. There are caps in place to protect you from large swings, however. That’s what happened to a lot of people during the recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who benefit from ARMs have a defined holding period and know exactly how long they want to own a property. You can also benefit from an ARM by rapidly paying down your loan at the beginning of the term while the rate is low. &lt;strong&gt;By the time the rate adjusts, your payment will have lowered, even with a higher rate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ARM definitely has a place in the lender’s toolbox, but there is some risk involved. If you have any questions for us about ARMs or any other type of loan, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Are You Ready to Get Rid of Your Mortgage Insurance?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zR6wgPYdlrM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Removing mortgage insurance is different for conventional and FHA loans. However, most people may not realize that the removal of mortgage insurance, regardless of loan type, is actually dictated by the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take out an FHA loan, your ability to remove mortgage insurance is predicated on the down payment amount. If you put more than 10% down, you are only required to pay mortgage insurance for 11 years. If you put less than 10% down, &lt;strong&gt;then you have to pay mortgage insurance for the entire life of the loan.&lt;/strong&gt; So, keep that in mind if you are considering an FHA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conventional loans carry private mortgage insurance, or PMI. Most people think that once they get to 80% loan to value, the mortgage insurance falls off. That’s not exactly true. The rule states that if you pay mortgage insurance, it automatically falls off at 78% loan to value—but you can request to remove it at 80% LTV. Contact your loan servicer once you reach 80% and ask to get that PMI removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Appreciation in value adds a bit of a wrinkle to this process.%20http://winningwithwade.com/are-you-ready-to-get-rid-of-your-mortgage-insurance.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Appreciation in value adds a bit of a wrinkle to this process.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appreciation in value does add another wrinkle to this process.&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of customers say, “My home appreciated in value since I bought it. Now I have the 20% equity and would like to remove my mortgage insurance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is fine, but the rules for using appreciation as justification are different than the rules based on the original purchase price. You are ineligible to use appreciation as justification years zero through two of owning the home. Between the two and five-year mark, you need 25% equity for justification; after five years, that number goes back down to 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your loan servicer will require an updated appraisal at that time to make sure that you have subsequent equity levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about removing mortgage insurance, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Texas-Specific Equity Loan Rules</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/adaXpZFGsus?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may not realize it, but we actually have some of the most conservative equity laws in the country down here in Texas. They limit the maximum loan-to-value of your financing to 80% of the home’s value. &lt;strong&gt;Regardless of the financing you are doing, the state requires an appraisal to be conducted to determine its value to make sure it doesn’t exceed the 80% threshold.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few different types of equity loans out there. Here’s a little bit of information about each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equity lines of credit are variable and can be used for practically anything. Standalone second liens are typically taken out for home improvements. Cash-out refinances are when you refinance your entire loan balance in excess of what you want to borrow to get cash out of the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You can only have one equity loan at a time.%20http://winningwithwade.com/texas-specific-equity-loan-rules.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“You can only have one equity loan at a time.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are advantages and disadvantages to each, but one thing about these loans is universal in Texas. &lt;strong&gt;Whenever you take one out, there is a 12-month cooling off period until you can touch it.&lt;/strong&gt; If you did a cash-out refinance and rates cratered immediately after, you are prevented from refinancing again until after the period has passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, keep in mind that in Texas, you are only allowed one equity loan on a property at a time. If you did a cash-out refinance, for example, you are not allowed to take a home equity LOC out after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me or would like to discuss your specific scenario, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;
