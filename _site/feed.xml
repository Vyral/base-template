        <title>How We Make Homebuying Easier</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3oPhEItFrDw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does working with the Vanka Group make a difference when buying a home in Silicon Valley? &lt;strong&gt;There are three main reasons.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing is our needs analysis. It’s the first thing we do with our buying clients. It’s so important because every client is different. Some buyers want a certain home in a certain area no matter the price, and some have a budget they have to stick to. &lt;strong&gt;Because of that, this meeting is essential in setting your expectations for the process as a whole.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=55% OF HOMEBUYERS ARE PAYING WITH CASH.%20localhost:4000/how-we-make-homebuying-easier.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“55% OF HOMEBUYERS ARE PAYING WITH CASH.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we understand the market. In Silicon Valley, 55% of homes purchased last year were cash transactions. If you’re going to be competing with cash offers and you’re using financing, a pre-approval is essential in getting all your ducks in a row. &lt;strong&gt;We have some amazing lender partners we can refer you to.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the last step is to identify the neighborhoods that are good fits for you. We can strategize with you and help narrow down the best options, whether you want to be near good schools, the highway, or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Should You Be Worried About a Market Correction?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bYlhlpvAxhQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of “Are we headed toward a market correction?” is one of the most common inquiries I’ve been getting lately. So today &lt;strong&gt;I am going to talk about the three things you should be focusing on if we are indeed headed toward a correction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, make your investments with a five to seven year outlook. With a long-term plan, you’ll be just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, California real estate has historically appreciated for over 7% if you hold the asset for at least five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=REAL ESTATE IS A RECIPE FOR BUILDING WEALTH.%20localhost:4000/should-you-be-worried-about-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“REAL ESTATE IS A RECIPE FOR BUILDING WEALTH.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the power of compounding. Real estate is one of the only asset classes that you can invest in with as little as 10% down. You can buy a million dollar asset for $100,000 in cash value and when you combine that with the fact that homes appreciate so rapidly around here, &lt;strong&gt;you have a recipe for building wealth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me or you’re looking to get into real estate investing yourself, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Makes Zillows Estimates So Inaccurate?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cbgq9ZLNilY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I go on listing presentations, home sellers always ask me about the disparity between Zestimates and what homes actually sell for. Zillow will give their home a certain value, but the National Association of Realtors states that homes sell for 5% more or less than their Zestimate more than 67% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple main reasons why this happens. &lt;strong&gt;The first thing you have to understand about a Zestimate is that it’s an algorithm, or a formula-based estimation.&lt;/strong&gt; It only calculates general information like the square footage of the house and the previous sales in that house’s particular zip code. As we know, houses are imperfect. Zillow doesn’t take into account things like the wear and tear from your kids or your pets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details play a huge part in a home’s true value. For example, in Silicon Valley, schools are a big factor in determining home prices. Two identical houses in Cupertino that are right across the street from each other could be as much as $200,000 apart in value just because one house is assigned to Lynbrook High School and the other is assigned to Monte Vista High School.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=ZESTIMATES SHOULD ONLY BE USED AS A GUIDING TOOL FOR PRICING YOUR HOME.%20localhost:4000/what-makes-zillows-estimates-so.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“ZESTIMATES SHOULD ONLY BE USED AS A GUIDING TOOL FOR PRICING YOUR HOME.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this factored in, it’s really important that you use Zestimates and other online calculators as merely a guiding tool. If you want to know the exact value of your house, you should ask a professional real estate agent who knows your neighborhood well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need an estimate of your home’s value or you’re looking to buy or sell, don’t hesitate to get in touch with us. We’d be glad to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Should You Sell During the Spring and Summer?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/p7R-prVYPVU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When is the best time of year to sell your home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redfin, which is the largest real estate portal, has stated that homes sold in the spring and summer sell 9% faster and for 1.2% more money. There are a couple of reasons for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=SPRING AND SUMMER ARE GREAT TIMES TO SELL YOUR HOME.%20localhost:4000/should-you-sell-during-spring-and-summer.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“SPRING AND SUMMER ARE GREAT TIMES TO SELL YOUR HOME.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, families that are looking to move want to wait until their kids are out of school. They don’t want to deal with the hassle of having to change school districts in the middle of the year, so selling during the spring and summer is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, interest rates are beginning to rise. Buyers are getting off the fence because they want to lock in the low interest rates that we have right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to buy or sell a home or if you have any other questions, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 Tips for a Smooth Escrow Process</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zl7aPBwL1Vc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you sell your house and get a ratified contract, taking these three steps will help you have a smooth escrow process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclosures.&lt;/strong&gt; As soon as the contract is ratified, the seller has to provide a certain amount of disclosures. The two most important ones that sellers should really take their time filling out are the seller supplemental checklist (which has to do with the seller’s knowledge of all the items in the home) and the transfer disclosure statement, which outlines what is and isn’t included in the property. Say you have a chandelier that’s a family heirloom that won’t be included with the house—you’d need to include that in the TDS.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mortgage process.&lt;/strong&gt; The appraisal is a big hurdle we need to get past. Typically, we want the appraisal to be at or above the purchase price so that the bank will approve the loan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=THE TITLE SEARCH ENSURES THE PROPERTY DOESN'T HAVE ANY LIENS ON IT.%20localhost:4000/3-tips-for-smooth-escrow-process.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“THE TITLE SEARCH ENSURES THE PROPERTY DOESN’T HAVE ANY LIENS ON IT.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing.&lt;/strong&gt; In the state of California, there are a lot of things we’ve got to make sure we pass clearly. The first item is the title search; we want to make sure we’re up front and clear about any liens on the property or anything that would prevent us from giving a free and clear title to the buyer. Next comes title insurance, but if you work with our team, we take care of it ahead of time so you can be ahead of the curve. Then comes the funding part. About one or two days before the close of escrow, the bank will put the money into the escrow account, so you need to make sure this is done. Lastly, we have the final sign off. Schedule some time to sign off with the title team before you leave to celebrate selling your home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about the escrow process or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in the Bay Area, give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 Tips to Sell for Top Dollar in the Bay Area</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsJD6aySsCM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you sell your home, following these three steps will help you net the most money possible.
 1. &lt;strong&gt;Staging.&lt;/strong&gt; The National Association of Realtors has statistically proven that homes that are staged and displayed with great photography (and video) net up to 6% more than houses that aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mega open houses.&lt;/strong&gt; This is something I share with sellers in our very first consultation. Any buyer who is serious about buying your house will take three showings. The first is typically online (remember, amazing photos and videos are important!) and the second typically happens when a buyer drives around the neighborhood to see if it’s one they’d want their family to live in. Can their kids go play at the park? Is this where they’d like to go buy groceries? The third and final showing for motivated buyers is the “mega open house” when they come visit it in person. We hold these mega open houses for all of our sellers, and they are a giant party! We have food, champagne, wine, and beer, and we make it a great experience. Motivated buyers will possibly look at four to eight houses in a given weekend, so we want to be the house that sticks out in their mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=BUYERS WILL LOOK AT UP TO EIGHT HOUSES IN A GIVEN WEEKEND, SO WE WANT TO BE THE HOME THAT STANDS OUT.%20localhost:4000/3-tips-to-sell-for-top-dollar-in-bay.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“BUYERS WILL LOOK AT UP TO EIGHT HOUSES IN A GIVEN WEEKEND, SO WE WANT TO BE THE HOME THAT STANDS OUT.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inspections.&lt;/strong&gt; When a buyer looks at a home, they like to know that all the little issues have been addressed up front. As a seller, we ideally like to have inspections up front, like the property inspection, termite inspection, and a chimney or pool inspection if the home has them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this topic or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home here in Bay Area, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help you out!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 Tips for Increasing Pre-Sale Value</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qN4GtBNFqnQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When preparing your house for sale, what can you do to it that brings the best return on your investment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put together a list of the best things you can do in our market here in the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Declutter the house.&lt;/strong&gt; Your personal ornaments might not be things that buyers are looking at or place value in. Decluttering and making the house as bright as possible will make it look larger.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paint is gold.&lt;/strong&gt; Think neutral colors on your interior walls for a clean look to increase the value of your home. At the end of the day, it will return more money on your investment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flooring.&lt;/strong&gt; New carpet might be one of the cheapest and most effective ways to get more money out of your sale. If you have hardwood flooring, be sure to clean it up and polish it. We have great vendors for these resources that give our clients special pricing on things like flooring. We’d be happy to put you in touch with them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=NEW CARPET MIGHT BE ONE OF THE CHEAPEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO GET MORE MONEY OUT OF YOUR SALE.%20localhost:4000/3-tips-to-increase-your-homes-value.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“NEW CARPET MIGHT BE ONE OF THE CHEAPEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO GET MORE MONEY OUT OF YOUR SALE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about ways to get the most value out of your home sale or you’re thinking about buying a new home, give me a call or send me an email soon. I’d be glad to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 Home Buying Costs You Might Forget About</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/rFDucaD66Ds?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mortgage payment isn’t the only cost you’ll have when you buy a home. There are certain costs that buyers tend to forget when they are going through the buying process. &lt;strong&gt;Here are three extra costs associated with homeownership that you should take into account in your budget:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Property taxes.&lt;/strong&gt; They are paid once every six months in California. However, you can deduct all the property taxes against your revenue line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Property taxes are paid twice per year.%20localhost:4000/3-home-buying-costs-you-might-forget.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Property taxes are paid twice per year.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Utility bills.&lt;/strong&gt; When you are coming from a property where you lease with a landlord, they could be covering some of your bills. When you own your own home, you will have to pay those costs out of pocket. I’d budget at least $200 a month for this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Furnishing bills.&lt;/strong&gt; To furnish a 3-bedroom house, it’s going to cost you $15,000 to $20,000. Don’t go out on a spending spree before the sale is closed and you hold the title. The lender can pull your credit up to that moment and even deny your loan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for us or you’re looking to buy a luxury property in the area, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Trump Effect on the Real Estate Industry</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LzFar7WMJig?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump will be the next President of the United States. What does that mean for the real estate industry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, since the election ended a couple weeks ago, &lt;strong&gt;interest rates have gone up half a point.&lt;/strong&gt; Historically speaking, 4% is still a low interest rate, so home prices have not been affected that much so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Interest rates are still historically low.%20localhost:4000/the-trump-effect-on-real-estate-industry.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Interest rates are still historically low.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if rates were to increase in the future, Trump’s views on regulation in the real estate industry would counter any effect interest rates might have on price. This past August, Trump said, “There’s no industry other than the energy industry that’s regulated more than real estate.” Right now, regulation costs make up 25% of building costs; &lt;strong&gt;Trump believes regulation costs should be closer to 2%.&lt;/strong&gt; If that happens, more renters would be able to afford houses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, inventory is still a huge challenge in the real estate market. As a result, our market has remained fairly stable. If you are thinking of selling your home, now is still a good time to get top dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about the real estate market, just give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Financial Benefits of Homeownership</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DcNoE_FnPFQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it’s a dream for many of us to one day own a home, there are a few financial benefits of homeownership that you may not have considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saving money is one of the major benefits. You get to save the interest portion of your whole mortgage against your income for the year. &lt;strong&gt;Many people don’t realize that your monthly mortgage payment is broken down into two separate parts: mortgage interest and mortgage principal payment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the first part of your monthly payment is fully tax deductible, the second part includes property tax. When you own a house in California, you’ll pay property tax on it. That portion of your monthly payment can be held against your income as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, during the first year you own a house, you’ll typically have origination fees from borrowing money with a loan. This can also be deducted against your income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when you’re deciding whether it’s better for you to rent or buy a home, &lt;strong&gt;you need to determine your net payment and compare that to what you’re paying your landlord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Owning a home is like a forced savings plan.%20localhost:4000/the-financial-benefits-of-homeownership.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Owning a home is like a forced savings plan.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing to consider about home ownership is that owning a home is like a forced savings plan. Remember when I said that your monthly payment is broken up into two parts—the principal and the interest? The principal part is the actual loan that you’re paying down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at an example mortgage. If you’re paying $2,000 per month against your principal and you own the house for five years, this would equal $24,000 in principal reduction per year or $120,000 over the course of five years. This is a lot of money, but you’ve saved a lot of money that you wouldn’t have if you had rented the property. When you add it all up, this is how you build wealth in real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens at the end of this five-year period? &lt;strong&gt;If you own the house for more than two years, then in the state of California, you are eligible for a capital gains exclusion on your primary residence.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re single, this could mean up to $250,000 available for you to defer out in taxes, and if you’re married, you’re eligible for up to $500,000 in deferments per transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about the benefits of homeownership or you’re looking to buy or sell a home in the Bay Area, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;
