        <title>Are You Ready to Get Rid of Your Mortgage Insurance?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wiWFgIXXxzA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Removing mortgage insurance is different for conventional and FHA loans. However, most people may not realize that the removal of mortgage insurance, regardless of loan type, is actually dictated by the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take out an FHA loan, your ability to remove mortgage insurance is predicated on the down payment amount. If you put more than 10% down, you are only required to pay mortgage insurance for 11 years. If you put less than 10% down, &lt;strong&gt;then you have to pay mortgage insurance for the entire life of the loan.&lt;/strong&gt; So, keep that in mind if you are considering an FHA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conventional loans carry private mortgage insurance, or PMI. Most people think that once they get to 80% loan to value, the mortgage insurance falls off. That’s not exactly true. The rule states that if you pay mortgage insurance, it automatically falls off at 78% loan to value—but you can request to remove it at 80% LTV. Contact your loan servicer once you reach 80% and ask to get that PMI removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Appreciation in value adds a bit of a wrinkle to this process.%20http://winningwithwade.com/are-you-ready-to-get-rid-of-your-mortgage-insurance.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Appreciation in value adds a bit of a wrinkle to this process.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appreciation in value does add another wrinkle to this process.&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of customers say, “My home appreciated in value since I bought it. Now I have the 20% equity and would like to remove my mortgage insurance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is fine, but the rules for using appreciation as justification are different than the rules based on the original purchase price. You are ineligible to use appreciation as justification years zero through two of owning the home. Between the two and five-year mark, you need 25% equity for justification; after five years, that number goes back down to 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your loan service will require an updated appraisal at that time to make sure that you have subsequent equity levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about removing mortgage insurance, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Texas-Specific Equity Loan Rules</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/d5qvE6xL7RU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may not realize it, but we actually have some of the most conservative equity laws in the country down here in Texas. They limit the maximum loan-to-value of your financing to 80% of the home’s value. &lt;strong&gt;Regardless of the financing you are doing, the state requires an appraisal to be conducted to determine its value to make sure it doesn’t exceed the 80% threshold.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few different types of equity loans out there. Here’s a little bit of information about each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equity lines of credit are variable and can be used for practically anything. Standalone second liens are typically taken out for home improvements. Cash-out refinances are when you refinance your entire loan balance in excess of what you want to borrow to get cash out of the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You can only have one equity loan at a time.%20http://winningwithwade.com/texas-specific-equity-loan-rules.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“You can only have one equity loan at a time.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are advantages and disadvantages to each, but one thing about these loans is universal in Texas. &lt;strong&gt;Whenever you take one out, there is a 12-month cooling off period until you can touch it.&lt;/strong&gt; If you did a cash-out refinance and rates cratered immediately after, you are prevented from refinancing again until after the period has passed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, keep in mind that in Texas, you are only allowed one equity loan on a property at a time. If you did a cash-out refinance, for example, you are not allowed to take a home equity LOC out after the fact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me or would like to discuss your specific scenario, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Can You Buy a Home for Your Parents?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gsGxSsduAb0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people would like to buy a home for their parents, but don’t know the best way how. The answer largely depends on the circumstances of the parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae guidelines allow a child to buy a property for their parents, &lt;strong&gt;and if the parents don’t qualify, the child can purchase it as a primary residence.&lt;/strong&gt;The advantage of this is the lower interest rates and lower down payment requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=How you buy a house for your parents depends on their unique circumstances.%20http://winningwithwade.com/can-you-buy-a-home-for-your-parents.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“How you buy a house for your parents depends on their unique circumstances.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the parents qualify for a mortgage, the child can still purchase the property, but it has to be structured as an investment property purchase, which will have more restrictive down payment requirements and higher interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you or anyone you know are thinking about buying a home for your parents, we’d love to sit down with you and talk about the intricacies of this kind of transaction and how to put you in the best possible position. We’d be honored to serve you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Handle a Mortgage During a Divorce</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RpzletUHTGQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a marriage ends, what happens to the house and the mortgage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to know the plans for the home. You can refinance to remove one person from the loan or sell the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Texas is a community property state. A refinance may not be necessary if you dictate in the divorce decree who will be obligated to make the payments. However, the downside is that the departing spouse’s credit is still tied to the home. If the occupying spouse misses a payment, it would still negatively affect the other’s credit. That’s why I recommend refinancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=It's important to know the plans for the home.%20http://winningwithwade.com/how-to-handle-mortgage-during-divorce.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“It’s important to know the plans for the home.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timing will dictate whether an owelty lien is used. In Texas, if you’re trying to refinance to remove one spouse, many times you need to take cash out to pay them their share of the equity. Texas has limits for the maximum loan-to-value you can have on a cash-out refinance of 80%. Depending on what the home appraises at or the agreed payment, it may or may not be enough equity to take out. The alternative is the owelty lien, which gets put on the property for the agreed-upon amount and prevents the occupying spouse from refinancing or selling the property without guaranteeing payment to the departing spouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the most secure way to get equity out of the home. However, it needs to be agreed upon before the divorce is finalized. Sadly, I many people come to me after the divorce is already finalized, so this option is off the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selling the property releases both parties from the obligation of the mortgage, but they both still need to move somewhere. That’s why it’s still important to speak with a mortgage lender to get the situation resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you or anyone you know is in this situation and needs guidance, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. It would be my honor to help you through this process.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Different Types of Mortgage Insurance and How They Function</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/s2cDOcklKKI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To many people, the topic of mortgage insurance carries a negative connotation, but it shouldn’t. It has its place in the mortgage process and can benefit you as a consumer. There are three main types of mortgage insurance you need to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Know the goals of your property before picking a mortgage insurance.%20http://winningwithwade.com/the-different-types-of-mortgage.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Know the goals of your property before picking a mortgage insurance.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common type is borrower-paid monthly mortgage insurance. This is where the monthly amount gets added to the principal and interest portion of your payment. You would then make that payment each month until you get to a 78% loan-to-value ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other type is single-premium financed mortgage insurance. This is where the lifetime costs of the mortgage insurance get financed into the loan amount. It keeps your interest rate the same, but it adds to the loan amount. This actually results in a lower monthly payment because you don’t have the interest rate at that higher amount each month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last type is lender-paid mortgage insurance. This is where the lender pays the lifetime cost of the mortgage insurance in exchange for you agreeing to a higher interest rate. A higher interest rate has a negative connotation with most consumers, but the reality is that it results in the lowest possible monthly payment, and it’s even lower once you consider the after-tax mortgage interest deduction. This is a good way to structure your loan, but not if you’re going to keep the loan for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of the monthly mortgage insurance is that it can fall off once you get to the 78% loan-to-value ratio. If you finance it in as a lump sum into the loan amount or roll it into the interest rate, there’s nothing to fall off because it has already been factored in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules to remove monthly insurance are pretty complicated, and which structure makes the most sense for you is largely dependent on your goals for your property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My staff and I would be honored to help walk you through this, so if you have any more questions or know anyone looking to purchase a home in the next six months, please don’t hesitate to give us a call. we‘d love to speak with you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Can You Get the Effect of Bi-Weekly Payments Without the Middleman?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/U4p8l27fX68?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often get questions from clients asking about bi-weekly payment options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is, once you close on a transaction, you’re going to get inundated with junk mail, much of which will be requests for you to sign up for a bi-weekly payment option. This means that instead of paying your mortgage once a month, you’d pay twice a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=With this plan, you get the same effect as bi-weekly payments without the middle man and their fee.%20http://winningwithwade.com/how-can-you-get-effect-of-bi-weekly.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“With this plan, you get the same effect as bi-weekly payments without the middle man and their fee.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality of working with these companies, though, is that you’ll pay them a month in advance. Then, you’ll pay every two weeks, and in turn, they will pay your lender once a month. This will continue until they’ve built up enough reserves in the escrow account they’ve set up for you to make that 13th payment a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I advise my clients to take that monthly payment you’re paying to your lender each month, divide it by 12, and add that amount to what you pay every single month. This results in a 13th payment being made every year. It’s exactly the same as the bi-weekly payment plan, with the only difference being that by doing it yourself, you cut out the middleman—and their fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this payment plan, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be honored to help!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Can Your Lender Close on Time?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nGd-4XihD40?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closing on time is a promise that every lender makes, but the reality is that very few actually do it consistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I have an initial conversation with a borrower and I ask them what’s most important to them, I’ll often hear things like the interest rate, the communication level, the products that are offered, and the ability to close on time. Out of all of those factors, the one that has the most bearing on a successful transaction is the lender’s ability to close on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take out a loan, it’s very important to partner with a lender that will go through the due diligence steps up front to ensure that you’re fully pre-approved. After that, they should set the correct expectations for you so that when you shop for a home, you know how to properly negotiate for it so the transaction is a smooth one and you have a happy closing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, about one-third of all home loans don’t close on time, according to the Campbell/Inside Mortgage Finance Housing Pulse Tracking Survey. FHA loans only close on time 59.2% of the time. Conventional loans (e.g., those that are backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) only close on time 63.6% of the time. Cash transactions—believe it or not—only close on time 79.1% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Who you partner with for your financing has a large impact on your transaction.%20http://winningwithwade.com/can-your-lender-close-on-time.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Who you partner with for your financing has a large impact on your transaction.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who you partner with for your financing has a large impact on whether you have a successful closing or not. If you or someone you know is planning on purchasing a home in the next six months, please don’t hesitate to give us a call or shoot us an email so we can set up a consultation. We’d be happy to help!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Are the Benefits of Using a Piggyback Loan?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/F9ABJoFBjwc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes piggyback loans beneficial to home buyers? Why would a recast be more advantageous for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A piggyback loan is when you take out a single loan for 80% of the home’s value and either 10% or 15% of the remainder to purchase the home. It’s usually either an 80/10 or 80/15/5 split.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structuring the loan this way usually makes sense when you’re very close to the $417,000 conforming loan limit. There are definitely better ways to structure this if possible, though. I say this because when you structure it with the first and second lien, the interest rate on that first lien is quite a bit higher than it would be otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the loan amounts cooperate, most of our clients actually structure this with a single loan, pay the private mortgage insurance, and then pay the loan down in either a lump sum payment as a result of the sale of another property, or with accelerated principal payments throughout the loan so that the mortgage insurance drops off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point, they can then contact us to recast the loan so it acts as a retroactive down payment. What happens, then, is you end up at the same place as if you structured the loan with the first and the second lien. The difference is by structuring it with a single loan with mortgage insurance and throwing in a recast there, you end up with a lower interest rate over the life of the loan, which ends up saving you quite a bit of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Structuring your loan this way will give you a lower interest rate.%20http://winningwithwade.com/what-are-benefits-of-using-piggyback.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Structuring your loan this way will give you a lower interest rate.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Do You Finance New Construction Homes?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qMFCChEBMAc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When buying a new construction home, the financing works a bit differently. But how?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are basically two ways to fund new construction—a one-time close or a two-time close. Each has its pros and cons, so I wanted to provide an overview of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A one-time close uses one loan from the beginning to fund the construction and purchase of the home. The advantage of this option is that there is only one set of closing costs and there won’t be potential issues with qualifying after closing if you have any personal circumstances change. These changes would include things like job loss, for example. The downside to a one-time close loan product is that the interest rate is quite a bit higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative is to structure it with two separate loans, or a two-time close. This means you purchase the property and construct the home with construction financing, and when the home is complete, a lender will come in and refinance you to permanent financing. The downside here is that you will have two sets of closing costs. However, the advantage is that the interest rate will be quite a bit lower (assuming that rates hold steady while the home is constructed). The two-time close is the more common of the two options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Each financing type has its own pros and cons.%20http://winningwithwade.com/how-do-you-finance-new-construction.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Each financing type has its own pros and cons.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Opting Out of Junk Mail Is Easy</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WmafYepAIGo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you close a real estate transaction, there are certain documents that have to be filed with the county courthouse. The unfortunate thing is that county courthouse records are public access, and marketing companies will routinely buy this information to tailor their solicitations to new loan recipients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, there are three things you can do to reduce the amount of junk mail you receive from credit bureaus and marketing companies who purchase your information from other sources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go to optoutprescreen.com. This is the shared web portal for the three major credit bureaus. By opting out of that website, you can remove your credit profile from being sold to third parties. All those offers and solicitations will cease, and you can opt out for any period of time, whether it be five years or permanently. If you do opt out permanently, there is a bit more paperwork you have to fill out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Opt out of direct marketing from dmachoice.org. This is the police for all the catalog mail and other mail that isn’t tied to your credit profile. It does have a nominal fee and lasts for only five years at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit catalogchoice.org. If you want to take things a step further, you can visit this site and input the different vendors that slipped through the cracks from your other opt outs and block their solicitations as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
