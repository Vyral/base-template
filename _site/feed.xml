        <title>Reflecting on the 2017 Real Estate Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nIyWFgbozQM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did the 2017 real estate market do and what can you expect from our market in 2018?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas and happy New Year! As 2017 draws to a close, we’re looking back to see how the real estate market did this year and what to expect next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our local area, the number of sales for vacant land, condos, and single-family homes increased by 17% over 2016. The average sales price is up 8%, and the total dollar amount of sales is up 26%. Inventory is down 3% compared to 2016. We simply need more properties to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the low inventory, pending contracts are up 18% over 2016, so &lt;strong&gt;this is the best market we have seen since 2005.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to 2018, many anticipate that housing costs will go up as a result of the hurricanes in Florida and Texas and the fires in California. These natural disasters impact the whole country, and they have affected the cost of housing a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband is a local builder and he says that he has seen price increases from different vendors he works with in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, interest rates are still low right now but they may go up a little bit in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the market looks good for 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to thank my coworkers for their work in 2017 and my friends and clients for their support. &lt;strong&gt;2017 was a good year, and 2018 certainly looks promising.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=2018 looks like another good year for real estate.%20localhost:4000/reflecting-on-2017-real-estate-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“2018 looks like another good year for real estate.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about real estate, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a happy holiday season!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Whats It Like Working With Us? Our Clients Tell the Story</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mj5Pdi0R8IA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to share a few client testimonials we recorded from a viewing party of our guest feature on HGTV’s “Beachfront Bargain Hunt.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently had the pleasure of working with HGTV to film an episode of “Beachfront Bargain Hunt” right here in Atlantic Beach. We had a great time filming the show, and we’d love for you to tune into episode 13 of season 15 to see us on TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are a few client testimonials from our recent viewing party of this experience:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Bill and Fossie Latham:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lugean closed three properties with us in the course of about 60 days—one we bought, and two we sold. The thing I appreciated the most was, you know, whether you’re buying or selling can be a bit frustrating and emotional. I mean, there’s a lot of money involved, and Lugean, through the whole process, was very calm. She didn’t let you get too optimistic; she didn’t let you get too pessimistic. She kept everything on an even keel and things worked out wonderfully. We really appreciate what she did for us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Mahilda Barbee:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I worked with Lugean to buy my house when I was transferred here to open the state police credit union four years ago. She was so gracious to sell me a house in her neighborhood that not only did she sell me a house, but now I’m her neighbor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Dale and Norma Coley:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lugean helped us find the absolute perfect condo in Atlantic Beach. She showed us at least 40 different condos and was very patient with us, and we ended up with the perfect condo. Lugean is the best.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Sharon Pietzrak:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My husband and I met Lugean in August of 2014. She helped us buy our home, which was a foreclosure and was the first one she had done. She was just tenacious and got it done. Even after we lost it in an auction, she put in a backup bid, which we didn’t know she did, but it was a good thing because the deal fell through and she saved the day with that backup bid, and we’re so happy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=It was great having the support of our friends, family, and many of my clients.%20localhost:4000/whats-it-like-working-with-us-our.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“It was great having the support of our friends, family, and many of my clients.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To see a few clips and photos from this viewing party, watch the video above.&lt;/strong&gt; It was great having the support of Bluewater Real Estate, our friends, family, and many of my clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home here in paradise, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Makes Today's Market So Great to List In?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wNlAQWt-TEY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m bringing you a quick look at our market’s latest numbers as well as some key listing tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve had a good hot summer this year in Crystal Coast, and the real estate market in our area is seeing that same heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the summer has come to a close, it’s time for a market update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, it’s interesting to note that the total number of sold properties is up from last year by 217 homes. &lt;strong&gt;The average list price and average sold price are both also up, each having risen by $9,000.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another factor we’re seeing is a shorter number of days on market. The average days on market has actually gone down since last year by about 47 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The summer has been hot, and the real estate market in our area is seeing that same heat.%20localhost:4000/what-makes-todays-market-so-great-to.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The summer has been hot, and the real estate market in our area is seeing that same heat.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking about putting your house on the market, it’s a great time to do so. Inventory is very low right now, so the market is in need of properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you plan to list this month or a year from now, there are a few key things you can do to prepare. For one thing, upgrading your countertops is always a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area that buyers look at closely is flooring. &lt;strong&gt;I would wait to change out carpet until you’re close to listing, but vinyl and hardwood can be put in any time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want more listing tips, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Top Tips for Hurricane Preparedness for Crystal Coast Homeowners</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8k6hr9IBc-Q?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to give you a quick refresher on some of the most important things you can do to prepare yourself for this hurricane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I wanted to lay out a plan and offer a few tips for you to consider as Hurricane Irma continues to bear down and has us all guessing where and when it might land. This is currently a category 4 storm and potentially one of the worst storms ever recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to offer some reminders to help you get ready for anything Mother Nature might throw at us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Stay tuned to the local weather station.&lt;/strong&gt; They’re going to keep you updated on the critical info from the National Weather Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Check your disaster supply now.&lt;/strong&gt; Your supply kit should be ready to go with a gallon of water per person, non-perishable food for three days, flashlights, batteries, and candles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Remove or tie down objects in the yard.&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure things like patio furniture are stowed away or secured so they can’t blow away or cause damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Take inventory of your property.&lt;/strong&gt; We haven’t had a ton of hurricane wind damage in a long time here on the Crystal Coast, but we’re very susceptible to flooding. Take pictures, do a walkthrough, and write down everything. That way, if you ever have a flood or wind insurance claim to make, you’ll have something to fall back on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. It’s a good idea to turn the fridge and freezer all the way down.&lt;/strong&gt; Setting the fridge and freezer to the coldest setting will help you keep it cool if the power goes out, and your food will stay fresh longer. Keep the doors closed as much as possible if you lose power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Don’t forget to turn off the gas.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have propane or other small appliances, make sure they’re turned off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Keep your gasoline tank in your vehicles full.&lt;/strong&gt; If there’s flooding and you need to get out of town, be prepared to exit with a full tank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Have an evacuation plan in place.%20localhost:4000/top-tips-for-hurricane-preparedness-for.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Have an evacuation plan in place.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Have an evacuation plan in place.&lt;/strong&gt; This way everyone in your family will know what to do and you won’t be scrambling at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any more questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us at the Star Team. We would be happy to help you. We wish you all good luck and safety through this big storm.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Which Home Improvements Can Maximize Your Homes Value?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VOC56yG8Krs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few repairs you can make to your home that will maximize your dollar return when it comes time to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What improvements can you make to your home to increase its value when the time comes to sell it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Countertops and bathroom fixtures are at the top of the list.&lt;/strong&gt; If yours are dated or old, replace them. They’ll really pop if they’re brand new, and you can still enjoy them for a year or two if you don’t plan on selling right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=These updates will add value now and later.%20localhost:4000/which-home-improvements-can-maximize.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“These updates will add value now and later.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect you should focus on is &lt;strong&gt;flooring.&lt;/strong&gt; Hold off on replacing any carpet until right before you list your house. You can install vinyl or wood flooring any time and it will increase your home’s value. It will not age quickly, so doing it ahead of time makes you ready once your house hits the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These improvements will both increase your dollar return and help market your home online. If you have any other questions about making home improvements or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home right now, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Cant You Trust Zillows Zestimates?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/p8FHzGHTwNc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent lawsuit filed against Zillow by a homeowner in Illinois demonstrates why you can’t quite trust their Zestimate tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re a buyer or seller in our market, you should be wary of Zillow’s Zestimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you didn’t know, Zillow is the largest online search engine for homebuyers. The Zestimate is their version of an estimated value for a property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A recent development in the real estate industry illustrates why you can’t quite trust Zestimates.&lt;/strong&gt; A woman in Illinois has filed a lawsuit against Zillow, claiming that her Zestimate undervalued her house and created a roadblock for its sale. Despite Zillow’s denial that they offer appraisals, the fact that they’re promoted as a tool for potential buyers to use in assessing the market value of a property shows that the definition of an appraisal under Illinois state law was met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit argues that Zillow should be licensed to perform appraisals and that they should also obtain the consent of a homeowner before they go online. The Zestimate in question is for a townhome that was bought for $626,000 in 2009 and recently listed on the market for roughly what it was bought. However, the home’s most recent Zestimate was only $562,000. The homeowner is suing Zillow to either remove the Zestimate or amend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Zestimates supposedly have a median error rate of 5%.%20localhost:4000/why-cant-you-trust-zillows-zestimates.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Zestimates supposedly have a median error rate of 5%.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zillow has a different take on the situation. They don’t see their Zestimates as an appraisal, but rather as a tool that utilizes a proprietary algorithm to assess value. According to some, they have a median error rate of over 5%. That can mean a lot of money on the table. Zillow is now offering a $1 million prize to anyone who can improve their algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until the Zestimate can be improved, &lt;strong&gt;my advice to you is to not allow Zillow to dictate your buying or selling choices.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re curious what your home is really worth, give me a call or send me an email and I’d be happy to perform a real analysis on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, if you have any other questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. Talk to you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Get the Biggest Return on Investment on Your Property</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wkMav0rxuaE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to maximize your ROI on your rental properties, you need to be sure that you’re charging market rate for rent to your tenants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re an investor with a rental property and have had the same tenants for a long time, I wanted to share a few things that you might want to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You always want to maximize your ROI on rental properties, and what we’re seeing currently is that there are a lot of investors who just aren’t charging market rate for rent. This is happening in commercial real estate, long-term residential rentals, and even vacation rentals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You always want to maximize your ROI on your rental properties.%20localhost:4000/how-to-get-biggest-return-on-investment.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“You always want to maximize your ROI on your rental properties.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A classic example is an investor who bought a property many years back and continued to charge the same rental rate to his tenants year after year. He runs into a serious problem when he goes to sell the property, and his tenants are unable to afford the current market rate that the new owner will charge them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is further deepened when he realizes that they can’t leave either due to various reasons, like working in the area or being unable to afford to move anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’ve dealt with investment properties in the past, then you know that getting rid of a tenant is expensive, time consuming, and often requires hiring an attorney.&lt;/strong&gt; Many times during this period, they aren’t even paying rent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about how you can maximize your ROI and avoid the pitfalls of a messy tenant removal situation, please give me a call. I’d be happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>These 3 Tips Will Help You Start the Downsizing Process</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2DuHtPBsbIc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downsizing is becoming increasingly popular in our market. If you’re thinking of downsizing, keep these three tips in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downsizing has become an increasingly popular trend in the world of real estate, and as baby boomers come of age more and more people will have it on their minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve thought about downsizing, these three tips will help you start the process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Start with a plan:&lt;/strong&gt; Write down what you want to keep, what you want to donate, and what needs to come with you. We can help you create those lists and then organize your possessions accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Start looking for your next house now:&lt;/strong&gt; You need to know where you’re going before you put your current house on the market so that you can get a good idea of your next move. A good Realtor will help you clarify what you want and what you need in your next home and show you homes that meet your criteria. This step can also give you a taste of what your new lifestyle could be in your next neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Downsizing can get emotional, but it will be a positive step toward your future.%20localhost:4000/these-3-tips-will-help-you-start.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Downsizing can get emotional, but it will be a positive step toward your future.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Start preparing your home for sale:&lt;/strong&gt; Downsizing can be an emotional process, but it will also be a very positive step in securing your future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for us about downsizing or you’re ready to start the process, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to serve you during this important time in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>6 Home Selling Mistakes to Avoid</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TonYj14OMy8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home selling is a complicated process. Here are six things you need to avoid doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selling your home can be a stressful process, but avoiding these six common mistakes will make that process a lot easier and smoother:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Picking the wrong agent.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s really easy to pick the wrong agent if you don’t do your research on them. The right agent is going to answer the phone when you call, get back to you in a timely manner, and be a market expert. They will be honest and straightforward with you rather than agreeing with everything you say and telling you what you want to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Overpricing your home.&lt;/strong&gt; Price is everything when marketing your home. Even a well-priced home with a bad marketing plan will sell. It will just take a little longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Failing to make simple repairs.&lt;/strong&gt; If the dog chewed something up or there are minor dents or scratches in the paint, buyers will notice that. It’s better to get these things fixed before listing the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Avoiding these mistakes will make sure your home sells for the most money possible.%20localhost:4000/6-home-selling-mistakes-to-avoid.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Avoiding these mistakes will make sure your home sells for the most money possible.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Neglecting the decluttering.&lt;/strong&gt; Buyers start their home searches online these days and if the pictures of your home show off your stuff instead of the home itself, there’s a good chance buyers won’t even come out to look at the home in person. Store your excess “stuff” in the garage or a storage pod so it doesn’t get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Not allowing adequate access to your home.&lt;/strong&gt; Your home should be show-ready at all times and you should be able to accommodate agents and their buyers when they want to see it. If a seller tells a buyer or their agent they can’t see a home at a certain time or they have to reschedule, most won’t come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Getting too emotional about your house.&lt;/strong&gt; Sellers can be very attached to their homes, which is understandable. However, when you are selling your home you have to look at it as an investment, not as your home. If you get a lowball offer or someone wants to remodel a part of the home, don’t take it personally as long as they pay the price you want them to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoiding these mistakes will make sure your home sells for the most amount of money possible in the least amount of time. If you have any questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Appraisals Can Affect Your Home Transaction</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kg2Au1N0dEo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is an appraisal and why is it important? I’ll answer those questions for you today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appraisals have become a hot topic in today’s market. &lt;strong&gt;An appraisal is what the bank uses to determine what they consider the true value of a home that’s being bought and sold.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s done by a certified home appraiser who is an independent third party in the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the appraiser will take the property you’re buying or selling and look at homes in the area with similar amenities, features, and square footage in order to compare them. They will use that information, based on recent past sales, to validate the price of the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appraisals have become more relevant recently because we have seen some appreciation in the market. However, we frequently see homes that fail to appraise at what we expect, which is not good. If an appraiser takes information from a home that sold six months ago, &lt;strong&gt;the home might not appraise at the price it’s listed for today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a buyer, an appraisal is meant to protect you so you don’t overpay for a home. However, it can also have a negative effect on buyers. If you fall in love with a house and agree to a certain price, &lt;strong&gt;your bank will only lend you money based on the appraisal.&lt;/strong&gt; If the home doesn’t appraise, you’d have to come up with the cash to make up the difference between the appraised value and the list price of the home or walk away if the seller won’t renegotiate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=As a seller, if your home doesn’t appraise, you may have to lower the price or risk losing your buyer.%20localhost:4000/how-appraisals-can-affect-your-home_19.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“As a seller, if your home doesn’t appraise, you may have to lower the price or risk losing your buyer.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a seller, the appraisal may affect you more than anything else in the selling process. If your home doesn’t appraise, you may have to lower your price or risk your buyer walking away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Star Team, we provide our friends and clients with a comprehensive market analysis, or CMA. It uses a similar approach to determining a home’s value that an appraiser does.&lt;/p&gt;
