        <title>What’s Our Process for Helping Buyers and Sellers?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6_nKxh6NPBQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we want to talk a little bit about our team, our process, and how everything works when we are helping a homebuyer or seller with their transaction. Dana is a new member to our team and has really brought a unique touch. Recently, we discussed this topic and now we want to share our conversation with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I started the Elite Home Team around two years ago because I believed that a team concept would bring much better service to my clients.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=It is really hard for a single agent to keep up with a process like this.%20http://denverrealestatetips.com/whats-our-process-for-helping-buyers-and-sellers.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“It is really hard for a single agent to keep up with a process like this.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We put a lot into our transactions, whether we are working with a buyer or a seller. Dana works exclusively with buyers, and I with sellers. When you hire one of us, you are getting an entire team helping you with the process instead of just one person. We have a team of 10, including other agents, administrative staff, and a sales department that makes 10,000 calls per week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is really hard for a single agent to keep up with a process like this. &lt;strong&gt;Everybody on our team specializes in doing what they do best, and things work better for everyone that way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for us or want to put our team to work to help you buy or sell your next home, please give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Do the Latest Year-Over-Year Stats Mean for Our Market?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4MAP6Bl_DOk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s going on in our market right now? Let’s look at Denver’s MLS numbers from last January and compare them to this January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From January 2017 to January 2018, the number of home sales dropped 9% from 3,237 to 2,935. &lt;strong&gt;Because of the lack of supply, property values have continued to go up.&lt;/strong&gt; From January 2017 to January 2018, the average sold price for single-family homes rose 11% from $401,961 to $447,487.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re seeing houses take a little bit longer to sell this year. In January 2017, the average days on market was 45 days. In January 2018, the average was 53 days. As far as new listings go, we saw that number rise from 3,809 in January 2017 to 4,200 in January 2018—a 10% increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Buyers should have an easier time finding properties as 2018 rolls on.%20http://denverrealestatetips.com/what-do-the-latest-year-over-year-stats-mean-for-our-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Buyers should have an easier time finding properties as 2018 rolls on.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that more homes are hitting the market is very important. That means inventory is going up, which is very healthy for our market. If this continues, buyers will be able to find properties more easily and get them under contract more easily. I expect this trend to continue over the next few months, which means if you’re selling, more competition is on the way. The average days on market might get a little bit longer in the spring, so &lt;strong&gt;listing now in March is likely a better option than listing later on in the season.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with more properties coming on the market, we also saw the number of homes going under contract rise 9% from 3,725 in January 2017 to 4,060 in January 2018. We should see the number of closed deals even out in the next couple months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that these are general statistics from our market as a whole, and every neighborhood is specific and different, so if you’re interested in what your neighborhood’s statistics look like, let me know and I’d be glad to share those with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Which Is Better: a Real Estate Team or an Individual Agent?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/d8bJyRvcK98?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you better off working with a team of real estate professionals or a single agent? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a great question. While there are plenty of great individual agents out there who do a wonderful job for their clients, &lt;strong&gt;I believe that you’re better off working with a team.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us start out as individual agents. When we’re new in the business, we typically handle every part of the transaction, and that’s how we learn. As our experience grows and we get better and more professional, though, we often find that a team is much more effective at working each part of the transaction. Doing it all as an individual agent is very difficult without a lot of help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The benefits of a team come from the fact that we have people specializing in certain parts of a transaction. &lt;/strong&gt;That’s where the team concept really takes shape in the real estate business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently read an article by one of the leading trainers in the real estate industry who was quoted as saying, “The future of real estate is in total team domination.” Further on in the article, this trainer explained why. In his opinion, a team always services a client better than a single agent. It’s just that simple. He also goes on to say that the minutiae involved in a real estate transaction or the business, in general, is so immense that no single person can do it all. The paperwork, marketing, transaction management, and customer service (which is most important) all combine with needing to be a contract expert, a negotiation expert, and having to keep up with all the laws and regulations and technologies and techniques. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I built my team because it was important to me to do a better job for you.%20http://denverrealestatetips.com/which-is-better-a-real-estate-team-or-an-individual-agent.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“I built my team because it was important to me to do a better job for you.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much going on that trying it all on your own is nearly impossible. Doing it well without a team is just not realistic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I know some fabulous agents out there who aren’t working on a team and have been servicing their clients very well. In my opinion, though, a team can provide a better experience for their clients. On our team, we have a contract expert, a listing specialist, a negotiation expert, and a buyer specialist. We also have an entire team of salespeople who are on the phones every day looking for buyers and sellers for their clients. Furthermore, my office manager is licensed and experienced and always available to answer questions when our clients have questions and their agent isn’t available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We never miss an offer or opportunity for our clients because we’re always on point with everything. &lt;/strong&gt;Because we have a team handling our transactions, our buyer’s agents are in the market every day handling the buy side of things while our listing agents are handling listings. Additionally, our office staff are all experts on the legal aspects of each transaction and keep up with the laws and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see how all of these people come together and provide a better overall service. When we take on a listing or agree to represent a buyer, we have eight people working on the deal. All of them are experts, and they’re all focused on our clients. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there are benefits to working with an individual agent, but I built my team because it was important to me to do a better job for you. I believe the team concept does a better job. That’s our goal, and that’s what we strive for every day in everything we do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about the advantages a real estate team provides over an individual agent or you’re thinking of buying or selling a house in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Things You Should Know About the Buying Process</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nd5VFw5jxHQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I brought in Kim Davis, our lead buyer specialist, to answer some questions about loans and the buying process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions we hear quite often are about how to start the buying process. “How much money down is needed? What do I do if my credit is bad—how does one repair it?” And so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first question to address is about the difference between a pre-qualification and a pre-approval.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between the two is that when you’re just getting pre-qualified, it’s often the first step in searching for a home. Initially, you don’t even need to have your credit ran; the lender will just give you an idea of where you’re at after just a few minutes on the phone. You’ll supply them with some financial information such as your income, assets, and debts, and then the lender will provide you the preliminary estimate of the amount you qualify for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pre-approval is the next step, in which an underwriter will evaluate your situation and credit. They will make the final decision based on the preliminary information you provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You’d be surprised at the loan programs that are available which don’t require a down payment.%20http://denverrealestatetips.com/things-you-should-know-about-the-buying-process.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“You’d be surprised at the loan programs that are available which don’t require a down payment.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People also frequently ask about when is the best time to begin the process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking about making a move, you should start the process right away. It’s best to evaluate your situation months before the move, if possible. Of course, that really depends on your situation, so the best bet is to reach out to us and let us help you make a set of plans for yourself. There are so many working parts that it’s best if you let us help you meet those goals. There’s no reason to try to navigate this by yourself. We can put you in contact with a lender that we know and trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should someone do if they don’t have any money for a down payment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’d be surprised at the loan programs that are available which don’t require a down payment. If you or the property you’re purchasing meets certain credit, employment history, location, and other determining factors, a zero down payment loan may be an option for you. We can help you work your way through that process as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If your credit isn’t where it should be, what can be done?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a lot of programs to help you get your credit back on track. If you don’t know where your credit is, we can definitely help you find out. There are some programs wherein people with really low credit scores and a good income can get loans on houses. It’s really shocking for people. The thing is, you just need to reach out to us so that we can try to help you through that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What types of loan options are out there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few different loan options to choose from. There’s the VA loan, conventional loan, and FHA loan for starters. Which type is best for you depends on your situation. The best bet for someone who isn’t sure about their situation is to contact us so that we can help you evaluate and decide which program best fits your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember that we’re here to help. Kim is in the market dealing with these issues every day, so she’s an expert on loans and the processes through which you need to go to get them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please feel free to give us a call any time. No question is too minor; we’re here for you anytime you need us.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Holidays Can Be a Most Wonderful Time to Sell: Part 2</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5dpjfrpLeJ0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year around this time, I’m asked the same questions about listing during the holidays: Is now a good time list, or would it be better to wait until January? Should I pull my house off the market during the holidays?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://denverrealestatetips.com/the-holidays-can-be-a-most-wonderful-time-to-sell-part-1.html&quot;&gt;Last time,&lt;/a&gt; we discussed six reasons why selling now makes more sense than waiting til spring to list. Today, we return to this question with six additional reasons why you should get a move on and sell during the holidays, just in case the first six didn’t quite sell you on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Some people have to buy before the end of the year&lt;/strong&gt; to enjoy the tax benefits associated with purchasing a home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. New job transfers often begin in January&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning that employees moving for work will need to buy a home in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Don’t believe the myth that suggests spring and summer are the only viable times to list.%20http://denverrealestatetips.com/the-holidays-can-be-a-most-wonderful-time-to-sell-part-2.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Don’t believe the myth that suggests spring and summer are the only viable times to list.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. You have the option to restrict showings during the holidays.&lt;/strong&gt; Buyers seem to be more understanding during this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. You can sell now for more money, and we can provide for a delayed closing,&lt;/strong&gt; or extended occupancy, until early next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. By selling now, you may have the opportunity to be a non-contingent buyer&lt;/strong&gt;during the spring, when many more houses are hitting the market at lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. 28.4% more homes close in December&lt;/strong&gt; than they do in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it—collectively, all 12 of these reasons ought to give you plenty of confidence that the holidays can be a successful time to sell your home. Don’t believe the myth that suggests spring and summer are the only viable times to list. If you take advantage of the factors I’ve mentioned, there’s nothing stopping you from having a truly happy holiday for more reasons than just the spirit of the season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions or need anything, give me a call or send an email. I’d be glad to help you out in any way that I can.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Holidays Can Be a Most Wonderful Time to Sell: Part 1</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dll6nG1WUUg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year around this time, I’m asked the same questions about listing during the holidays: Is now a good time list, or would it be better to wait until January? Should I pull my house off the market during the holidays?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, most people think that it’s a really bad time of year to sell. Actually, that could not be further from the truth. It’s a great time to sell. Every year, December is my best month for selling homes, there’s no doubt about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be a hectic time for people, with all of the holiday hustle and bustle and other stuff going on. So why would you want to list your house and keep it on the market during that time? In fact, there are a number of reasons, and here are the first six of the top 12 that you should think about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Every year, December is my best month for selling homes, there’s no doubt about it.%20http://denverrealestatetips.com/the-holidays-can-be-a-most-wonderful-time-to-sell-part-1.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Every year, December is my best month for selling homes, there’s no doubt about it.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Buyers are more serious.&lt;/strong&gt; Looky-loos and other potential buyers who aren’t altogether serious about buying won’t be out during this time to look for homes. People who need to buy soon are going to be the ones out looking. This means fewer showings for you and less trouble getting ready for those showings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Less competition.&lt;/strong&gt; Those serious buyers that are out looking for homes have fewer options available to them. This means they’re more likely to give you a good offer on the home, which is a really big deal for you, the seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The supply of homes will increase after the holiday season,&lt;/strong&gt; which means less demand for your home, and in turn, that means less money for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Houses show better&lt;/strong&gt; when they’re decorated for the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Buyers are more emotional&lt;/strong&gt; during the holidays. They’re more likely to base their decisions on how they feel about your house, which means they’re more likely to pay your price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Buyers have more time to look&lt;/strong&gt; during the holidays. People tend to have more time off during the holiday season, which affords them extra time to look through available homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes no sense to wait til next year to list, so do it now. &lt;strong&gt;Stay tuned for next time, when I will give you six additional reasons&lt;/strong&gt; to think about listing your home sooner than later. If you have any questions or need anything, give me a call or send an email. I’d be glad to help you out in any way that I can.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unsure About the Buying Process? We’re Here to Help</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/AQ8sT9gWgmM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m here today with one of our buyer’s agents, Walter, to help you better understand where to start the home buying process. Do you have questions about the buying process? Are you a first-time homebuyer, or are you unsure about how this whole thing works? That’s what we’re going to talk about today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a variety of resources for buyers—from first-time homebuyer loan packages to helpful books and guides. Reach out to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the first step we’d recommend in the home buying process is to get some guidance from us. It doesn’t cost you anything, and we’ll get you moving in the right direction. Every situation is different, and we can help you navigate through this difficult process based on your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We can help you navigate through this difficult process based on your needs.%20http://denverrealestatetips.com/unsure-about-the-buying-process-were-here-to-help.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We can help you navigate through this difficult process based on your needs.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where does Walter say you should start to get the process going?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Walter, &lt;strong&gt;you need to start off by talking to the right lender.&lt;/strong&gt; Find out what you qualify for. It doesn’t matter if you’re ready right now, or planning on starting next month or next year. Even if you think you can’t get qualified, or you don’t even have enough down payment, find out for sure. You might be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, once we have you headed in the right direction with the lender, we’ll sit down with you on the phone, or in person, and &lt;strong&gt;find out what exactly your time frame is and what your expectations are.&lt;/strong&gt;If you’re ready, we’ll set you up on a search and discuss options for you and the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, you should be very careful about getting on the internet for research. &lt;strong&gt;Websites like Zillow and Trulia just don’t have accurate information.&lt;/strong&gt; We can set you up on the MetroList directly, or you can search on our website or also on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.LetsGoHouseHunting.com&quot;&gt;www.LetsGoHouseHunting.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, once we’re ready, we start looking and begin the process. In this market, houses sometimes can go quickly, so we’re ready to show you houses right as they hit the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the big advantages of working with our team. We having showing assistants and plenty of buyer’s agents to make sure you’re out getting the houses before they’re gone. Unlike many agents, we won’t miss listings because we’re not available to show you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any more questions about the process or where to start, give us a call, send us a text, or email us. Both Walter’s and my door is always open, and our entire staff is available any time that you have questions or concerns. Remember, no questions are too basic. This is what we’re here for.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Do You Find out What Your Home Is Worth?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/IcfGULsDNcs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants to know what their home is worth, but how can you find this out? This is a great question. Actually, there are a few ways to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to do this is to hire an appraiser. My team and I know and trust a few appraisers who we would be happy to recommend to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two important things you must consider when it comes to choosing an appraiser, though. &lt;strong&gt;First, appraisers don’t consider the saleability of your home.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither Realtors nor appraisers price your home according to the market. Instead, appraisers are justifying the value for either legal purposes or for you to get an appropriate loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When appraisals are done for these reasons it doesn’t actually give you a real value, it just justifies a target value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently the most popular way to find value is by looking online. Websites like Trulia are Zillow are commonly used for this purpose. Any of the websites out there are basically the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I’ve helped people determine the value of their property thousands of times in my career.%20http://denverrealestatetips.com/how-do-you-find-out-what-your-home-is-worth.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“I’ve helped people determine the value of their property thousands of times in my career.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the popularity of this method, these websites simply don’t work that well. I wouldn’t put any credence in what they tell you about value. Their information is neither updated nor accurate. &lt;strong&gt;Zillow has even claimed that their online estimates are generally 8% off.&lt;/strong&gt; On top of that, they’ve recently been sued for violating consumer protection laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the least-accurate option out there is checking the tax assessment. Very little time is put into these, which means they are way off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, &lt;strong&gt;the best option you have is to consult with an expert like myself. &lt;/strong&gt;Real estate agents who study homes and their prices every day are going to be much more reliable than other methods of finding value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve personally helped people determine the value of their property thousands of times in my career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’ve got a great opportunity. We have a system designed to send people monthly updates on what’s coming onto the market. If you’d like for us to give you access to this, we would be more than happy to plug you into the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What You Should Know About Zillow</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3jxY6OiYHgI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever searched for homes online, you’ve probably been to Zillow. Over 73 million people visit the website each month. I think it’s important that consumers are a little more educated on what Zillow is and isn’t so they aren’t led astray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zillow has been in the news lately, but not for a good reason. They’re currently being sued for violating consumer protection laws because of their automated home valuation tool, the Zestimate. The plaintiff in the case says that the Zestimate was so inaccurate that it ended up causing damages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Zillow’s defense, they have been publicly clear that their Zestimate is not 100% accurate.&lt;/strong&gt; I hear from clients all the time that, “Well, Zillow says this” or “Zillow says that.” Here’s what Zillow actually does say. Their CEO, Spencer Rascoff, has publicly stated in the past that their Zestimates have a median error rate of about 8%. Last year, it was 14%. That’s almost $50,000 on a $350,000 home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We’d be happy to provide an accurate estimate ourselves.%20http://denverrealestatetips.com/what-you-should-know-about-zillow.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We’d be happy to provide an accurate estimate ourselves.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rascoff’s own home was a victim of Zestimate misinformation. His home ended up selling for 40% less than the Zestimate said it was worth. That’s like losing $700,000. If Zillow is saying themselves that their Zestimates may be hundreds of thousands of dollars off, you can imagine how accurate the valuation for your home really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It all comes down to where Zillow is lacking.&lt;/strong&gt; Their algorithm can’t take into account all of the things that play a role in a home’s value. At the same time, the market is moving so fast that a lot of their information is inaccurate, which can lead to many other problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for us about how we keep pace with the market or if you have any interest in buying or selling a home, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Should You List Your Home or Buy a New One First?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/f1lnl4wA4es?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question that’s come up quite a few times in the last few weeks deals with buying and selling at the same time. Which comes first? Do you list your current home or buy your new home first?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases, you really have to list first, and here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you consider the current market, many sellers are getting multiple offers on their homes. &lt;strong&gt;Most homeowners won’t even consider an offer where a buyer has to list and sell their home first.&lt;/strong&gt; This is especially true if the buyer hasn’t even put their home on the market yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the house is already listed or under contract, it really changes the offer in the seller’s eyes. If you find a home and then wait to put an offer on it so that you can list your own home, that property will be gone. The seller will have accepted an offer from a buyer who’s ready to move in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s really no other way around it: you have to list your home first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We understand that this is a really stressful situation for you. We do this type of transaction every day, and we help people through this scenario all the time. We’ve found over the years that there are three key things that we can do to put you into the best position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=There’s really no other way around it: You have to list your home first.%20http://denverrealestatetips.com/should-you-list-your-home-or-buy-a-new-one-first.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“There’s really no other way around it: You have to list your home first.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we do is &lt;strong&gt;pre-market your home for several days before showings.&lt;/strong&gt; While you’re looking for the home you want to buy, we’ll get the marketing set up. We’ll get the listing written, get all the paperwork together, and let other agents know that your home is coming for sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing we do is &lt;strong&gt;let buyers know that you’re selling and looking to buy.&lt;/strong&gt; We can get you as much time as you need to search for your home if we’re up front about your situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if an offer comes in then &lt;strong&gt;we can negotiate how much time you will need&lt;/strong&gt; in order to make a smooth transition into your new home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to discuss this topic more in detail or you’re looking to buy or sell a home in our area, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to helping you.&lt;/p&gt;
