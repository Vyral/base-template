        <title>What to Expect When You're Inspecting</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mjm8LccKPLk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I am joined by Fred Larsen from Pillar to Post Home Inspection to answer some common questions about home inspections. So what should you expect when you’re inspecting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The most common issues found during home inspections are water related.&lt;/strong&gt; Water can get into the house by grading and draining from the exterior, rain gutters leaking, leaking around flashing, and through improperly installed roofing and siding materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to sell a home, a good first step is to get your gas appliances checked and serviced to make sure that they are safe for use. Of course, it’s also a good idea to address any of the water issues previously mentioned. Take care of anything you know needs to be taken care of before the inspector gets to your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting your home pre-inspected also boasts a ton of benefits.&lt;/strong&gt; Doing so will save you lots of time and money. Also, when your home in under contract, it will save you the headache of trying to scramble to get everything fixed or repaired during the due diligence period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you’re a buyer, get the inspection done as early as possible.%20http://sternteam.org/what-to-expect-when-youre-inspecting.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you’re a buyer, get the inspection done as early as possible.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a buyer ordering a home inspection, make sure to get it done early in the due diligence period. There may be some things that the inspector finds that you’ll want to be checked out further. Also, make sure you find a good home inspector by asking your agent for referrals and interviewing potential hires. It’s always a good idea to ask for a sample report, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to understand that &lt;strong&gt;a home inspection is a visual inspection.&lt;/strong&gt; Home inspectors don’t tear things apart or dig through walls, and there are things they can’t see. Fred and his team try to be as thorough as possible, though; they cover up to 1,600 items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that Utah does not require a license to do home inspections, so make sure you get an experienced and qualified home inspector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any further questions for Fred or you’d like to schedule an inspection, you can reach him at 801-281-0484 or go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://saltlake.pillartopost.com/home&quot;&gt;saltlake.pillartopost.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2016 Wasatch Front Market Report</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Fem0C5oZuk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a look at what is happening in the Wasatch Front real estate market.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the year comes to a close, it’s time to take a look at the 2016 report card for the Wasatch Front home sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wasatch Front sales volume for single-family homes is nearly the same this year as it was in 2015. That’s 29,000 single family homes that have sold, which is very strong. In fact, our strongest sales year was in 2006 when 29,300 homes were sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our average sale price along the Wasatch Front in 2015 was $285,250 and in 2016 it is just over $305,000, which is a 7% increase. If we adjust for inflation, &lt;strong&gt;we are actually above pre-recession pricing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Condos and townhomes have been off the charts. There has been an 18% increase in sales between 2015 and 2016. 2015 was already a record year, so this year has been phenomenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First-time home buyers should buy before a rate increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=First-time home buyers should buy before a rate increase.%20http://sternteam.org/2016-wasatch-front-market-report.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“First-time home buyers should buy before a rate increase.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look at the average price of these properties, the condos and townhomes in the Wasatch Front area were $193,000, a 5% increase year over year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what might 2017 look like? &lt;strong&gt;Utah’s economy remains one of the strongest in the country,&lt;/strong&gt; and the number of families that are moving into the state remains one of the highest in the nation. The average age of our residents is 29, which is also the average age of a first-time home buyer. Therefore, we anticipate that we are going to continue to see strong sales, but not record breaking sales. However, something is going to happen with interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predictions for 2017 are widely varied. They are dependent on world events, the incoming presidency, and signs of a recovering economy. All of those factors will influence the direction of mortgage rates in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that rates have been on the rise for the last 30 days, and the &lt;strong&gt;FED has been fairly clear about their intention to raise rates even more.&lt;/strong&gt; So what does this mean for home buyers? A 1% increase in mortgage rates equates to a 10% increase in the cost of a home over a 30-year loan. Even more unfortunate, it’s predicted that if we have a 1% increase in rates, 18% of first-time home buyers will no longer be able to afford a home. If you are looking to purchase a home, now is the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any further questions about what’s going on in the the market, or if you are looking to buy or sell a home, please give me a call or send me an email. I’m here to help!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Our Client Appreciation Event Was a Huge Success</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/glvn04WH1ac&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our recent client appreciation event was a huge success. It was a great opportunity for a mid-week date night with your spouse, or just an escape from the day to day. &lt;strong&gt;We were thrilled that so many of you were able to come out and enjoy the movie with us, and we thank you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another big thank you to everyone who brought your gently used dolls, toys, and stuffed animals for the Sandy City Fire Department. They take these toys and use them to comfort children who have been in traumatic situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we raised a bunch of money for them through our split the raffle to purchase things like crayons and books for children experiencing trauma during emergency situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We were thrilled that so many of you were able to come out.%20http://sternteam.org/our-client-appreciation-event-was-a-huge-success.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We were thrilled that so many of you were able to come out.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, congratulations to Grant, who won the other half of the raffle. &lt;/strong&gt;Looks like he will be able to retire at least one day earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye out for the upcoming invite to our next client appreciation event. This one will be for the whole family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for now, have a grateful and thank-filled holiday season. We are thankful for all of you and your continued support of our team and our mission to help you realize the American dream of homeownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Top 6 Reasons to Sell Your Home During the Holidays</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/R9MAd2f4Dec&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should you sell your home during the holidays? I believe the answer is yes, and here are the top six reasons why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will face less competition.&lt;/strong&gt; There are fewer sellers on the market this time of year, which means your home will have fewer homes to compete with. One of the common myths in real estate is that you should wait until school is out to put your home on the market. The thing is, that is exactly what most people will do. You can get an edge over the competition by listing when there is only a handful of other properties on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buyers are serious.&lt;/strong&gt; In the spring and summer, some buyers are just getting their feet wet and trying to decide whether or not they want to buy a house. In the wintertime, buyers are strapping on their snow boots and coming to your house because they are ready to buy today. It won’t take as many showings to find the right buyer in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homes show really well this time of year.&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing says home like the holidays. All consumer decisions are based on emotions first and are then justified by logic, so people become very emotionally attached to holiday themes. They envision having their family in your house over the holidays and cozying up to the fire with their family. Another way to appeal to buyers’ emotions is to bake some apple pie, cookies, or bread. These scents bring back memories and create a positive attraction to your home.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Buyers are ready to purchase your home right away!%20http://sternteam.org/the-top-6-reasons-to-sell-your-home-during-the-holidays.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Buyers are ready to purchase your home right away!”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buyers have more time off at this time of year.&lt;/strong&gt; Everyone takes time off during the holidays, which gives buyers more time to look at your home. They will be able to make it to more daytime showings, which works great for sellers and makes things easier for buyers who have to work those tough 9-to-5 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be more competition after the holidays. &lt;/strong&gt;If you are planning on selling your home, do it during the holidays. Most sellers will wait until right after the holidays to put their home on the market. In the second week of January, there will be a surge of homes on the market. My recommendation to you is to list now and beat the surge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can sell now but move after the holidays.&lt;/strong&gt; You can put your property on the market in November, get a contract in December, and then you have 35 to 45 days before the buyer moves in. That means you can spend the holidays in your home and be secure in the knowledge that you have a contract on your home.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many benefits to putting your home on the market during the holiday season. If you have any questions about getting your home ready for the market or about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 Costly Mistakes to Avoid This Winter</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pF7ZO18L4dw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s that time of year, folks — winter is coming. It’s going to get cold. Now is the time to harvest what is left of your garden, winterize your sprinklers, and cozy up at home with your friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there are three huge mistakes that can cost homeowners thousands of dollars. Luckily, you can easily avoid these mistakes by properly winterizing your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, make sure that you buy a $2 protector for your outdoor faucet. It’s amazing how much damage a little bit of ice can do. Ice can cause pipes to explode or leak into your basement. Just an inch of water in your basement can cost up to $15,000 to pump out and dry. All you have to do to prevent this disaster is buy one of those protectors and take your hoses off of your faucets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I know everyone loves Instagramming icicles, but don’t just take your pictures and leave the icicles on your roof. If there are icicles hanging off your roof, then you probably have ice damming issues. Basically, when the ice melts, the water has nowhere else to go. Ice damming can cause serious damage to your roof, which costs thousands of dollars to repair. Not only that, icicles are also safety hazards; it can be very dangerous to walk beneath some of those huge icicles we get here in Salt Lake County.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=A little ice can cause a lot of big, costly problems for your home.%20http://sternteam.org/3-costly-mistakes-to-avoid-this-winter.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“A little ice can cause a lot of big, costly problems for your home.”&lt;/a&gt;If you notice that you have ice damming, you can pay a few hundred dollars to have someone come out and steam the ice away. You can even rent one of those steamers yourself. I also recommend installing a little extra insulation around the eaves of your house, which is typically where ice damming occurs. Heat tape can also help you avoid ice damming and water damage, which will save you thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, don’t let cold air sneak into your home. If you add up all of the cracks in the average home, it’s like having a 3x3 foot window open at all times. Not only will that make for a cold winter, it will also cost you a lot of extra money in energy bills. Fortunately, you can head to a Lowe’s or Home Depot and buy some caulk. Caulk comes in all kinds of different colors, so find the one that matches your home and fill up those exterior cracks. That way, you won’t have all of that cold air coming in through your windows, stucco, or doorframes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Tale of 2 Markets</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bq7Jc-KBjss&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I did a market update for our local radio station KNRS. As I was preparing the data for the show, I realized that we had a tale of two markets on our hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, if we look at the availability of all the housing types across the entire Wasatch Front under $300,000, we have about a three-month supply of homes available. In a real estate market, it’s considered a level market when you have between a four-to-six-month supply of homes available. When there are fewer than four months, it’s considered a seller’s market. When there are more than six months, it’s considered a buyer’s market.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I want you to be able to win no matter what market you're completing in.%20http://sternteam.org/the-tale-of-2-markets-48.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“I want you to be able to win no matter what market you’re completing in.”&lt;/a&gt;
In any price point less than $300,000, then, it’s absolutely a seller’s market. Here are three quick strategies you can use to help you compete if you’re a buyer in that market:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be the first to know. Your agent should be able to match your specific home buying criteria so you can be the first to know about homes as they become available. This will allow you to weed out the competition and avoid multiple offer scenarios that may cause the price of the home to increase.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a full approval letter.  This will take you through parts of the underwriting process, and that’s exactly what the seller wants to see. This will turn you into a cash buyer in the eyes of the seller and help you stand out from the competition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try using an escalation clause on the offer you write. For example, you could state that you’re willing to offer X amount of dollars higher than the highest net offer the seller receives, provided the cost doesn’t exceed a certain price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, we’re experiencing a tale of two markets. The other market I’m referring to is all the housing types above $500,000, in which there is a 10-month supply of homes. This, obviously, is a buyer’s market. Here are three tips you can use if you’re a seller to ensure your home priced more than $500,000 sells fast and for the most amount of money:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Boost your curb appeal. It’s a fact of life—everyone judges a book by its cover. Make sure the front door’s got a fresh coat of paint on it and the landscaping looks good. Take photos now if you’re planning on listing over the winter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stage the home. Clear off all the flat surfaces in the property of everything other than decorative items. Clean lines show the property, and it’s the property you’re selling, not the stuff. Flat surfaces run vertically as well as horizontally, so make sure both surfaces are cleared of all clutter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Price the home right. Be sure to use accurate comparables within your micro-market and view those comparables through the eyes of the buyer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what tale our market is telling, I want you to win. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently sold a property for more than list price in less than two weeks. Prior to working with us, these clients had their home on the market for over six months before the listing expired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During that time, the property had six showings and no offers, so the sellers were understandably frustrated. When they were referred to us, I told them exactly what they needed to do to get the property sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need to understand is curb appeal. If you look at the video above, you will see before and after pictures of the property. I had the clients paint the exterior of this beautiful log home because the photos from the original listing showed that the home had deferred maintenance. Everybody on the Internet judges a book by its cover, so your home needs to look good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine going to an expensive restaurant and paying $50 for a plate of food. That plate of food will come out looking good, and because it looks good, it’s going to taste better. The same principle applies to buying a home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the video above, you will see a couple of interior photos as well. Before, the property had not been staged. I found that the clients were more than happy to stage the home but their prior agent didn’t give them any direction on what to do or how to do it. We went room by room and staged the property correctly. For instance, we referred them to our countertop guy so they could finish updating the kitchen. It cost $1,500 to replace the countertops and they look great.

When you look at a listing online, after the exterior photos, the buyer should see a picture of the kitchen, the master bedroom, and the master bathroom in exactly that order. Those three rooms are the most important to buyers and most buyers will only look at your listing for a little bit, so you need to post photos of those rooms up front in order to grab their attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are incredibly grateful to these clients. They did everything that we asked them to do. We launched the property using our grand opening technique and, as a result, we sold this property in fewer than two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about the home selling process or if you’re having trouble selling your property, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Do You Want to Buy a Fixer-Upper? </title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2_Wz0A18JT0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I have a few tips for buying a home that needs work. There are different types of fixer-uppers out there and some need more work than others. The way you pursue a purchase offer on the home most likely depends on which fixer-upper category it is in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most sellers realize that a home needs work when they put it up on the market and have already accounted for that when they priced the home. I have yet to find a seller who is willing to subsidize a buyer’s home improvement dreams, yet that doesn’t stop buyers from trying to get a discount on an already discounted price. It is very important to look at comparable properties in order to determine whether a fixer-upper has been priced correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s talk about the different types of fixer-upper homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you have your basic fixer-upper. Fixer-upper homes are generally priced for sale as-is. These homes often have deferred maintenance items or other minor repairs that the sellers either aren’t willing to fix or cannot afford to fix. When you make an offer on these properties, have your buyer’s agent pull comparables for other fixer-upper properties to see how the price stacks up. That way, you are comparing apples to apples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, you may be interested in a mint condition vintage house. Although these properties are not modernized, they can be very desirable. Mid-century modern houses have made a real comeback recently; other vintage houses include Victorians or Craftsman bungalows. Generally, the seller will add a premium price pad due to the area and architectural uniqueness of the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, the interior of a vintage property will be in incredible condition. However, they can look very outdated. When you write an offer on this kind of property, be aware that there may be a premium price to pay for the uniqueness of the property. Make sure that you look at other similar homes and compare the listing price to those that have already sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another kind of fixer-upper is the newer home that may be outdated. Lots of subdivisions have homes that were built in 1995; these sellers know there are newer homes out there, but still price their homes as if they are brand new. That is unfortunate because a lot of the trends from the 90s — like hunter green carpeting — are not popular today. Some of these sellers may be priced above where they should be, so again, make sure to look at comparable properties. When you send your offer in, send along the list of work it would take to modernize the home and include how much it would cost to do all of that work. That way, the seller can see things from your perspective.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Always look at comparable properties to see if the property is fairly priced.%20http://sternteam.org/do-you-want-to-buy-fixer-upper-46.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Always look at comparable properties to see if the property is fairly priced.”&lt;/a&gt;
A lot of buyers think they will get a good deal when it comes to buying a foreclosure property, but that’s not always the case. Banks will usually not lower the purchase price on a foreclosure property within the first 30 days. Foreclosures normally come with other rules beyond that. For example, after 30 days, the bank may lower the price by 3%. If 60 days go by without an offer, they may lower the price again by another 3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also make sure to do a title check on foreclosed properties because the banks have not occupied these properties. The bank should have cleared any hidden liens on the property, but it is still a good idea for you to work with a good title company and pull a complete title report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in a short sale, you need to know that there is nothing short about them. Short sale transactions can take a lot of time to close. Since the seller cannot afford to make the payments on the home, they also cannot afford to do any work on the property, so short sale homes are often sold as-is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also be aware that the price an agent sets for a short sale property is not always accepted by the bank. The bank will do an independent appraisal on a short sale property to ensure that it will be sold at market value. Don’t be lured in by the price on the MLS system unless it says that the price has been previously approved by a third party. More often than not, that’s the price the bank is willing to accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you may want to buy a “packrat” house. If you have ever watched Hoarders, you know that these houses have stuff stacked up to the ceiling and aisles to get from room to room. The challenge with these properties is not that there is a lot of stuff in the house (which makes it hard to visualize what you’re going to do with the property, though), but that there is a monstrous amount of deferred maintenance that needs to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, it helps to look at other distressed properties to see if the packrat house is priced correctly. It is especially important in this case because you won’t know how much work the property really needs until you get a home inspector in there. Keep in mind that if all of that stuff in the home is still in the way, the home inspector won’t be able to do their job thoroughly. Consider extending your due diligence period and require the seller to allow access to all visible parts of the interior of the property before the home inspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number one thing to keep in mind when purchasing a house that needs some work is to look at comparable sales. You can then deduct the price of the work that’s needed based on estimates from licensed contractors. If that adjusted price lines up with the listing price, you might need to pay the listing price to purchase that fixer-upper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about fixer-upper properties or need to get in touch with a licensed contractor to fix up your property, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using Football to Explain Your Home’s Closing</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/m7hJNxrCOlg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does football relate to the closing of your property? The analogy we’ve come up with makes a lot of sense, and we hope it will help shine some new light on the process for you if you’ve been thinking about selling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this analogy, let’s say we are starting with the ball right on our own one-yard line. There are 99 yards between you and the goal line. Once an offer is accepted, you’ve made it to midfield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An offer will be contingent on a few things, including due diligence. Due diligence is basically any type of inspection a buyer wants to do. We know that 24% of contracts fail and 80% of those are due to due diligence. The buyer could decide they don’t want to buy at this point for pretty much any reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that once we’ve made it past due diligence, we are in the red zone. Good offense so far, but you’re not quite there yet. Now the offer is contingent upon the financing going through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your buyer should already be pre-approved by a lender; however, that still doesn’t mean they will get the loan. The “defense” in this situation is underwriting. It’s a secret weapon that is going to look for every reason not to lend the buyer money, so certain things can come up.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=%20http://sternteam.org/using-football-to-explain-your-homes-45.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good agent will be in contact with the lender who issued the pre-approval to ask certain questions to see if they will be able to pay. You want to find out as much as you can up front about their financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the financing hurdle has been cleared, you are on the 10-yard line. The offer is now contingent upon the appraisal. In the last couple of years we’ve had more and more issues with appraisals because the market is improving. Homes still have to appraise for buyers to be able to purchase. If you get a bad appraisal, you do have options to remedy it without throwing the deal away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you’re through the appraisal, you are at the five-yard line. The final hurdle is the settlement table. This is where we sign all the documents with the title company to be able to transfer the deed into the buyer’s name. It usually happens a week or two after the appraisal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bad things can happen, like a medical emergency or the buyer losing their job, but it’s not likely. Now you are at the one-yard line, and the property must fund in order for the seller to receive the money and the buyer to get the deed. Once that has happened, you are in the end zone! Time for a touchdown dance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;
