        <title>Top 5 Tips for Scoring a Great Deal on Your Dream Property</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BY9jiLBsRfw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are five creative tips that will help you get a great deal on the perfect property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Be very specific about what you want.&lt;/strong&gt; The more you share with us, the easier it will be to find that dream property. Don’t be afraid to let us know what you would be uncomfortable with spending, either. Everything you tell us will help us find the right pool of options that perfectly align with your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Be financially well documented.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re taking out a loan, make sure you are pre-approved and have that pre-approval letter before you start looking at homes. If you’re a cash buyer, you’ll still want to have some form of financial verification to present to the seller. Having that paperwork presents you as a serious buyer. We’ll align you with the best lender for your needs that is already familiar with properties in our area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The more you share with us, the easier it will be to find that dream property.%20http://ownemeraldcoast.com/top-5-tips-for-scoring-a-great-deal-on-your-dream-property.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The more you share with us, the easier it will be to find that dream property.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Act quickly.&lt;/strong&gt; We’ll be sending you properties as soon as they hit the market, so when you see one that checks off all the boxes, be ready to see it and possibly make an offer. Chances are, you’ll be one of six or seven people also looking at that same home, so be prepared to pounce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Come in with a market-appropriate offer.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t try to undercut the sellers. A low offer could cause the seller to reach out to other interested parties, creating a bidding war and ultimately driving up the price. If you present a great offer right off the bat, the seller will only be focused on yours so you can avoid that competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Minimize contingencies.&lt;/strong&gt; If you write in a bunch of ways in which you can get out of or cancel a contract, a seller isn’t going to take you very seriously. You want to include some contingencies to make sure you’re protected, but limit the amount to show you are serious about closing on that property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or need any help buying or selling your home, please don’t hesitate to give us a call. We’re here to help!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>If You Try Sushimoto, I Guarantee You'll Be Back</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YffYLr5u2Cs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I’m honored to feature Sushimoto, one of our favorite local restaurants here on the Emerald Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I absolutely love coming here for sushi that’s extremely fresh and hot dishes that are great. In fact, &lt;strong&gt;Emeril Lagasse himself recently featured Sushimoto as one of his favorite restaurants!&lt;/strong&gt; Owners Andy and Sophia are great people and good friends that provide the best customer service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you mention the Nathan Abbott Team, you'll get a hot sake on the house.%20http://ownemeraldcoast.com/if-you-try-sushimoto-i-guarantee-youll-be-back.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you mention the Nathan Abbott Team, you’ll get a hot sake on the house.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy wanted a way to feature local seafood and our beautiful beaches drew him here. He loves having a local spot and seeing so many new faces come try his food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you mention the Nathan Abbott Team, they’ll even give you a hot sake on the house.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to check out Sushimoto because if you come once, I’m sure you’ll be back. You won’t be disappointed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, give me a call or send me an email with any questions about our local real estate market. I’d be happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Few of My Favorite Spots Around Destin</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wdVViuPCwEc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m here today to talk to you about some of my favorite places in the area that you may not know about. We’re visiting two of them today, and I’m excited to talk about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First up is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lulubuffett.com/destin/&quot;&gt;Lulu’s&lt;/a&gt;, a restaurant in Destin right by the Mid-Bay Bridge.&lt;/strong&gt; They have a big outdoor beach, lots of great seating, and all kinds of activities and events for kids. It has beautiful views of the ocean with both outdoor and indoor seating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we’re headed to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pedegoelectricbikes.com/dealers/santa-rosa-beach/&quot;&gt;Pedego Bikes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, one of my favorite spots. They rent and sell electric bikes here, and I actually bought one for Christmas. It’s been a ton of fun for me and my family. It lets us explore 30A without having to pedal up any steep hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Lulu’s has such a gorgeous ocean view.%20http://ownemeraldcoast.com/a-few-of-my-favorite-spots-around-destin.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Lulu’s has such a gorgeous ocean view.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were delighted to be joined by Pedego Bikes owner Jason Medina. He recently retired from the Coast Guard after 22 years and created this store in part to get through some of the congestion and parking issues he faced. &lt;strong&gt;Jason says electric bikes are the best way to get around 30A, and I agree.&lt;/strong&gt; They offer sales and rentals to get the whole family out there cruising around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are located at 174 Watercolor Way in Santa Rosa, right next door to Publix and the UPS Store. I encourage you to come check out some of these bikes and take one for a test drive yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me about either of these places or about real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Prepare Your Home for the Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4l7k8d66arI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a home seller, what can you do to get your home ready for the photo shoot, the market, and for buyer showings?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When potential buyers pull up to your house, the outside needs to be just as inviting as the inside. This means having your bushes trimmed back, your driveway and home pressure washed, fresh light bulbs, and maybe some fresh cut flowers. &lt;strong&gt;If the exterior of your home is in disarray, that buyer may just keep driving&lt;/strong&gt; because they got a bad first impression of your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they walk through your front door, it’s important to have all of your carpets vacuumed and your home smelling clean and fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also make sure that your home is free of all personal items. Take down family photos and make sure that there aren’t any books stacked on the counter or above cabinets. You want the buyer to feel like this can be their home, and if your personal stuff is lying around everywhere, they will feel like they are intruding in someone else’s home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=A few small fixes can go a long way.%20http://ownemeraldcoast.com/prepare-your-home-for-the-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“A few small fixes can go a long way.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to have all of the smaller items in your home functioning correctly. Check on cabinet hinges, sliding glass doors, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the showing, we recommend that you have jazz music playing or cookies baking. Doing so will show buyers that you have pride in homeownership. &lt;strong&gt;We provide a professional stager to all of our clients.&lt;/strong&gt; The stager will come in and let you know what you need to do to make showings fantastic. Sometimes just switching out the comforters on the beds or adding a new lamp makes all the difference. Little changes go a long way; you don’t have to spend a lot of money to make your home more appealing to buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully some of these tips will help you sell your home faster and maximize your price. It’s all about the little touches and the experience the buyer has from the moment they pull up in front of your home. If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Where Is the Emerald Coast Real Estate Market Trending?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EzrBCxwxnBQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste present-before-paste&quot;&gt;What’s happening in our local real estate market?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;As a whole, &lt;strong&gt;our market is very healthy right now.&lt;/strong&gt; There are indications that it’s converting into a buyer’s market but some of that is due to December being a traditionally slow month for a vacation market, such as ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;We are in one of the fastest-growing areas in the country for primary residents, and we’re being discovered on a national level. Growing up in this area, I can tell you that, historically, most of our real estate traffic has come from the Southeast region. Now, though, we have residents coming from as far away as California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Our area is being discovered on a national level.%20http://ownemeraldcoast.com/where-is-the-emerald-coast-real-estate-market-trending.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Our area is being discovered on a national level.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;In the past, whenever we had a rise or fall in the market, there was so much speculation in our area that a lot of people who bought properties didn’t have the holding power to keep them and shouldn’t have been buying those properties on the level that they were. Today, there isn’t nearly as much speculation. &lt;strong&gt;The activity in our market now is based more on our exposure and people wanting to live in our area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;If you get a loan, lenders are very strict right now about who they’re lending to. There is a lot of cash entering our market, and that’s a strong indication of longevity. Another indicator I always look at in gauging market strength is how the commercial growth is happening in that area, and &lt;strong&gt;our commercial growth has been great lately.&lt;/strong&gt; We have a brand-new 5-star hotel, a new Whole Foods, and plenty of new shopping centers up and down Highway 98. These property developments are all signs of a strengthening market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shopping and Entertainment, Brand New and Expansions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
