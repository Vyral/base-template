        <title>How Is the Dallas Market Doing?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OEN4ImAuPvs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;Mindy and I often get asked about the state of today’s market. In fact, this is probably the No. 1 question we get from buyers and sellers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;Thankfully, our market here in Dallas is very healthy. We’ve had a strong seller’s market for years, but from looking at recent news &lt;strong&gt;we may be seeing the market begin to cool off.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;Recently we had lunch with a big, local lender who told us that applications for mortgage purchase loans are down by 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;This information points to a potential balancing off coming into the market.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Our market here in Dallas is very healthy.%20Mindyandjayrobbins.com/how-is-the-dallas-market-doing.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Our market here in Dallas is very healthy.”&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But this doesn’t mean that you should panic if you’re a seller. &lt;strong&gt;If you have a good Realtor who will be able to do the right kind of marketing, you can still command top dollar for your listing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;And if you’re a buyer, this shift in the market could mean you’ll have more leverage so long as you know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;Homes under $300,000 still have a lot of high demand and are likely to continue seeing multiple-offer situations. However, these conditions still aren’t quite as harsh as what we’ve seen in the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Accurate Is Zillow's Zestimate?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtQEAbmnyM4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zillow is one of the most common websites used today by people trying to figure out the value of their home.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;However, while Zillow might be a good way to get a ballpark figure, you might think twice about trusting its accuracy. In fact, The New York Times and multiple Seattle newspapers have reported that &lt;strong&gt;the CEO of Zillow sold his home for 40% less than the Zestimate.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In other words, the Zestimate can be and often is, inaccurate. Right here in Dallas, it tends to be off by an average of 5%.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This might sound like a fairly close evaluation but for those seriously considering buying or selling a home 5% could total about $15,000 in today’s local market
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The best way to make sure that your estimate is accurate is to hire a real estate professional.%20Mindyandjayrobbins.com/how-accurate-is-zillows-zestimate.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The best way to make sure that your estimate is accurate is to hire a real estate professional.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The best way to make sure that your estimate is accurate and that you are making the most out of a real estate transaction is to hire a real estate professional.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Working alongside someone able to determine a realistic price is going to make a big difference in your pocket.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So how does Zillow determine values, anyway? Well, they use a computer. As you and I both know, a computer is not what determines the value of a home.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A home’s value is determined by what a buyer is willing to pay as well as what the seller is willing to list it for.&lt;/strong&gt; These two figures can be vastly different from what a computer might estimate.
