        <title>Preparing Buyers for the Market, Part 3: The Closing Process</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7MRqV2Xmlso?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re back with the third and final installment of our series on preparing buyers for the market, and today we’ll be covering how to get clients to the finish line. Associate broker David Dorius joins us once again to help discuss this important topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your buyer has successfully entered the market, made an offer, and gone under contract, what does it take to get through the closing process?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before getting the answer to this, it’s important to note that &lt;strong&gt;being under contract is not the same thing as the property being sold.&lt;/strong&gt; This is something your clients must understand. As a professional, it is your responsibility to keep your clients in touch with reality. They must realize that being under contract really only puts them halfway through “the race.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One major hurdle of getting buyers through closing is guiding them through the due diligence process. And, because sellers are driving the market these days, something to keep in mind is that &lt;strong&gt;while sellers in the past may have been receptive to taking responsibility for certain repairs, this is no longer often the case.&lt;/strong&gt; Sellers in today’s market tend to price their properties with its condition in mind to begin with. So, your clients should be aware of this as you proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=As a professional, it is your responsibility to keep your clients in touch with reality.%20http://parkcityrealestatecareers.com/preparing-buyers-for-the-market-part-3-the-closing-process.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“As a professional, it is your responsibility to keep your clients in touch with reality.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another critical aspect of the closing process that your clients must understand is the importance of getting their finances in order. If their lender reaches out requesting further documentation, your client must respond expediently to make sure the transaction proceeds without any issues. &lt;strong&gt;A lot of paperwork goes into buying or selling a home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your client happens to be someone with a lot to do and a lot of things to manage within their financial portfolio, you may offer to communicate directly with their accountant. Getting their permission to make this contact can facilitate a much more streamlined process overall. Assisting a buyer with the logistics of their purchase is sometimes necessary to achieve a smooth close. Hopefully, all of the tips we’ve shared will help you and your client more successfully work through the buying process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preparing Buyers for the Market: Part 2</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/o8RvMHDV0eY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m here with associate broker David Dorius, a 30-year veteran of the Wasatch Back real estate market, to talk about a timely issue: How do you consult with buyers in a market where inventory is as tight as it is right now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David, tell us about the negotiating tactics you use when your clients find a property they’re ready to pursue.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we even get there, I try to give my clients copies of the contracts that we’ll be using so they can read through them ahead of time and come to understand what terms they’re dealing with. This way, when we finally find that property, only to discover that there are multiple other people looking at the same one, I won’t have to explain the whole contract to them. All they’ll have to do is fill in the blanks to be ready to roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Escalation Clauses are great tools to have, especially if clients are busy or traveling.%20http://parkcityrealestatecareers.com/preparing-buyers-for-the-market-part-2.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Escalation Clauses are great tools to have, especially if clients are busy or traveling.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I ask my clients, “How are you going to pay for it?” Will you use cash or loans? Somewhere around 50% of all of our transactions in this market are done with cash, so using cash will put you in a better position to get the property you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to finance it, you’ll want to make sure you’re completely approved for a loan and can show that all of your finances are in order. In other words, you’ll need to be in a position where your lender is ready to print out the loan documents. If you are, you’ll be able to compete with cash buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If there are multiple people bidding on a property, do you have any tools to help clients win negotiations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have something called an escalation clause, which is an addendum to the purchase agreement that says my client is willing to go above and beyond any competing offer up to a certain limit. Of course, I want to make sure they’re not vastly overpaying, so we’ll discuss what is an appropriate limit beforehand. It’s a great tool to have, especially if clients are busy or traveling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preparing Buyers for Our Low-Inventory Market: Part 1</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_RqwVfpR7QA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can you prepare a buyer for our current market, where inventory is tighter than it’s been in the past?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer that question, I’ve brought in KW Associate Broker David Dorius. David is a 30-year veteran of the Wasatch Back market who’s been named salesperson of the year by the Park City Board of Realtors and is currently on the Board of Directors for the Wasatch Back MLS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing David likes to do is &lt;strong&gt;have an in-depth discussion with the buyer to figure out what their needs and objectives are for buying.&lt;/strong&gt; This also prepares them for the possibility that, because we’re in a low-inventory market, they’ll have to compete with other buyers for the home they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Buyers need to know that they might have to compete with other buyers for the home they want.%20http://parkcityrealestatecareers.com/preparing-buyers-for-our-low-inventory-market-part-1.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Buyers need to know that they might have to compete with other buyers for the home they want.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get them to better understand this fact, David has to deal with the reality that most buyers today pre-shop for homes on the internet before meeting and consulting with an agent. The websites they use are valuable to consumers and helpful to us Realtors, but their information can also be out of date, which is why &lt;strong&gt;it’s important to make them understand that the homes they see on those websites might not be available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I need to get them in tune with allowing me to provide them accurate, current data and information about what’s available and what’s sold through our multiple listing service,” David says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to thank David for joining me today to share his thoughts on this important question. Stay tuned for part two of this series. In the meantime, if you have any questions or there’s anything I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to speak with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Increasing Your Stream of Income: Part 2</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fHSoTVeDDcE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we’re continuing our discussion on how to create a steady stream of income in your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not just in this market, but in markets across the country, we have been seeing a tremendous decrease in inventory. This is because pricing is beginning to peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing you can do when speaking to clients is to educate them on these kinds of trends. Following statistics may not direct you to the single most advantageous moment for a client to make their move, but it can certainly help you guide them to a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You can continue to be of value to your clients even after they close.%20http://parkcityrealestatecareers.com/increasing-your-stream-of-income-part-2.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“You can continue to be of value to your clients even after they close.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being able to engage with clients this way will likely lead to referral business, which will contribute to your overall income.&lt;/strong&gt;When you provide quality information to the people you work with, you become more than just an agent—you become a fiduciary to your client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you help a client make one of the biggest financial decisions of their lives, why wouldn’t you provide further insight on how to make the most of their resources after the transaction? You can continue to be of value to your clients even after they close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you become a fiduciary resource for your clients, you are fostering the potential for future business with them or people they refer to you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Create Consistent Revenue in Your Business</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vSwFtuBLFaM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to be joined once again by Scott Agnew, who’s back to share his expertise with all of us. Today we’re going to explore the topic of how to create a steady stream of income in your real estate business. Scott got his license at 18 and has been in real estate since then, so he has a wealth of knowledge to share with everyone. Here are some highlights from my interview with Scott:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your No. 1 tip for creating consistent revenue in a real estate business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relationships, which are built through consistent contact over time. &lt;strong&gt;The more time we’re able to spend sharing knowledge with others, the better off they will be.&lt;/strong&gt; We become a trusted resource over time by consistently bringing value in the form of tips, offers, and just being there to answer any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You want to create clients for life.%20http://parkcityrealestatecareers.com/how-to-create-consistent-revenue-in-your-business.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“You want to create clients for life.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the best use of an agent’s dollars for staying engaged with clients?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb is that whenever a client uses your services, you &lt;strong&gt;take a small percentage of the revenue that they bring to you and find a way to reinvest those dollars back into providing value&lt;/strong&gt; to all of the people who have committed to you. There’s a big difference between a one-time commission check and a commission check that comes with a raving fan attached. The goal should be to create as many raving fans as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the best tactical tool that an agent could put into play here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short videos. Building relationships used to be an information game, but today things are a little different because of the sheer amount of information there is to sort through. To be able to distill it down into a concise and succinct message means delivering content and delivering value in an easy-to-digest way. You want to give them information that’s so good that they would pay for it. I’m talking about fresh, unique, original content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Can You Attain the Mindset of a Trusted Advisor?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8sH9Gmhg8R0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a challenging market out there due to tight inventory, but our operating partner Scott Agnew has some advice on how to become a trusted advisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott says you can either accept the low inventory and hope you can get buyers to purchase homes from the picked-over supply or you can choose a different strategy. As an alternative to putting all your hopes on buyers, try figuring out how you can ignite the idea within homeowners—especially those who have been in their properties for years—that right now is one of the best times to sell we’ve seen recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, many of these homeowners are perfectly happy and aren’t in the modality to re-allocate their assets, but as far as having that conversation with them, you’re simply inquiring if they’ve considered that now might be a great time for them to sell and re-allocate their assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You’re there to ask people questions which might be at the top of their mind already.%20http://parkcityrealestatecareers.com/how-can-you-attain-the-mindset-of-a-trusted-advisor.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“You’re there to ask people questions which might be at the top of their mind already.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible that they want to but just don’t know where to start or who to talk to. Whatever the case may be, there are opportunities out there if you utilize what Scott calls the &lt;strong&gt;“approach it empathetically” mindset.&lt;/strong&gt; You’re not there to manipulate people or get them to do things; you’re there to ask them questions which might be at the top of their mind already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may also be sellers out there who don’t know they want to sell but realize they’re not getting the utility out of their house that they prefer. It might be a good idea for them to sell while the market is near its peak. &lt;strong&gt;When you introduce a thought or a concept to a client, they might resist it at first, but you can still plant the seed of that thought or concept.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’re not going to change people’s minds instantly,” Scott says, “but maybe you plant the seed in a way that’s empathetic—that gives them the time to process the idea such that, all of a sudden, it becomes something they want to do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to thank Scott for joining me today in this discussion. If you have any questions about attaining the mindset of a trusted advisor, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’d be happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Does Julie Hopkins Design a Results-Driven Marketing Program?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sT9IUrfItt4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie Hopkins has achieved enormous success in her real estate business, but how does she design a results-driven marketing program for that business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie entered the real estate field with a considerable background working with Fortune 500 companies. With her MBA and prior sales and marketing experience, &lt;strong&gt;she used that background to drive her business by establishing a brand and being true to that brand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also helps that Julie loves the resort community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was fortunate to grow up in a Colorado resort community and then live in this resort community my whole life,” she says. “And just believing it and having all my marketing centered around that, and understanding my target audience, and trying to sell the resort community through all my communications that sell my business.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie is very good at incorporating all the vendors that support her team in her marketing. Since she loves Park City and how it’s constantly evolving, whenever she sees someone new or a longtime resident starting a business, &lt;strong&gt;she tries to support them with her own business and build a partnership.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I try to differentiate myself by marketing the community and other people’s businesses as well.%20http://parkcityrealestatecareers.com/how-does-julie-hopkins-design-a-results-driven-marketing-program.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“I try to differentiate myself by marketing the community and other people’s businesses as well.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everyone in Park city has been really responsive to that,” she says. “I try to differentiate myself by marketing the community and other people’s businesses as well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fellow KW Park City agent Niki Thomas supports those marketing efforts by handling a lot of the back-end work and delivering and packaging of those marketing items. There are many details to this business and a lot of moving parts when it comes to coordinating with clients and coordinating marketing initiatives, and Niki manages many of those back-end moving parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working at Keller Williams has also helped Julie because it’s given her a certain autonomy to set her brand.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, she works with a designer she’s known for 30 years and previously worked with in corporate America. Working with that designer has helped her continually come up with fun ideas every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie’s marketing is delivering great results for her, and I want to thank her and Niki for joining me today. If you wish to contact Julie, you can email her at &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(106,117,108,105,101,64,106,104,112,97,114,107,99,105,116,121,46,99,111,109))&quot;&gt;julie@jhparkcity.com&lt;/a&gt; or call her at (435) 649-9882.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email as well. I’d be glad to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>An Expert’s Take on the Art of Time Management</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jkIX8ggChZo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fellow KW agent and associate broker Julie Hopkins uses specific time management techniques to perform at a very high level in our industry, and there are a few tips she recommends to help you prioritize your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of times, Julie notes, agents don’t have control of their own days, but &lt;strong&gt;the most important thing for her is holding a deal together.&lt;/strong&gt; “You’ve gone through all the steps to get the deal, and you want to hold it together and get it across the finish line,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a deal across the finish line, the first thing Julie does when she wakes up in the morning is look at what she has under contract and what needs to be done to get that contract to the next step. Her next priority is wherever her next deal is and what can she do in terms of marketing, prospecting, etc., to find the next piece of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Prioritize what needs to be done first.%20http://parkcityrealestatecareers.com/an-experts-take-on-the-art-of-time-management.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Prioritize what needs to be done first.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real estate agents have to deal with a lot of noise, and there are a lot of people knocking on our door asking for things. For Julie, that’s a difficult thing to manage, but it must be done, and she does it at times that are convenient for her. Some of it she doesn’t respond to, and some of it she does decide to politely respond to. As her email inbox fills up, she makes a conscious choice to stay on task, and that’s what you have to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie’s business coach also helps her stay accountable&lt;/strong&gt; by asking her important questions about things like her business plan, as well as by talking her through tricky situations and figuring out how to solve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He puts some perspective on things that help me better manage situations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie also uses the book “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People” as an important resource. It has helped her realize she’s not an effective multitasker, and she’s much better off at picking one task and focusing all of her attention on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I have to remember what Stephen Covey said—first things first.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to give a special thanks to Julie for joining me today. If you wish to contact her, you can call her at (435) 649-9882 or email her at &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(106,117,108,105,101,64,106,104,112,97,114,107,99,105,116,121,46,99,111,109))&quot;&gt;julie@jhparkcity.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Can You Add Leverage to Your Business?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fI-9_6VIb4k?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to our series on getting leverage in your business. To help me discuss today’s topic, I’ll be joined by our No. 1 associate, Julie Hopkins, and her assistant Niki Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an extremely successful agent in our area and across the board, I wanted to talk to Julie about how she personally uses leverage to achieve such amazing results in her business. First, I asked what prompted her to hire an assistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The business got too big for me to handle alone . . . It was time to get support to be able to responsibly handle the business I take on for people,”&lt;/strong&gt; said Julie. Prompted by this response, I wanted to hear from Niki. So, I asked her how she supports Julie in their business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Niki, she runs the day-to-day backend operations. She handles contracts and works closely with coordinating transactions. This is significant, since transactions can have many, many steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Niki and Julie’s day-to-day focus is always changing.%20http://parkcityrealestatecareers.com/how-can-you-add-leverage-to-your-business.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Niki and Julie’s day-to-day focus is always changing.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how exactly has business changed for Julie since hiring Niki and adding more leverage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s wonderful,” Julie says. “It’s awesome, because I have someone to delegate things to.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What needs to be focused on from day to day is always changing. As Niki put it, they take things “One thing at a time.” Not knowing exactly what the focus will be each day is really indicative of the flow of the business. &lt;strong&gt;Being able to keep up with this ever-changing flow is something Julie says she greatly appreciates in Niki.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though she very much likes working on her own without a team, Julie says it’s wonderful having someone like Niki by her side. I definitely applaud the two of them for having such a strong partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How The Wilstein Team Uses Leverage</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lry4jphcfiQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time for part two of The Leverage Series, which explores how building a business with a team might work for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m talking to The Wilstein Team. First, let’s meet Ron Wilstein and Doug Almstedt and see what they have to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ron, you’ve had some version of a team for the 25 years I’ve known you. What prompted you to bring leverage into your business way back when?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ron: I received some good advice from someone who said, “There’s a lot involved in real estate. There are a lot of things you have to do and if you’re doing all of it, then you’re spending a lot of time doing that and not working with buyers and sellers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they basically said that if you can hire someone at a lower wage than your earning power to take care of those tasks that are important, that will put you in front of more buyers and sellers. That is how I know the importance of leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve owned your own brokerage for 10 years. When you decided to get out of running the broker’s side of the world and just focus on the business, why did you choose to move to Keller Williams?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ron: I looked at a number of different, well-respected brokerages in town and they each had their strengths, but I found Keller Williams to be the best combination in part because I do my own distinct marketing. The Keller Williams environment, or culture, allows agents to express and conduct their business in the ways that they want rather than following a cookie cutter mold from a franchise. So, it gave me the greatest amount of latitude to help me be successful and the move was very well-suited for my team members because, frankly, they get better commission splits than the other brokerages allow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please tell me about the composition of your team.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ron: Our team consists of seven members. I am the team leader, and I typically specialize in representing sellers. Doug and I represent sellers, and then we have three buyer’s agents: Dean, Kathy, and Jeremy. Then we have the admin team, Lynette Thorn and Jennifer Lee. Lynette’s been with me 22 years and Jennifer has been with us for 12 years. Jennifer is our transaction coordinator and interacts with buyers and sellers. If you want a fast answer, talk to Jennifer. Lynette has done every job in the business and now handles the marketing while overseeing the entire team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Hire someone to take care of those important tasks so you can stay in front of buyers.%20http://parkcityrealestatecareers.com/how-the-wilstein-team-uses-leverage.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Hire someone to take care of those important tasks so you can stay in front of buyers.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doug, how long have you been on the team and how has being on a team changed your life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doug: I was able to join Ron about four years ago. His team has been an immeasurable help. Going from an independent agent trying to do it all myself and joining Ron’s team with established procedures and a team that takes care of everything has increased my business and give me a lot more free time. I’m a cyclist, so it’s been nice to have more time to train and do the races that I want to be in each year. It’s been extremely beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re also now a director for the Park City Board of Realtors. Congratulations!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doug: I am! So, boss, I may need a little more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ron: We have a political giant on our team, so this is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doug: I am excited to serve on the board of directors for the Park City Board of Realtors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After I met with Doug and Ron, I decided to sit down with the real heart of the organization: the admin team. Jennifer Lee and Lynette Thorn play very important roles on The Wilstein Team, and they took time out of their busy days to answer a few of my questions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jen, I understand that you’ve been with Ron for 12 years as client care and transaction manager. What does that involve?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jen: My job is to manage all of the paperwork, all of the people, and all of the deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the seller side, I am the main point of contact for our clients. They can call me with any questions and I can usually get an answer to them more quickly than the agent can. I manage all of the paperwork and make sure everything’s signed and distributed properly. I also help Lynette with the marketing schedule and handle all of the showings on our properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That includes receiving inquiries from the buyer’s agent, coordinating that appointment with the sellers, and follow up on every showing to get feedback so that we can report back to the seller so that they know what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the buyer side, I make sure the paperwork is submitted to the lender and the title company. I also coordinate the inspection, the appraisal, and serve as the main point of contact for the buyer or buyer’s agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that keeps us on the same page is that we all use a shared calendar so that I can see what everyone is doing, make sure everything happens as it should, and get us to the closing table with paperwork completed and done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, we know that leads to very satisfied clients. Jen, thank you for all of your hard work. Lynette, tell us about the marketing side of the team. How long have you been working with Ron?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lynette: I think it’s going to be 21 years in January. I do work on the marketing side of the team. One of my goals is to have no prospect left behind. I try to get contact info from our agents on all of their prospects. Sometimes I have to beg, borrow, or steal from agents or other sources to get people into our database so we can start disseminating information to them, whether it be an update on a new listing, our newsletter, or the postcards that we send to different neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also keep multiple websites updated with current information and add pages to them so our viewers can have the most recent information available. We also send out hard copies of our newsletters, flyers, magazines, and postcards. I coordinate with Ron on getting those edited, printed, and mailed out. We try to keep them going on a systematic calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next, I’d like to introduce you to two of the three buyer’s agents on The Wilstein Team: Kathy Leitzke and Dean Deleone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kathy, you joined the team a few years back. How has being a buyer’s agent on a team changed your life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kathy: Joining the team allowed me to focus on my clients and my client’s needs. My team takes care of marketing and our web presence, which frees me up to focus on what I like best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dean, I know you had the good fortune of starting with The Wilstein Team right out of business school. I know you had sales experience prior to this in another industry. How has that worked out for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dean: As Kathy mentioned, we have multiple websites that instantly get leads going. I don’t have to market and search for those leads. My past experience means I’m able to cultivate those leads and really hit the ground running, so it’s been a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, Jeremy Wilstein sent in a video with some comments on working on a team as a buyer’s agent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeremey: The support of The Wilstein Team has allowed me to pursue my love of real estate while simultaneously pursuing my love of adventure and travel. Without a doubt, I would not be able to do what I’m doing without the support of my team: my father, Ron; Jennifer; Lynette, Doug, Kathy, and Dean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While traveling, I’ve been able to farm and stay in contact with all of my clients that I’ve developed over the last six or seven years, when I worked full-time in real estate. I’m still able to keep those relationships but if I’m not in town, they can go out and look at a property with another agent on our team. It’s been tremendous for me to continue my real estate business while continuing this love of travel and adventure and not wait until I’m older to experience it in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you to The Wilstein Team for sitting down with me today.&lt;/strong&gt; If you would like to learn more about The Wilstein Team or have any questions for them, check out their website: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.viewparkcityrealestate.com&quot;&gt;http://www.viewparkcityrealestate.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any questions for me, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;
