        <title>How the Storms Affected Kauai Earlier  This Year?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/KwvpbSTs7NY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’ll be talking a little bit more about the island of Kauai. It won’t be so much about real estate this time; I thought it might be useful for folks on the mainland to learn a little about what has been happening on the island since &lt;strong&gt;Tropical Storm Olivia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in April, you might have heard about our torrential rains. Many have the idea that the whole island is underwater, but it really only affected a few parts of the island. A stream in Koloa Town flooded and caused some home damage, most of which occurred on the North Shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In just one day in April, there was 36 inches of rain&lt;/strong&gt; that caused a number of traumatic effects: In Hanalei, it rerouted rivers, and the Hanalei Pier was basically sitting on sand. It’s only now that Black Pot, the park adjacent to the pier, is being repaired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the dozen mudslides we endured, parts of roads were actually removed. Though it’s been many months, that part of the island is still inaccessible. Those who live out there can get special passes to a convoy that travels twice a day to and from that part of the island, which is really the only way to get around the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting moment for Kauai. There are a lot of vacation rentals on that section of the island, but of course, many of those folks are out of business. We just have to wait and see what the eventual outcome will be; &lt;strong&gt;the state just instituted the Haena Master Plan&lt;/strong&gt;, which, in essence, is a plan to limit the number of visitors to the area, to install parking, as well as to repair certain features in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost 3,000 cars a day were traveling to the area prior to the plan. People love to come and hike the trails and reach the places that one can only get to on foot, by boat, or by helicopter. The hope is that the master plan will normalize activity in the area by next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Overall, I think we’re learning to respect the power of nature.%20http://margolisteamblog.com/how-the-storms-affected-kauai-earlier-this-year.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Overall, I think we’re learning to respect the power of nature.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a challenging time for the island of Kauai. Many people lost their homes, and there are still those that need housing and food. Some lost their jobs because commuting to work and back became difficult or impossible. We’re still in a recovery phase her on the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, it is important to note that the rest of the island is still in good shape&lt;/strong&gt;: Tourism is strong, and so is the real estate market. We haven’t seen much of an effect on property values yet, besides those multimillion-dollar homes that were destroyed and had to be rebuilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think we’re learning to respect the power of nature. If you have any questions about the state of Kauai’s recovery process or about real estate here on the island, feel free to reach out to me. In the meantime, stay safe from any storms that are forming. A hui hou, and aloha!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>We Work in Real Estate So We Can Help Others in All Aspects of Life</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bj1bgeF4eHo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here at the Margolis Team, we work in real estate because we love to help people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the most enjoyable parts of the job is helping people learn about Kauai.&lt;/strong&gt; Sure, we can help you learn about its properties and negotiate for them on your behalf, but we also want to help you understand what life is like here, tell you about its great resources, and share what we’ve learned after living in Kauai for 15 years. This gives you all the support you need—not just in real estate, but in all aspects of your life here on the island.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working with sellers, for instance, it’s rewarding to understand what their needs are and help them as if they were a member of our church or our family. We put our whole hearts into getting you the results you need, and when we get those results, it’s fulfilling for us as well. When we don’t get the results we want, we at least know we’ve given it our all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We put our whole hearts into getting you the results you need.%20http://margolisteamblog.com/we-work-in-real-estate-so-we-can-help-others-in-all-aspects-of-life.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We put our whole hearts into getting you the results you need.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another reason we do what we do is so we can have the time and money to contribute to some of the great causes of Kauai.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the nonprofits we support (and I serve on the board of) that’s particularly relevant to this time of year is Aloha Angels, whose mission is to enhance the quality of life of middle and elementary school teachers and students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the initiatives we’re working on right now is something called “Adopt an After-School Club,” which works to improve after-school clubs. This year, we’ll have about 50 clubs on the island. This project serves an important need because Kauai middle schools and elementary schools normally don’t have after-school programs. By creating these enrichment programs, we’re providing emotional support for kids who may not be getting it from their own families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s very fulfilling to be able to help these kids, and it is similar to what we experience when working with buyers and sellers. If you’d like to learn more about Aloha Angels or you’d like to help them with their mission, you can visit their website &lt;a href=&quot;https://alohaangelskauai.org/&quot;&gt;AlohaAngelsKauai.org&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a great opportunity to interact with kids and share what you’ve learned with the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any questions for us or you have any real estate needs, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Check out This Step-By-Step Guide on How to Use Our New Website</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4JukUET5hK8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our new website is here, and today we are excited to give you a look at how to navigate all the features it includes. &lt;strong&gt;Feel free to follow along in the video above for a step-by-step demonstration.&lt;/strong&gt; Even more so than in the past, our new website makes it easy to find the valuable, current information you need to pursue your real estate goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a reminder, you can find our website at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kauairealestatesearch.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.kauairealestatesearch.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Once you’re at our home page, the first thing you will see is our convenient search feature. This tool allows you to look through properties in any area you’d like, whether you want to browse an entire ZIP code or just see a specific address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Our new website makes it easy to find the valuable, current information you need to pursue your real estate goals.%20http://margolisteamblog.com/check-out-this-step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-use-our-new-website.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Our new website makes it easy to find the valuable, current information you need to pursue your real estate goals.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After inputting your search, you’ll be shown all listings that match that criteria. You will also be able to see which properties are new, which have recently had a price reduction, which are pending, and more. The website will show you the most recently listed properties by default, but if you click the arrow at the top left-hand corner, below the Margolis Team logo, a drop-down menu will appear. This menu will let you customize how you’d like your results to be sorted, allowing you to sort homes by lot size, price, number of bedrooms or bathrooms, the year it was built, or square footage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By clicking on any of these search options, you can filter listings shown to you by any specific features or criteria you’re interested in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just like on our previous site, you can still save all of your favorite listings by clicking on the heart icon displayed over each listing. These listings will then be compiled into one convenient “favorites” folder that you can access at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, &lt;strong&gt;our website has great features available for sellers, as wel&lt;/strong&gt;l. Whether you’re seriously considering listing or are just curious about the market, clicking on the Home Valuation link at the top of our website will allow you to enter your street address and get an instant home-value estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you use this feature, you will be given a very accurate value range that reflects where your home stands compared to other comparable properties. If you would like a more in-depth analysis, though, please get in touch with me so I can give you a more thorough valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;buyers, sellers, and homeowners alike will be interested in the last feature of our website we’re going to highlight today: our blog.&lt;/strong&gt; Clicking on the blog link will lead you to all our past posts, which include videos and articles just like this one. There are new entries twice a month, so be on the lookout for updates. We love bringing you valuable information so that you can stay on top of your real estate goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Lessons From 2007 We Can Use in Today’s Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zp0UF4g-4L0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*This video contains a couple of statistical graphs to illustrate points about market value and number of visitor to the island which effects the vacation rental market. If those stats interest you, you might want to pause the video to look at the graphic.*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What lessons did we learn from 2007? There are five big ones which I am going to go over with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Do not buy a home that you cannot afford.&lt;/strong&gt; Many people felt the pressure of a brisk market from 2006 to 2008 and decided to buy for fear of being locked out. However, if they would have waited a few years, there would have been an opportunity for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since many people buy homes on Kauai as second homes or vacation rentals, they have multiple mortgages which affected them greatly when the economy slowed. Once that happened, there were fewer people vacationing and those travelers were not renting their homes. Keep that in mind if you are planning on buying a home and relying on the vacation rental income, as economic slowing can occur again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Do not always believe that your home will go up in value.&lt;/strong&gt; Real estate markets are cyclical. If you look at the graph at 1:54, you will see that while the market has averaged an annual appreciation rate of over 5% in the last couple decades, you will see that that increase is not a straight line. Instead, the graph fluctuates. This trend is especially true of second home destination marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Ensure that you have adequate reserves.&lt;/strong&gt; Financial experts tell us that we should always have six months of savings as liquid funds in case something happens economically to you specifically or globally. Here on the island, when the economy slows, so does the travel industry. This could cause a lot of problems for you if you are relying on vacation rental income to pay your mortgage.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Financial experts tell us that we should always have six months of savings as liquid funds.%20http://margolisteamblog.com/5-lessons-from-2007-we-can-use-in-todays-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Financial experts tell us that we should always have six months of savings as liquid funds.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Make as large of a down payment as you possibly can.&lt;/strong&gt; While there are a lot of options for low down payments, if the market drops 10% down the road and you have only paid 3.5%, you may find yourself in a tricky situation if you need to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Buy low and sell high if you can.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re holding out for the long term or fixing and flipping a home, though, those may be good strategies too. If you have had your home for a few years, it may be a good time to sell if your investment in your home is discretionary. Currently, the market is very strong, and you could sell your home for much more than you paid for it years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that you can reflect on what happened in 2007 so that you can make the right choice for you now. If you have any questions about this, would like help interpreting the current market, or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to contact me by phone or email. I look forward to speaking with you about your realty needs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Investors: Have You Considered Purchasing a Foreclosure Property?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GeLNgwfai3M?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I venture into today’s topic, I’d like to first discuss the recent storm here on Kauai. While most of the island goes unaffected, certain low-lying areas were greatly impacted by this historic natural disaster. That said, there is a silver lining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people of Kauai are incredibly strong and there has been an incredible response from those who have given their time, energy, and monetary donations toward relief efforts. Seeing the island come together like this truly demonstrates the aloha spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of that being said, I’d like to move on to today’s subject: foreclosure properties. &lt;strong&gt;Investors are always searching for opportunities, and many of these opportunities come in the form of distressed properties.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dominant type of distressed property in our market today is bank-owned properties. It may be hard to believe, but some of the properties I see coming to auction at the courthouse steps have been in foreclosure for nearly 10 years. These properties represent some of the best investment opportunities for those with the skills and resources to handle them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, it’s important to note buying a bank-owned property is a different kind of transaction than a typical real estate purchase.&lt;/strong&gt; The bank offers no guarantees or warranties. Another way this kind of purchase differs from typical transactions is that while the properties are sometimes placed on the MLS, they are also often sold through the courthouse or through an online auction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to courthouse auctions, a professional such as myself may bid on your behalf. The process can seem somewhat complex at first, so allow me to give a basic explanation of what you can expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Foreclosure properties represent some of the best investment opportunities for those with the skills and resources to handle them.%20http://margolisteamblog.com/investors-have-you-considered-purchasing-a-foreclosure-property.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Foreclosure properties represent some of the best investment opportunities for those with the skills and resources to handle them.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreclosure, the process through which a bank reclaims a property where the homeowner is in default, is handled differently in many states. &lt;strong&gt;In Hawaii, the process is known as judicial foreclosure. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the court has granted the plaintiff (the bank) its motion for summary judgement, the judge then appoints a commissioner, usually an attorney. The attorney must file three notices in the paper announcing the court sale date and hold two open houses at the property. &lt;strong&gt;This process usually takes 6 -10 weeks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the foreclosure auction sale will occur on the courthouse steps at noon on the announced date. The winner of the highest bid gets the property, but the process doesn’t end there. The commissionerthen files documents to schedule a confirmation hearing which usually occurs 6-8 weeks later. &lt;strong&gt;At the confirmation, the bidding is reopened&lt;/strong&gt;. At that time if a buyer wants to bid, the minimum bid must be at least 5% higher than the price at the courthouse. So, if a home were auctioned off on the courthouse steps for $700,000, when the bidding is reopened at the confirmation hearing, the minimum bid would be $735,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be multiple bidders at the confirmation hearing and the price will go up until the auction is completed. Then, there are more legal documents to be processed and filed and, ultimately, &lt;strong&gt;the buyer receives a commissioner’s deed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I would be happy to further explain this process. So if you have any other questions, would like more information, or are interested in purchasing a foreclosure property, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Homebuyers Can Learn From the 2017 Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/IZB7tgru-Qk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a buyer’s perspective, what did we learn from the 2017 market about buying a home on Kauai?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, prices have come back from the bottom of the market in 2011 and 2012. Depending on the transaction, they are almost back to where they were at the top of the market. Most areas still have another 15%, 20%, or 25% to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that started happening toward the end of the last year (that’s very prevalent now) is we don’t have a lot of inventory. You might look at the national statistics and think that real estate sales are down. &lt;strong&gt;However, the sales volume is down because inventory is down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does that mean for you as a buyer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need an agent who is going to pay attention so that you can react quickly when the right home at the right price comes on the market. You also need an agent who networks with other agents because other agents may have access to pocket listings. A pocket listing means that there is a seller out there who tells their agent, “I don’t want to put my home on the MLS but if you find a buyer, here’s the price that I want.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=As a homebuyer, you need to be prepared to move quickly in a competitive market like this one.%20http://margolisteamblog.com/what-homebuyers-can-learn-from-the-2017-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“As a homebuyer, you need to be prepared to move quickly in a competitive market like this one.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, make sure that you get an agent who is aggressive and will help you figure out the right price to get the property.&lt;/strong&gt; A good agent will encourage you to write a personalized letter to create an emotional bond with the seller so that you get the house you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, interest rates are still good. There are rumors that the Fed will raise rates a few more times this year, but that may or may not affect mortgage rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, if you want to buy a home, &lt;strong&gt;the 2017 market has taught us that you need to be prepared.&lt;/strong&gt;Have your pre-qualification letter ready. If you are paying cash, make sure you have proof of funds. Get that personalized letter written and put together a great offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you work with our team, we’ll send the offer and follow up with the seller’s agent to put you in the best position in a market that’s increasingly competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for us, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Year-in-Review Look at Our 2017 Market and a Few Predictions for 2018</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-fscWQfyfzg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the final word on our 2017 market? What can you expect from the market in 2018?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2017 Kauai market was bustling and brisk. &lt;strong&gt;The overall number of transactions was up over 12%, and the dollar volume of those sales rose 5%.&lt;/strong&gt; This means more money was invested and traded in real estate in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a closer look at how the median prices for single-family homes and condos played out across all five zones in Kauai:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Starting in Waimea, the median price for single-family homes rose 10.67%. There were no condo trades because there are no condos in that area.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Koloa, prices for single-family homes rose 6.15% and prices for condos rose 8%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Lihue, prices for single-family homes rose 4.8% and prices for condos rose 13.1%. For condos, that number doesn’t necessarily mean that prices went up - just that the trades were higher because of a lack of inventory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Kawaihau, prices for single-family homes rose 9.76% and prices for condos dropped 31.16%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Hanalei, prices for single-family homes rose 1.32% and prices for condos dropped 12.44%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what can we expect from the 2018 marketplace?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If things continue as they are (and there’s no reason to believe they won’t), we’ll keep seeing strong demand for property and only a limited amount of housing available.&lt;/strong&gt; Prices should continue to rise, and tourism should continue to stay strong, so if you own a vacation rental home, you should see good returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=2017 was a great year for Kauai, and 2018 looks to be very promising.%20http://margolisteamblog.com/a-year-in-review-look-at-our-2017-market-and-a-few-predictions-for-2018.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“2017 was a great year for Kauai, and 2018 looks to be very promising.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prices for single-family homes in the modest price ranges will continue to trend upward. There continues to be a couple years’ worth of supply in most areas on the island for homes priced over $2 million, but down toward $550,000 and $600,000 range, buyers could find themselves competing for homes in multiple offer situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2017 was a great year for Kauai, and 2018 looks to be very promising. If you’re a buyer, it’s still a good time to get a toe-hold on the marketplace. If you’re a seller, the market is strong as long as your home is priced and marketed correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to get in touch with us. We’d be happy to help you achieve all of your real estate goals, and we wish you a healthy, happy, prosperous 2018. Until next time, aloha!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Happy Holidays From the Margolis Team</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/M2BYEwP2jzQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aloha and happy holidays from beautiful Kaua’i!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My wife and I have been very blessed to have helped people find or sell homes for the past 13 years. &lt;/strong&gt;Whether people come to Kaua’i for retirement, to find a slower pace of life, or to find a more exciting life hiking, biking, surfing, and golfing in this beautiful area, it’s a place where families come together to make memories for a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This holiday season, we want to say thank you to those we’ve had the privilege to serve. To those of you who may one day own a piece of paradise or need to sell a property here, we value the opportunity to be of service in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You have made it possible for us to give back to the community.%20http://margolisteamblog.com/happy-holidays-from-the-margolis-team.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“You have made it possible for us to give back to the community.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on 2017, we know that you have made it possible for us to give back and serve our community in many ways. As some of you may know, Gwen and I serve through rotary. I am also an active board member of Junior Achievement, where we provide a financial education to our kids. I’m also a board member with Aloha Angels, a beautiful nonprofit which has raised over $2 million in the last four years to make lives better for teachers and students and improve education on Kaua’i.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am grateful to work with my wife, Gwen, my superb assistant, Bailey Hutton, and our transaction manager to provide the highest level of service, attention, and dedication to those we’ve had the privilege to serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, this is likely the largest transaction of your life. &lt;strong&gt;I am proud to be part of a team that is committed to your success regardless of any challenges.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On behalf of my team, I would like to wish you joy, health, peace, and abundance through the holidays and the new year. May you spend time with your family and be filled with gratitude and recognition for all that you have been blessed with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mele Kalikimaka me ka hauʻoli makahiki hou!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Do You Do When You Get Multiple Offers?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DXwZPELIWZM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should you do when you get multiple offers on your property?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a great home that’s been priced, staged, and marketed properly, you may find yourself with multiple offers. That can be scary for people because they’re not exactly sure what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday, a condo came on the market in Princeville that was priced very well. I called the agent to take a buyer up there, and they said they had 15 showings already. I’m sure that seller will receive multiple cash offers today. That does happen in our marketplace when homes are priced correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you receive multiple offers on your home, you have three options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, if you get one offer that is superior to others, you can go ahead and &lt;strong&gt;accept the best offer.&lt;/strong&gt; If one offer gets you the best price and the terms you want or if you’re not sure the other buyers are qualified, you may be better off accepting the best one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You can ask the buyers to come back with their highest and best offers.%20http://margolisteamblog.com/what-do-you-do-when-you-get-multiple-offers.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“You can ask the buyers to come back with their highest and best offers.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also counter the offer that you think is best or &lt;strong&gt;counter all of the offers.&lt;/strong&gt; Let’s say that you get three offers and decide to counter all of them. In the counter, you have to have language that explains and contractually says if you receive multiple counteroffers back, you reserve the right to pick one of those offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can pull a Pat Benatar and tell the buyers, “Hit me with your best shot.” In this scenario, &lt;strong&gt;ask each agent to have their buyers bring in their highest, best, and final offer.&lt;/strong&gt; From there, you choose which offer you want to go with. Asking for their highest and best can get you a price above and beyond what you expected. However, some buyers may respond emotionally. They won’t want to get in a bidding war, and they may pull their offer off the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose which option is best for you to get your home sold for top dollar. As your real estate agent, I can guide you through this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about multiple offers or selling your home, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;
