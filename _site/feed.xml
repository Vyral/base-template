        <title>Why You Need to Take Advantage of the Market Now</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PGjQdBq5NwM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re a buyer or seller, I have important news to share with you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest rates, as we know, have been on the rise. Why does this matter?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a buyer and rates go up just 1%, you’ll lose 10% of your buying power. This means you may have to settle for not living in the neighborhood you want or giving up that pool you wanted. That’s not what you want, right? I know that’s not what I want for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a seller, rising interest rates mean fewer buyers can afford your home. Fewer buyers mean fewer offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY OUR MARKET IS GIVING YOU RIGHT NOW.%20http://treugroupsouthflorida.com/why-you-need-to-take-advantage-of-the-market-now.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY OUR MARKET IS GIVING YOU RIGHT NOW.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a study published recently that no one’s talking about but I think you deserve to know about. The study showed that in South Florida, there’s less than a 10% chance that our real estate prices will decrease in the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a buyer, you might have both higher interest rates and higher prices, and that’s not good for anybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are here to help you capitalize on the opportunity in the current market, so if you have any questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling real estate, don’t hesitate to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Things to Know About the Palm Beach County Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PzqeHzODsAE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real estate market can be a little bit confusing, especially if you’re getting your information from friends, family, or the news. So I wanted to give you some accurate information about the Palm Beach County market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, we had 5.1 months of inventory. &lt;strong&gt;That means we’re still in a seller’s market.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re looking to buy, you’re going to need to be prepared, and if you’re looking to sell, you’re going to be pretty happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;35.7% of all transactions that closed last month were cash. There were no appraisal contingencies and no financing in these transactions. The median price was $327,000 and that number keeps rising. We still have room to grow, as the number when we were at the height of our market was around $375,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question frequently asked is this: “Are you buying or selling in a buyer’s market or seller’s market?” It depends on two things: the area and the price range that you’re in. For example, if you’re buying or selling a single-family home in the $200,000 to $250,000 range, then you’re in a very strong seller’s market. There are only about two months inventory in this price range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=THERE’S ALWAYS AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE MARKET.%20http://treugroupsouthflorida.com/things-to-know-about-palm-beach-county.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“THERE’S ALWAYS AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE MARKET.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you increase your budget and you’re buying or selling in the $300,000 to $400,000 range, then you’re still in a seller’s market and there’s only about three months of inventory. Sellers are receiving multiple offers for these homes and buyers are going to have a hard time beating out the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you move into the luxury market ($600,000 to $1 million range), you’ll see we’re in a buyer’s market. We have nine months of inventory in this market, so if you’re looking to buy then you’ll have plenty to choose from. The same goes for homes that are priced at $1 million or more. We have 16 months of inventory available in this market, making it a strong buyer’s market as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s always an opportunity in the market. The question is how do you capitalize on that? Here at True Group Real Estate, we’ve been helping buyers in the seller’s market get the home of their dreams. If you’re selling, we want to help you get the most money for your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the luxury market and you’re frustrated because your home isn’t selling, we have the right formula to get a sold sign in the yard and you to the closing table. The formula is simple, but it isn’t easy; you need &lt;strong&gt;the right price, the right condition, and the right marketing.&lt;/strong&gt; We can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about real estate, or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, please give a call or shoot us an email. We’d love to help!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Does Zillow Hurt Your Chances of Buying or Selling?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sAG3BlI4Jkg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sites like Zillow, Realtor.com, and Trulia can be a challenge for buyers and sellers. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that you are buying a home and looking for your dream home on these sites. If you call the listing agent, &lt;strong&gt;you will probably hear that the property has already sold.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s because there is a delay between what you see on those websites and what professional agents see. As real estate agents, we actually get a head start of up to seven days on the best properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how can you find a listing online that hasn’t already gone under contract?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do one of two things. First, you can search on a site like ours, which pulls information directly from the MLS. That way, when a home hits the market, you will know right away. The other option is to allow us to do all of the hard work for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=OUR WEBSITE PULLS INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM THE MLS.%20http://treugroupsouthflorida.com/does-zillow-hurt-your-chances-of-buying-or-selling.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“OUR WEBSITE PULLS INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM THE MLS.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few buyers we’ve worked with only viewed four homes until they found their dream home. That might not seem very impressive, but one of those buyers had been searching with another agent and on their own for two long years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are selling your home, are those websites your friends? Not really. It’s important to understand how Zillow impacts your pool of buyers. If Zillow has a wrong Zestimate or other incorrect information, it can cost you thousands of dollars. &lt;strong&gt;It may even cost you the home sale.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to understand how these sites work and competitively list your home in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Treu Group real estate, we understand how to help you buy, sell, and, most importantly, how to help you win. If you have any questions, we are here to help you. Just give us a call!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What's your Word? Discover your Word with Chris Pan from MyIntent.org.</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;no&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/326206974&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisa discussed how she met Chris Pan and discovered MyIntent.org and the power of Treu Group Real Estate’s Word. The 2017 Word is Commitment. It is a constant reminder that they will Say What needs to be said, Do whatever needs to be done and Go where they need to go to help them accomplish their clients and team goals. Chris Pan, the founder of myintent.org, shares that bracelet product that is more than just a fashion piece. Chris talked about the bracelet not as jewelry but as a reminder of one’s idea of what he/she wants more from life, what challenges he/she wants to overcome, or what is something he/she is really passionate about in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris was kind enough to offer a 20% discount code which you get by listening to the show. These are great gifts or can be used for your personal or corporate Word.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>International Interest In South Florida Is An Opportunity For You</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;no&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/325706360&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of all 50 states, Florida has the most international buyers. This means more opportunities for you! This means more potential buyers for your home and an active real estate market. Most international buyers pay cash for vacation homes, and add to the local economy when they come to visit. Understanding which countries are interested in Florida is important, and at Treu Group Real Estate we stay informed of what’s happening abroad. Our understanding of the international market helps us better navigate our local real estate markets, and help you make an informed decision when making your next big real estate transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
