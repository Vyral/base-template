        <title>9 Ways to Cut Energy Costs This Summer</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/C9wA6Pttx3Y?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to cut energy costs for the summer season, here are nine useful methods that will save you money without sacrificing comfort:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Plug any holes you may have in your house.&lt;/strong&gt; Use plastic film on any drafty windows or just replace them if you have the budget, as leaking air is one of the biggest ways energy gets sucked out of your house and costs you money. Foam and caulk any other problem areas you see, like gaps around your doors and windows and around your outlet plates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Close the shades.&lt;/strong&gt; Anything that keeps the sunshine from coming directly into your house will help lower your energy costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Keep your filters clean.&lt;/strong&gt; You should check your AC filter at least once a month to make sure it’s clean and you should be replacing it as necessary. This way your air conditioner isn’t working twice as hard to circulate cool air throughout your house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Program your thermostat.&lt;/strong&gt; If you aren’t home, you obviously don’t need it to be as cool as when you’re there, so feel free to raise the temperature a little bit. Only about half of all people actually take advantage of their programmable thermostat, which is unfortunate because it’s a cheap and effective way to reduce energy costs. Also, overhead fans can circulate and cool air a lot more cheaply than a low thermostat, so don’t forget to use them if you have them or install a couple to help keep your air just how you like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you aren’t home, you obviously don’t need it to be as cool as when you’re there.%20http://guaranteedsoldsanantonio.com/9-ways-to-cut-energy-costs-this-summer.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you aren’t home, you obviously don’t need it to be as cool as when you’re there.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Unplug, unplug, unplug.&lt;/strong&gt; Computers, TVs, mobile devices, and any other devices such as these that are plugged in can use up energy while they’re not in use. Unplug them when you don’t use them and you’re not around so they’re not drawing energy while you’re not there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Cut back on oven usage.&lt;/strong&gt; Using a grill or outdoor cooktop instead will reduce the amount of heat being generated in your house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Turn down the thermostat on your water heater.&lt;/strong&gt; Lowering the temperature from—say—130 degrees to 115 degrees can save you around $50 a year, which can add up over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Get your HVAC tuned up.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t ignore your air conditioner until something goes wrong with it, because if it malfunctions when it’s 100 degrees out in San Antonio, you’ll want someone to fix it right away, and it will probably cost you a lot of money to get that done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Upgrade your systems. &lt;/strong&gt;This means things like changing your light bulbs and replacing major appliances like your refrigerator, washer, or dryer. If and when you do, make sure you check out the energy efficiency rating of these items before you buy another so its replacement has a higher rating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about cutting summer energy costs or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in the San Antonio market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Obstacles to Buying Your First Home</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cVSzcYfoUzM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying a home is not always an easy process, and there are many obstacles that a first-time homebuyer may encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing you can do is be prepared for those obstacles. An experienced agent can help you find the right home, negotiate for you, and guide you every step of the way. However, that doesn’t mean you won’t encounter any wicked witches or flying monkeys while you’re on the yellow brick road to homeownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding a down payment. Unless you’re independently wealthy or have just won the lottery, you will probably have to get a mortgage to buy a home. VA loans are the only loans that allow you to purchase a home with no money down, and you need to be active or retired military to qualify. Most loans require some kind of down payment. The most popular loans are FHA loans and conventional loans, which require anywhere from 3% to 20% down.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obtaining a minimum FICO score. You need at least a 620 FICO score for an FHA loan, and you need a 720 score for a conventional loan with mortgage insurance. However, if your FICO score falls below that, you may still qualify for a mortgage; you will just have a higher interest rate or different requirements that you have to meet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to talk to your lender about your credit score, as online credit scores may vary. Get pre-qualified with a lender before you start looking at homes, even if you don’t plan on doing so for another six to 12 months. That way, you can identify any issues with your credit that you may need to repair and you can get some guidance from your lender to make sure that you’re doing everything you can to get the house that you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meeting lender ratios. Most lenders have a certain ratio that you have to meet. Your PITI (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) ratio for your mortgage payment cannot exceed 33% of your monthly gross income. Some lenders accept higher than that but again, that is something you need to check with your lender. For example, if you earn $5,000 a month, then the max PITI payment you could qualify for was $1,650.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your back-end ratio includes your PITI ratio with all of the debt that you pay on a monthly basis. That ratio should fall between 41% and 50%, depending on your lender and the type of loan you are looking for. If you don’t want mortgage insurance, you typically cannot exceed 41%; to qualify for a higher back-end ratio, you can put 20% down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are always exceptions to the rule, however, so make sure you work with a lender that you trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Make sure you speak with a trusted lender before you start looking at homes.%20http://guaranteedsoldsanantonio.com/5-obstacles-to-buying-your-first-home.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Make sure you speak with a trusted lender before you start looking at homes.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Receiving an appraised value. The appraisal occurs after you’ve gone under contract. Before May 1st, 2009, your lender could select their own trusted appraiser that was experienced and comfortable giving appraisals in the area. As a result, you would get a fair and balanced appraisal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a new home valuation code of conduct allows appraisal management companies to pluck an appraiser from a random pool. Your appraiser may be from another area and not know anything about the neighborhood that you’re buying in, which could result in a low appraisal. That’s tough for buyers and sellers alike, but that is the world we live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the appraisal does not come in and the seller does not adjust the price, you can walk away from the transaction, pay the difference in cash, or meet the seller in the middle. Homes often don’t appraise in our current seller’s market, as home prices continue to increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Satisfying your loan conditions. Underwriting can be frightening. An underwriter will review your file and make demands that you might not have even known about. At that point, you’ve probably already gone through your home inspection and your appraisal. When the underwriters come back with conditions and requirements, don’t get upset. They may need more documents or they may have rejected the loan for any number of reasons; they write the rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you’ve remarried but your former spouse went through a short sale or foreclosure with your name on the mortgage, you may be disqualified for your mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why it’s important to disclose everything about yourself and your finances to your lender so that the loan officer will be able to foresee any problems down the road. You can also get a full underwritten approval before you look at homes to make the whole process easier for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few of the most common obstacles first-time homebuyers may encounter. If you have any other questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>6 Tips for Buying in a Sellers Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iPvW10Oz6HQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real estate market often fluctuates, so planning for mistakes in advance is smart. It’s tough to predict whether the market will favor buyers or sellers when it’s your turn to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s a seller’s market like the one we are seeing right now, buyers can get what they want. However, they need to bring their A-game and be decisive in order to do so. Here are six common mistakes we see in a seller’s market like this and how you can avoid them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not making your best offer up front. The motivation to buy for as little money as possible is deeply ingrained in us. When buyers see a high list price, they naturally wonder if they can get a better deal. Offering less than asking price is a reasonable strategy in a buyer’s market, but it doesn’t work quite as well when there is a shortage of inventory. In fact, it doesn’t work at all. Competition is fierce, so come in with a strong opening offer if you really want to get the home.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overanalyzing the purchase price. This is ill-advised because the longer you take to make an offer, the higher the risk of losing the home you want. Once you’ve determined the type of home you want, the location you desire, and the right price range, don’t wait to make an offer. Be prepared to move quickly by having your finances in order and being pre-approved.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work with an experienced agent. A lot of people make the mistake of not doing this, and it costs them. If you have a seasoned agent on your side, they will give you a better chance of getting the home you want. In Texas, sellers pay the commissions for their agent as well as yours, so it costs you nothing out-of-pocket to have an experienced professional advising you on the best course of action to take.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Low offers won't do a thing for you in this market.%20http://guaranteedsoldsanantonio.com/6-tips-for-buying-in-sellers-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Low offers won’t do a thing for you in this market.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not being pre-approved. This is a common problem. With the market moving so fast, you’re going to lose out on a lot of great homes if you’re not pre-approved. Without that letter in hand, most agents and sellers won’t even entertain your offer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not being prepared for a bidding war. No buyers want to be involved in bidding wars, but they are inevitable in this kind of market. Start your search below your maximum budget so you have room to up your offer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not learning from your mistakes. It’s easy to get frustrated by repeatedly declined offers. Learn from prior offers and transactions so you can move into your dream home.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>5 Easily Forgettable Tasks to Complete Before Moving</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/O2I3Qm_leso?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving to a new town can be difficult. There are just so many different things to keep track of that it can get confusing. There are probably even a few things that you’ll completely forget about until the moving truck is all packed up and ready to go. Here is a list of five things you might not have thought about, but you should definitely complete before you leave:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Banks. Check to see if your bank has a branch in your new city. If they don’t, you may need to find a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medical needs. If you can, have your doctor call in your prescriptions to a pharmacy in your new town. Keep your old doctor’s number handy in case you need to contact them to forward any paperwork in the future. If you’re keeping your health insurance plan, look for doctors in your new area that accept your insurance. If you need to switch providers or update your plan, try to do it before moving.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Things to transfer. Transfer memberships from local organizations, gyms, associations, and clubs. Be aware that you may have to pay an early termination fee on some of those. Factor that into your moving costs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Raid the kitchen. About a month before moving day, start using up frozen or canned goods so you don’t have to let anything go to waste. Donate any unopened, non-perishable food to a local food pantry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Don't let the food in the freezer go to waste!%20http://guaranteedsoldsanantonio.com/5-easily-forgettable-tasks-to-complete.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Don’t let the food in the freezer go to waste!”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the car. Give it a tuneup to avoid a breakdown on the way to your new home. If you have a trusty mechanic, ask that they refer you to another one near your new home. Pack a first aid kit just to be safe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few of the things that you should do before you move. If you have any questions or want any more tips, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Will Happen If Rates Go Up?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tpszKkr5fK4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, there has been a lot of buzz about potential interest rate increases. First, they were predicted to go up last September. That didn’t happen, but they did go up in December. Nobody knows if or by how much rates will go up next time, but we do know that they will still be historically low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is widely expected that the Federal Reserve will increase rates in 2017. Even if they go up by 1% or 2%, it won’t affect our market much. There are three reasons why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mortgage rates often move independently of the Fed rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=A small increase in rates won't affect our market much.%20http://guaranteedsoldsanantonio.com/what-will-happen-if-rates-go-up.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“A small increase in rates won’t affect our market much.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any increase in rates will be small. Whether they go up by 0.25% or 0.5%, they will still be historically low.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A shortage of inventory. With a limited supply of homes out there, the Fed will keep the health of the real estate market in mind before taking any action.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the market is doing great right now and it’s likely to stay that way for the rest of the year, regardless of what happens with interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me or want to take advantage of current market conditions, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>6 Home Maintenance Tasks You Need to Do </title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/aoG9k4aKb0Y?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a homeowner, it’s important that you keep up with home maintenance. It’s especially important when you are preparing to sell your home. Here are six tasks that you should take care of today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apply a coat of fresh paint throughout the house. Fresh paint will go a long way and make your house show very well. Spiff up the walls, cabinets, doors, and trim. Make sure you eliminate scuff marks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Redo your laundry room. Take advantage of every square inch of the laundry room. Make sure the room is clean and organized so that it looks as open as possible. Don’t just leave a big pile of clothes in there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clean out your dryer vents and ducts. Not only will you take care of a dangerous fire hazard, you will also lower your utility costs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clean your refrigerator coils. Save energy and improve the longevity of your fridge’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Make sure your laundry room looks clean and open.%20http://guaranteedsoldsanantonio.com/6-home-maintenance-tasks-you-need-to-do.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Make sure your laundry room looks clean and open.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give your mattress some love. Flip the mattress, rotate it, and vacuum the coils so that the mattress is fresh and comfy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look for leaks. Inspect the roof for missing tiles and damaged vent hoops. You should also check out your foundation. If you’re not sure how to inspect your roof, take a flashlight into the attic and look for leaks. That can help you determine if you need to address any issues with the roof.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking care of these six home maintenance items will make your home more appealing to buyers. Even if you are not selling for a while, these six tasks will improve your home and make it feel fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about home maintenance or about selling your home, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Should You Invest in a Fixer-Upper?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/KfgXAhwAQ5c?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to talk a little bit about buying a fixer-upper. Is it worth it? How can you tell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you want to do when considering purchasing a fixer-upper is evaluate the price. Do your homework to make sure you can afford the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treat the remodel like it’s a business, not a hobby or a get-rich-quick scheme. Determine the after repair value, the value of the home after it’s repaired, based on the market values of the homes in your neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, start evaluating what improvements are needed. Some projects, like painting and landscaping, have more sweat equity involved and will give you more bang for your buck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get accurate estimates for professional projects such as getting a new roof or putting in new floors before you commit to buying the house. Those projects can add equity, but they can also be very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stress is a huge factor when taking on a fixer-upper, so you need to make sure you can handle it. There are hidden costs that always pop up during a remodel, so having some extra money set aside will help keep things running smoothly for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, hire an expert to help you through the process. Have someone who is familiar with fixer-uppers help you make decisions in order to stay on a clear path and stick as closely as possible to your budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about fixer-uppers or if you have any other real-estate related questions, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’m more than happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>6 Staging Tips to Help You Sell for Top Dollar</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXUXxG_Pupc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staging your home is incredibly important when selling. Today, I’ll go over six tips to help you stage your home for top dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First impressions are the only impression. It’s important that people feel warm and welcome when they approach your home. You only have one chance to make a first impression, so make sure the exterior of your home is clean and fresh for the spring market. Declutter your entryway, trim trees and bushes, and add some fresh mulch to your yard. These are cheap, easy ways to spruce up your exterior.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Always be ready for home showings. You never know when a buyer is going to walk through that door, especially since so many schedule showings at the last minute. Before you leave for work each day, make sure that all of your beds are made and that the kitchen and bathrooms are picked up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kitchens and bathrooms really do sell homes. Small updates, like new paint or hardware, can make a dated kitchen look like new. Updating to stainless steel appliances or bronze fixtures can make a huge difference to buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Depersonalize and declutter your house.%20http://guaranteedsoldsanantonio.com/6-staging-tips-to-help-you-sell-for-top.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Depersonalize and declutter your house.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take the home out of your house. That means you should remove any personal items, like personal photos. Invest in a storage unit and get rid of about a third of your stuff. Pull stuff out of your closets so that they appear half empty. The more open you can make your home, the better it will be for showings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conceal animal accessories. Not everyone likes animals in their home. If you have pets, the best rule of thumb is out of sight, out of mind. I also recommend that you get some air fresheners. You might not be able to smell your pets, but buyers will definitely detect the pet odor in your house.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hire an informed real estate agent with an aggressive marketing plan who will price your home right. Pricing and marketing are key to selling your home, and if you follow the other five tips as well, you can sell for top dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about selling your home, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 Key Home Buying Considerations</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_cF7tXHVC94?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should buyers look for in a San Antonio home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often see buyers look for homes with window dressings or modern fixtures and appliances. These are great, but it’s just as important to look at these three factors when you choose a home:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resale value. Don’t just think about the house you buy, think of it as a house you’ll have to sell in the future. Consider the neighborhood, the pricing, and the size. Buying the biggest and best house in the neighborhood could present major issues down the road when selling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure the house is structurally sound. It should have good windows, doors, floors, and roofing, and should not have water spots on the ceiling or cracks on the inside or outside walls. Look for the house that has the best ‘guts’ rather than just looking at the design. Always have a home inspection to make sure you’re not overlooking something that could be a costly headache down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cost of repairs. Plumbing, heating and cooling, roofing, and water heaters are all very costly systems to repair or replace. Make sure they’re all inspected and addressed during the inspection period of the home buying process before you’re fully committed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about the important things to look for in a home, or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in the San Antonio market, give me a call or send me an email. We’d be happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Tips for Keeping Your Home Safe While on Vacation</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EP4jGBa3A7A?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you’re relaxing on a tropical beach or strolling through a quaint European resort during your holiday vacation, thieves could be planning on invading your unoccupied home and ruining more than just the vacation. The good news is that there are five easy steps you can take to make sure that you don’t come back to an empty house:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get a Wi-Fi doorbell. Products like the SkyBell actually videotape any visitors that come to your front door and sync that video to your smartphone so you can keep a watchful eye. Not only are these devices cheap, but they are also easy to install. I would recommend buying one for your home at all times—not just during vacations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Utilize exterior lighting. A well-lit property is less likely to be an attractive target for potential intruders. Motion-activated lights that pop on whenever they detect movement are an excellent deterrent. A watchful spotlight will send any unwanted visitors scurrying.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let your (trusted) neighbors know that you’ll be gone. If those that live closest to you know that you’re away, they’ll likely monitor your home for any strange noises or unfamiliar faces skulking about and alert the police is they see any suspicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Check once, check twice, and after that, check one more time.%20http://guaranteedsoldsanantonio.com/5-tips-for-keeping-your-home-safe-while.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Check once, check twice, and after that, check one more time.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alter your mail and newspaper delivery service. You can either call your mail service provider and temporarily suspend your deliveries or ask one of your neighbors to pick them up for you as they arrive. An overflowing mailbox and a pile of newspapers are sure signs that no one is home.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Double-check that all doors and windows are locked before you leave. Statistics show that roughly 33% of all home invasions happen through an unforced entry, meaning they likely occur through an unlocked door or window. A good rule of thumb is to check once, check twice, and check one more time before you and your family depart. If you have kids, this step is especially important.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following these steps will help you rest easier while you’re away and ensure that everything is safe and sound when you come back. If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to help!&lt;/p&gt;
