        <title>Meet Yana Novikov</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wVg_l5M697E?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did I hear about Team Lally?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first heard from my cousin, Veronica Edwards, who is a buyer’s agent here on the team. Then, I did my own research and found out that it’s the No. 1 real estate team in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What motivated me to join the team?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, Team Lally is the No. 1 team in Hawaii whose team leaders are using advanced home search tools to stay ahead of the competition. They also use a home-selling device and professional expertise to provide services to our clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I love the culture here.%20http://realestatecareerhawaii.com/meet-yana-novikov.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“I love the culture here.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is my role on the team?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a buyer’s agent who works exclusively with buyers, representing them and their best interests, as well as educating them on the current market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do I enjoy most about working on the team?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the culture here. I love the constant growth and learning from the top producers to improve my negotiation skills, as well as having fun and connecting with the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me personally or are looking to buy a home, feel free to reach out to me at 808-633-2368. I’d be glad to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Listing Partner Benjy Gilholm Has to Say About Team Lally</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZznfyTxJht4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet Benjy Gilholm, one of our great agents here at Team Lally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Benjy first heard about our team, he was working at another top real estate team here in Honolulu. During that time, &lt;strong&gt;he noticed his team was referring all of their short sales over to agents on our team.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benjy took note of our good reputation and decided to make the switch. What ultimately motivated his move to our team was that he didn’t want to be a solo agent anymore. Being part of a team where you have a specific duty is something he was definitely attracted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=At Team Lally, we create great experiences.%20http://realestatecareerhawaii.com/what-listing-partner-benjy-gilholm-has-to-say-about-team-lally.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“At Team Lally, we create great experiences.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Lally has a “great team environment that is based around continuing education,”&lt;/strong&gt; says Benjy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a listing partner for our team, Benjy specializes in getting listing agreements signed and properties sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing he most enjoys about working with Team Lally is our atmosphere. According to him, “We create great experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Make Your Marketing Videos More Effective</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EvvJMJ7d0qo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to talk to you guys about video marketing and how you can use videos to leverage your overall business in the real estate industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I wanted to talk about this subject using PowerPoint slides, but to really bring the point home, I decided to make it into a video. &lt;strong&gt;The great thing about doing this on video is that I won’t get that awkward silence when I ask for questions or feedback.&lt;/strong&gt; What’s more, if someone misses something, they can go back and rewatch the part they missed or didn’t understand fully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I’ve got four tips for you, which I turned into the acronym &lt;strong&gt;SEER (Story, Educate, Entertain, and Retention)&lt;/strong&gt;. Hopefully these tips will make your video marketing more effective in your business life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there’s a lot to cover, I’ll timestamp each section so that you can learn about each one at your leisure—&lt;strong&gt;yet another awesome aspect of video!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Story (1:40)—make your videos revolve around a story.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Educate (2:34)—come from a place of education.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Entertain (3:35)—make your videos as entertaining as possible.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Retention (4:03)—edit your videos so that the audience will watch the whole thing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;7:28—hear examples of ideas I have that utilize SEER.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8:30—a note about potential compliance and legal issues that you might come across if you don’t perform your due diligence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, being in front of a camera is very awkward for me. Even though I’m uncomfortable doing it, it’s going to improve my speech, communication skills, my knowledge of the industry, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this, feel free to contact me via phone or email, or keep an eye out for my future video blog posts. Thank you all so much, and have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;
