        <title>How Do We Structure Appointments With Buyers?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SwMXOhwhbfo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, the way I would conduct myself when first meeting with buyer clients was much less structured than the way I conducted listing appointments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My listing process involved a set number of steps I would carry through, so I began to wonder why my team and I weren’t applying this same sense of structure to buyer appointments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I checked around with some of the highest producing and most innovative brokers in the country, and, sure enough, their buyer appointments were just as structured as their listing appointments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;strong&gt;from the moment we’re setting up an appointment with a buyer, we explain what they can expect from the process.&lt;/strong&gt; We let them know that we will first come together at the home, then go over the consumer notice and walk through the property, and then finish by discussing the real estate process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Thanks to this sense of structure, we’re able to build rapport, ask questions about the buyer’s goals and motivations, and solidify a professional relationship.%20http://davehookecoaching.com/how-do-we-structure-appointments-with-buyers.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Thanks to this sense of structure, we’re able to build rapport, ask questions about the buyer’s goals and motivations, and solidify a professional relationship.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the buyer confirms that they would like to proceed, we can move forward knowing everyone is on the same page. We also review what will happen during the process at the start of every appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this sense of structure, we’re able to build rapport, ask questions about the buyer’s goals and motivations, and solidify a professional relationship. Also during the appointment, we provide a packet containing mortgage information, the consumer notice, the buyer agency agreement, and what I call a buyer presentation. This last item outlines and unpacks the entire home buying process and goes into the role of a buyer’s agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The buyer presentation is about 15 pages long. It’s &lt;strong&gt;designed to help buyers understand exactly how we can advocate for them through the transaction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we ask the buyer if they understand everything we’ve gone over. If they do, we can move on to signing the buyer agency agreement and get the rest of the process underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is It Worth It To Generate Business From Online Leads?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gxXYrKpO4qE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I’ll be addressing the question of whether or not leads from Zillow and Realtor.com are worth the money we spend to try to generate business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that &lt;strong&gt;tracking is critical.&lt;/strong&gt; We have a lot of data accumulated over the last few years about all sorts of internet business and what the return on investment is like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we’ve learned is that Realtor.com and Zillow business is market-specific. The price per inquiry here at South Central Pennsylvania is going to be vastly different than the price per inquiry in another market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, due to the way Zillow is set up, &lt;strong&gt;the price per inquiry in one ZIP code may be dramatically higher than another simply due to temporary demand&lt;/strong&gt; depending on how many brokers are investing in that ZIP code. They can push the price per inquiry way up. Zillow is contract-free, so you are able to keep an eye on the price per inquiry and move your investment elsewhere if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=According to the study, it’s critically important that we respond within five minutes of the initial inquiry.%20http://davehookecoaching.com/is-it-worth-it-to-generate-business-from-online-leads.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“According to the study, it’s critically important that we respond within five minutes of the initial inquiry.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, is it ultimately worth it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It depends. We’ve gone through seasons where we’ve lost money and haven’t gotten a good ROI, and we’ve also had more positive seasons as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here was the difference: If you Google “MIT lead response study,” you’ll get a PDF file of a robust study that shows that &lt;strong&gt;whether we convert internet business leads depends highly on a few things:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. How quickly we respond.&lt;/strong&gt; According to the study, it’s critically important that we respond within five minutes of when the inquiry happens. Every minute that goes by after the initial five exponentially decreases the odds that you’ll convert that business into a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. What methods used to respond.&lt;/strong&gt; People prefer different methods of communication. It’s important to not only call that business within five minutes of the inquiry, but also shoot them a text and an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. How often we follow up.&lt;/strong&gt;If you don’t make a connection quickly, it’s important to not give up. No salesperson calls only once. Studies show that a minimum of 10 times is required in order to capitalize on the highest probability to convert that business. Those follow-ups should be made within 12 to 15 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you’ve found this information to be helpful. If you have anything to add, share, or ask about this topic, I’d love to hear from you. Feel free to reach out to me anytime.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Great Way to Increase Client Retention and Conversion</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XQs0dEX-AzE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m excited to share one simple tool with you that will help you increase your client retention and conversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on in my career, I learned a lot from a lot of different consultants and agents. I studied what they did and took classes. In one of my classes, we read a book about basic fundamental administration. It was like an executive assistant boot camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One thing I learned in that class is that there is an etiquette involved in serving people that will build their confidence and help you earn their trust very quickly. &lt;/strong&gt;Practicing this method properly results in others seeing you as a professional and having increased confidence in your abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This simple method is called “closing the loop” and it starts like this:&lt;/strong&gt; When you have an inquiry, whether it’s a phone call, text, email, etc., the very first thing you should do is message that person back and let them know you got their message and will get back to them shortly. That simple exchange builds their confidence in your ability to serve them later on down the road. It might seem silly, but it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=This process is simple but effective.%20http://davehookecoaching.com/a-great-way-to-increase-client-retention-and-conversion.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“This process is simple but effective.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you need to note that action somewhere in your calendar or wherever you keep your task list. Then, make sure you message them back the next day, whether you have an answer for them or not. If you do have an answer for them, just reach back out and let them know. If you don’t, let them know that as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once you finally have an answer for the person, send them a message with the answer and ask if they need help with anything else in order to completely “close the loop.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might sound really simple, but executive assistants across the country have mastered this skill because it shows that they are supremely competent. That’s the same kind of vibe you want to give off to your clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me about closing the loop or about anything else related to your real estate career, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2 Business-Saving Strategies That Are Better Than Multitasking</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/I0S6UDmuXbQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I almost became burnt out in my real estate career. I was working between 70 and 80 hours a week with zero time off, juggling a huge number of different tasks and responsibilities. I began to wonder, “How do higher-capacity people do it? How do they manage to juggle all these tasks?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I took it upon myself to fly out and visit various high-capacity CEOs across the country. Studying their habits changed my life. What I found out is this: &lt;strong&gt;Multitasking is a lie. There are more efficient ways to handle your work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time and time again, studies have shown that there’s no effective way to do two things at once. When people multitask, they become vastly less efficient. In fact, multitasking itself isn’t real. What’s actually going on in our brain is something called switch-tasking, which is the act of quickly shifting focus back and forth between two tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you’re switch-tasking, you’re wasting time. It takes a lot of effort for your brain to continuously refocus on different tasks. To demonstrate what I mean, there’s an experiment I’d like you to try. I want you to try saying the alphabet and counting to 26 at the same time. Before you do this, set a timer to see how long it takes you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that as you do this, the two things can’t occur simultaneously. Instead, you end up saying things like “A, one. B, two. C, three…” and so on and so forth. And &lt;strong&gt;even though each task is simple on their own, it’s easy to become confused as you try to handle both at once.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you’ve done this experiment, try timing yourself doing just one of these tasks. In terms of time spent, the difference between counting to 26 and saying the alphabet at the same time versus doing one after the other might surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, counting and saying the alphabet are both pretty simple. That being said, imagine how much more difficult it would be to perform two complex tasks at once. The point is that &lt;strong&gt;tasks are almost always completed more quickly when they are done one at a time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Managing your schedule through time blocking allows you to run your business, instead of letting your business run you.%20http://davehookecoaching.com/2-business-saving-strategies-that-are-better-than-multitasking.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Managing your schedule through time blocking allows you to run your business, instead of letting your business run you.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real estate is one of the few industries where professionals are expected to be experts in more than a dozen, separate skills.  Agents are asked to be good at negotiating, marketing, photography, showing properties, setting schedules, budgeting, accounting, administrative tasks, and much, much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being told to juggle all of these tasks, it’s no wonder that so many agents attempt to multitask. But as we’ve already seen, multitasking doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what can you do to plan your day in a way that avoids the need for multitasking? The key is using time blocking and activity chunking. &lt;strong&gt;Time blocking is the act of scheduling blocks of time for specific activities.&lt;/strong&gt;Scheduling activities a week or a month in advance can help you develop a routine. When you devote certain blocks of time to specific tasks, you ensure that everything you need to do is given adequate effort and attention. Time blocking will also leave you with vacant spaces in your day, which can be used for appointments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing your schedule through time blocking allows you to run your business, instead of letting your business run you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, certain activities must be done together. This is where activity chunking comes in. &lt;strong&gt;Activity chunking is when you put light activities together in time blocks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you block out recurring events, divide your “to-do” lists across the blocks of time you have already designated for those activities. At the end of the week, the end of the month, and the end of the year, you’ll save a ton of time by following these tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Has the Bright MLS Changed the Way We Work?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfD3PEAOTks?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How has the Bright MLS changed the way my team works?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I’d like to clarify that Bright isn’t paying me to write this blog. I just wanted to share some information about the Bright system that my team and I have learned over the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be the first to admit that when the Bright change first took place, there were a lot of kinks in the system. A lot of our properties didn’t show up on consumer sites, and some didn’t show up on my own website. Searching was also difficult; results didn’t come up the way they should have, especially in the first week or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although a lot of organizations stick their heads in the sand when they go through changes, &lt;strong&gt;I was impressed by how responsive Bright’s staff was.&lt;/strong&gt; Whenever we needed assistance or there was a technical issue, they would tell us where it was in the queue and when they expected the issue to be worked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also held private trainings at our office, and we went to Harrisburg for additional trainings. There were five or six trainings as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bright even sends daily updates about technical difficulties or where problems were in the queue. Bright was incredibly responsive, and most of the kinks have been worked out at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=With the Bright MLS, I have access to data that I couldn’t get before.%20http://davehookecoaching.com/how-has-the-bright-mls-changed-the-way-we-work.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“With the Bright MLS, I have access to data that I couldn’t get before.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve had time to learn the system and get feedback from my agents and staff, I’ve been able to see that this system has a real positive impact, and I’m extremely grateful for that. &lt;strong&gt;Here are a few important things that Bright has been able to do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) I am able to get data in areas that I wasn’t able to before. I remember often feeling stupid because a customer was able to go on Realtor.com and give me property information that I had to struggle to find in the system. Now, I can just jump on Bright and get information on a market that’s 45 minutes away. I can even get more information than the customer can, which allows me to offer them some value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) I don’t have to pay for and learn a multiple systems. Since Bright is a large, regional system, I can look in the same system, pay the same dues, and save all that time and energy that I would have spent learning a new system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) There are many useful tips and tricks that have made us more efficient and saved us a huge amount of time. For example, the web mapping search allows us to look at flood zones, public record information, and more. &lt;strong&gt;I’ve been incredibly impressed with the owner information available for properties that aren’t listed,&lt;/strong&gt; including the assessed value. There are many tips and tricks this system offers that Paragon didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am incredibly grateful to Bright and their staff for the dedication they put into the transition. I think the Bright MLS will improve my life, my team’s lives, and my client’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear any feedback or tips that you’ve discovered that impact your business. Just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What’s the Best Way to Structure a Listing Appointment?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/518sYreq21k?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the best way to structure a listing appointment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people in the office have been asking about it, and I’ve been meaning to put together a training video together for listing appointments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I can’t say I have the best way to structure a listing appointment, but over the last 15 years, I’ve been on over 1,000 of them. I’ve also learned things from other agents both inside and outside of the market. As a result, I’ve been able to put together a good, professional listing appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During the intake call, we fill out a seller information sheet.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a proven process that helps us learn the needs of the seller as well as their interests. The sheet also helps us learn a bit about their property, what improvements they’ve made to the property, and which features they are most proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, we set the listing appointment. Sometimes we do a one-step appointment, where we walk away from the initial listing appointment with the listing contract signed. Sometimes we have two separate appointments. It really depends on what the seller’s motivation is and what they are looking for from us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing we do is prepare for the appointment. We will pull all of the information from the public record that we can. If possible, we’ll pull a deed. We’ll also look at previous listing information and put together a &lt;strong&gt;listing preparation packet.&lt;/strong&gt; We also add a listing presentation manual; we have 100 of those pre-printed at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I like to make the listing appointment about what the seller can expect from the process.%20http://davehookecoaching.com/whats-the-best-way-to-structure-a-listing-appointment.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“I like to make the listing appointment about what the seller can expect from the process.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, show up at the appointment and ask if they have a kitchen table you can set your things down on. From there, walk through the house with them. This gives you the opportunity to take notes, ask questions, learn more about the seller, and make a connection with them. Remember, it’s important to be super complimentary when you are walking through the home. This is also a good time to ask them what they love most about the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the walk-through, we’ll go back to the kitchen table and review their needs one more time. That’s where the seller information sheet comes in handy; simply review the information you got on the intake call. At that point, you will go through the listing presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I like to make the listing presentation about the seller.&lt;/strong&gt;I tell them what they can expect when they list their home, what showings will look like, and how often we will provide feedback. I also go over exactly what we’ll do to market their property so they know where their home will be advertised.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, we’ll decide if we want to talk about the value of the property. If it makes sense, you can go ahead and list the property. In some cases, the property may be a bit more difficult to price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that’s the case, we’ll set a second appointment at our office. We’ll take a couple of days to run the CMA. At the second appointment, we’ll go over their home’s value. If it makes sense to list their home, we’ll go ahead and do that. If they want to wait for a while or decide to go a different direction, that’s fine too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about how we structure our listing appointments, or if you have any helpful steps to add, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Can You Do To Combat a Slow Business Period?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/p7w1JWvLwtM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the fastest way to generate immediate business if you’re in a bit of a slow season?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question is that it depends—it depends on who you talk to, what area of the world you’re in, and what season it is. Today, I have three of my own top answers that have worked for me year after year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If I do a really high-traffic open house in a great area, I’m bound to generate some quick business and connections that I can follow up with afterwards.%20http://davehookecoaching.com/what-can-you-do-to-combat-a-slow-business-period.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If I do a really high-traffic open house in a great area, I’m bound to generate some quick business and connections that I can follow up with afterwards.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Utilize your sphere of influence and trusted resources.&lt;/strong&gt; If I’m a little slow in business and can project a slow season coming up, I immediately get on the phone with past clients and people that I know and trust, check in and connect with them, and before I hang up, I ask one simple question, “I’m in a bit of a slow season, and I’m just wondering if you could think of anybody you know who might be looking to sell their home in the next six to 12 months?” If I do that consistently, I’m sure to come away with some prospects to follow up on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Prospect for expired listings.&lt;/strong&gt;There are different technologies like Vulcan 7 and RedX that offer expired data for properties that came off the market unsold. If used with consistency, you can generate some quick business. From those calls, you can generate a connection and possibly an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. High-traffic open houses.&lt;/strong&gt; If I do a really high-traffic open house in a great area, I’m bound to generate some quick business and connections that I can follow up with afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or suggestions about strategies that have worked for you when you’re in a slow season, I’d love to hear them. Just give me a call or send and email and we can go over them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Secure an Appointment With a New Potential Homebuyer</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iV56ZVFoI34?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As real estate agents, we get internet inquiries and call-ins all the time. We know that our first initiative is to serve the client the best we can and serve the customer on the other end of the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we also know that these are opportunities to get an appointment with a new potential buyer, and we want to capitalize on those opportunities while serving our listing client, if that’s applicable. If an internet inquiry or a call comes in, we usually call back within five minutes, and &lt;strong&gt;here’s a statement we use for that call that works better for us than just about any others:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hi (client name), this is (agent name) with (name of real estate company). I see you inquired about (property address) through Zillow. What questions can I answer for you about that property and do you have a time that would work for you to preview that home?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking those two questions does two things. First, it addresses the reason they inquired. Second, it opens the door for them to preview the property with you. When someone calls about a property, they typically have a question in mind, but they may not have been thinking about previewing the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, they’ll follow up with the question they called about. Assuming you have factual information, you can answer their question or say you’ll bring the property up and follow up with “As I’m bringing the property up, is there a good time that would work for you to preview this property?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The person wants the appointment, so go ahead and give it to them.%20http://davehookecoaching.com/how-to-secure-an-appointment-with-a-new-potential-homebuyer.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The person wants the appointment, so go ahead and give it to them.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restating that opens up their mind even more. More often than not, they’ll opt into that appointment. Keep in mind that after they elect to have the appointment, if they’re going to be asking opinion-based questions, you still have to do the oral consumer notice and make sure you’re explaining agency relationships. We’re always going to need to qualify that prospect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing—we’re often afraid to set the appointment because we’re putting the cart before the horse. &lt;strong&gt;Oftentimes, though, the person wants the appointment, so go ahead and give it to them.&lt;/strong&gt; After that, make sure you qualify them well, because you don’t want to waste your time, the seller’s time, or the prospect’s time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go through all the typical questions, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Are you already working with another agent?” If they say yes, make sure they get back to their agent so that agent can show them the property.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Have you looked out for or obtained financing yet?” If they haven’t obtained financing, you can simply postpone the home preview and put them in touch with a lender.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, again, start the conversation with why they called and ask if they have time to preview the home.&lt;/strong&gt; Asking those two questions in your first breath will go a long way in helping you get an appointment with every customer who calls in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any more questions about securing appointments, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to chat with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Throw a Great Client Appreciation Event</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qCLhAbv5LGA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 15 years, we’ve tried just about everything related to client appreciation events. Some of them have crashed and burned. Others have been home runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two examples of client appreciation events that have worked for us are our client appreciation cookout and our Thanksgiving pie and pumpkin roll giveaway. We throw both of these events annually and they’re definitely worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To pull off events like these, &lt;strong&gt;we break them down into five manageable steps that you can use as a guide for setting up your own client appreciation event:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Make a list of preferred attendees. We recommend this list be comprised of past clients that have remained local and your local sphere of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Most of our clients really appreciate these events and look forward to them annually.%20http://davehookecoaching.com/how-to-throw-a-great-client-appreciation-event.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Most of our clients really appreciate these events and look forward to them annually.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Contact the vendors you need to support this event and confirm the dates. For example, the client appreciation cookout typically requires a caterer and a band. The Thanksgiving pie and pumpkin roll giveaway typically requires a bakery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Have a print shop print out potential mail invite proofs. Make sure whichever you choose looks professional and has your logo on it. Also include an RSVP date on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Send the invites out to your preferred list and schedule a four- to five-hour prospecting time block so you can get on the phone and contact all of your invites personally. You can make sure they got their invite or you can just ask them if they want to RSVP right then and there. This is a critical point most agents forget about, but sometimes people just get too much mail and forget about invites like this. Attendance will be low if you don’t follow up your invites with a phone call. This is also a great opportunity to reconnect with your database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Make connects with all of your attendees at your event and enjoy your time. You’ll get about two to three hours to connect with people you won’t get a chance to connect with any other time of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When done correctly and with consistency, these events can be invaluable to your business.&lt;/strong&gt; They allow you to connect personally with people you’ve worked with in the past or those who you like and trust. Truthfully, these events also give your clients a great opportunity to make connections they otherwise wouldn’t have a chance to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of our clients really appreciate these events and look forward to them annually. If you have any other questions about this topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to chat with you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Real Estate Agents</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bcR94NoepY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the seven habits of highly effective real estate agents? According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inman.com/2017/08/01/7-habits-of-highly-effective-real-estate-agents/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stephen Covey and Brandon Doyle,&lt;/a&gt; these are the habits every agent should follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Be proactive.&lt;/strong&gt; If you spend your day reacting to everyone else’s whims, your business will run you instead of the other way around. Make sure that you have time blocks and set boundaries around your time. Be proactive about communicating with your clients so they hear from you every week, instead of waiting to touch base after a problem comes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Begin with the end in mind.&lt;/strong&gt; Create a plan for your life and your business. What do you want your life to look like 10, five, or three years from now? What about one year down the road? Figure out where you want to be and map out a strategy to meet these goals. Break that strategy down into bite-sized chunks so you don’t feel overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Communicate with clients proactively instead of waiting for a problem to arise.%20http://davehookecoaching.com/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-real-estate-agents.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Communicate with clients proactively instead of waiting for a problem to arise.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Put first things first each day.&lt;/strong&gt; There are important activities that need to be done. Since they are not urgent matters that need to be done right now, many agents tend to skip important activities like prospecting to grow their business. Spend two hours each morning getting those things accomplished before you get pulled into urgent reactive activities, like replying to emails or handling social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Think win-win.&lt;/strong&gt; Take a collaborative approach to the real estate business in general. Think how you can create a win-win situation that will benefit your client as well as the other agent and their client. If you can do that effectively transaction after transaction, it goes a long way toward making everyone happy at the settlement table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Seek to understand before being understood.&lt;/strong&gt; Empathize with people. Put yourself in their shoes. Understand their needs first. Again, it may seem like more work up front, but it goes a long way to make everything go smoother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Synergize.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if you’re not on a team, there are a lot of people around you. From title companies to attorneys to home inspectors,  you can lean on them and act as a team to make your goals and your client’s goals a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Sharpen the saw.&lt;/strong&gt; What does this mean? According to Stephen Covey, it’s important to keep learning constantly. Watch webinars, read books, and go to seminars that will further your life and your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you utilize these seven habits, you will become a highly effective agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;
