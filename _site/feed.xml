        <title>How to Choose the Correct Path in Real Estate</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/AJxecpDQnvM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hear this question at least a few different times per week: “I want to get into real estate. What should I do?” My initial response is to think about the question a little more and then get back to me. However, I want to answer the question once and for all today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to “get into” the real estate business. The first is real estate sales. That’s what we do here every day on the AJ Team. We take clients out, help them find properties, and ultimately, our job is to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;a href=”https://twitter.com/home/?status=”Most of the time, people aren’t talking about getting into the sales business.”%20http://AllenJohnsonCoaching.com/how-to-choose-the-correct-path-in-real-estate.html%20via%40” target=’_blank’ class=”pullquote”&amp;gt;““Most of the time, people aren’t talking about getting into the sales business.””&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of the highest pressure sales job you could ever think of, then add a layer of emotions on top, and multiply it by the fact that Northern Virginia is one of the craziest markets here in the U.S. I’d say that 99% of time when people say they want to get into real estate, this is not what they are talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What most people are talking about when they say they want to get into real estate is actually real estate investing. That’s the other side of the ledger. Investors take their money, put it into properties, and watch it grow over time. Traditionally, this is the way that most people are looking to “get into” the real estate business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get into real estate, start to think about which side you want to be on. When you’ve decided, we can help you get closer to achieving your goals by offering you advice and/or assistance. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Do I Need a Realtor If I Buy New Construction?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OjoyV3vvunE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people think that if they’re going to buy a new home, they should do it on their own in order to get the best deal possible. They think that maybe they will save on commission costs or get a better deal. The truth is, none of that is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, builders prefer working with teams like ours as opposed to a lone-wolf buyer. The reason why is because we have the potential to bring them multiple deals. Because of that, they give us better deals than you could typically get on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=In fact, builders prefer working with teams like ours as opposed to a lone-wolf buyer.%20http://AllenJohnsonCoaching.com/why-do-i-need-a-realtor-if-i-buy-new-construction.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“In fact, builders prefer working with teams like ours as opposed to a lone-wolf buyer.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work with several home builders, such as Ryan Homes, who are willing to give our clients better deals because they know that if they do, we will bring the next client back to get a good deal as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are thinking of buying a new home, give us a call. It doesn’t cost you a thing to work with us because our commission is covered by the builder, and we’d love to help you get into the new home you’ve been dreaming of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;
