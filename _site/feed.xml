        <title>Should I Buy a Starter Home in Today’s Market?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/J7XL1dbdwFA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question about the viability of purchasing a starter home in today’s market was recently posed to us, and it boils down to this: &lt;strong&gt;Should you invest now in a starter home or would it be more prudent to wait and save for your forever home?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s first make sure we’re talking about the same thing—among economists, the prevailing definition of a starter home is one that falls within the lower-third of the market’s valuation, unlike, say, trade-up or luxury homes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homebuyers themselves may define a starter home a little differently, though; rather than a starter home’s defining characteristic being price, &lt;strong&gt;the question that’s front and center for buyers relates to time.&lt;/strong&gt; Therefore, to a buyer, a starter home is one that they may only live in for a few years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the dilemma really lies. If you choose to purchase a starter home, the bulk of your payments in the first few years of ownership will go toward interest, which hampers your ability to build any equity in the home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The best time to buy is imminently approaching.%20http://sternteam.org/should-i-buy-a-starter-home-in-todays-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The best time to buy is imminently approaching.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, some estimates indicate that the break-even point for starter homeownership is somewhere around five to seven years. To put it simply, &lt;strong&gt;if you plan to live in the home for a short period of time, it might not make sense to buy at all.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be perfectly clear: We aren’t necessarily telling you not to buy a starter home. &lt;strong&gt;In some cases, going this route may be squarely within a buyer’s interests.&lt;/strong&gt; Staying in a home for more than five years, for example, will allow you to build savings that might otherwise go to rent and also build equity over time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also find that, with the right renovations and care, your starter home could blossom into your forever home. Alternatively, you could keep the home and rent it out at a later time if your plans change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this decision should be based on decisions and preferences specific to your situation. Let’s say, after careful consideration, you’ve decided a starter home is right for you. If that’s the case, take note: &lt;strong&gt;The best time to buy is imminently approaching.&lt;/strong&gt; Why? Per Trulia, starter home inventory sharply increases and listing prices drop in fall and winter, which translates to maximal choices at less cost to you.   &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lock In Your Interest Rate With This Great New Program</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FEtPUr3WOuY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interest rates are on an upward trajectory, but not everyone can take advantage of the low rates we have now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m joined today by &lt;strong&gt;Mandi Henriod of Intercap Lending&lt;/strong&gt;, who shared with us a great way buyers can lock in current interest rates. Let’s say rates are 5.25% now and you know you want to buy a home within the next year, but by then, the rate will likely increase to 6.25%. Intercap Lending’s new program can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Their clients can now lock in a rate for up to 120 days while shopping for a home.&lt;/strong&gt; Most lenders won’t lock in a rate without having a purchase contract, but that’s not the case with this program. Intercap Lending will be able to lock it in with no up-front fees, and they can even lock the rate on a specific property for up to 360 days (with a fee). This is a great option if you have a home under construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Most lenders won’t lock in a rate without having a purchase contract, but that’s not the case with this program.%20http://sternteam.org/lock-in-your-interest-rate-with-this-great-new-program.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Most lenders won’t lock in a rate without having a purchase contract, but that’s not the case with this program.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike any other option we’ve seen, the up-front fee is refundable at the time of funding. All of their rate-lock options allow for renegotiation if rates somehow decrease. &lt;strong&gt;They’re able to offer this on all agency loan programs, including FHA, VA, and conforming loans.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to make a move within the year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intercaplending.com/loan-officers/mandi-henriod/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;contact Mandi at Intercap Lending&lt;/a&gt; so you can lock in a low rate today. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Buy Property Through a Partnership</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_MMGjV_75vU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s always our goal to keep you educated about all things real estate so you can accomplish your buying, selling, and investment goals. Today we’ll be talking about how co-borrowers works in real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen home values increase by over 30% in the last five years, and combined with recent interest rate hikes, &lt;strong&gt;affordability has been affected—especially for first-time homebuyers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, we’re seeing more and more people purchase properties together. It makes sense: Rather than waiting to afford something on their own, they’re compounding their homeownership efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-borrowers are creating long-term partnerships of five to 10 years, even creating LLCs to spell out the terms. Others have taken title as tenants in common instead of through common joint tenancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We’re seeing more and more people purchase properties together.%20http://sternteam.org/how-to-buy-property-through-a-partnership.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We’re seeing more and more people purchase properties together.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tenancy in common imposes joint liability and several liability of tenants, &lt;strong&gt;meaning each owner can be liable for property taxes and deductions equal to the amount they paid.&lt;/strong&gt; Simply put, tenancy in common allows several people to share their interest in real property while retaining the freedoms that would be restricted through joint tenancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’d like to buy real estate but are unable to on your own, and you have a friend or family member who’s in the same boat, consider a partnership.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether you want to have a home to live in or a property to invest in, you can compound your purchasing power together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that when you’re purchasing as a partnership, both credit scores will be used. The lowest score will determine the financing ability and interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any topics you’d like us to cover in the future, have any questions, or need further information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Wasatch Front Market Update</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WF4T-zjjToU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the latest news from our Wasatch Front market as we move further along into 2019?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer that question, let’s first compare the statistics from the fourth quarter of 2018 with 2017’s fourth quarter. Home sales dropped 7% from just over 9,600 to 8,994. The average sale price, meanwhile, increased 8% to $350,000. For new construction homes, the average asking price rose a little over 8%. The average days on market for all housing types decreased 5% from 43 to 41 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With interest rates rising almost a full percentage point during that time and an exceptionally low number of starter homes available, &lt;strong&gt;first-time buyers are being squeezed pretty tightly right now. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, we have a tale of two markets. Our supply of inventory for all home types is at 5.3 months, and because a six-month supply is considered a level market, we’re close enough to that mark to be considered a level market too. However, for homes priced under $350,000, there’s just a 3.9-month supply, which is a strong seller’s market. For homes priced over $500,000, we have a 10-month supply, which is a strong buyer’s market. In other words, the higher you go in price, the more we become a buyer’s market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our market can also be described as more of a trickle-up market&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning first-time buyers dictate the rest of the market’s movement. When a first-time buyer buys a home, that seller is able to move up into the next price range. In that sense, we can see how a lack of supply impacts the higher price ranges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Slightly slower economic and demographic growth along with higher prices and interest rates will dampen demand.%20http://sternteam.org/a-wasatch-front-market-update.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Slightly slower economic and demographic growth along with higher prices and interest rates will dampen demand.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the year-over-year numbers from 2018 as a whole?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of total home sales stayed relatively flat compared to 2017. The average home price increased 9% to nearly $340,000, while the median price rose 10% to $300,000. The average market price decreased 5%. Like our fourth quarter snapshot, home prices continued to rise while affordability decreased. That being said, the supply of inventory increased from 3.19 months to 4.06 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s in store for 2019? Slightly slower economic and demographic growth along with higher prices and interest rates will dampen demand, which will mean fewer single-family home sales but more condo and townhome sales as more buyers seek affordable housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, prices are expected to rise between 5% and 7%. Single-family home sales are expected to decline 8%, while condo sales are expected to increase 7%. When you combine the two, we expect the total number of sales to drop 4%. &lt;strong&gt;With fewer expected sales but higher sale prices, it’s still a great time to sell your home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we finished the fourth quarter of 2018, the Federal Reserve was expected to increase interest rates four times this year, and there was some speculation that we could see rates rise as high as 6%. Those expectations have been tempered a bit, and we’re now expecting just one adjustment this year. &lt;strong&gt;If you’ve been holding off on buying a home due to high interest rates, it might be time to get off the fence and make a move.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking of buying or selling a home or you have any more questions about our Wasatch Front market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Guide to the Tax Benefits of Homeownership</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/IYTUbmlQdsY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick note before we begin today’s topic: We’re not tax professionals here at the Stern Team, so &lt;strong&gt;please be sure to meet with a qualified CPA for more details.&lt;/strong&gt; If you don’t know one, we’re happy to refer one whom we trust completely to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every four years, some candidate for higher political office tries to focus our attention on equalizing the tax laws and repealing the homeowner benefits, but these arguments have consistently fallen on deaf ears. Thankfully, our own local political action committee has successfully fought off and worked diligently to ensure that our legislators don’t tack on the insidious transfer fee, which gets charged to the seller or buyer at closing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of us who own homes, here’s a list of the itemized tax deductions available to the average homeowner. Every year, you’re permitted to deduct the following expenses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Taxes.&lt;/strong&gt; Real property taxes, both state and local, can be deducted. The one exception is that tax filers can deduct on Schedule A any combination of state and local property taxes, as well as income or sales taxes, but only up to a total of $10,000. Interestingly, married couples who file their own separate tax returns can only deduct up to $5,000. However, it should be noted that real estate taxes are only deductible in the year that they’re paid to the government. Thus, if in the year 2018, your lender held money in escrow for taxes due in 2019, you can’t take a deduction for these taxes when you file your 2018 tax return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mortgage lenders are required to send an annual statement to borrowers by the end of January each and every year that reflects the amount of mortgage interest in real estate taxes that the homeowners actually paid during the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Mortgage and interest.&lt;/strong&gt; Interest on mortgage loans on a first or second home is fully deductible, subject to the following limitations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acquisition loans—up to $1,000,000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home equity loans—up to $100,000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are married but file these separately, these limits are split in half. Note that for the new loans taken out after December 14, 2017, the limit on the deductible mortgage debt is reduced to $750,000. Loans in existence prior to that date are grandfathered in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must understand the concept of the acquisition loan: To qualify for such a loan, you must buy, construct, or substantially improve your home. If you refinance for more than the outstanding indebtedness, the excess amount does not qualify as an acquisition loan unless you use all of the excess to improve your home. However, any other excess may qualify as a home equity loan; if you pull out a home equity loan, you actually have to use that money to improve your house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Points.&lt;/strong&gt; Because mortgage rates are still considerably low, not too many borrowers right now are paying points. But with interest rates on the rise, this is something to attend to. When you obtain a mortgage loan in order to get a lower-rate mortgage, you would pay one or more points up front. Whether referred to as loan origination fees, premium charges, or discounts, they’re still points. Each point is essentially 1% of the amount that’s being borrowed. If you obtain a loan of $170,000, each point will cost you $1,700 and the interest rate on your loan will then be lowered. The IRS has also ruled that even if points are paid by sellers, they’re still deductible by the homebuyer. Points paid to the lender when you refinance your current mortgage are not fully deductible in the year that they’re paid; you have to allocate the amount over the entire life of the loan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, if you paid 1,700 points for a 30-year loan, each year you’re permitted to deduct only $56.66. However, when you pay off this new loan, any remaining portion of the points that you have not deducted are then deductible in full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=It should be noted that real estate taxes are only deductible in the year that they’re paid to the government.%20http://sternteam.org/a-guide-to-the-tax-benefits-of-homeownership.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“It should be noted that real estate taxes are only deductible in the year that they’re paid to the government.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, if you have any questions about these tax benefits, discuss them with your financial and legal advisors. We hope that this topic has been useful for you, and if you have any real estate questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We are happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Will I Pay Less Commission If I Find My Own Buyer?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/L8JE5uNnSF4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a misconception among many sellers out there that any commission they pay to their Realtor will be reduced if they’re able to secure a buyer on their own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the real estate transaction, the goal is to obviously find a buyer to sell the property to, but there’s much more that goes into finalizing the process. In the event that you find your own buyer, it’s oftentimes spelled out in your contract that you, nevertheless, remain beholden to pay a specific amount to your agent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this in mind, you can request a flexible commission plan.&lt;/strong&gt; If you make a point of requesting this up front, your agent may be agreeable to establishing this type of plan with you. Should you find your own buyer, this will allow for the possibility of adjustable commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is the true value you extract from your agent’s efforts? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contrary to what you might think, finding a buyer is a relatively small piece of the process for your agent.&lt;/strong&gt; Once you’ve accepted the buyer’s bid, your agent has the responsibility of doing paperwork with all other parties involved—the buyer’s agent, legal representation, and even title companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Contrary to what you might think, finding a buyer is a relatively small piece of the process for your agent.%20http://sternteam.org/will-i-pay-less-commission-if-i-find-my-own-buyer.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Contrary to what you might think, finding a buyer is a relatively small piece of the process for your agent.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before signing an agreement with an agent, take the opportunity to discuss services and commission. If you have a pre-established idea of what you’re willing to pay and it’s somewhat lower, understand that this means the scope of services your agent provides might be narrower. &lt;strong&gt;As the old adage goes: You get what you pay for. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, your agreement should detail what you’ll pay, whether or not you can cooperate with other agents, your agent’s responsibilities, the length of the contract, and whether or not you can cancel.  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Does Reduced Home Affordability Mean for You?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xW1E1v_uSy0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home affordability is shrinking rapidly, according to research by Arch Mortgage Insurance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first quarter, affordability (defined as the size of the monthly mortgage payment needed to buy a home) dropped by 5%. &lt;strong&gt;This was mainly due to the increase in mortgage rates.&lt;/strong&gt; As a consequence, more people are now stretched and taking on greater debt relative to their income. Other buyers are being pushed out of the market altogether. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=There’s no need to panic if you’re a homebuyer.%20http://sternteam.org/what-does-reduced-home-affordability-mean-for-you.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“There’s no need to panic if you’re a homebuyer.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s not all: &lt;strong&gt;Affordability is expected to drop an additional 15% to 20% by the end of the year.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s because home prices continue to rise, and the Federal Reserve is expected to ratchet up its reference interest rate, which often leads mortgage rates, two more times this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to sell, &lt;strong&gt;you won’t have a hard time finding a buyer&lt;/strong&gt;. Even with decreasing affordability, demand for homes still far outstrips supply. However, it’s certain that buyers will look to take advantage of current conditions before affordability drops further. That means that this spring and summer might see an additional rush in the real estate market. It also means that &lt;strong&gt;right now might be a very good time to list your home&lt;/strong&gt; if you’ve been thinking about selling for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you are thinking of buying a home, you might think that this news spells doom for you. However, there’s no need to panic. While affordability is dropping, it is still well above historical averages (just like current mortgage rates). In fact, Arch Mortgage Insurance estimates that &lt;strong&gt;homes are now 15% to 20% more affordable than they were in the period from 1987 to 2004.&lt;/strong&gt; When rates go up, it will affect what your monthly payments will be on a new home. From this perspective, &lt;strong&gt;it makes sense to move now in case you’ve been looking to buy before rates rise further. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s the next step?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, give us a call. We’d be happy to answer any questions you may have. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Benefits of Buying and Selling in Winter</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/922Qw5-2nGk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For today’s topic, we’re going to discuss the benefits of buying or selling in the winter. Contrary to what you might think, the passing of the summer season doesn’t necessarily equate to stagnation in the market now.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are great tax advantages to buying or selling late in the year.&lt;/strong&gt; Buyers who close escrow before year’s end will enjoy tax write-offs that they otherwise wouldn’t receive in the new year. This can result in highly significant savings for you when tax season rolls around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just buyers that reap the benefits of end-of-year moves—closing costs and home improvements are also tax deductible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ll have greater availability to services.&lt;/strong&gt; Buying in the winter can also open up greater access to resources, such as moving services, that the influx of buyers and sellers in the spring and summertime makes hard to find. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Due to a higher scarcity of buyers and sellers in the fall and winter months, closing at a realistic asking price can be most easily accomplished during this window.%20http://sternteam.org/the-benefits-of-buying-and-selling-in-winter.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Due to a higher scarcity of buyers and sellers in the fall and winter months, closing at a realistic asking price can be most easily accomplished during this window.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “off-season” is anything but.&lt;/strong&gt; Due to a higher scarcity of buyers and sellers in the winter months, closing at a realistic asking price can be most easily accomplished during this window. Coming up with a good pricing strategy is sure to make your home shine brightly over the competition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buyers will likely see an upsurge in the chances that they’ll get that home that’s within their budget, since bidding wars and homes selling above asking price are less of a factor this time of year. Competition may drop in the fall since people often consider it to be the “off-season,” but this is far from the case for a serious buyer—there seldom is a drop-off in inventory in the winter seasons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less competition and stable inventory are highly attractive to buyers. This is mutually beneficial to both buyers and sellers because it means that a seller’s agent won’t have to wade through non-serious offer after non-serious offer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, if you need to make some last-minute home improvements before it’s time to sell, contractors and subcontractors tend to be more available and more affordable with the slowing down of business that the winter brings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, please give us a call or email us with any other real estate-related needs or questions. We’d be happy to assist you however we can.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Do Deals Fall Apart?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dv1LfZl-AkU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, real estate deals don’t always make it all the way through closing. There are a number of reasons they can fall apart, and today we’d like to share five such reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The buyer and/or seller encountered pre-contract problems.&lt;/strong&gt; This includes issues like a lowball offer, an extensive list of repairs, or an appraisal problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The buyer and/or seller encountered post-contract problems.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether a buyer gets cold feet, the buyer and seller can’t agree on how to handle repairs, or a problem with financing arises, there are several different things that can kill a deal once the buyer and seller are under contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. A contingent buyer failed to sell their current home.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most common reasons a real estate deal falls through is that buyers who need to sell their current property before buying their next may be unable to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Whether for one of these reasons or as a result of something else, about one in four real estate contracts will fail.%20http://sternteam.org/why-do-deals-fall-apart.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Whether for one of these reasons or as a result of something else, about one in four real estate contracts will fail.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. The buyer was denied financing.&lt;/strong&gt; In a perfect world, every buyer out there would be going about their search with a pre-approval letter in hand, but this isn’t always the case. Financial issues on the part of the buyer are a major reason deals can fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. There were issues with the pre-settlement walkthrough.&lt;/strong&gt; Even once the closing table is in sight, last-minute problems can pop up and sink an entire deal. Liens, a previously unnoticed safety issue like mold, or an unforeseen financial hardship could all pose a threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether for one of these reasons or as a result of something else, about one in four real estate contracts will fail. And this is exactly why it’s so crucial to work with a highly experienced agent who can help you navigate the buying or selling process and avoid these common pitfalls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Watch Out For These Real Estate Scams</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_NOQnPEjzUs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be a scary world out there—though a majority of people are good and honest, some like to try taking advantage of others. The real estate market is no exception, so today we’ll be looking at the scams we want to make sure you’re aware of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Mortgage closing scam.&lt;/strong&gt; This scam has become so prevalent that the FBI estimates it’s led to over $1 billion in stolen/diverted funds in 2017 alone. It begins when a hacker gains access to a real estate agent’s email account. When it’s time to close a deal, the hacker poses as the agent and sends money-wiring instructions to the homebuyer. The truth only comes out after the buyer has already lost thousands. Never wire money without confirming the account with your title company and/or your agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Fake real estate agents.&lt;/strong&gt; Similarly to the previous scam, the scammer will impersonate someone who is legitimately involved with a deal. The hacker will often pretend to be a real estate lawyer who is associated with a sale and, at the time of closing, call or email the homebuyer with changes to the money-wiring destination. If this works, the buyer loses a lot of money. In Utah, wire fraud is happening on housing every other day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Bait and switch.&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike the first two, this scam targets sellers. It also doesn’t require any hacking or impersonation; it just needs a dishonest buyer. Here’s how it works: A buyer makes an offer above selling price and the seller happily agrees. The contract is signed, but then the buyer begins procrastinating and dragging out the process for weeks and months. In the meantime, the seller is becoming worn out emotionally in continuing to pay costs for the home. &lt;strong&gt;Finally, the buyer says they can only buy at a lower price and the desperate seller agrees.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We are proud of our guaranteed sale program.%20http://sternteam.org/watch-out-for-these-real-estate-scams.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We are proud of our guaranteed sale program.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we protect ourselves from these and similar scams?&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t send account information over email, confirm everything over a valid phone number or in person, and find an agent who you trust to represent your best interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re ever in need of an agent you can put your faith in, our doors are always open. If you’re looking to buy or sell a home, have any questions, or need more information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;
