        <title>For Any Question Big or Small: Ask Sarita</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4N7W71im4Xc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I’d like to tell you a story from my past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I was a Realtor, I had an experience as a client that I want to share with you. At that time, I remember my agent paying a lot of attention to my husband. Admittedly, I was jealous. I felt that no one was paying attention to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were moving to a new area for my husband’s job, but I had a lot of important life changes going on myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only was I adjusting to having a new baby, I was also adjusting to life in a new area. &lt;strong&gt;I had no idea where to find the best pediatrician, hair stylist, or even Chinese restaurant.&lt;/strong&gt; It was really hard not knowing my area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Even after I help you close a transaction, I am always here for you.%20localhost:4000/for-any-question-big-or-small-ask-sarita.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Even after I help you close a transaction, I am always here for you.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to now, 17 years later, and I feel very at home and connected here in Portland. We’ve lived in four homes over that time, which is one of the reasons I became an agent in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got a lot of great connections. &lt;strong&gt;In fact, my clients think of me as their own personal “Angie’s List.” I like to call it “Sarita’s List.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My clients know that they can ask me any time they need a referral for anything here in Portland. I’m happy to help you buy and sell homes, but I also want to be the first person you think of when you need a recommendation for a service, big or small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I don’t already have a connection to a resource, I will seek one out for you.&lt;/strong&gt; Even after I help you close a transaction, I am always here for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tangible Proof That Portland Is the Place to Live</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKevj8VzDFc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portland has been in the news recently in a big way. Specifically, there were a few recent articles in Forbes that I wanted to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is a list of the companies with the happiest employees. Nike, where my husband works, came in at No. 2. Keller Williams actually took the top spot! &lt;strong&gt;We’re so grateful to work for such great companies and we can definitely say that we are extremely happy to be where we are at.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=This is a great place to be in business.%20localhost:4000/tangible-proof-that-portland-is-the-place-to-live.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“This is a great place to be in business.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another article from Forbes rated Portland as the No. 1 city for business growth. This study was based on 14 different metrics, including income growth, costs, education level of the labor force, and other factors. Personally, as someone who is working here day in and day out, I see people flocking here in droves from the East Coast and other West Coast markets like San Francisco and Seattle. &lt;strong&gt;This is a great place to live, great place to invest, and a great place to be in business.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me or any real estate related needs I can assist with, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Holiday Message From Our Team to You</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mbgPRJDxK1Q?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m getting into the holiday spirit today, as you can see from my choice of headwear. I just wanted to stop by and say thank you for all your support this past year. To all my friends, clients, family, and colleagues, I’m so grateful for your business and more importantly, your friendship. We are looking forward to an even better 2018. To see my full holiday message, watch this short video.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Should You Inspect Your Home Before You List It?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kaS-kbQRieU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste present-before-paste&quot;&gt;Are pre-inspections a good idea if you’re a home seller? Not necessarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;You see, if you have the home inspected, make all the noted repairs, and then list the house, guess what’s going to happen? The buyer will also have the home inspected and pay anywhere from $500 to $1,000 for a battery of their own inspections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;When they hire an inspector, they’ll want to get their money’s worth, so you can be sure that &lt;strong&gt;they’ll find many other problems with the home&lt;/strong&gt;, because no two humans are going to find the same list of issues. While you’d think you’d be prepared by getting a pre-listing inspection, you could still be faced with many issues that come up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;Ultimately, the decision to get a pre-inspection is up to you. If you’re the type of person who prefers to have a little peace of mind that’s afforded by a pre-inspection, then by all means get one. You may find some issues you didn’t know your home had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Pre-inspections aren’t necessarily a good idea.%20localhost:4000/should-you-inspect-your-home-before-you-list-it.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Pre-inspections aren’t necessarily a good idea.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;If you’re the kind of person who wants perfection, though, there is no such thing. A buyer is still going to inspect the home on their own and find their own set of issues, and if you do choose to inspect your home and you find some issues that you choose not to take care of, you’ll be obligated to disclose those in a disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In most cases, you’re better off leaving the inspection to the buyer.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s what their due diligence period is for. In the meantime, you can work with a professional such as myself to prepare your home to sell. That’s what we’re here for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;If you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Importance of Working With a Buyer’s Agent</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ImGx6iquvTI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talk to friends and buyer clients all the time who say that they don’t want to waste my time because they’re still trying to figure out what they want in a home. My reaction to that gracious sentiment is always the same. You’re not wasting my time. &lt;strong&gt;In fact, if we visit a home and you don’t like it, that’s the opposite of a waste of our time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, it’s my job to help you. To do that to the best of my ability, I need to understand exactly what you’re looking for. The more homes we look at, whether you like them or not, the better idea I’ll have of what you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Not working with a buyer’s agent leaves you vulnerable.%20localhost:4000/the-importance-of-working-with-a-buyers-agent.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Not working with a buyer’s agent leaves you vulnerable.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative to working with a buyer’s agent isn’t that great. By going to a home and only working with the listing agent, you’re not helping anybody (except for maybe the seller).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A buyer’s agent does much more than just show a home.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s why it’s important to work with one every step of the way. Not only can we help you find the perfect home, we can help you write a contract and negotiate the best terms on the sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for us about buyer’s agents, seller’s agents, or anything else about real estate, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Are You Asking Agents the Right Questions?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4j2-sEdZLsY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’d like to go over the five things you need to ask when interviewing a potential listing agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How long have they been in business?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What experience do they have in your neighborhood?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How are they going to price your home?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is their marketing strategy?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do they have a team? If they’re an individual agent, how will they cover all the tasks?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selling homes is a complex job. &lt;strong&gt;This is one instance where numbers really do matter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following example is one way I like to explain what I mean by this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you needed to get your appendix out. Who would you trust? Would you trust a surgeon who successfully performed 150 appendectomies a year? Or, would you trust a surgeon who only did one or two per year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The only real way to determine which agent will provide you with the best service is by asking key questions.%20localhost:4000/are-you-asking-agents-the-right-questions.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The only real way to determine which agent will provide you with the best service is by asking key questions.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is obvious, and this is the same way you should approach your real estate needs. &lt;strong&gt;Someone like myself who sells 150 homes per year and other agents who sell far less may have close to the same commission rate.&lt;/strong&gt; So, the only real way to determine which agent will provide you with the best service is by asking key questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An agent should be able to show you their experience and results. You need proof of their success and references to confirm their claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Inspection Process Is All About Give and Take</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/r9HUH3M3DYw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s topic is one that is near and dear to my heart: inspections. This subject is loaded with expectations. For right now, I’d like to cover it from the buyer’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When buyers move forward with purchasing a home, it’s very exciting. Then the inspection comes and the buyer is given a 53-page report detailing everything wrong with the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that inspections have a two-fold purpose. The first objective is to find anything that needs to be repaired in the property. The second objective is &lt;strong&gt;to understand the condition of the house and how to operate systems and appliances within it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inspector not only finds things that are wrong, they also educate the buyer on the home. After the inspection, the honeymoon period of home buying is pretty much over. When buyers get the inspection report, &lt;strong&gt;their rose-colored glasses usually come off and they start to feel nervous about their decision.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=With the right person by your side, inspections don’t need to be scary.%20localhost:4000/the-inspection-process-is-all-about-give-and-take.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“With the right person by your side, inspections don’t need to be scary.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once buyers know what’s wrong, they may start thinking about what they can realistically expect the seller to take care of. The level to which a seller might comply with these expectations can really vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a home has been sitting on the market for a while, a seller might be more willing to take care of more items. Ultimately, it’s all about negotiation. &lt;strong&gt;Buyers and their agents can ask for repairs, but should know that the seller doesn’t have to agree.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the seller doesn’t agree to fix something, the buyer may terminate the contract and receive a refund. The important thing is to know that you can’t force the seller’s hand. They may have a backup offer in their pocket. It’s important to weigh your options before pulling out of a deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inspection could scare you, but the right agent is going to be able to tell you what is normal and what isn’t. Agents like myself will also be able to provide you with access to a large network of quality vendors who can help. With the right person by your side, inspections don’t need to be scary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How a Home's 4 L’s Will Tell You Whether It's the Right Fit for You</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ramSfy3aMo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are a home’s four “L’s?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get to that, I’d like to go over something I often ask my buyers to think about. When I sit down with clients, I like to ask them what their “must-haves” and “would-be-nices” are. &lt;strong&gt;Must-haves are non-negotiable items, like the number of bedrooms or bathrooms they want in a home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would-be-nices are items like hardwood flooring, or other negotiable features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the four L’s I mentioned earlier come in. The four L’s of a home are features of a home that can’t be changed, which are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Lot.&lt;/strong&gt; This constitutes the yard or parcel of the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Location.&lt;/strong&gt; This particular point is a very important aspect of real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Focusing on these four L’s will make the most difference in finding your dream home.%20localhost:4000/how-a-homes-4-ls-will-tell-you-whether-its-the-right-fit-for-you.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Focusing on these four L’s will make the most difference in finding your dream home.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Layout.&lt;/strong&gt; This refers to the floor plan. You can technically change this, but doing so is very expensive. If you’re spending a ton of money changing a home’s layout, you may as well just buy a different home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Light.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m not talking about chandeliers or other fixtures, I’m referring to the natural light that is let into the home. For example, a home on a wooded lot is going to tend to be very dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other features like granite countertops, hardwood flooring, or a particular style of cabinets are much more easily changed than these four L’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I will certainly take all of your specifications in mind when looking for your dream home, focusing on these four L’s will make the most difference in choosing the right house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2 Reasons to Get Pre-Approved Before You Look at Homes</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/czTDIdRDY2Y?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many buyers call me feeling excited to get out there and start looking at homes. However, I do recommend that you talk to a lender first, because it’s important to get pre-approved before you begin your home search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First of all, getting pre-approved lets you know what your price range is.&lt;/strong&gt;There’s nothing worse than looking at homes in a higher price range and finding out that you can’t afford them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like test-driving a Lexus only to be told that your budget will only allow you to buy a Camry. Nothing against the Camry, but it can be difficult to get excited about buying one after you’ve seen what the Lexus can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it’s hard to look at homes in a higher price range and then adjust your expectations for the price range you can afford. You will be disappointed with the homes in your price range after you’ve seen other ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Getting pre-approved lets you know what price range you should look in.%20localhost:4000/2-reasons-to-get-pre-approved-before-you-look-at-homes.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Getting pre-approved lets you know what price range you should look in.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, you may get pre-approved for a higher-priced home and decide that you would prefer not to spend that much. In other words, you may be able to afford a Lexus but decide to stick with a Camry instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what, it’s really important to know your numbers, and the pre-approval will tell you exactly what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, getting pre-approved before you start looking at homes makes you more competitive as a buyer. You might find the home you want only to discover that there is an offer deadline. You may also end up competing against multiple offers or cash buyers. &lt;strong&gt;The pre-approval letter helps you compete with those buyers.&lt;/strong&gt; It shows the seller that you have talked to a lender who has verified your income, credit, and assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do find the house of your dreams, a pre-approval letter allows you to make an offer in a timely fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, before you start looking at homes, make sure that you talk to a great lender and get pre-approved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about getting pre-approved or would like me to put you in touch with one of my trusted lender partners, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Right-Pricing Is Essential</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/diE3UVM0ADM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people ask me, “What’s the best pricing strategy? Should I just price the home a little high so we can leave room to negotiate?” That strategy may work in certain markets, but not in this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The most important thing when selling your home in this market is setting the right price.&lt;/strong&gt;To do this, we take a look at other properties that have recently sold and are similar to yours. We compare things like the square footage and home additions/improvements to get the right price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Overpriced homes don’t sell.%20localhost:4000/why-right-pricing-is-essential.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Overpriced homes don’t sell.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you overprice a home in this market, the listing will simply sit there because people will see better value in other homes that aren’t priced as high. After a while, the home will sit on the market because buyers will start to get a sense that there’s something wrong with it. Even if you reduce the price, the days on market will be a red flag for buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it’s virtually impossible to underprice a home in our market. If you underprice a home, the market will determine that it’s an amazing deal. &lt;strong&gt;The market typically responds with multiple offers, sometimes even with bidding wars.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about pricing strategies or anything else related to real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
