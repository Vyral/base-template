        <title>How Do You Know When It's Time to Talk to a Realtor?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/IRyVhShwWu4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to sell your house, when should you contact a real estate agent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as possible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re nine months out from selling your house, you want to contact a professional Realtor like myself as soon as possible. &lt;strong&gt;We can come to your home and tell you what needs to be updated, what you should keep in the house, and the things you should take out of the house to prepare it for the market.&lt;/strong&gt; This will help you get the most money you can from your home sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other reason to contact a Realtor early is that we want to keep the buyers in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Your home's online presence plays a key role in your success.%20localhost:5000/how-do-you-know-when-its-time-to-talk-to-a-realtor.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Your home’s online presence plays a key role in your success.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How will buyers look at your house? We know that 96% of all buyers look at homes online in the convenience of their own home or office to decide what they want to go see in person. Your home’s online presence will determine whether a buyer wants to come see it in person. We want to come up with a list of things we can do to make your house look as perfect as possible on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both your goal and our goal is the same—to get the most money possible for your house, and this list will help you do just that. If you’ve lived in the house for 35 years, this could take some time, so you want to reach out to us as soon as you know you are selling your home. It’ll maximize your sale and minimize the time and money you put into the house in order to sell it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions for me or you’re ready to speak with a Realtor about selling your house, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Inadequate Inventory Driving Prices Up</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Gresh.1.05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;The latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nar.realtor/news-releases/2016/12/existing-home-sales-forge-ahead-in-november&quot;&gt;Existing Home Sales Report&lt;/a&gt; from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) revealed a direct correlation between a lack of inventory and rising prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all familiar with the concept of supply and demand. As the demand for an item increases the supply of that same item goes down, driving prices up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Year-over-year inventory levels have dropped each of the last 18 months, as inventory now stands at a 4.0-month supply, well below the 6.0-month supply needed for a ‘normal’ market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The median price of homes sold in November (the latest data available) was $234,900, up 6.8% from last year and marking the 57th consecutive month with year-over-year gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NAR’s Chief Economist, Lawrence Yun had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Existing housing supply at the beginning of the year was inadequate and is now even worse heading into 2017. Rental units are also seeing this shortage. As a result, both home prices and rents continue to far outstrip incomes in much of the country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is good news about rising prices. More and more homeowners are recovering from a negative equity situation and learning that they are able to sell their homes and either move up to their dream home or downsize to a property that will better suit their needs. Look for these homes to come to market soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bottom-line&quot;&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buyer demand continues to outpace the supply of homes for sale. Listing your home in the winter attracts &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.simplifyingthemarket.com/en/2016/12/07/selling-in-the-winter-attracts-serious-buyers/?a=226943-26c8d141bf39a1b9a34cc58e335aca2f&quot;&gt;serious buyers&lt;/a&gt; who are looking to close the transaction quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Really Matters in Your McLean House Hunt?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5CJ-3jkRPs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see a wide range of buyers, from those who want homes of a very specific size, style and architectural design, to buyers who simply want four walls, a roof, and electricity for their next home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most clients are somewhere in the middle - they’re looking for a home that looks good and has most of the features they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably looked at houses and checked off a few boxes, making sure it has the number of bedrooms and bathrooms you want, but have you ever looked at a home and really thought, “Is this house right for me?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not many do. That’s why I wanted to share a Consumer Reports video with you that I recently found. It’s a nice checklist to go through in order to make sure the home you’re considering actually fits you and your lifestyle. Here are my favorite items:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Communicate with people at the local coffee shop or any place where locals hang out. Simply ask their thoughts on the area.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can tell a lot about the sense of community in a neighborhood based on the sidewalks and porches. Seriously!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proximity to places and amenities you frequent shouldn’t be overlooked. Do you want to be close to restaurants and shops, the airport, or parks and trails?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mortgage cost shouldn’t be the only factor when considering affordability. Look at transportation and utility costs too, for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, the average McLean homeowner will stay in their home for about nine years. Don’t ignore the important checklist items when considering the place you’ll call home for nearly a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this example is pretty broad. Each family has its own unique situation and its own unique checklist. I’d love to sit down with you and use my experience to help you come up with that all-important checklist of your own to help find the right home for you. Give me a call or send me an email and let’s talk soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Avoid the Biggest Remodeling Mistakes</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fioLohO9avc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently came across a great video from Consumer Reports about home updates and remodels that I just had to share with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that some of the best upgrades to add value to your home are actually some of the smallest ones? Big changes like a new addition won’t always make you all of your money back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video is all about seeking the help of professionals when you want to make updates, repairs, or remodels on your home. If you’ve been in your house for more than a few years, odds are that the value of your house could improve with some upgrading or remodeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it doesn’t always have to be expensive, but it’s important that you do it right. In this market, there is a lot of money to be made with the right upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you want to make your home more valuable because you’re thinking about selling and want to get top dollar, or you just want to add to future resale value, it’s important to avoid falling into a money pit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by figuring out what you want to accomplish. For most people, that starts with finding out the value of their home at this time. That will go a long way in determining what kind of investment you should make in order to maximize the value of your home for the least amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an accurate idea of your home’s value, use our free home market analysis tool. Send info like the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, along with a few photos of your home - especially the important rooms like the kitchen and master bedroom - and we can quite accurately predict your home’s selling price, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The estimate won’t be perfect, but it will be extremely close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can recommend upgrades or remodels that will bring you the best return on every dollar. As the Consumer Reports video shows, a survey of 300 contractors revealed that homeowners changing their minds in the middle of a job can increase costs by 10%!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, don’t waste your time with a contractor who isn’t licensed. Accredited contractors are better at keeping the cost to you down when you come across budget overruns. Since many hidden costs come from unseen structural problems, a pre-inspection may be your best bet to help you find out what you’re getting yourself into with a big project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we see that their survey showed that many contractors are, in fact, willing to haggle on an estimate. Your odds are better if you’re a repeat customer or are having work done on multiple rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the full video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fioLohO9avc&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an expert in the Northern Virginia market, I can also help you pinpoint areas of your home that will maximize your return when it comes to upgrades and remodels. I know exactly what buyers in the area want and can tell you exactly where your money is best spent to get the most out of your home. Send me an email, give me a call, or check out our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.simplyyourbestmove.com/sell/&quot;&gt;free home market analysis tool&lt;/a&gt; to get the conversation started.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A New Review Website We Recommend</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/V_Rz2O_g-ro&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our commitment to customer service, we wanted to share with you a website we found that we think could be a great resource for any consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reviews.com&quot;&gt;www.reviews.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What they do on this site is review various products and industries, and they state that it’s unbiased research. We like that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found reviews.com when looking at homeowner’s insurance. They did a review of 99 homeowners insurance companies and used the industry’s own rating standards to rank these companies. We think it’s a value to you as anyone buying or renting a home who is looking for homeowner’s insurance, HO6 insurance, or renter’s insurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more about homeowner’s insurance specifically, check out this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of your real estate needs from buying to selling please feel free to reach out with any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is Waiting to Buy or Sell a Good Idea?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4bO2L6w9bN0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question I am often asked by buyers and sellers is, “Should I wait until next year to buy or sell my home?” It’s a difficult question to answer, and if I knew the future, I’d be the first one to tell you exactly what to do. What I do know, however, is that there is a cost to waiting to buy a property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have no idea where interest rates are going to go, but we do know that right now they are the lowest they’ve been in a long time. We are currently on the back-end of an 8-year increase in home prices, but we’ve never seen a 9- or 10-year period of increases in history. At some point, the market is going to flatten out, and so are home prices. Another sign of an impending market slowdown is the fact that our average days on market is up. More units are being sold, but they are taking longer to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking about buying, you’ve got to do so before rates go up and if you’ve been thinking about selling, now is the time to get your home on the market. Prices are going to flatten out and rates are going to go up. You want to be ahead of that curve. If you’re thinking about making a move, I would be happy to have a conversation with you where we can talk about the options you have right now, and why they are only going to get worse in the future. Just give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why You Should Own, Not Rent</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/q6BPh8e_UUk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we’ll address why it’s better to own rather than rent in Northern Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is, you have to live somewhere. You’re either submitting a monthly payment to a landlord or paying off a mortgage every month. It’s far better to pay off your own mortgage than someone else’s!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mortgage allows a tax deduction, and that savings is huge for you! Whenever I help a first-time home buyer, they’re always shocked and delighted to see the tax savings by deducting mortgage interest. It’s incredibly rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title> The Latest News on Interest Rates for Northern Virginia</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/soR-smR7Gq0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, interest rates are still historically low. Many economic experts predicted interest rates would increase steadily through 2016. However, due to the combination of volatile economic reports and our falling stock market, we’ve actually seen interest rates decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one really knows what will happen next. What we do know is that rates are the lowest they have been since April of 2015. Many of the experts in the industry still expect interest rates will rise throughout 2016, but nobody knows for sure. Not the National Association of Realtors, nor Fannie Mae, nor Freddie Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you need to know is that rates are incredibly low. Read more about it in this article here. If you’ve been thinking about buying or selling, now is the time to take action. If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;
