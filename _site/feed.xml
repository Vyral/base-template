&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have another mastermind coming up and we’d love for you to join us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we wanted to talk to you about the power of the mastermind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Napoleon Hill calls the mastermind the key that will open the door to your desires—whatever they may be. He defines it as two or more people that work in perfect harmony for the attainment of a definite purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are holding a mastermind session in our Kapolei Business Center like we do every month on the last Friday from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. The agenda is always filled with topics that will bring you success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mastermind will feature Mr. William, a professional voice coach. &lt;strong&gt;He will teach you how to improve your ability to communicate with clients and loved ones.&lt;/strong&gt; This will bring you more clients and improve your relationships. Become a trained speaker whether one-on-one or to a group. His most important points are power, confidence, and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Miranda Helps Your Real Estate Transaction Run Smoothly</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8-86eYOstng?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today we’d like you to meet Miranda, one of our inside sales agents. Her job is to guide buyers and listing agents to any resources or information they need.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we wanted to introduce you to Miranda Haws, one of our beloved inside sales agents here at Team Lally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miranda heard about Team Lally from the radio and also by seeing our yard signs throughout the community. She was motivated to join us after hearing about our success as the No. 1 team in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I had to come and see what all the rave was about,” she says. “It turned out that Adrienne and Attilio are just really down-to-earth people. &lt;strong&gt;They care about the team and they care about their business.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=HER FAVORITE PART OF THE JOB IS THE COLLABORATION EVERYONE BRINGS TO THE TABLE.%20localhost:4000/how-miranda-helps-your-real-estate.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“HER FAVORITE PART OF THE JOB IS THE COLLABORATION EVERYONE BRINGS TO THE TABLE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an inside sales agent, Miranda works hand-in-hand with buyers and listing agents to help guide our clients to the best resources and all the information they desire. Her favorite part of the job is the collaboration everyone brings to the table from their many years of experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Any time there’s a problem or conflict that comes up, we can all work together to figure it out,” Miranda says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for Miranda or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home here in Hawaii, you can always give us a call or send us an email. We’re here to help!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Strategic Driven Business Is How We Did $82 Million Last Year </title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DH-dz1YGUgY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have you thought about starting a career in real estate? Here’s how to approach it to set yourself up for a prosperous career.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we want to talk for a minute about a career in real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People always ask how the market is and whether now is a good time to get into real estate. &lt;strong&gt;A common misconception is that the answer depends on what kind of market we’re in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we have learned from being in real estate for more than 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not what the market conditions are, but whether you have the right strategies for success.&lt;/strong&gt; How do we know this? We had a phenomenal year during the worst real estate bubble in history. We did a ton of short sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=WE ADJUST TO THE MARKET WE’RE IN TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF SUCCESS.%20localhost:4000/a-strategic-driven-business-is-how-we.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“WE ADJUST TO THE MARKET WE’RE IN TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF SUCCESS.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is an example of having the right strategy—we adjusted for the market we were in. In fact, we have been able to grow strategically year over year for the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have what we call a strategically driven business, and not an economically driven business. The difference? Our business does not go up and down with the economy, but rises upward with strategic growth. How do we do that? Come to one of our Career Nights or check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jointeamlally.com/&quot;&gt;JoinTeamLally.com&lt;/a&gt; to learn more. We’d love to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks and Aloha!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Did Benjy Gilholm Join Our Team?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/IzVq5VcszEk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benjy Gilholm is a great listing partner on our team.
Hear from the man himself about how he came to join our team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited to introduce another great member of our team. Benjy Gilholm is a listing partner with Team Lally and he is going to talk about what led him to us today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benjy had actually heard about us first in 2008 when he was working for a different team.&lt;/strong&gt; His team referred all their short sales to us. The first thing that attracted him to us was the fact that we did a good job with those referrals and had a stellar reputation for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Benjy’s number one goal is taking care of his clients.%20localhost:4000/why-did-benjy-gilholm-join-our-team.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Benjy’s number one goal is taking care of his clients.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that gave Benjy the fire to actually join our team was listening to our Sunday morning radio show. Benjy joined us as a listing partner because he loves getting on the phone, getting people into properties, and helping sellers list their homes successfully. His number one goal is always to take care of his clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benjy loves the team environment and the fact that the process of joining our team was so competitive.&lt;/strong&gt; He looks forward to closing 180 homes this year and continuing his success in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for Benjy or if you’re looking to get your home on the market, give him a call at (808)-647-0002. If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out. Talk to you soon!&lt;/p&gt;
