        <title>What’s a “Playbook” and Why Should Every Agent Have One?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/a34ifuY-Ya4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ve probably heard the term “playbook” recently and you may not be sure what it means. Here’s what you need to know.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What in the world is a “playbook” in the real estate world and why is everyone talking about it all the time? I was recently at a Mastermind, and it was definitely the buzzword of the event, so I figured I’d quickly touch on the value and power of having a playbook for your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A playbook is just a fancy name for a plan. You are going to document all of the events and marketing that you’ll do in your business to make sure that you are getting in all the proper touches to your database. They include all of your digital touches, marketing pieces involved in events, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Our playbook is in an Excel spreadsheet.%20https://realestateintherealworld.com/whats-a-playbook-and-why-should-every-agent-have-one.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Our playbook is in an Excel spreadsheet.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your playbook has three main purposes: It’s a plan, it allows you to budget, and it holds you accountable. You make your plan based on your goals, and in order to achieve those goals, you need accountability behind them. At the end of the day, you have to be able to afford the plan and it has to produce a return on your investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many teams and agents have a playbook. We do too. It’s on an Excel spreadsheet, where we can always see what’s coming up on our timeline to stay ahead of the curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d be happy to share our playbook with you if you’re interested in seeing what one looks like. If you want to take a look or if you have any other questions, feel free to reach out as well. I’d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Showing/Open House Partners</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RcftdUyb9Do?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Having showing and open house partners is a great way to better leverage your time as an agent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As busy as we agents can get, we sometimes need help showing to buyer clients and hosting open houses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s why my team and I came up with the idea of having showing and open house partners&lt;/strong&gt;—so we can leverage our time better and help our clients at the highest level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does it work? We work with agents who agree to our standards and expectations of working with people. Communication is key when working with these agents. We have a plan and agreement in place, and we make sure they communicate with us as soon as the open house or showing ends so we can update our clients and make sure they’re taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Communication is key when working with these agents%20https://realestateintherealworld.com/showingopen-house-partners.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Communication is key when working with these agents”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are pros and cons to this system.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the pros is that we’re able to help our clients faster. One of the cons is that we’re the ones who have to make sure that our clients’ expectations are met. This system is risk-free in terms of bringing people into your world and onto your team, but you don’t have 100% control over how they work in the field when dealing with clients. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that, by doing this, our agents can serve more clients and our clients are better taken care of—that’s what matters to us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about showing and open house partners or if there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Importance of Setting Expectations in Your Real Estate Career</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/IfUTojuH_98?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Setting expectations on your team is critical, and today I’ll discuss why.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any business, setting expectations is key—and this is especially true when you’re part of a real estate team. After all, &lt;strong&gt;the mutual success of everyone on that team depends on clear communication about the goals and strategies everyone holds.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s why, today, I’d like to share what I expect of the people who work with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally speaking, I’ve recently done a lot of reflection on how my teammates can win and lose with me, and have found that both of these things are closely tied to Keller Williams’ Six Personal Perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=There are occasionally things that fall outside of anyone’s control, but the point is to always own up to the things you can control.%20https://realestateintherealworld.com/the-importance-of-setting-expectations-in-your-real-estate-career.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“There are occasionally things that fall outside of anyone’s control, but the point is to always own up to the things you can control.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, &lt;strong&gt;victim language always rubs me the wrong way.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a deep-rooted pet peeve of mine to hear people blaming external influences on their personal success. On the flip side, I’m always happy to work and grow with people who hold themselves accountable. It’s all a matter of mindset. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are occasionally things that fall outside of anyone’s control, but the point is to always own up to the things you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; control. That’s how you win with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you focus on what matters, admit accountability, and do what it takes to move yourself forward, it will be much easier for us to communicate effectively. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any questions or would like more information about setting expectations or effective communication, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tips for Hosting a Pie Day Event</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBeMWwCwNFE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it’s getting a little chilly here in Tulsa, which gets us in the mood for planning our annual pie event. A lot goes into this event, so &lt;strong&gt;today I wanted to take you through it step by step to show you all the systems, checklists, and everything else we do for our Pie Day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our third annual Pie Day. The first one was pretty small. We only invited the clients we had helped buy or sell a home to test it out. Last year, we gave out over 100 pies to our raving fans who share referrals and introductions with us regularly. &lt;strong&gt;This year, we’re opening it up to our entire database and we’re very excited.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To plan your own Pie Day, you’ll first need to pick a date. We’ve been having the best luck with the Sunday on the week before Thanksgiving. &lt;strong&gt;This year, that’s Sunday, November 24.&lt;/strong&gt; On a Sunday afternoon, most people are free to swing by and pick up a free pie. Then you’re going to have a cute little sticker or some other kind of swag, which they’ll take to their Thanksgiving where you get to be the hero with the pie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, make sure you pick a location. We’ve had ours at a local bakery and our local market center. This year, we’re actually doing it at a local caterer who happens to be my sister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ll need to set up an Eventbrite link in order for people to RSVP.&lt;/strong&gt; We usually just serve the pies on a first-come, first-serve basis instead of having them reserve a specific type of pie. We usually get our pies at Costco for a great price and a great pie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Make sure you’re posting about the event on social media, too!%20https://realestateintherealworld.com/tips-for-hosting-a-pie-day-event.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Make sure you’re posting about the event on social media, too!”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love giving back to our community, so we attach a non-profit to our event. Maybe your local Food Bank, or another great organization relating to the holiday needs of others. &lt;strong&gt;You can incorporate creating a video with the non-profit and share about all the good they are doing in the community.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year we are also adding in a Reverse BOLD 100 with a Thanksgiving meal giveaway, as we launch the Pie Day event. We’re asking for people to call in on a certain day to provide their contact information and they will be entered to win the drawing and also get a free pie!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another video or email you might send out would be an announcement about the event. We typically send a postcard as well to all the people in our MET database. Then we call to confirm with those people on one day and another call the day after the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Pie Day theme this year is Fall Festival, so we’ll have some hot cider, cookies, and more for people when they come pick up their pies.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a family affair! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final note is to make sure you have a cutoff day for RSVPs so you can get the final number for the pies. Make sure you’re posting about the event on social media along the way, too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me about our Pie Day or about how you should be planning your own, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why You Should Always Have a Yearly Business Plan Meeting</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TwRhhxyRs0w?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the beginning of the fourth quarter, and 2020 is right around the corner. We’re going to keep focused for the rest of this year, stick with our lead generation, and stay optimistic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People often ask me what the agenda is for our goal planning event. First, you need to have a meeting in October or November to plan for the next year, but October is best. Whether you’re a single agent or a big team, everyone needs to get together and plan for the coming year. This may take an entire day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of our agenda items are the same each year. &lt;strong&gt;You should run this like an official meeting;&lt;/strong&gt; have lender partners or title company friends come, bring in lunch or breakfast, and build in some fun and community. The team needs to know this is a business meeting, cell phones should be turned off, and everyone should display full focus. Our own meeting always starts with breakfast and an ice breaker to have some fun with the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Whether you’re a single agent or a big team, everyone needs to get together and plan for the coming year.%20https://realestateintherealworld.com/why-you-should-always-have-a-yearly-business-plan-meeting.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Whether you’re a single agent or a big team, everyone needs to get together and plan for the coming year.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s critical to reflect on the goals we set for this year. What were our goals, how did we do, where are we in relation to those goals, and what were our missteps? We will check our “GPS,” which stands for goals, priorities, and strategies. Where did we blunder, what can we get better at, what can we tweak? By setting these goals you can detect any gaps. &lt;strong&gt;Everyone should agree on what the team’s standards are. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should end the day with some kind of fun, maybe a happy hour out or a teambuilding activity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you do to have an amazing planning day for next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or would like to speak to me, please call or send me an email, I would love to help.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Story That Highlights the Importance of Keeping a Clean Database</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2OXDsfapdX8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to talk to you about an “aha moment” my team and I recently had concerning our database. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many of you might remember, a few years back I decided to spend some serious time on my team’s database—cleaning it up, properly tagging contacts, etc. The end product was a cleaned-up ‘Met’ database comprised of 1,200 of our past clients, friends, family, colleagues, and people we know in the community or have had a real estate-related conversation with. For our Met database, we use a higher-level touch system than we would for databases containing contacts we’ve received minimal information from.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That aside, let’s talk about the aforementioned aha moment: &lt;strong&gt;At the start of football season every year, we send out a football-themed magnet to our clients.&lt;/strong&gt; Football matters a lot to us Oklahomans. To give our clients a heads up that their magnet is on the way, we film a fun video that goes to Facebook and to our database. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, once we know all the magnets are out, we’ll go a step further and call each of our contacts to check that theirs came and to ask which team they cheer for on Saturdays. We make sure to weave our call to action into the conversation as well by expressing our team’s goals and asking the client if they know of anyone who may need help buying, selling, or investing in real estate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=As I’ve learned from this experience, you should never stop learning new things and refining your skills in this business.%20https://realestateintherealworld.com/a-story-that-highlights-the-importance-of-keeping-a-clean-database.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“As I’ve learned from this experience, you should never stop learning new things and refining your skills in this business.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sent this year’s magnets out last year and, as you can tell, a lot of them came back as return to sender—40, in fact. I then blocked off some time to determine where those 40 people moved, why they moved, and why we weren’t able to help them move. &lt;strong&gt;Probing a little deeper provided much-needed clarity and gave us a chance to clean up our database even further.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that situation, we learned a valuable lesson: Although our touch system already included mailing various items to our clients year-round, we weren’t always springing for first-class mail. Getting 40 magnets returned to us was a wake-up call for us to start spending a little extra on our mailing method, so we can stay on top of our database. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I also used this as an opportunity to send an email out to our entire database&lt;/strong&gt; (Met database and all), letting them know we had some leftover magnets and that if they replied back with their home address, we’d gift one to them just in time for football season. A handful of clients have already replied back with their home address, which means we can now move them over to our ‘Met’ database! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve learned from this experience, you should never stop learning new things and refining your skills in this business. What might seem like a waste of money at first can turn out to be a win if you get a little creative.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or would like more tips for improving and tweaking your business, please reach out to me. I’d be happy to help! &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The 5th and Final “S” of the Five-S Model: Sustain</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bGZSHKvER2M?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s finally time to explore the fifth and final “S” of the Five-S model of customer experience: Sustain. At this point, you’ve set expectations, kept your clients updated along the way, you’ve surprised and delighted throughout the transaction, and now it’s over. &lt;strong&gt;Once you’ve done all of this, now it’s time to sustain the relationship in order to create a client for life. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to make them feel special, but it doesn’t require a ton of effort or planning. &lt;strong&gt;First off, make sure you call them a few days after closing to thank them for allowing you to help them.&lt;/strong&gt; This is also a surprise and a nice thing to do. It’s not a call for a referral; it’s purely a gratitude phone call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To properly sustain a relationship, you have to have a touch program in place.&lt;/strong&gt; If it’s already built out on your calendar, you won’t forget to keep those who are most important to you in the loop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You have to have a touch program in place.%20https://realestateintherealworld.com/the-5th-and-final-s-of-the-five-s-model-sustain.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“You have to have a touch program in place.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many people think that real estate agents are just money hungry. When you don’t call someone after closing or maintain your relationship with them, you’re essentially proving their point. I know that’s not who you are, so that’s why you need to take steps now to make sure you stay in touch with all of your clients in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me know some of the ways that you stay in touch with past clients.&lt;/strong&gt; We use a lot of events and giveaways to increase engagement, but we’d love to hear about what you’re doing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Discussing Some of Ty Voyle’s Agent Success Secrets</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QYhhAhdS00o?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my latest edition of “Agent Success Secrets”, I had the pleasure of being joined by Ty Voyles. We had a great discussion about his business, his success, and his plans for the future. We discussed some of the finer points involved with his fantastic Fulcrum Training Events, the menu of services that they offer each client, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Five-S Model of Customer Experience: Surpass</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/w01tZO9N_Oc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the latest installment of our video series on the Five-S Model of customer experience, we’ll talk about the fourth S: &lt;strong&gt;surpass.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found that the more I teach about customer experience, the more attuned to it I become as an observer—whether the experience was amazing or left much to be desired. In the real estate business, &lt;strong&gt;we should always be looking for ways that we can be better for our clients, &lt;/strong&gt;and the “surpass” component of the Five-S Model is an opportunity for us to surprise and delight them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides giving clients updates, checking in with them, asking for feedback, and satisfying all the basics of an overall great experience, it’s important to look for ways that we can go the extra mile and surpass expectations. As I travel around and meet with other agents, I continue to learn new ideas for doing this. Here’s one: &lt;strong&gt;As soon as your buyer or seller goes under contract, surprise them with a gift.&lt;/strong&gt; Perhaps you can deliver packing tape, champagne or wine, or some other small gesture that celebrates the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The “surpass” component of the Five-S Model is an opportunity for us to surprise and delight our clients.%20https://realestateintherealworld.com/the-five-s-model-of-customer-experience-surpass.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The “surpass” component of the Five-S Model is an opportunity for us to surprise and delight our clients.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, rather than advising them to do this or that, &lt;strong&gt;look for opportunities to do certain things for your client.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, if the seller you’re representing is moving out of their home in the coming days, show them that you’re willing to go above and beyond by bringing in a professional carpet cleaner, mowing their lawn one last time, or helping to offset their costs if that’s part of your approach.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;your extra efforts should have the element of surprise and need to be carried out in a systematic, organized fashion.&lt;/strong&gt; The best way to do this is to set reminders so that no matter how busy you get in your life and career, you don’t forget this important part of bolstering your customers’ experience. Of course, just because you have a system, it doesn’t mean you can’t personalize your gifts as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t even have to reinvent the wheel. Whether it’s other real estate teams or leaders in entirely different industries like Nordstrom’s, Southwest, Disneyworld, or anyone you notice providing a world-class customer experience, there are other models out there that you can look to.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or if you’d like to share with me the unique ways in which you surprise and delight your clients, please give me a call at 918-706-9845 or send me an email at &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#074;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#110;&amp;#105;&amp;#101;&amp;#064;&amp;#084;&amp;#104;&amp;#101;&amp;#087;&amp;#111;&amp;#108;&amp;#101;&amp;#107;&amp;#071;&amp;#114;&amp;#111;&amp;#117;&amp;#112;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;&amp;#074;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#110;&amp;#105;&amp;#101;&amp;#064;&amp;#084;&amp;#104;&amp;#101;&amp;#087;&amp;#111;&amp;#108;&amp;#101;&amp;#107;&amp;#071;&amp;#114;&amp;#111;&amp;#117;&amp;#112;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&lt;/a&gt;. I look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rockstar Agent Haro Setian Shares His Secrets to Success</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/KqgiuownMFI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the latest episode of Agent Success Secrets, I had the pleasure of speaking to Greenville, South Carolina Realtor Haro Setian. Haro came to Keller Williams in 2009, when the market was, of course, not in the best state. Despite entering the industry at a difficult time, Haro has absolutely thrived since then. Now, he’s going to explain how he did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cited below for your convenience are timestamps that will direct you to various points in the video. Feel free to watch the full message or use these timestamps to browse specific topics at your leisure: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;01:12 - Haro shares the story of how he got to where he is today&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;08:40 - How Haro finds agents who share his mission, vision, and values&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13:21 - Three mistakes Haro has learned from in order to “fail forward” in his career&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20:19 - How Haro avoids “shiny objects” as a real estate professional&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21:59 - Haro shares what he thinks holds most agents back from achieving their potential&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;26:06 - Wrapping up our interview with one of Haro’s most difficult moments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;30:01 - How you can get in touch with Haro&lt;/p&gt;
