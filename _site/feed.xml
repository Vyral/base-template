        <title>Meet Buyer Specialist Miranda Haws</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kIBEl1CZWGk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we’d like to introduce our buyer specialist Miranda Haws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miranda first heard about our great success on the radio from hosts Rick Hamada and Sean Hannity. Once she’d heard about us, she began to think about joining our team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miranda was curious as to what set Team Lally apart from other real estate teams here in Hawaii. Most agents compete against each other, but &lt;strong&gt;here at Team Lally we compete for each other.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just part of the reason why we’re so successful. The opportunity for collaboration that this mindset brings is what Miranda says she enjoys most about working on our team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each agent brings something different to the table, so &lt;strong&gt;everyone on the team combines their experiences and outlooks to find the best solutions for any transaction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=On Team Lally, everyone brings something different to the table.%20http://realestatecareerhawaii.com/meet-buyer-specialist-miranda-haws.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“On Team Lally, everyone brings something different to the table.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her role as a buyer specialist, Miranda works with families who are looking to purchase homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help find the home that will best fit their criteria and lifestyle, Miranda sifts through a number of properties before finding the right ones to show them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introducing Veronika, Team Lally’s Newest Member</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VBc4bmDcUtY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our newest team member, Veronika Edwards, was born and raised in Russia and came to the U.S. at age 19. Her life took her all over the country until she settled in Clarksville, Tennessee, where she got her real estate license in 2007. &lt;strong&gt;Even though she entered the business at the worst possible time, her passion, determination, and persistence helped her assist over 150 families in making their American Dream come true.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The housing crisis helped Veronika master her skills quickly to be able to help her best assist her clients’ needs. In 2016, her husband’s military job relocated her family to Hawaii. Veronika has two beautiful kids, ages four and nine months. She’s worked with many families with different life situations and understands how to provide her clients with “Raving Fan” level customer service. &lt;strong&gt;Her number one priority is exceeding her clients’ expectations.&lt;/strong&gt; Today, we want you to get to know her a little better. We sat down and asked her a few questions recently—here’s what she had to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you hear about us?&lt;/strong&gt; I heard about Team Lally from my previous team leader, who thought I would be a great fit. I did my own research as well to find the best in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We’re excited to have her on the team.%20http://realestatecareerhawaii.com/introducing-veronika-team-lallys-newest-member.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We’re excited to have her on the team.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What motivated you to join our team?&lt;/strong&gt; Team Lally’s track record and reputation. Team Lally has the proper systems and tools in place to keep me organized and professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your role on the team?&lt;/strong&gt; I’m going to be a buyer specialist who helps families find their dream home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you enjoy most about working on the team? &lt;/strong&gt;Team Lally is a place that is jam-packed with motivation, ambition, success, and inspiration. Not only do they want you to grow as a businessperson, they want you to grow as a person in general. The environment is so warm and welcome. I feel like I’m part of a big family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about Veronika or if she can help you with any of your real estate needs, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Meet Benjy Gilholm, Our Listing Partner Specialist</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/E1jh3BrmGeA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meet Benjy—a listing partner specialist at Team Lally. Through a combination of teamwork and working closely with clients, Team Lally remains a step above the rest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Team Lally, we have a unique and collaborative approach to real estate—which is one of the main reasons why Benjy Gilholm is so excited to be working as a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hands-on, team-oriented way of thinking benefits not only us but also our clients. &lt;strong&gt;Through a combination of teamwork and maintaining continuous contact with our clients, we are able to get the most out of what we do for you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=AS A TEAM, WE REMAIN A STEP ABOVE THE REST.%20http://realestatecareerhawaii.com/meet-benjy-gilholm-our-listing-partner-specialist.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“AS A TEAM, WE REMAIN A STEP ABOVE THE REST.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to ensure that we are working together efficiently and putting out the best work for you, we hold weekly meetings between our buyer agents, seller agents, listing partner specialists, like Benjy, our in-house escrow officer, and our in-house listing manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helps to ensure that, as a team, we remain a step above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consider the way we work together to be one of our greatest tools—it allows us to close on the highest volume of homes possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or would like to learn more about Team Lally and what we can do for you, feel free to call or email us. We look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have another mastermind coming up and we’d love for you to join us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we wanted to talk to you about the power of the mastermind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Napoleon Hill calls the mastermind the key that will open the door to your desires—whatever they may be. He defines it as two or more people that work in perfect harmony for the attainment of a definite purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are holding a mastermind session in our Kapolei Business Center like we do every month on the last Friday from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. The agenda is always filled with topics that will bring you success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=THIS INVITATION IS FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN LEARNING THESE SUCCESS SECRETS.%20http://realestatecareerhawaii.com/kapolei-mastermind-key-to-success-last-friday-of-every-month.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“THIS INVITATION IS FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN LEARNING THESE SUCCESS SECRETS.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mastermind will feature Mr. William, a professional voice coach. &lt;strong&gt;He will teach you how to improve your ability to communicate with clients and loved ones.&lt;/strong&gt; This will bring you more clients and improve your relationships. Become a trained speaker whether one-on-one or to a group. His most important points are power, confidence, and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Miranda Helps Your Real Estate Transaction Run Smoothly</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8-86eYOstng?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today we wanted to introduce you to Miranda Haws, one of our beloved inside sales agents here at Team Lally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miranda heard about Team Lally from the radio and also by seeing our yard signs throughout the community. She was motivated to join us after hearing about our success as the No. 1 team in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I had to come and see what all the rave was about,” she says. “It turned out that Adrienne and Attilio are just really down-to-earth people. They care about the team and they care about their business.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=HER FAVORITE PART OF THE JOB IS THE COLLABORATION EVERYONE BRINGS TO THE TABLE.%20http://realestatecareerhawaii.com/how-miranda-helps-your-real-estate-transaction-run-smoothly.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“HER FAVORITE PART OF THE JOB IS THE COLLABORATION EVERYONE BRINGS TO THE TABLE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an inside sales agent, Miranda works hand-in-hand with buyers and listing agents to help guide our clients to the best resources and all the information they desire. Her favorite part of the job is the collaboration everyone brings to the table from their many years of experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Any time there’s a problem or conflict that comes up, we can all work together to figure it out,” Miranda says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for Miranda or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home here in Hawaii, you can always give us a call or send us an email. We’re here to help!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Strategic Driven Business Is How We Did $82 Million Last Year </title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DH-dz1YGUgY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have you thought about starting a career in real estate? Here’s how to approach it to set yourself up for a prosperous career.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we want to talk for a minute about a career in real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People always ask how the market is and whether now is a good time to get into real estate. &lt;strong&gt;A common misconception is that the answer depends on what kind of market we’re in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we have learned from being in real estate for more than 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not what the market conditions are, but whether you have the right strategies for success.&lt;/strong&gt; How do we know this? We had a phenomenal year during the worst real estate bubble in history. We did a ton of short sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=WE ADJUST TO THE MARKET WE’RE IN TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF SUCCESS.%20http://realestatecareerhawaii.com/a-strategic-driven-business-is-how-we.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“WE ADJUST TO THE MARKET WE’RE IN TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF SUCCESS.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is an example of having the right strategy—we adjusted for the market we were in. In fact, we have been able to grow strategically year over year for the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have what we call a strategically driven business, and not an economically driven business. The difference? Our business does not go up and down with the economy, but rises upward with strategic growth. How do we do that? Come to one of our Career Nights or check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jointeamlally.com/&quot;&gt;JoinTeamLally.com&lt;/a&gt; to learn more. We’d love to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kapolei Mastermind Key to Success - Last Friday Of Every Month</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fb7pt3hLWaM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The power of the mastermind is undeniable. We’d love for you to join us on the last Friday of the month for one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we want to talk about the power of the mastermind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Napoleon Hill calls the mastermind “the key that will open the door to your desires,” whatever they may be. He defines it as two or more people that work in perfect harmony for the attainment of a definite purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We want to bring this to you, so we’re holding a mastermind session in our Kapolei Business Center.&lt;/strong&gt; We do this every month on the last Friday of the month from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. The agenda is filled with topics that, if implemented, will make you more money in 2017. The invitation is to anyone interested in learning our secrets of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=THESE SECRETS HELPED US GENERATE OVER $82 MILLION IN SALES LAST YEAR.%20http://realestatecareerhawaii.com/kapolei-mastermind-key-to-success-last.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“THESE SECRETS HELPED US GENERATE OVER $82 MILLION IN SALES LAST YEAR.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These secrets helped us generate over $82 million in sales in 2016 and we are going to share them with you. Now, we know that you’re thinking we won’t really share our secrets, but you’re wrong. &lt;strong&gt;We have learned that it is good to be abundant-minded and that sharing is caring.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you still don’t believe us, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teamlally.com/kw.php&quot;&gt;RSVP here&lt;/a&gt; and bring your questions to us on the last Friday of the month. In the meantime, take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/chicceo/2013/10/21/7-reasons-to-join-a-mastermind-group/#38b986e817ab&quot;&gt;this recent Forbes article&lt;/a&gt; we found that will give you seven better reasons to join a mastermind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. Thanks and aloha!&lt;/p&gt;
