        <title>What Is Driving Las Vegas’ Rapid Growth?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_i4RgLHk2bo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is driving the massive growth in Las Vegas? Today, I have three reasons that contribute.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forbes magazine just recently announced America’s fastest-growing cities in 2018. Las Vegas was one of the top cities in the country in terms of projected aggressive growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is driving this growth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the reasons that Las Vegas’ cost of living is still very low&lt;/strong&gt; compared to the rest of the country is that real estate prices are still 25% to 30% below the peak of where they once were. This has caused an influx of people moving to the area.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many people who once lived in Vegas unfortunately lost their houses due to foreclosure short sale bankruptcy&lt;/strong&gt; when the market collapsed. Those people are back on the market now that they’ve fixed their credit, so they’re ready to buy again. This means there’s been an increase in demand from buyers that were renting at one point. This also encourages a lot of new home construction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additionally, there are a lot of jobs that are being created by the construction field.&lt;/strong&gt; Recently, a new Raiders stadium began construction, as well as a practice facility that will be built in Henderson. There are also a couple major casinos that will begin construction soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=There are a lot of jobs that are being created by the construction field.%20http://www.myvegasrealestateinfo.com/what-is-driving-las-vegas-rapid-growth.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“There are a lot of jobs that are being created by the construction field.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about what Las Vegas’ recent growth means for you or you are looking to buy or sell real estate, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When Is the Best Time for Homeownership? </title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/aL7jFuJeRcw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waiting around for a market correction is rarely a good reason to keep renting. The longer you wait, the more money you are putting toward someone else’s mortgage instead of your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to sell your home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/free-home-value/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a FREE home value report.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Want to buy a home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/homes-for-sale-search-advanced/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it better to buy right away or rent until there’s a market correction? The truth is that it depends on your circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help you determine what’s right for you, there are a couple of things you should ask yourself. First, &lt;strong&gt;how long are you looking to rent for?&lt;/strong&gt; If the period of time is short, it’s a good idea to rent. This is especially true if you are only looking for temporary housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re only looking to rent because you want to wait for prices to correct themselves in the market, there are a few statistics you should be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average rent of a small home is $1,500. If you pay this amount each month for a full year, this would amount to $18,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=THE LONGER YOU WAIT, THE LONGER YOU’RE PUTTING OFF HAVING A PAID-OFF HOME OF YOUR OWN.%20http://www.myvegasrealestateinfo.com/the-real-cost-of-renting.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“THE LONGER YOU WAIT, THE LONGER YOU’RE PUTTING OFF HAVING A PAID-OFF HOME OF YOUR OWN.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re waiting around for the market to correct itself, you are throwing away a lot of money. Over the course of three years, a monthly rent of $1,500 would amount to $54,000. &lt;strong&gt;Why help someone else pay off their mortgage when the money could go towards your own?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical mortgage will be paid off within 30 years. The longer you wait, the longer you’re putting off having a paid-off home of your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Think You Need 20% Down? Not With These Assistance Programs</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ihDdDqSH9pA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people believe that it takes a lot of money down to be able to afford a home. With the help of down payment assistance programs, this isn’t always the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to sell your home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/free-home-value/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a FREE home value report.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Want to buy a home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/homes-for-sale-search-advanced/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’ve got some exciting news. If you’ve been renting because you believe you don’t have enough money for a down payment, you should know that you actually have some options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a common misconception that to buy a home you need to come up with a large sum for the down payment. This is not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of programs out there allow you to purchase a home for very little money down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To discuss this, I recently sat down with one of the top loan officers in Las Vegas: Monica Aldana from Cross Country Mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With a conventional loan, you can put just 3%, 4%, or 5% down so long as your credit score is above 640.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also never have to repay the money you receive from this assistance program. However, there is a fee of approximately $700 for down payment assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS OUT THERE ALLOW YOU TO PURCHASE A HOME FOR VERY LITTLE MONEY DOWN.%20http://www.myvegasrealestateinfo.com/you-could-be-able-to-afford-home-sooner.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS OUT THERE ALLOW YOU TO PURCHASE A HOME FOR VERY LITTLE MONEY DOWN.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have credit score of at least 660 and are using the FHA loan, you can qualify to put down 4% through that program. Typically, though, buyers can qualify for just 3.5% down using an FHA loan. This means that money saved on the down payment could go toward closing costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programs like these open up a lot of opportunities. However, there are some things you should be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to remember that interest rates are higher for these programs than what is found on the standard market. However, these interest rates are not FICO-driven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that if you have a low FICO score, &lt;strong&gt;you could get a lower interest rate by using a down payment assistance program.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got any questions for Monica about this, you can reach her by calling (702) 339-8221.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you would like more information or have any other questions for me, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Should You Sell Now or Wait?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GTpkp-sJsnI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should you sell now or wait to see where our market is headed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to sell your home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/free-home-value/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a FREE home value report.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Want to buy a home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/homes-for-sale-search-advanced/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In real estate, timing can be a critical factor to any transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something on the minds of many people who are thinking about listing is whether they should do so now or wait to see what happens in our market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the market is currently appreciating, this can be a tough question to answer. In fact, there is no one-size-fits-all answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question depends on your personal circumstances. To determine what is right for you, you should consider two main factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=THERE IS NO ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL ANSWER.%20http://www.myvegasrealestateinfo.com/should-you-sell-now-or-wait.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“THERE IS NO ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL ANSWER.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First of all, think about your own motivation and need to sell.&lt;/strong&gt; Why do you want to sell? Do you need to sell first to buy another property?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, consider price. Pricing a home correctly is absolutely critical to getting top dollar. Future appreciation aside, you can still get a great price now if you understand how to properly price your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing you might want to consider is the option of renting your property out. If you’re waiting to see where the market goes, &lt;strong&gt;why not rent out the property and make some money in the meantime?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Few Tips if Youre Looking to Get a Mortgage</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/s-gNgOxvbzg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can you stand out in this competitive market? We have the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to sell your home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/free-home-value/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a FREE home value report.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Want to buy a home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/homes-for-sale-search-advanced/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re lucky enough to be joined today by Monica with CrossCountry Mortgage. She is here to give us some more information about what’s going on in this crazy market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you’re probably already aware, Las Vegas is a strong seller’s market right now. With many more buyers than sellers, what’s the best way for a buyer to prepare to get the home they want? According to Monica, it’s getting a pre-approval. Don’t settle for a quick pre-qualification. A fully underwritten approval with verified income and assets is what you’re looking for. &lt;strong&gt;It only takes a few days, and then you can go home shopping with confidence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=A FULLY UNDERWRITTEN PRE-APPROVAL IS KEY.%20http://www.myvegasrealestateinfo.com/a-few-tips-if-youre-looking-to-get.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“A FULLY UNDERWRITTEN PRE-APPROVAL IS KEY.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a seller in this market, Monica says not to accept an offer from a buyer who doesn’t have a fully underwritten approval because they might not actually be able to buy your home. Their income and assets should be verified as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for Monica, you can give her a call at (702) 339-8221. If you have any other questions for us, you can always give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Stand out to Sellers in the Las Vegas Market: Part 2</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2AMOq0kIxpw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to buy a home here in the Las Vegas market, it won’t be easy. You can help yourself with these three tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to sell your home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/free-home-value/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a FREE home value report.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Want to buy a home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/homes-for-sale-search-advanced/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re back to continue our conversation about how to get your offer accepted as a buyer in the crazy seller’s market we’re experiencing in Las Vegas. If you missed the first part of our discussion, you can see it &lt;a href=&quot;http://myvegasrealestateinfo.com/how-to-stand-out-to-sellers-in-las.html&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inventory is low across the country and Las Vegas is no different.&lt;/strong&gt; We have just 4,917 single-family houses for sale in the Las Vegas area. That might not sound like a shortage, but compared to the nearly 8,000 houses we had for sale at this time last year, you can see how drastically inventory has shrunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also just 366 condominiums and 305 townhomes for sale in our market. When you buy a home in our market, you need to be aggressive. You can win in this low inventory market by following a few key tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Don’t overanalyze the process:&lt;/strong&gt; Be aggressive and don’t take too long looking for options because you just won’t have many options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Be prepared for a bidding war:&lt;/strong&gt; There will be a lot of buyers looking for homes that are priced right and in good condition, so put your best foot forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=YOU DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF TIME IF YOU FIND A HOME YOU LIKE.%20http://www.myvegasrealestateinfo.com/how-to-stand-out-to-sellers-in-las.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“YOU DON’T HAVE THE LUXURY OF TIME IF YOU FIND A HOME YOU LIKE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Listen to your agent:&lt;/strong&gt; Learn from other buyers’ mistakes. An experienced agent can help you through the whole process, so trust them and be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to buy a home or sell your current house, give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to use my experience to help you get the best outcome in our market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you want to buy a home here in the hot Las Vegas market, there are a few certain things you can do to make yourself stand out amongst the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to sell your home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/free-home-value/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a FREE home value report.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Want to buy a home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/homes-for-sale-search-advanced/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to buy a Las Vegas home, there are a few specific things you can do to get the home you want for a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Choose an experienced agent:&lt;/strong&gt; You want a full-time agent who knows what they’re doing. They should be patient and willing to show you properties. It’s also not just about finding your house, you want an agent who can negotiate and be aggressive to get your offer accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Be aggressive with your offer:&lt;/strong&gt; When you find the right property in the right area that fits your criteria (size, price, budget, etc.) don’t sit there and over-analyze things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=EVEN THOUGH IT’S A SELLER’S MARKET, THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN DO TO MAXIMIZE YOUR PROFIT.%20http://www.myvegasrealestateinfo.com/how-to-stand-out-to-sellers-in-las.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“EVEN THOUGH IT’S A SELLER’S MARKET, THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN DO TO MAXIMIZE YOUR PROFIT.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Have your full financing approval ready:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure you have a copy before you even start shopping for homes. Not having your approval ready would be like going hunting without a gun. Even if you find the perfect home, if you haven’t been approved for financing yet, it could take a lot of time and cause you to lose out on the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for our next video where I’ll reveal the last three things you can do as a homebuyer to set yourself up to win the home you want. In the meantime, give me a call or send me an email with any questions you have. I’d be glad to help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m bringing you the latest numbers in the Las Vegas and Henderson area market and wishing all the mothers out there a very Happy Mother’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to sell your home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/free-home-value/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a FREE home value report.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Want to buy a home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/homes-for-sale-search-advanced/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get started with your newest market update, I want to take a moment to wish all the mothers out there a &lt;strong&gt;Happy Mother’s Day!&lt;/strong&gt; Make it a great weekend and enjoy your time with your families. You deserve it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Currently, we have a little more than 5,000 single family homes, approximately 400 condos, and around 300 townhomes for sale.&lt;/strong&gt; Last month in April, there were 2,800 homes sold. Based on those numbers, we have a very low inventory. In fact, if no new houses came on the market, it would only take 45 days to sell everything currently for sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=EVEN THOUGH IT’S A SELLER’S MARKET, THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN DO TO MAXIMIZE YOUR PROFIT.%20http://www.myvegasrealestateinfo.com/las-vegas-and-henderson-market-update.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“EVEN THOUGH IT’S A SELLER’S MARKET, THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN DO TO MAXIMIZE YOUR PROFIT.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those numbers put us in a very strong seller’s market. &lt;strong&gt;There are more buyers than there are homes for sale, so prices are going to continue to rise.&lt;/strong&gt; If you are thinking about selling, make sure you contact the right agent to help you strategize. Even though it’s a seller’s market, there are certain things you can do to maximize your profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about the market conditions or are looking to buy or sell a home, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m more than happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Listing Mistakes to Avoid in the Las Vegas Market </title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fumr_NtkVpM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you sell your house in the spring market, you want to avoid these five mistakes at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to sell your home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/free-home-value/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a FREE home value report.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Want to buy a home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/homes-for-sale-search-advanced/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re getting ready to sell your house in the upcoming spring or summer months, there are five mistakes you want to avoid making:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Do not overprice your home:&lt;/strong&gt; Even in this appreciating market, it could cost you in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Don’t leave minor repairs undone:&lt;/strong&gt; Minor repairs are part of getting your house ready to list on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Don’t overimprove:&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t think that spending a ton of money on improvements will all come back in your bottom line. Consult with your Realtor about which upgrades will make you your money back when you sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Don’t make it hard for buyers to see your property:&lt;/strong&gt; With low inventory in our market, we have a lot of motivated buyers. A lot of people will want to see your house in the first two weeks it’s on the market, so make it as easy as possible for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=OVERPRICING YOUR HOME COULD ACTUALLY COST YOU MONEY IN THE END.%20http://www.myvegasrealestateinfo.com/5-listing-mistakes-to-avoid-in-las.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“OVERPRICING YOUR HOME COULD ACTUALLY COST YOU MONEY IN THE END.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Don’t try to sell on your own:&lt;/strong&gt; You might think you’ll save money on real estate commission, but in this appreciating market, it will cost you more than if you sell with a professional real estate agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or you’re thinking about making a move in the Las Vegas market, give me a call or send me an email. I’m always happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>4 Tech Features That Improve a Homes Value</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kDFf1zfHndc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart home technology has improved a lot over the years. Here’s what buyers are looking for in today’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to sell your home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/free-home-value/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a FREE home value report.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Want to buy a home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/homes-for-sale-search-advanced/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the latest technology in your home will help it get more attention from buyers, both online and in-person. &lt;strong&gt;Here are four tech upgrades you can make in your home to maximize its value when the time comes to sell:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Smart thermostat.&lt;/strong&gt; They keep your home at the temperature you like when you are home, and keep it at an energy-efficient temperature when you’re away. These thermostats can help bring energy bills way down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Surveillance cameras.&lt;/strong&gt; Nowadays, they are pretty inexpensive. There is even a doorbell that comes with its own webcam. You want something newer that is compatible with smart technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Smart culinary equipment.&lt;/strong&gt; No-touch faucets are great for keeping germs off faucets, and a fridge that tells you when you’re running low on milk or Coors Light is an added bonus for buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=SMART THERMOSTATS HELP LOWER ENERGY BILLS.%20http://www.myvegasrealestateinfo.com/4-tech-features-that-improve-homes-value.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“SMART THERMOSTATS HELP LOWER ENERGY BILLS.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Updated surround sound.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether you have a theater room or not, buyers love seeing high-end sound systems when it comes to entertainment areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for us about selling your home or what else you can do to help it stand out, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;
