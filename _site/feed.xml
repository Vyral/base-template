        <title>Should You Trust Zillow With Your Homes Value?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lROsP-pfiSA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zillow’s Zestimates can be deeply flawed when it comes to determining your home’s value. Here’s what you should do instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get a lot of questions from people asking me if they should trust the value that Zillow gave their home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer that, let me share a few facts with you about Zillow. As a company, they started in 2006. Prior to that, they weren’t involved in the real estate market. Last time I checked, they haven’t sold any homes, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zillow is basically a company that collects whatever data they can find and then puts it into their website to determine home values.&lt;/strong&gt; The one thing Zillow can’t account for is the upgrades or special features of your home. Think of it this way: has Zillow been in your home? Of course not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zillow’s estimates, called Zestimates, are determined by an algorithm based on comparable homes sales. In the greater Milwaukee metro area, Zestimates can be off by as much as 10% or more. Zillow even admitted that 46% of the time their Zestimates were off by at least 5% or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ZILLOW’S ZESTIMATES CAN BE OFF BY AS MUCH AS 10% OR MORE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might’ve heard by now, a homeowner in Illinois actually filed a lawsuit against Zillow because they claimed their Zestimate harmed their home sale. This may yet turn into a class action lawsuit. Zillow knows they have a problem, and they’ve gone as far as offering a $1 million prize to anyone who can fix their algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 11 years since Zillow has been around, whenever I get calls from prospective buyers about homes they’ve found on Zillow, I’ve found that 35% of the time their information is inaccurate. Our website’s information, on the other hand, is 98% accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking all of this into account, I wouldn’t put much credo into Zillow’s Zestimate. &lt;strong&gt;If you really want to know the value of your home, call a professional Realtor.&lt;/strong&gt; We can physically look at your home and all of its upgrades and features to provide an accurate valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about Zillow or you want to know the real value of your home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>7 Keys to Winning a Multiple Offer Situation in Our Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xoPM4bsSnsA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To win a multiple offer situation as a buyer in our Greater Milwaukee market, I have seven tips for you to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our current market, if you see a home you like that’s a hot property in a favorable price range, there could be multiple offers for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself in this situation and have to compete with other buyers, here are seven things you can do to make your offer the best of the bunch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Make sure the seller knows you’re qualified.&lt;/strong&gt; The best way to do this is to get a pre-approval letter (not a pre-qualification letter) from your lender and submit it along with your offer for at least the mortgage amount or higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Submit a large earnest money deposit.&lt;/strong&gt; A normal deposit in today’s market is 1% of the purchase price, so make yours 2%, 3%, or even 5% of the purchase price. If your offer doesn’t get accepted, you’ll get that money back anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Find out from your agent what’s important to the seller.&lt;/strong&gt; Do they prefer an earlier or later closing date? Do they want certain items excluded from the sale? Your agent can find these things out by talking to the listing agent prior to you making your offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Give the seller time to move.&lt;/strong&gt; I understand you want to move in as fast as possible, but normal closings take about 45 days, so if you’re expecting them to be out in 20 to 30 days, that’s unrealistic unless it’s a vacant property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Consider shortening or waiving some of the contingencies you have.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, instead of waiting two or three weeks to do a home inspection, do it within seven days. If you think the property is good enough as it is, consider waiving the inspection altogether. The fewer contingencies you bring, the better chance your offer has of being accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Let the seller know you love their house.&lt;/strong&gt; I suggest writing a brief letter to the seller outlining why you love their house and why they should pick you to be its buyer. And remember—be sincere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=MAKE YOUR FIRST OFFER YOUR HIGHEST AND BEST ONE.%20localhost:4000/7-keys-to-winning-multiple-offer.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“MAKE YOUR FIRST OFFER YOUR HIGHEST AND BEST ONE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Make a good offer.&lt;/strong&gt; Make your highest and best offer now because you may not get countered. Excuse the listing price and have your agent do a comparative market analysis—sometimes properties are priced below market value, and you may have to offer thousands of dollars more to get that property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about getting your next home in today’s competitive market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to assist you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Greater Milwaukee Area Market Update</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/56PFENvB7To?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I wanted to give you a market update on how the market has been doing the last seven months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’re into August, I thought I would take some time to give you a market update recapping the last seven months of this year. I’ve laid out the current statistics compared to this time last year below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IF YOU’RE THINKING OF SELLING, NOW IS THE TIME TO DO SO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Number of homes available for sale is down by 12%
• Number of days on market decreased from 61 to 39 days
• Number of listings also decreased by 2%
• Number of homes sold is down 9%, mostly due to low inventory
• Median sales price has increased 5% to 6% in the metro area
  • Milwaukee County sales price is $160,000
  • Waukesha County sales price is $308,000
  • Washington County sales price is $255,000
  • Ozaukee County sales price is $305,000
  • Racine County sales price is $171,000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inventory is low and prices are going up—so if you’ve been thinking of selling, now is the time to do so. Based on these statistics, we’re in a firm seller’s market in the metro area. For buyers, the interest rates are still low and you can find a great deal on a mortgage if you’re looking to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions on the market or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, please give us a call. We’d be happy to help!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Get Rid of Harmful Radon Gas</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/C9bDR9APZwA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radon gas can be very harmful. Here’s how to make sure the levels in your home are acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 50% of the houses we sell have radon gas inspections done. Eric Clark from Lifetime Radon Solutions is here with us to talk a little bit about radon gas, what it is, and how you can treat it if the levels of radon in your home get too high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radon is an invisible, odorless, colorless gas. We know it’s there, but we don’t know it’s there. It’s a naturally occurring radioactive gas that comes from uranium in the soil and is concentrated in the home. &lt;strong&gt;The midwest is notorious for high levels of radon. Wisconsin is right up there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radon can’t be seen or smelled, but it can be measured and it can have consequences. Behind smoking, radon gas is the 2nd leading cause of lung cancer in the U.S. Every house has radon, it’s just a matter of how much. &lt;strong&gt;The EPA recommends action for any radon levels above 4 pCi/L.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=A SOLUTION TO A DANGEROUS PROBLEM.%20localhost:4000/how-to-get-rid-of-harmful-radon-gas.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“A SOLUTION TO A DANGEROUS PROBLEM.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle Radon Solutions offers radon mitigation systems and they can install them in a number of ways. They draw the radon gas out from the home by creating a negative pressure that gets the gas out before it even enters the home. They guarantee that your radon levels will be below 4 pCi/L with one of their systems.The price range for one of these systems is anywhere from $845 to $1305.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;strong&gt;even if you have high radon levels in your home, it is fixable.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have any questions for Eric about Lifestyle Radon Solutions and any of the services or products they offer, give him a call at (262)-955-7701. If you have any other real estate questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us anytime. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Can a Home Warranty Help Sell Your House?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/rj5K2IyBiMI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting a home warranty is absolutely a good idea if you’re a home seller, and here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should you use a home warranty to help sell your house?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I strongly recommend that you do. &lt;strong&gt;Getting a home warranty offers many advantages to a home seller.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we work with a company out of Madison called Home Security of America. They provide warranties on the sale of used or existing homes just like a builder would on a new construction home. Typically, a builder would cover you for one year after closing, and the same thing applies with Home Security of America’s warranty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=GETTING A HOME WARRANTY HELPS SELL YOUR HOUSE.%20localhost:4000/can-home-warranty-help-sell-your-house.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“GETTING A HOME WARRANTY HELPS SELL YOUR HOUSE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their warranty covers any major problem with the plumbing, the electrical, the heating, the air conditioning, the appliances in the house, etc. The seller also gets free coverage while the home is listed for plumbing, electrical, and the water heater. On a single-family home, the cost for full coverage is typically $564.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious benefit of getting a home warranty is that &lt;strong&gt;it helps sell your home.&lt;/strong&gt; If your home has a warranty and one of the other properties your prospective buyer is looking at doesn’t, that may sway them to buy yours. Secondly, getting a home warranty provides is peace of mind—not just for the buyer, but for you too. If something goes wrong in the home, it can be fixed or replaced by the warranty company with a nominal deductible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about home warranties or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, feel free to give us a call. We’d be glad to assist you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Avoid 7 Common Home Selling Mistakes</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xN_bGTr8mjA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are seven big mistakes that I commonly see people make when selling their house. Here’s how to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you sell your house, there are some common mistakes that I see too many sellers make:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Picking the wrong agent:&lt;/strong&gt; Most people pick an agent they know or a relative rather than one with proven track record who sells homes full time and has experience in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Overpricing the home:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s a fine line between getting the best price and asking too much and selling too cheaply in the end. Get a professional’s opinion on the value of your house and listen to them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Not making simple repairs to their home like cleaning and new paint:&lt;/strong&gt; Some sellers don’t even want to replace minor things like missing fixtures or handrails. A good agent can advise you on what to repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Too much clutter:&lt;/strong&gt; We all have too much stuff, so get rid of all that clutter when selling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=GIVE BUYERS AN ENVIRONMENT THAT LETS THEM OPEN UP TO THEIR AGENT ABOUT YOUR HOME.%20localhost:4000/how-to-avoid-7-common-home-selling.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“GIVE BUYERS AN ENVIRONMENT THAT LETS THEM OPEN UP TO THEIR AGENT ABOUT YOUR HOME.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Not allowing adequate access:&lt;/strong&gt; Most buyers will want to see your home by appointment, and sometimes they might want to see it on shorter than a day’s notice. Let them in; they’re ready, willing, and able buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Staying during a showing:&lt;/strong&gt; You want to leave while a buyer looks at your home so they have an environment where they can open up to their agent and ask questions without feeling like they’re intruding on your privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Leaving pets in the house during showings:&lt;/strong&gt; Cats and dogs are great, but they can be a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking about selling your house or you have any questions at all about real estate, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’re here to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Improve Your Credit Score When Buying a Home Using These 4 Tips</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/M6ipd6nbCh8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m going over four tips for improving your credit when applying for a home loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can you improve your credit score when applying for a house loan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;don’t open or close any credit accounts&lt;/strong&gt;, as that will lower your score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;check your credit card balances.&lt;/strong&gt; You want to keep your credit card balance at 25% or less or if you can, pay off the cards each month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR CREDIT CARD BALANCE AT 25% OR LESS.%20localhost:4000/improve-your-credit-score-when-buying.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR CREDIT CARD BALANCE AT 25% OR LESS.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, this may be common sense, &lt;strong&gt;but don’t switch jobs.&lt;/strong&gt; You generally need two years in the same line of work and one year with the same employer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;don’t buy new furniture or a car until after you’ve purchased the home&lt;/strong&gt;. Those types of big purchases could significantly affect your credit score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about buying a home or getting a better credit score, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m more than happy to help!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Should You Worry About Rising Interest Rates? </title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wd4eqxGaJ0o?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should you be concerned about the impact rising interest rates will have on the current real estate market?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you probably know, over the last couple of months, interest rates have been on the rise. &lt;strong&gt;Should you worry about these increasing rates?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of months, fixed-rate mortgages have gone up just over 0.5%. Rates can be as high as 4.25% and as low as 3.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In real terms, this rise in rates means that if you took out a 30-year mortgage on a $250,000 home, you would pay as much as $100 more each month and pay an additional $35,000 over the life of the mortgage. That is a sizable chunk, so some people are nervous that increasing rates will slow down the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=OUR MARKET IS NOT GOING TO SLOW DOWN ANYTIME SOON.%20localhost:4000/should-you-worry-about-rising-interest.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“OUR MARKET IS NOT GOING TO SLOW DOWN ANYTIME SOON.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the market is not about to slow down anytime soon. Why? Historically speaking, these rates are still incredibly low. Back in the 90s, rates were as high as 10%. In the 80s, interest rates were at 16%! As you can see, these 4.25% rates are still incredibly low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does that mean for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a buyer, these low rates create a great opportunity for you to buy an amazing home, which is way better than renting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to sell your home, you are in a great position to do so quickly and get top dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about interest rates and our current market, give me a call. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Tips for Selling a Home With Pets</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ixdszRtVG8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re selling your home and you have pets, follow these tips to appeal to more buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I’d take some time today to talk a little bit about selling a home with pets. I’ve got five steps that will help you prepare your home for sale while your pets are living there, too. &lt;strong&gt;Whether you have a cat, dog, bird, or any other animal, follow these tips:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Get the pet(s) out of the home before showings.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether buyers love or hate your pet, they are going to be a distraction during the showing. The best thing to do is have a doggy daycare, a family member, friend, or neighbor watch the pet while there is a showing going on. If you have no other option but to keep them in the house, make sure they are put in a kennel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Hide evidence of pets.&lt;/strong&gt; This includes food and water bowls, leashes, and toys. Eliminate any pictures of your pets and other signs that suggest you have them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Clean up any pet mess.&lt;/strong&gt; Be conscious of their hair, stains, and any other damage they may have caused in your house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Remove any odors.&lt;/strong&gt; Ask your agent or someone who doesn’t come to your house regularly if they notice any pet odors. If they do, fix it. Odors can linger in places like the carpet, a bed, or furniture. Clear those odors out with fresh air as opposed to air freshener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Prepare your yard.&lt;/strong&gt; This could be one of the best selling features in your house, so you want to make sure all waste is picked up and repair any damage to  grass.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Crucial Questions to Ask When Interviewing Agents </title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7NxdpODz5hM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a real estate agent, it is vitally important that you ask them these five questions before giving them the important job of selling your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite what most people think, not all agents are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are all attorneys the same? Are all CPAs the same? Are all doctors the same? Of course not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how can you make sure that you hire the right real estate agent? I recommend asking them these five questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. How many homes have you sold so far this year?&lt;/strong&gt; You should also ask how many homes they sold the previous year. Why? The average agent sells fewer than three homes in a calendar year, which means that they probably don’t know much about real estate. At the Roth Team, we’ve sold 175 homes so far this year; last year, we sold 236 homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. What is your average list to sales price ratio?&lt;/strong&gt; In other words, how close is the purchase price to the asking price? Some agents offer a lower commission because they will give your house away. They let the buyer negotiate the price down. Our average list to sales price ratio is 98.4%, which is very close to asking price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=YOU NEED AN EXPERIENCED AGENT WHO WORKS FULL-TIME.%20localhost:4000/5-crucial-questions-to-ask-when.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“YOU NEED AN EXPERIENCED AGENT WHO WORKS FULL-TIME.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. What is the average days on market for the homes you list and sell?&lt;/strong&gt; Of course, if it takes an agent six months to a year to sell homes, they are wasting time and money. This year, our homes spent an average of 48 days on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. How many years of experience do you have?&lt;/strong&gt; Do they have another job? Quite honestly, many agents do not make enough money to support their income in real estate. Many agents have less than three to five years of experience in the market. I’ve been doing this full-time for 35 years. Experience counts; it can really make a difference when it comes to selling your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. How many people will you talk to every day to sell my home?&lt;/strong&gt; Every agent puts your home on the MLS, throws it on a few websites, and takes out an ad in the paper. Some agents may even hold open houses. However, those methods are not good enough. They need to personally contact potential buyers every day. We call that active marketing. Our team contacts as many as 100 people a day to get your home sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about real estate, please don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. My team and I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;
