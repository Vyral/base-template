        <title>A Market Shift Is on the Way</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SvdnA9CfNaI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question we get asked almost every day in our business is, “&lt;strong&gt;When is the best time for me to sell my house?&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our area being so dense, buying or selling a home can be done at basically any time of year. However, this doesn’t mean there aren’t seasonal factors at play. We live in a cold-weather market, which means our market cycle is different from those located in warmer climates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the weather here starts to warm up, then the market tends to heat up too.&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to know when the best time to sell is, you’ve got to pay attention to current market statistics. Understanding market trends is the key to success in real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you or anyone you know is thinking of selling, now is a good time to make your move.%20http://carterpropertygroupblog.com/a-market-shift-is-on-the-way.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you or anyone you know is thinking of selling, now is a good time to make your move.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far this year, we’ve seen a decrease in the number of contracts being written compared to what we saw this same time last year. Still, there has been a slight increase in inventory after a very long period of decreasing supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market is set up statistically for a shift. With that information in mind, think about anyone you know who is thinking of selling in the next three to 18 months. Conditions are now slowly shifting to benefit buyer’s more, so if you or anyone you know is thinking of selling, now is a good time to make your move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My team and I watch market statistics on a weekly basis, so we have clear evidence that this shift is on its way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Top 3 Mistakes Home Sellers Make</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/x3glAUPRfwg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we’re counting down the top three mistakes that home sellers make when they put their home on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Not saying “yes” to a showing request.&lt;/strong&gt; You should always say yes. The buyer and the buyer’s agent have carved out time in their schedules to come and see your home. If we ask them to schedule for another day, ask to move the time, or decline altogether, we may never hear from them again. Even if we follow up and ask them to please reschedule, they will probably go out and find another home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. They don’t rise to the occasion and prepare the property to show in the best light possible.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s so important that your property looks great. Make sure that you declutter, clean, and make repairs and updates. With wide-angle lenses and enhanced photographs, our first sale is online. Your home has to look amazing online, or the buyer may not come into your home to start with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You should always say “yes” to a showing request.%20http://carterpropertygroupblog.com/the-top-3-mistakes-home-sellers-make.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“You should always say “yes” to a showing request.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. They refuse to listen to market data and price the home correctly for the market conditions.&lt;/strong&gt; You cannot afford to overprice your home. When you are getting your home ready for the market, it’s important to pay attention to market conditions and price your home accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the three most important things you should keep in mind when preparing to sell your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are thinking of selling your home and would like to know what your home is worth in the current market, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What’s Happening With Interest Rates?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iMpGFtifp5Q&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to go over what interest rates are doing in the local market and how they impact buyers and sellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of 2018, mortgage interest rates have increased from 4.0% to 4.625% for a 30-year mortgage. That might not seem like a significant jump, and, historically speaking, a 4.625% interest rate is still very low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing—that increase has an impact on a buyer’s ability to borrow money to buy real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=An increase in interest rates means a decrease in buying power.%20http://carterpropertygroupblog.com/whats-happening-with-interest-rates.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“An increase in interest rates means a decrease in buying power.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a homebuyer and you want a specific monthly mortgage payment based on your income, you’ve lost 7.2% in purchasing power. That means you have the ability to buy 7.2% less home for the same monthly payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a seller, since people who are interested in buying your home have lost some purchasing power, there will be a downward effect on prices and the offers that they might be able to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the real estate market in Chicago is still very strong. This is a fairly recent development but it is significant, so I wanted to make sure that everyone was aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like rates will continue to increase over the course of 2018. If you have any questions about how rising interest rates will impact your 2018 real estate goals, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Is a Buyer’s Agent?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qO9zijKrhlU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I wanted to introduce you to Laura Jones, the buyer’s agent for our team here at Carter Property Group, so that you can get to know her and have some of your questions answered by her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s a buyer’s agent?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I focus solely on the purchase of our clients’ homes. First-time homebuyers, investors, upsizing, downsizing—I only work on the buy side of the transaction.  Any client we have has to sit down with me for a consultation. I’m able to get an idea of their needs in about 30 to 40 minutes.  Once we do that, we begin searching and going out into the field to look at homes. After that, when we’re ready, I write the contract and negotiate the terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So essentially, I do needs-assessment through a consultation, preview homes on the MLS, set up searches for people, take people out into the field to view homes (sometimes as many as 40 properties a week), write offers and negotiate terms once a property is selected, and eventually get it under contract. I’m able to service clients at a very high level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does a typical day look like for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wake up in the morning, shake my son awake and take him to school, and then I get to the office. I generally block off my morning for business calls and finding properties that aren’t yet on the market for our clients. I’ll take lunch and maybe make time for a workout, and then for the rest of the afternoon and evening I’ll block out that time period to be able to go out into the field with clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So the MLS is only one source that you use to find properties for clients?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely. Sometimes I’ll send out mailers and follow it up with a call. Sometimes the property for our clients isn’t always on the market at the time. That allows me to block a whole morning to find properties and preview them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your favorite part of your job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a buyer’s agent, my favorite part of my job is the fact that I do get to know my clients in a really intimate way. I spend a lot of time with them and their families, I get to know personal things about them, and after the transaction, we don’t really fall off. I love checking in with them. They send me photos of remodels, updates, babies, and more. It’s just really rewarding. I don’t take it lightly that buying a home is probably the most money you’re ever going to spend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Helping someone get into their new home is pretty powerful. I love it.%20http://carterpropertygroupblog.com/what-is-a-buyers-agent.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Helping someone get into their new home is pretty powerful. I love it.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helping someone get into their new home is pretty powerful. I love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about property, taxes, or anything real estate-related, give us a call. We’re always happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gaining a New Perspective on the Home Buying Process: Part Two</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LmMrTgnX5EU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we’re coming at you with the second part of our two-part series, where we continue to answer the question “What happens when the agent becomes the buyer?” &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/gaining-a-new-perspective-on-the-home-buying-process-part-one.html&quot;&gt;For the first part of this series, click here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step in the home buying process for Paul was the home inspection phase, which always creates moments of apprehension. Going in with a 203(k) loan, Paul is borrowing a little bit more money than the purchase price of the property in order to put some money back into that property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=“We train really hard on stuff like that—how to listen, how to find out where people are, and how to ask a question to dig deeper about emotions.”%20http://carterpropertygroupblog.com/gaining-a-new-perspective-on-the-home-buying-process-part-two.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;““We train really hard on stuff like that—how to listen, how to find out where people are, and how to ask a question to dig deeper about emotions.””&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing that extra money was there to handle problems created a sense of calmness, but the home’s inspection revealed three relatively big ones: asbestos, residual termite damage, and some fascia on some of the gutters, which is a complicated fix. Moving forward, we’ve uncovered a layering of information and still have some unknowns to decide on in order to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul jokes that he’s almost fired two people so far, but having the experience of feeling like he’s not being heard was invaluable to him because he always wants our clients to feel like they’re being heard, as do I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we’ve seen for a long time, and what partially explains this feeling if you’re a homebuyer, is that the further away a person involved in the transaction is from the actual transaction and the core facilitators of that transaction (i.e., the agent), the more you’re just a file to them. They don’t have the first-hand connection to your goals, your situation, and your timeline. &lt;strong&gt;We always keep these factors in mind when working with our clients.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We train really hard on stuff like that—how to listen, how to find out where people are, and how to ask a question to dig deeper about emotions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll keep you posted on the next steps of this transaction and relay some more first-hand knowledge on the subject. In the meantime, if you have any questions or are looking to buy or sell a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gaining a New Perspective on the Home Buying Process: Part One</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikbaRm7pxMM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we’re coming at you with a two-part series, where we answer the question “What happens when the agent becomes the buyer?” &lt;a href=&quot;/gaining-a-new-perspective-on-the-home-buying-process-part-two.html&quot;&gt;For the second part of this series, click here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what exactly happens when the agent becomes the buyer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Popp, our transaction coordinator and operations manager, is purchasing a property right now, which means he’s going through all the same steps our clients go through when buying a home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, Paul’s been calm where he didn’t expect to be calm and feeling different emotions in situations he thought he’d know how to handle better. &lt;strong&gt;Being in the same shoes as you are has helped him understand the process better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=This experience has been invaluable to Paul as an agent.%20http://carterpropertygroupblog.com/gaining-a-new-perspective-on-the-home-buying-process-part-one.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“This experience has been invaluable to Paul as an agent.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s been unique,” he says. “It’s a constant reminder of where our clients are at different stages of the process and how those stages are being influenced, either by the other agent, the seller in this situation, the home inspector, timeliness of response—all of that stuff is really kind of communicated in a heavy, tangible way what our clients are going through.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of documentation buyers have to provide to their lenders has stood out as the most vivid part of the process for him. As easy as lenders make that exchange, he’s found that it can still be tense as far as the level of detailed knowledge they have about you. Once he finished getting pre-approved and entered negotiations, keeping his end-goal in mind helped him deal with the emotions of that situation and navigate all the hypothetical scenarios that arose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Continually coming back to the goal made it crystal clear what we were trying to accomplish.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next part, we’ll discuss what happens during the home inspection. &lt;a href=&quot;/gaining-a-new-perspective-on-the-home-buying-process-part-two.html&quot;&gt;To watch the second video in this series, click here&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, if you have any questions or are looking to buy or sell a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Investing in Short Term Rental Properties: Part Two</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0b1klbVLTis&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Part Two of our series on investing in short-term rentals. Joining me again is Rees , a client of ours who has recently used short-term rentals in her investing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/investing-in-short-term-rental-properties-part-one.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To watch the first part in this series, click here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the first part of this series, Rees explained the return she received on this investment.&lt;/strong&gt; Initially, returns were in the single digits. From a percentage standpoint, though, short-term rentals produced a 50% higher return than long-term rentals. Her family also decided to outsource the management of these properties, so they hired a company who handles the management of similar internal units, and that 50% was after that management company’s fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to managing the property itself, her workload has decreased because their management company, like most management companies, has a handyman on call for maintenance issues within short-term properties. Many people wonder how much time they’ll have to devote to managing residential rental property, and the answer is usually less than you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Always have a good team in place when investing in short-term rentals%20http://carterpropertygroupblog.com/investing-in-short-term-rental-properties-part-two.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Always have a good team in place when investing in short-term rentals”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rees has two main points of advice for anyone thinking about buying an investment property.&lt;/strong&gt; The first is to leave a little bit of a buffer from a dollar standpoint, especially with short-term rentals. This is because there is a little bit of upfront capital investment required, and issues can arise that you’ll need money set aside for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s also critical to have a good team in place.&lt;/strong&gt; Rees had a great real estate attorney and a home inspector working for her, and they advised her against buying a different property that would’ve caused her a lot of headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Investing in Short Term Rental Properties: Part One</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/e2qWEOXQ6r4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we’re coming at you with a two-part series, where we take a much deeper dive into the topic of short-term rentals. &lt;a href=&quot;/investing-in-short-term-rental-properties-part-two.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the second part of this series, click here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To discuss how short-term rentals can make a wise real estate investment strategy, we’ve brought in Rees, a client of ours who’s recently found success investing in short-term rentals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rees had a few goals in mind when she got into real estate investing&lt;/strong&gt;. Though she wasn’t initially thrilled about the idea, after a few conversations with us, it became clear to her that it was a great option to add to the current investments she has from a diversification standpoint. She also considered it important to gain some passive income in addition to her job. On a more personal note, it was important for her to have an investment dedicated to the medical needs of her son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=From a percentage standpoint, though, short-term rentals produced a 50% higher return than long-term rentals.%20http://carterpropertygroupblog.com/investing-in-short-term-rental-properties-part-one.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“From a percentage standpoint, though, short-term rentals produced a 50% higher return than long-term rentals.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify, whereas “active income” is whatever comes from your primary occupation, “passive income” is typically the category where real estate investing falls, and that’s the way the IRS categorizes it as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rees was initially looking for multi-unit properties (specifically three-unit) with long-term renters, and she was identifying them specifically based on whether they would be a good investment numbers-wise and make sense from their return perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One property in particular came up that was significantly higher in return.&lt;/strong&gt; That property had one of its three units as a short-term rental. She then realized that short-term rentals could be applied to other three-unit properties with long-term renters. &lt;strong&gt;Once she was able to take that idea and apply it to other properties, several more options became available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, returns were in the single digits. From a percentage standpoint, though, short-term rentals produced a 50% higher return than long-term rentals. Her family also decided to outsource the management of these properties, so they hired a company who handles the management of similar internal units, and that 50% was after that management company’s fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to thank Rees for joining us today to help us explore the topic of short-term rentals! &lt;a href=&quot;/investing-in-short-term-rental-properties-part-two.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re considering investing in short term real estate, we encourage you to watch the second part of this series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where we discuss what it takes to manage an investment property, and give advice to those looking to diversify their investments with real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
