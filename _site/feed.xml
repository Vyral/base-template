        <title>What’s Happening in the Hoboken Real Estate Market?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/llQScLP7syo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, a lot of people are asking, “Are we approaching another real estate bubble?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here in Hoboken, the market trends are not pointing to another bubble&lt;/strong&gt;. Right now, there is enough equity built into homes that we should be able to sustain any interruption in the market or any decrease in pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, real estate trends on a seven-year scale. Since we are reaching the latter end of the scale, it makes sense that we’re starting to see a bit of a slowdown in the market, as well as an increase in the absorption rate this year as opposed to last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the higher end of the market, specifically above the $1.25 million price point, properties are staying on the market longer and the list to sales price ratio has gone down over the last year and a half. We are starting to see a similar trend in the higher hundred-thousand dollar price range, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=In the higher end of the market, we are seeing a bit of a slowdown.%20localhost:4000/whats-happening-in-the-hoboken-real-estate-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“In the higher end of the market, we are seeing a bit of a slowdown.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interest rates will also play a major part in our market&lt;/strong&gt; for the next six months to a year. The Fed is expected to raise rates again in the third quarter. However, positive job numbers should ease off some of the bond buying in our market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a slight uptick in inventory. Due to a huge build up in rental properties along River Road and in downtown Jersey City, investors and landlords have seen a negative impact on their bottom line, as some of these investors have had to lower their rental prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, every situation is different. If you have any questions about buying, selling, or investing in our market, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;
