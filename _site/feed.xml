        <title>An Exciting New Addition to Our Team: the Peer Pay Program</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJ72BaM3rA4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently implemented a new program called Peer Pay on our team, and I want to tell you all about how it works. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept behind Peer Pay is that &lt;strong&gt;each team member gets a sum of money that they can reward other team members with throughout the year.&lt;/strong&gt; In our case, each member of the Wolek Group received $500 of what I call “TWG Peer Pay Bucks” to give to their peers. By the end of the year, they must distribute all of their money to other team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I think this program fits great with our team culture.%20http://yourjourneywithjennie.com/an-exciting-new-addition-to-our-team-the-peer-pay-program.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“I think this program fits great with our team culture.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the kicker: Each reward must be done in private. This is because we don’t want to hinder other team members from rewarding the same person. If they’re awesome enough, they should get all the money they deserve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think this program fits great with our team culture, and I’m excited to share the results with you later on.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have other ideas about how to build a sense of community within your team or business, I invite you to share them with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, if you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to call or email me anytime. I’d love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Follow This Script to Make a Great First Impression With Your Database</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/HgWRcP0EgmY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every one of us has a database. Whether it’s Facebook friends or the contacts on our phone, all of us have people we can reach out to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know the value of establishing a great foundation for your business based on your database, so we have a script you can use to introduce yourself to your database. &lt;strong&gt;This is the follow-up script my team uses to call people after we’ve done the Facebook exercise that I mentioned in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://yourjourneywithjennie.com/how-to-use-facebook-to-grow-your-database.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;previous video:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Hey, it’s (name) with the Wolek Group! How are things going? I’m so excited—I started my new job and I’m just calling all my friends and family to let them know it’s official. I am now in real estate with the Wolek Group.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on who you’re talking to, there are three different ways you can continue with the script, but here’s how I’ll continue in this example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;You know, I’ve been looking forward to this for awhile. I mean, the Wolek Group loves helping buyers and sellers and they helped over 100 families last year. I would love to mail you some of my business cards when they come in. I want to make sure you have them in case you hear of anyone who may be looking to buy, sell, or invest in real estate. My team covers all of Metro Tulsa, so no matter where they may be moving, I can help. I have your email address, but may I also have your home address?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=There is a purpose behind this script, and it keeps you focused.%20http://yourjourneywithjennie.com/follow-this-script-to-make-a-great-first-impression-with-your-database.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“There is a purpose behind this script, and it keeps you focused.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to ask for a piece of contact information—they will always give it to you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I just want to make sure I have the best contact info for you. Obviously I would love to be your new resource for all things real estate. Also, if you hear of someone moving out of the area, we have a huge database of agents all over the world, so I can help them get in touch with an excellent agent anywhere. Either way, please keep me in mind. Since real estate is referral-based business, I really appreciate your support. As soon as my cards come in, I’ll get you one. Thank you so much! Well, I’ll let you get back to work—I’m sure you are super busy. Great talking with you, and tell Mary (or whoever) I said hi.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of this script is to follow it so you don’t get off track. It’s really easy to get distracted, so &lt;strong&gt;stay in line with the words.&lt;/strong&gt; There is a purpose behind this script, and it keeps you focused. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, you really need to share your enthusiasm. The people you’re calling already know, like, and trust you, and they want to support you. Be comfortable asking for contact information and don’t get sidetracked by wondering if you’re bugging them or not, or if they think you’re too pushy or sales-ey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, make sure you get the best possible contact information from them. You’re building a business, and that starts with building a foundation based on your database. We’re in a relationship-based business, and you need lots of relationships in order to have a big business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you use this script, feel free to reach out to me and let me know how it’s working out for you. If you have any questions about it or there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to call or email me anytime. I’d be happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Use Facebook to Grow Your Database</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oIMzrSGTgtc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you looking to build up your database? I recently got a great idea of how to do just that from my friend, business coach, and trainer: Brian Eisenhower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a team, he taught us &lt;strong&gt;a fun trick and tool to build your database by simply using Facebook.&lt;/strong&gt; More than likely, you’re already on there, so why not make it purposeful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get on your smartphone and go into your Facebook mobile app. From there, go to your profile page and you’ll find your friends list in ascending order. Eventually, &lt;strong&gt;you’ll create a private message to send out to your friends list, but remember Facebook’s regulations—you’ll get into trouble if you send a message to too many people.&lt;/strong&gt; The way around this barrier is to send your message out to 20 people a day, just to avoid “Facebook jail.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as what this message contains, make it generic since you’ll be copying and pasting it. Here’s the script that I use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Keep your message short and sweet.%20http://yourjourneywithjennie.com/how-to-use-facebook-to-grow-your-database.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Keep your message short and sweet.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey, it’s Jennie. How have you been? I’m updating my real estate database and I’d like to send real estate info from time to time. My real estate business was amazing last year.” Or, as an alternative to that line, “I’m new to real estate and I need to be better about staying in touch with people I know. Would you mind replying with your home address, phone number, and email to help me out?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep your message short and sweet. It’s amazing; &lt;strong&gt;people actually respond,&lt;/strong&gt; and these are your Facebook friends, so it’s likely that they know you and want to support you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use this tip to build your database. I’ve found that even though you might be an agent who’s been in business for a while, &lt;strong&gt;you might be missing out if you’re not utilizing Facebook to expand your reach.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or thoughts about this approach, please reach out to me. If you give it a try, I’d love to hear your results as well!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Relationship Patterns Influence Our Business</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/i7-TJKBaSQA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you keep track of relationship patterns, you’ll see that making one contact can lead to a windfall of transactions down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look in the video above, you’ll see I’m holding a piece of paper I’m really proud of that I want to share with you. It’s a flowchart of a relationship pattern my team and me have been tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this shows me is that &lt;strong&gt;making one contact, making one relationship, and helping one family with their relationship needs can lead to over 30 other transactions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take those 30 units and multiply them by our average commission of—let’s say—$5,000, that’s over $300,000 of gross commission income we can bring in as a team, all by being purposeful and having a database that applies systemized touches. And, it’s fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=GIVE THANKS TO THE PEOPLE WHO HELP YOU WITH YOUR BUSINESS.%20http://yourjourneywithjennie.com/tulsa-real-estate-agent-do-you-know-where-your-business-comes-from.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“GIVE THANKS TO THE PEOPLE WHO HELP YOU WITH YOUR BUSINESS.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;strong&gt;make sure you notice relationship patterns.&lt;/strong&gt; The reason I was reminded to share this with you is that Nate, one of our sales associates, has been working with some new clients buy and sell homes, and we retraced those transactions to a friend I went to college with whom we helped buy and sell a home last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sign in the yard led to another listing across the street, which led to an open house guest, which led to four other families we now get to help. Celebrate these kinds of patterns and don’t forget to reward the people who help you with your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any questions or there’s anything else I can assist you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Train Your Referral Partners</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/47iQ0WJRfao?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure that your family, friends, and clients all know the best way to refer you to a potential client. Here are a few tips to help them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can you make sure that when people refer you, they’re doing it correctly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had a past client, friend, or family member tell you that they’ve given so-and-so one of your business cards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those situations, I’m always very appreciative. However, there is an issue with that sort of referral. If the person who received the card is anything like me, &lt;strong&gt;they’ll eventually lose the card.&lt;/strong&gt; I like to tell the friend or client who gave them my card to call, text, or email me. The last thing we would ever want is for that person to end up with a weak agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we just need to remind our friends and family how they should refer us to them. One script that I love is Mick Hick’s “The Promise.” It’s a great foundation and piece to add to your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=SOMETIMES, WE JUST NEED TO REMIND OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY HOW THEY SHOULD REFER US TO THEM.%20http://yourjourneywithjennie.com/tulsa-real-estate-agent-teaching-others-how-to-refer-your-business.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“SOMETIMES, WE JUST NEED TO REMIND OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY HOW THEY SHOULD REFER US TO THEM.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• “The idea is, during the process of us working together, you will likely hear of other people talking about buying and selling real estate. In that time—between now and when we get to closing—we sure would appreciate if you would give me a call when you hear of anybody that’s thinking about buying or selling.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• “[…]What I’m asking for is for you to take the next step to make sure that I have the chance to help. In addition to giving my name out, please call, text, or email me their information, because then, I’ll know that there’s a 100% chance that I’ll get in touch with them. This could even be if they’re thinking about refinancing or if they have a general question about real estate. Let me be the real estate expert and reach out to them, because I love helping you and I sure love helping your friends, as well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing referrals is a great way to build our business. It’s what we do—we help people and build relationships. &lt;strong&gt;Make sure to gather the information of the referring person;&lt;/strong&gt; we’re not going to bug them. We’re just going to gently reach out and let them know that we heard they were looking for real estate help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. I’m happy to give you advice on how to improve your practices.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Being Accountable is the Key to Success</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cv6mwdaF75s?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accountability is an essential quality for any successful real estate agent.
Take it from my friend, Ricky Cain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m at the Keller Williams Realty Southwest market center with Ricky Cain of The Cain Team of Austin. Today, Ricky is going to talk with us about being accountable as an agent. Accountability is the most important thing you can do to ensure your success, Ricky says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It starts by being accountable to a time-blocked schedule. &lt;strong&gt;That way, you can accomplish the things that you need to get done when you need to get them done.&lt;/strong&gt; If it’s not in your schedule, it doesn’t exist. That’s a big BOLD principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to being accountable to your schedule, you need to be accountable to your goals. Break them down to weekly and monthly goals, starting with a “1-3-5” or a “GPS” where you are breaking down the one thing that you absolutely have to accomplish this year that will make it the best year you ever had, then breaking it down to those three primary actions and five secondary actions within those primary actions that you intend on completing. Then, create a 4-1-1 plan that incorporates your 1-3-5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=ACCOUNTABILITY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOL FOR YOUR SUCCESS.%20http://yourjourneywithjennie.com/tulsa-real-estate-agent-how-to-hold-yourself-accountable.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“ACCOUNTABILITY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOL FOR YOUR SUCCESS.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That all sounds easy and good, but who is going to hold you accountable to staying on track?&lt;/strong&gt; For us, it’s our MAPS coaches, our family, and ourselves. You need all three to maximize your productivity. It’s better to stick to a plan and have your goals exceeded than try to fit everything else in on the side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This information all comes from “The One Thing” by Gary Keller. If you haven’t read it yet, stop what you’re doing and read it now. They also have some great podcast and webinars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Rick for joining us today. If you need any help in Austin, send him an email to Ricky@TheCainTeam.com. If you need anything else, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Removing Limiting Beliefs Can Change Your Life</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdNeHzYB6Mw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By removing limiting beliefs, just like I did, you can live your life more productively and more fiercely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every single day, we make choices about what we’ll allow into our brains, what we absorb, and how we’ll react to life. When it comes to these choices, it’s important that we remove limiting beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember that my mind first expanded and adopted this concept back in 2010 at a BOLD class when I started thinking about the possibilities of living a life by design instead of default. That’s when I started thinking about life in terms of “I can,” and “I am,” and I started having daily positive affirmations to feed myself positive vibes and thoughts that allowed me to currently live more productively and more fearlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before that, I had limiting beliefs about myself—either because I didn’t have the same experience as other agents, the same amount of money as them, or that certain “thing” that allowed them to be confident. I just didn’t feel the same thing inside me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember thinking the same thought so many other agents have every single day: I don’t want to bug them. &lt;strong&gt;Shifting my mind from “I don’t want to bug them” to “I’m really great at helping people—how many people do I get to help today?” changed everything for me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO DO DAILY TO REMOVE YOUR LIMITING BELIEFS.%20http://yourjourneywithjennie.com/how-removing-limiting-beliefs-can-change-your-life.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO DO DAILY TO REMOVE YOUR LIMITING BELIEFS.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At my first BOLD class, I remember that the thought of talking to 20 people in a single day physically made me want to vomit. That’s because I was living in fear of what they might think about me or how I might be intruding on their day. Then I realized that after I connected with them, they were happy to hear from me! If they weren’t, that was OK too. That’s none of my business, and they don’t know me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you switch your thinking to “I don’t want to bug them” to “I’m great at helping people,” I promise you’ll be able to remove your limiting beliefs, at least in regards to helping people. After all, we’re in the business of helping people—the relationship-building business. If you don’t have relationships, you don’t have a business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do whatever you have to do on a daily basis to remove your limiting beliefs,&lt;/strong&gt; whether it’s positive affirmations, journaling the things you’re good at, etc. Have accountability around those things as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about limiting beliefs our you’d like to talk with me about any “drunk monkeys” that get in your way, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Are All Successful Agents Learning-Based?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XNSgl7KgbLU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s always more to learn as a real estate agent. Here are just a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited to be joined today by my amazing friend, Jessica Starr, a Keller Williams agent out of Connecticut and Lower Massachusetts. I talked to her a little bit about why being learning-based is so important as an agent, as well as about some of the different trainings and learning opportunities that KW offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessica’s favorite course is probably BOLD, judging by the fact that she’s taken it a dozen times. There are so many different opportunities out there for KW agents, though, that &lt;strong&gt;Jessica says you should start building a plan for all the events you want to attend in December or January.&lt;/strong&gt; Take a look at the training calendars in your office, then determine which ones you want to attend. Jessica advises booking KW Family Reunion and Mega Camp first. A few other courses that Jessica recommends are Quantum Leap and the Language of Sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=ALL SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE ARE LEARNING-BASED.%20http://yourjourneywithjennie.com/tulsa-real-estate-agent-the-benefits-of-being-a-learning-based-agent.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“ALL SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE ARE LEARNING-BASED.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also make it a point to attend a few masterminds. They can be a game changer. &lt;strong&gt;When you’re working with people who are doing things at a high level, the conversations and relationships you build are huge and can help you out for the rest of your career.&lt;/strong&gt; Even though it’s a cost to attend, the referrals alone that you’ll get from other agents make it worth the price of admission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that all successful people are learning-based. Jessica and I actually filmed the video above at a Mastermind event in Chicago. If you or someone you know needs real estate assistance in Connecticut or Massachusetts, give her a call at (860) 761-3765 or send her an email to StarrRealtyGroup@gmail.com.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Going From E to P Can Help You Burst Through Your Ceiling of Achievement</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/95OZodJH6wU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going from E to P changed Scott Klaas’ life for the better, and it can do the same for you.
Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here at my latest mastermind trip, we’ve been talking about Keller Williams’ six personal perspectives. One of those perspectives I want to share with you is going from E to P, and I’m happy to be joined by fellow agent Scott Klaas from Wisconsin and have him explain how this perspective had a positive impact on him and his business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The E in this perspective means “entrepreneurial.” Your natural ability, energy level, and anything else you can naturally do has a ceiling of achievement, and &lt;strong&gt;the only way to bust through that ceiling of achievement is to go to P, which means “purposeful.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hearing that for the first time changed Scott’s life. Now everything he does has to have a system, a model, and it has to have leverage behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Those three things will break you through your ceiling of achievement,” he says. “And then that ceiling will become your new floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=WHEN YOU KEEP BUSTING YOUR HEAD AGAINST THE CEILING, YOU NEED MORE LEVERAGE AND BETTER SYSTEMS AND MODELS.%20http://yourjourneywithjennie.com/tulsa-real-estate-agent-going-from-e-to-p-with-scott-klaas.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“WHEN YOU KEEP BUSTING YOUR HEAD AGAINST THE CEILING, YOU NEED MORE LEVERAGE AND BETTER SYSTEMS AND MODELS.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, you can move toward your next level of achievement. When you keep busting your head against the ceiling, you need more leverage and better systems and models. From there, you can keep going up and up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are some ways to increase your ceiling?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Scott, going from E to P is about having a better life. He was working nonstop 16- and 18-hour days with 10 to 20 deals always under contract. He was always dealing with something wrong, or some headache, or always putting out fires, and he was never present anywhere. &lt;strong&gt;When you get purposeful, you have other people take some of those responsibilities, and you time block extremely well. It frees up your nights and weekends and helps every area of your life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to get in touch with Scott or you’d like to send a referral his way, you can reach him on Facebook, call him at (414) 795-6675, or send him an email at sklaas@kw.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to speak with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Prioritizing Your Time to Maximize Your Outcomes</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/m6RJrB1EhQE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the 80/20 principle, we can ensure that we’re prioritizing our time to be sure that our money-producing activities are handled before everything else, which sets us up for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to continue my discussion of the six personal perspectives by focusing on another of them: the 80/20 principle. It shows up time and time again in our lives and in our businesses, and I really believe that there’s so much truth behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pareto’s principle states that 20% of our activities will produce 80% of our results.&lt;/strong&gt; Simply put, not everything we do is equally as important. Because others have gone before us and done the research, we know that we need to &lt;strong&gt;do our most dollar-productive activities in the morning&lt;/strong&gt; to make sure those things get done because that will help determine our success in our business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real estate agents and salespeople of any kind all have the same job descriptions:
• Lead generation
• Lead follow-up
• Go on appointments and negotiate contracts
• Practice and roleplay&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually reword these and put them in the order of how my day usually goes. So instead, I would say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• 8:30 a.m.—Practice and roleplay
• 9:00 a.m. to 11 a.m.—Lead generate
• 11 a.m. to noon—Lead follow-up
• Afternoon—Go to appointments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=PARETO’S PRINCIPLE STATES THAT 20% OF OUR ACTIVITIES WILL PRODUCE 80% OF OUR RESULTS.%20http://yourjourneywithjennie.com/tulsa-real-estate-agent-the-80-20-principle-use-this-principle-to-change-your-business.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“PARETO’S PRINCIPLE STATES THAT 20% OF OUR ACTIVITIES WILL PRODUCE 80% OF OUR RESULTS.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s crazy how this works and when you set accountability around it, it starts showing up, and your perfect calendar does start to come true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2015, I took BOLD four times in a row. I did that because I knew I had to get into action and get things back on track for my business and for my team. During that time, I had five different role play partners, with a different partner to work with at 8:30 a.m. every morning in a different city. &lt;strong&gt;That really helped increase my ability to talk better, know my scripts, be better at objection handlers, and it’s also a great way to connect with agents across the country.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After practice and roleplay, I would go into my 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. lead generation. Early on with the new coach that I had, he required that I send him a text every morning at 9 a.m. when I got into my database. By sending that text every morning, I was certain to open my database to see who I needed to call to get into action and get busy. That one little text I sent every morning has changed my business over the past couple years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think about what you are spending your time on all day long.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re still a single agent, that’s super great—just make sure you’re doing your most dollar-productive activities in the morning. Everything else like setting appointments, making flyers, and doing inspections can all be done in the afternoon, after you’ve ensured that your money-making activities have been taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know how you focus on your 20%; I’d love to hear about it. For any other questions, feel free to contact me by phone or email. Have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;
