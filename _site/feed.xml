&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you looking to buy, sell, or rent a home? No matter what your real estate dreams are, we can help.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to sell your Austin Home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://anew.exprealty.com/sell/default&quot;&gt;Get a FREE home value report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Want to buy an Austin Home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://anew.exprealty.com/search&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I wanted to reach out to you and see what we can do to help you with your dreams of moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know that moving can seem like an overwhelming task.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether you’re renting or buying a new place, gearing up for a move is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I can help you through this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are buying a home, my services are free. I know what it takes to coordinate a big move. I can even help you sell your current home and move at the same time; a lot of buyers need to sell before they can buy another property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have developed some proven strategies over the past 17 years&lt;/strong&gt; that will help you get top dollar for your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I HAVE DEVELOPED PROVEN STRATEGIES TO HELP YOU GET TOP DOLLAR FOR YOUR HOME.%20localhost:4000/how-can-we-help-you-achieve-your-real.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“I HAVE DEVELOPED PROVEN STRATEGIES TO HELP YOU GET TOP DOLLAR FOR YOUR HOME.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you are renting in today’s market, I can help you out. Rentals are pretty hard to come by these days, unless you are looking for an apartment. If you’re looking for a smaller home to rent, that market is as hot as the sales market, and those homes go pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We also have a great network of real estate agents around the country,&lt;/strong&gt; so we can help you whether you are moving locally or out of the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you happen to know of anyone or you yourself are thinking of moving, just give us a call. We would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What's Going on in Our Market Today?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JMQWKn6q7Mc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now that we’re halfway through the year, it’s time for a market update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to sell your Austin Home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://anew.exprealty.com/sell/default&quot;&gt;Get a FREE home value report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Want to buy an Austin Home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://anew.exprealty.com/search&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m out at the Play Shop, where I’ve just found some real estate statistics for our Austin, Texas area for the month of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in Austin, the median home price has gone up 4% year over year from last June. The price that homes are selling for, on average, is now $303,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember to think of this number as a halfway point — &lt;strong&gt;half of homes will sell above this price, and half will sell below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=WE’RE SEEING A FEW NUMBERS THAT HAVE GONE UP FROM THIS TIME LAST YEAR.%20localhost:4000/whats-going-on-in-our-market-today.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“WE’RE SEEING A FEW NUMBERS THAT HAVE GONE UP FROM THIS TIME LAST YEAR.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, we’re seeing a few numbers that have gone up from this time last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, our average days on market is 16 days—meaning that number is up 14% from what we saw this time last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total sales, though, are down 3% from last year—$3,656 for the month of June. But, the &lt;strong&gt;average price per square foot is currently $182, and some new builders are doing even better than that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or want more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Get Your Home Sold If You Have a Pet</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PlJ7_E3qcMs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you have a pet and you’re looking to sell your home, then read on for some helpful advice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to sell your Austin Home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://anew.exprealty.com/sell/default&quot;&gt;Get a FREE home value report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Want to buy an Austin Home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://anew.exprealty.com/search&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is, many homebuyers are looking for a pet-friendly home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two out of three of us have a pet, and 61% of pet owners say they have trouble finding a home that is a good match for their pet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, a recent survey estimates that 31% of animal owners frequently don’t put in an offer because a home would not suit their pet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that if your home is a good match for a pet, it will be attractive to a large pool of dedicated animal owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, 67% of Realtors also estimate that actually having a pet in your home can make it harder for you to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what can you do? Here are three things I typically recommend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Repair any damage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Floors, walls, doors, the yard — these are some typical areas that pets love to chew, scratch, and dig up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repairing this damage is an investment that will pay for itself many times over in terms of a higher selling price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=PET OWNERS ARE LESS SENSITIVE TO ODORS IN THEIR HOME THAN PROSPECTIVE BUYERS ARE.%20localhost:4000/how-to-get-your-home-sold-if-you-have.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“PET OWNERS ARE LESS SENSITIVE TO ODORS IN THEIR HOME THAN PROSPECTIVE BUYERS ARE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Get a professional to remove pet odors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many pet owners are less sensitive to odors in their home than prospective buyers will be.
That’s why you should hire a professional cleaning crew to clean any carpets, rugs, or upholstery that have absorbed pet odors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’re done with the cleaning, ask a friend or your Realtor for a sniff assessment to make sure the job is really complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Take your pet out during showings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people are afraid of animals. Others are allergic. And regardless of the time, money, and effort you’ve put in to clean and repair your home, many buyers will be prejudiced by knowing that a pet currently lives there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I recommend taking your pet out during showings and also removing any pet objects such as toys, food bowls, or scratching posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By following these three simple guidelines, &lt;strong&gt;you will be able to sell your home for top dollar, whether the buyer is a pet owner or not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in case you have any questions or concerns about preparing your home for a sale, give me a call. I’m here to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Zillows Day in Court Says About Their Zestimate</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jGCf1VxBXgo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zillow is being sued by a disgruntled homeowner, and the reason why will tell you everything you need to know about their Zestimates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to sell your Austin Home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://anew.exprealty.com/sell/default&quot;&gt;Get a FREE home value report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Want to buy an Austin Home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://anew.exprealty.com/search&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you haven’t heard, &lt;strong&gt;a recent lawsuit was filed against Zillow by an Illinois homeowner and it’s causing ripples in the real estate industry.&lt;/strong&gt; How does this affect you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let me start by saying I’m not here to hate on Zillow like so many other agents do. I actually love Zillow, and many of the clients I have today first got in contact with me after reading my reviews on Zillow. I think they do a great job of mapping out neighborhoods and providing information about certain areas, school districts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the homeowner in this lawsuit claims her home is valued at $626,000, but Zillow values it at $562,000, which is a $64,000 difference. This woman feels that the typical buyer will feel that her home is worth less because of its Zestimate. Zillow responded by saying that a Zestimate is just a starting point to determine value, and it’s not an official appraisal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even well-known real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran of ABC’s “Shark Tank” chimed in on the matter on “Good Morning America,” which you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/zillow-faces-lawsuit-zestimate-tool-47341951&quot;&gt;watch here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you start your online home search, Zillow is a website you’ll likely land on because they do a great job capturing nearly 64% of all real estate-related web traffic. Is it a good start for determining the value of your home, though?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barbara Corcoran says that &lt;strong&gt;it’s a starting point, but not a reliable starting point,&lt;/strong&gt; which I agree with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=ZILLOW IS A STARTING POINT FOR HOME VALUE, BUT NOT A RELIABLE STARTING POINT.%20localhost:4000/what-zillows-day-in-court-says-about.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“ZILLOW IS A STARTING POINT FOR HOME VALUE, BUT NOT A RELIABLE STARTING POINT.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may not know this, but Zillow admits that its fault factor is around 5.6%. That means that less than half of the values in a given area are less than that fault factor percentage and half are even further off. To put that into perspective, on a $250,000 house, that’s a $14,000 difference one way or the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Texas, Zillow doesn’t even offer a percentage of error because we’re a non-disclosure state, meaning our sales prices aren’t publicly disclosed at closing. You need to hire a professional to get that information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff is opening up their platform and offering a $1 million prize to any person or team who can improve their algorithm. I encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity if you think you can do so. In the meantime, &lt;strong&gt;if you really want to know the value of your home, call me.&lt;/strong&gt; My team and I can put our experience of selling hundreds of homes over the years to good use so you can sell your home for the most money in the shortest amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Whats the Difference Between an Appraisal and an Inspection? </title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sxna9_a3c_A?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How are home inspections and appraisals different? Melanie Taliaferro from SWBC Mortgage joins me to explain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to sell your Austin Home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://anew.exprealty.com/sell/default&quot;&gt;Get a FREE home value report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Want to buy an Austin Home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://anew.exprealty.com/search&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the difference between an appraisal and an inspection? Melanie Taliaferro from SWBC Mortgage joins me today to explain this a little more fully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you make an offer on a house, there is something called the ‘option period.’ During that time, you have the opportunity to do your due diligence as a buyer. You should always hire a licensed home inspector to come in and do an inspection on the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A licensed home inspector will check everything from the roof to the foundation.&lt;/strong&gt; If there is a major issue with your air conditioner, roof, or any other system in the house, then the home inspector may recommend that you get a specialist’s opinion. The inspector will also give you a 50-page report of everything they found in the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people use the terms ‘inspection’ and ‘appraisal’ interchangeably, which makes things confusing. However, the appraisal is very different from the home inspection. After you order the home inspection and decide you want to move forward with the purchase, the lender will require you to order an appraisal. This happens after the option period because you have completed your due diligence and decided that you want to buy the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=THE LENDER WILL ORDER THE APPRAISAL AFTER THE OPTION PERIOD HAS ENDED.%20localhost:4000/whats-difference-between-appraisal-and.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“THE LENDER WILL ORDER THE APPRAISAL AFTER THE OPTION PERIOD HAS ENDED.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the appraisal, a licensed appraiser will come out to inspect the property. They won’t do a true, detailed inspection like the home inspector did. The appraiser is just there to provide an opinion of the value of the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The appraiser will pull comparable sales&lt;/strong&gt; of similar homes within a half-mile radius from the last six months to see if the purchase price matches the market value of the home. The appraiser looks for similar-sized homes with similar amenities in order to make that decision. The appraiser will then tell the lender whether or not the market value of the home matches the purchase price you and the seller have already agreed upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appraiser may also recommend certain repairs. If something comes up in the appraisal affecting the safety or livability of the property, then the appraisal will be subject to repairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, although appraisals and inspections are very similar, the appraisal is the biggest piece of our property approval process. The main difference is that the inspection is part of the buyer’s due diligence while the appraisal has more to do with the lending side, getting a loan, and making sure that the investment is worth its value.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Difference Between Being Pre-Approved and Pre-Qualified </title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PIjiV4wwSRY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is the difference between being pre-approved and pre-qualified for a mortgage? Melanie Taliaferro from SWBC Mortgage is here to answer that today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m joined by Melanie Taliaferro from SWBC mortgage to answer the question, “What is the difference between being pre-approved and pre-qualified?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People use the terms pre-approved and pre-qualified interchangeably when it comes to mortgages, but there is definitely a difference.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pre-qualification can be as little as a verbal conversation with a borrower in which the lender asks about income and credit then tells the borrower based on their answers that they are pre-qualified for a home loan. That confirmation can be verbal or in writing, and the strength of a pre-qualification can range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A true pre-approval means that a lender has not only gotten a written loan application, but has also pulled your credit report and evaluated your income and assets&lt;/strong&gt; to get an overview of your whole financial picture before issuing a pre-approval letter. Having a pre-approval letter, then, will make your offer much stronger and put you in a position to beat out someone who might have only been pre-qualified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=A PRE-APPROVAL LETTER WILL ALWAYS MAKE YOUR OFFER STRONGER.%20localhost:4000/the-difference-between-being-pre.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“A PRE-APPROVAL LETTER WILL ALWAYS MAKE YOUR OFFER STRONGER.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
