        <title>A Retrospective on Our 2017 Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dXzpR9eJSdM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now that the new year is upon us, I’d like to take a moment to review our 2017 market.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that 2017 is behind us, I’d like to go over a quick review of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few statistics I’d like to focus on, specifically. The first is the median number of days homes spent on the market in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to 2016, &lt;strong&gt;the number of days homes spent on the market was virtually unchanged in 2017. &lt;/strong&gt;At the end of the year, the median days on market was 18. This is still a historic low for that statistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another statistic that remained nearly identical to what we saw in 2016 was the number of homes sold. In 2017, a total of 45,630 homes were sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the number of new listings that came on the market, there were 61,102 in 2017. This number is up approximately 1% from what we saw in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Appreciation is likely going to see a slowdown in 2018.%20http://www.canovogroup.tv/a-retrospective-on-our-2017-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Appreciation is likely going to see a slowdown in 2018.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Median sales price, though, saw considerably more change. &lt;strong&gt;This statistic was up from 2016 by more than 8% in 2017.&lt;/strong&gt; In 2017, the median sales price at the end of the year was $267,970.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had another phenomenal year in terms of appreciation. 2017 outpaced the previous two years. But as far as 2018 goes, I anticipate that we’ll see a slowdown in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One statistic we saw in 2017 that I found particularly interesting was the median asking price. At the end of the year, the median asking price was $294,000. This is up nearly 11% from 2016. In other words, &lt;strong&gt;there was a big difference in 2017 between what sellers were asking for and what homes were actually selling for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Makes the Holidays a Great Time to List?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PqtqwZXivi0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contrary to popular belief, the holiday season can be a great time to list. Here are a few reasons why.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people hesitate at the idea of listing over the holiday season. Today, I’d like to address some of the reasons why selling during this time of year might actually be beneficial. To help me cover the subject, I’m joined by top agent Ali Garbero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A key benefit in listing at this time of year is that the market is full of motivated buyers.&lt;/strong&gt; People searching for a new home at this time of year are very serious about doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, holiday listings see a much lower level of competition. There isn’t a ton of inventory available during these later months, so your home is going to be one of a small number of available homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Between the low level of inventory and high level of motivated buyers, the holiday season creates the perfect conditions for you to obtain top dollar.%20http://www.canovogroup.tv/what-makes-the-holidays-a-great-time-to-list.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Between the low level of inventory and high level of motivated buyers, the holiday season creates the perfect conditions for you to obtain top dollar.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the snow begins to fly, there won’t be any looky-loos hanging around in the market. &lt;strong&gt;Buyers who are willing to face inclement weather to look for homes this winter are truly motivated.&lt;/strong&gt; Between the low level of inventory and high level of motivated buyers, the holiday season creates the perfect conditions for you to obtain top dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, landscaping costs can really add up when listing in the spring or summer. In winter, however, you can really take advantage of the weather and focus on the interior of your home, instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Has Our Market Changed Over the Years?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8CYCrwtStB0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How has the market changed since 2006? Let’s take a look back at some market trends from across recent years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How has our real estate market changed over the recent years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin by looking at the median sales price. After rising consistently in the early 2000s, the median sales price reached an initial peak in the third quarter of 2007 of $216,000. &lt;strong&gt;After that, the median sales price rapidly declined until bottoming out at $173,000 in 2011’s third quarter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, we’ve had a significant increase in median sales price. As of this year’s third quarter, the statistic sat at $270,000. This constitutes a $20,000 increase from just one year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I’d like to share what happened in terms of inventory over that same period of time. The number of homes listed peaked out in 2007’s third quarter at 24,112. In the third quarter of 2012, inventory bottomed out at 12,884. Inventory has risen slightly since then, but has generally stayed fairly level over the past four or five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helps to explain the housing shortage we’ve seen lately. A lot of buyers have come into the market over the last six or seven years &lt;strong&gt;but the number of homes listed hasn’t increased to match demand.&lt;/strong&gt; This has been a major factor in driving up sales price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2006, the number of homes sold was 11,912. The lowest point we’ve seen in recent years occurred in 2010, when only 6,017 homes sold. This statistic peaked last year at 13,019 homes. Since then, the number of homes has dropped for the first time in several years. The decrease was not significant, but is something to keep an eye on as we move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of days homes are spending on the market has remained virtually the same as last year, changing from 15 days in 2016 to 16 days this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, let’s take a look at the percentage of new listings that actually sold. In 2016, 77.55% of all listings that came on the market sold. This percentage is down to 71.08% today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s also important that we look at the median asking price for listings on the market. This doesn’t reflect what homes actually sold for, but instead gives us an idea of what the seller’s asked for. Since last year, this number has seen a significant increase. &lt;strong&gt;In 2016 the median asking price was $265,000. Now, the median asking price is $299,000.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned earlier, homes are actually generally selling at a median price of $270,000. This indicates that many sellers are likely overpricing their properties. This can lead to sellers getting even less in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By all shapes and measures, the market is in a strong place. The economy here in Utah is strong and the unemployment rate is significantly low. This makes it an exciting time to be in the real estate business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=By all shapes and measures, the market is in a strong place.%20http://www.canovogroup.tv/how-has-our-market-changed-over-the-years.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“By all shapes and measures, the market is in a strong place.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>STUDY: For Sale by Owners Don't Save Money</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/X8LkMVClFoE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Collateral Analytics conducted a study that compared homeowners who list For Sale By Owner against those who list with an agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Sklarz, the CEO of Collateral Analytics, co-authored the study with Dr. Norman Miller—a real estate professor at the University of San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the full study was very lengthy, we’ve included it in a PDF that you can find &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://www.inman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/CA-RESEARCH-Saving-Real-Estate-Commissions-at-Any-Price-1.pdf&amp;amp;hl=en_US#101922730&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=For Sale By Owner listings are more work and net less money.%20http://www.canovogroup.tv/study-for-sale-by-owners-dont-save-money.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“For Sale By Owner listings are more work and net less money.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there was one main point uncovered by this study that I want to share with you. According to this study, &lt;strong&gt;For Sale By Owner listings sold for 5.5% less on average when compared to listings sold with a real estate agent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most homeowners who try to list on their own are doing so because they believe it will save money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What many people fail to realize is that listing this way is not only much more work, it also nets less money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Does Our Current Utah Market Look Compared to 2016?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MrhcK5cw6x0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do the latest statistics say about our Utah market compared to 2016?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, our average days on market is 14 days, which is a slight drop from the 15-day average that was recorded this time last year. It’s still amazing that homes are selling this fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of homes that have sold is down 3%. What’s surprising, though, is that compared to 2011, the number of home sales is up 60%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The median sale price has increased 8%. &lt;strong&gt;Compared to 2011, it’s increased by—get this—51%!&lt;/strong&gt; This means if you bought a home in mid-2011, you’re in really good shape right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you bought a home in mid-2011, you’re in really good shape right now.%20http://www.canovogroup.tv/how-does-our-current-utah-market-look-compared-to-2016.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you bought a home in mid-2011, you’re in really good shape right now.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our level of inventory—or the number of new listings that have come on the market—is down 1%. Compared to 2011, though, it’s up 14%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, prices continue to go up, and the average days on market is still really low. Not only that, but interest rates are also really steady. &lt;strong&gt;Overall, the market continues to head in the right direction.&lt;/strong&gt; We believe that in the next 12 to 24 months, though, we will see a leveling out. In the meantime, the shortage of available homes should continue to drive prices up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious about what your home’s worth or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home right now, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why a Discount Brokerage Isn't the Best for Selling Your Home</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DzCW6OByqxc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m with my good friend Ali Garbero, who is a listing specialist on our team. She’s been a good friend for a long time, knows the business very well, and is one of the top agents in our market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awhile back, we did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://canovogroup.tv/the-risks-of-selling-your-home-without-a-professional-agent.html&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; talking about Homie and some of the services they provide, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of working with them. There have been a few recent developments involving Homie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know, they have been promoting working with their service over using a real estate agent to buy or sell property and, in an ironic twist, they just became a real estate brokerage. As far as I understand, they were under investigation by the Division of Real Estate—who was trying to determine if they were practicing real estate without a license—and now they’re a real estate brokerage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today, I’ve brought Ali on to talk about the benefits of working with a professional real estate agent or team rather than working with any one of these discount brokerages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People need people, and when you’re selling a home, it’s more than just the very black and white transaction,” Ali says. Selling a home involves a lot of emotion—you’re negotiating one of your largest if not the largest asset that you have, and it affects your bottom line financially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having someone to walk you through the process step-by-step, especially if you’ve never sold your home or it’s your second time going through it, will make the entire transaction easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with a professional real estate agent means you also have access to a network of professional vendors. “Getting a home sell-ready is also going to be a process,” Ali says, is a valuable asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it’s an emotional process selling your home. Having a trusted advisor to help you make decisions is a welcome thing. Additionally, she says, “We’re so confident we’re going to sell your home for top dollar and the least amount of time, that we really charge no upfront costs to start working with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The discount brokerages will charge you upfront, and then they really have no skin in the game.&lt;/strong&gt; If your home sells for top dollar or for rock bottom price doesn’t matter— they’ve already been paid. When you work with a professional agent, you can rest assured that they only get paid when the home sells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Professional agents only get paid when the home sells.%20http://www.canovogroup.tv/why-a-discount-brokerage-isnt-the-best-for-selling-your-home.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Professional agents only get paid when the home sells.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here at the Canovo Group, we don’t charge any upfront fees. We have a very flexible commission structure and a cancellation guarantee. &lt;strong&gt;If you’re not happy with our services, you can cancel our agreement with you at any time, for any reason, and without any repercussions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our flexible commission structure works like this: we have a 7% commission structure on the high end, which is usually for homeowners who have a huge remodel or another project that needs to be done on their home, but don’t want to deal with contractors personally. So we’ll take that on with the commission and manage the entire transaction for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another part of our commission structure is the more traditional 6% commission, where we represent the seller exclusively and another agent represents the buyer. In this transaction, we would share 3% of our commission with the buyer’s agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, if we have a client who is interested in just having us manage the transaction itself—they’ve already found a buyer and just need help getting through all the paperwork—then we will service that client for 1% of the sales price of the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me or Ali about this topic, or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, please give us a call. We would love to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What’s the Biggest Challenge Facing Sellers in Our Utah Market?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jdzd15wZ3Qw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are some of the challenges sellers currently face in our market?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Dane Hill, our director of operations who has extensive experience in transaction management, one of the biggest challenges is &lt;strong&gt;appraisal issues.&lt;/strong&gt; There is a lot of demand but not a lot of track record of homes being sold for the prices which the current market warrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we can encourage a client of ours to list a home at $375,000 and they can get an offer for $395,000, but once the buyer tries to get an appraisal done to satisfy their financing obligations, the appraiser won’t have enough track record of other sales at that price to warrant that $395,000 offer. The lender will only lend at what the home appraises for, so in this situation the buyer has to come up with the extra cash to close the difference or both parties have to renegotiate the sale price so the buyer can close on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each home sale is unique, but &lt;strong&gt;the most common way to settle a low-appraisal situation like this is for the buyer and seller to meet in the middle&lt;/strong&gt; between what the offer price is and where the appraisal came in at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seller typically loses some concessions during this process. If they’re paying the buyer’s closing costs, then they’ll remove those from the contract and/or drop the home warranty or other repairs they’d previously negotiated. In return, they’ll drop the price so the buyer can get the loan and close on the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If both parties can’t find some common ground to make the sale work, the buyer will usually cancel their offer and the seller will relist their property for another buyer who perhaps has more cash or is in a better financial situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to give special thanks to Dane for joining me today to discuss this topic. There are other potential solutions to this problem that we didn’t get into, so if you have any questions about this topic or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Risks of Selling Your Home Without a Professional Agent</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EX4qt2HXbyk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently had a conversation with a group of my top agents about some of the big challenges they have been facing in helping their buyers find good properties at good prices. &lt;strong&gt;The dialogue shifted to where they were finding the best opportunities to find the lowest priced properties and the easiest deals.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;There were two sources in particular that they mentioned where they were having the most success at getting good deals. One was FSBO homes, which makes sense because the people selling like this are most likely not real estate professionals. The other was homes that were using Homie.com to help sell their home. Homie is a Utah startup that claims to be the solution to all your real estate problems. They say they can save you more than $10,000 on your transaction while giving you all the tools you need to sell your home without an agent.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Why are the homes listed with Homie such easy pickings for our agents? &lt;strong&gt;In many cases, they are finding that sellers are drastically underpricing their homes.&lt;/strong&gt; Homie doesn’t have the tools and technology necessary to help sellers value their property the same way a professional, experienced agent can. These homes don’t get nearly as much exposure either, and oftentimes have to suffer through price reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=These homes don’t get nearly as much exposure as they should.%20http://www.canovogroup.tv/the-risks-of-selling-your-home-without-a-professional-agent.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“These homes don’t get nearly as much exposure as they should.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many homes on the market today receive multiple offers and sell over asking price when they are listed with an agent. This doesn’t happen nearly as much with homes listed with Homie. Sometimes, it doesn’t happen at all.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I don’t want to corner Homie into a box and say that everyone that uses them is sabotaging their transaction, because there’s definitely a place for their services in our market. However, it’s very important that if you are considering selling you are comfortable with pricing and marketing your home so you don’t leave tens of thousands of dollars on the table. It’s one thing to save 3% on commission, it’s another to leave 10% in value on the market.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions about Homie, selling your home on your own, or anything else related to real estate, give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Agent Highlight: Meet Brandon Evans</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jmr3Maj1fiA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m excited to introduce you to Brandon Evans, one of our real estate agents. The Agent Highlight series will help you get to know some of the agents that you’re working with.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Brandon worked as a police officer for about five years. “I have a lot of respect for police officers, but it just wasn’t my area of expertise,” says Brandon. “I had some good learning experiences, but it just wasn’t my thing.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;“I came across the Keller Williams website, started inquiring more about it, and met with someone in the Riverton office,” Brandon adds. “She sent me down here, and I had several positive conversations that let me know that &lt;strong&gt;this is the place where I wanted to work.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Brandon continued working graveyard shifts while he went through real estate school. “Then I got set up with David and the rest is history,” Brandon says. “I found the right home.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;One of the biggest challenges Brandon faced when he dove in as a full-time real estate agent was the financial aspect. “I spent 20 years working hourly jobs and getting a paycheck every two weeks, and this job is sales,” says Brandon. “I got one deal in three months and it wasn’t that big—I only got $1,200 from it—but everything counts. Then, it started clicking, things started rolling, and I’ve had a pretty steady paycheck since then.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I’ve noticed over the years is that agents get into real estate for two reasons: an unlimited income ceiling and flexibility. However, those are also the two reasons why people leave. They think they will immediately make money and that there won’t be any lag between your efforts and your results.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The truth is that you will work for at least 90 days before you see any income,&lt;/strong&gt; and it will take about six months before you start to see consistent income. If you work through that, you can be a successful agent.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The freedom and flexibility is great, but many agents leave because they are not used to holding themselves accountable. As a result, they don’t keep up with the tasks they need to generate the kind of results that will provide for themselves and their families.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Family is very important to Brandon. “I’ve been married for eight years now, and we have four kids,” says Brandon. “We like to get out and do some motorcycle riding, and I’m a fan of all sports. I love football, and I am a Seahawks fan. Plus, we’re in the process of building our own home, so we’ve got our hands full right now.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;According to Brandon, the best thing about working in real estate is that you have the potential to provide a lifestyle for your family. “I never thought I would be able to come out and build on property,” says Brandon. “Police officers aren’t paid very much. They aren’t paid enough. We see that all the time and it’s unfortunate, but I wanted to be able to build a home and provide a life for my kids. I don’t want to have to say no when they ask to play this sport or go to dance school. &lt;strong&gt;My family is my driving force to get out there, work hard, and be successful.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=My family is my driving force to get out there, work hard, and be successful.%20http://www.canovogroup.tv/agent-highlight-meet-brandon-evans.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“My family is my driving force to get out there, work hard, and be successful.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brandon is a great person and a great real estate agent. I hope this has given you some insight into who he is. If you have any questions about real estate, please don’t hesitate to reach out to Brandon or anyone else on our real estate team.

        <title>Have You Met New Agent Daniel Pust?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/eFfRd8isnpc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today it’s my pleasure to introduce you to one of the new agents on our team, Daniel Pust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel is happily married with a young son in 1st grade. He grew up in the Santaquin/Payson area and still lives there because he loves it. He worked in law enforcement for seven years and eventually became a detective before transitioning into real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically enough, he came into his new profession through a failed transaction, which inspired him to educate himself about our line of work. When he bought his first home in 2004, the market was so hot he hardly remembers even talking to his agent at the time. Three years later, he and his wife had built up quite a bit of equity in that home, and when they found their dream home up in the Santaquin mountains, they decided they wanted to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the two agents who worked on that transaction didn’t know what they were doing and it cost them that home purchase. That experience inspired Daniel to take it upon himself to treat his clients with professionalism, stay on top of what’s going on, and provide them with whatever they need, whether they’re buying a home or selling one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel chose Keller Williams because of the education we provide. As a detective, his job was very demanding, and KW offered training sessions that were compatible with his schedule. He also credits his mentor for taking time out of her busy schedule and encouraging him to stay involved. He ended up here at the Canovo Group through knowing someone who also worked here whose life was transformed positively because of the experience. Working with fellow agents Dane Hill and Ali Garbero on a transaction, which he describes as an “amazing experience,” also sealed the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel’s goal is to establish our brand in South Utah County. He works hard every day and has run into quite a few people who want to move but haven’t put much thought in how they’re going to do it. He enjoys being able to provide a resource for them. Daniel is a person who has both his clients’, friends’, and family’s best interests at heart. He’s full of integrity and will do the right thing regardless of how it impacts him and his business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=DANIEL ALWAYS HAS HIS CLIENTS’ BEST INTERESTS AT HEART.%20http://www.canovogroup.tv/utah-real-estate-agent-meet-one-of-our.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“DANIEL ALWAYS HAS HIS CLIENTS’ BEST INTERESTS AT HEART.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re certainly excited to have him on our team. If you’d like to contact him, you can reach him at (801) 850-5656. If you have any other questions, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. We look forward to serving you in the future!&lt;/p&gt;
