        <title>Are Zestimates Trustworthy?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/X1Va84E5LCI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you go about determining the value of your home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, in today’s modern world, much of our research for any real estate transaction starts online. This is true for determining home values as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there have been a lot of questions raised recently about researching home value online. Zillow’s Zestimate in particular has been the topic of many conversations lately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;strong&gt;an Illinois homeowner is actually suing Zillow because of how she believes the Zestimate has damaged her listing.&lt;/strong&gt; She believes that the Zestimate massively undervalued her home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our endorser Barbara Corcoran, real estate mogul and star of the show “Shark Tank,” recently went on “Good Morning America” to talk about Zillow and this lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lawsuit, Barbara says, actually makes sense. The homeowner believed her home was &lt;strong&gt;worth $626,000 compared to the Zestimate’s value of $562,000—that’s a $64,000 difference.&lt;/strong&gt; This homeowner claimed this made a difference because buyers saw and responded to that lower price while doing their research on Zillow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the lawsuit was filed, Zillow actually responded by saying that “The Zestimate is a starting point to determine a home’s value and isn’t an official appraisal. The plaintiff can update her own Zestimate by adding the square footage of her home.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Zillow doesn’t claim that their Zestimate is an appraisal, but consumers are using it like one.%20http://bustamanteblog.com/are-zestimates-trustworthy.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Zillow doesn’t claim that their Zestimate is an appraisal, but consumers are using it like one.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barbara Corcoran admits that Zillow has been very upfront about their Zestimate not being an official appraisal. However, the issue is that &lt;strong&gt;this doesn’t change the fact that many buyers assume this information is accurate.&lt;/strong&gt; This is especially problematic given the fact that the margin of error for the Zestimate is about 5%. Additionally, one in 10 homes are valued at more than 20% less than they’re actually worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Zestimate, Barbara says, is not accurate. Instead, it should be a starting point. The Zestimate will give you a range of values, but can’t take into consideration things like upgrades. If you’ve extended the patio, added a pool, renovated the kitchen, or made other improvements, the Zestimate simply can’t account for these changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as technology companies would like to replace agents in real estate transactions, it simply won’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Zillow doesn’t claim that their Zestimate is an appraisal, consumers are using it as if it is one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If homeowners truly want to get the best price, they need to deeply understand its value. &lt;strong&gt;Barbara recommends relying on the help of a real estate professional instead of on an algorithm.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to learn how we can help you sell your home, want more information, or have any other questions, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
