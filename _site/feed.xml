        <title>Are We Seeing More Activity as Things Open Back Up?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/J8FnFRrXeF4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;More businesses are opening back up, and real estate is seeing a surge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were pleasantly surprised at the response last week in the real estate market as more and more businesses opened back up. We listed four houses last weekend and had a total of 85 showings. We didn’t expect such a response so soon, and more people are getting anxious to take advantage of pent-up demand and low interest rates. &lt;strong&gt;We only expect it to get busier from here&lt;/strong&gt; as we continue to follow the state’s guidelines for our listings.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is Our Market Headed for a Recession?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LPD5DKWs3zU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are we headed for a recession like the one back in 2007? Here&amp;rsquo;s what you need to know.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we continue to keep our clients and friends up to date with the latest goings-on in our market, we’ve been hearing a lot of people asking if we’re headed into a recession. Our friends over at eXp just had their shareholder meeting, and they provided a lot of great data to help answer that question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back during the Great Recession of 2007 and 2008, 14.5% of homeowners had less than 10% equity in their homes. Today, that number has dropped to 6.6%. Back then, the number of active subprime loans hit 5.1 million, where today, it’s only at 1.98 million. Those were a huge factor in what caused the Great Recession, and &lt;strong&gt;today we simply don’t have the same issues&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Sell Your Home During COVID-19</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/x66_WF46zTc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our goal is to help serve your real estate needs no matter what.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We received an amazing response regarding &lt;u&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://hbrteamblog.com/the-relationship-between-recessions-and-the-housing-market.html&quot;&gt;our last market update&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. While it’s a great time to sell, we’d like to ensure the process is being done correctly in order to get top dollar for your house. Those that went pending were priced right and cleaned inside and out, receiving multiple offers because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re aware that everyone has a friend or relative that sells real estate. We do, too, and they always want to offer their opinions. However, keep in mind that when you hire a real estate team like ours, &lt;strong&gt;we have your best interests at heart&lt;/strong&gt;. We want you to get your home sold quickly for top dollar and we appreciate your trust in us.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Relationship Between Recessions and the Housing Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/94QG6Jyw2CA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re not being overly optimistic when we say a crash isn&amp;rsquo;t imminent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many people expect that the housing market will fail as a consequence of what’s been going on with COVID-19 and its effect on the economy. Though some of us still bear the scars of 2008, there’s no reason to believe this new crisis will drag real estate down that same dark path again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are indicators that we may even come out of this ahead&lt;/strong&gt;; inventory is still low, and it’s still a seller’s market. We don’t see the world through rose-colored glasses, we tell it like it is. That being said, the numbers simply don’t indicate that we’re heading for housing market doom.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Will There Be a Spring Market?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/aXuw0TSrjJs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;With the shelter-in-place provisions across the country, will there even be a spring real estate market?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have been asking us over and over: What’s going on with the spring market? Are we even going to have one, or will COVID-19 cause us to bypass it completely? The answers we’ll provide today depend on when the shelter-in-place provisions will be lifted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, there are serious restrictions on showings; we can only show vacant homes in person, and we’ve been doing virtual home tours for sellers who still live in their homes. &lt;strong&gt;If restrictions are lifted, we anticipate a number of homes will enter the market&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How We and Dave Ramsey Can Rescue Your Finances</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ivGZ3c8qJmQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dave Ramsey has taught us so much about financial responsibility and proper budgeting. Now we want to pass those lessons on to you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most important things that we’re focusing on during this time is the purification of our budget. &lt;strong&gt;It’s time to take a closer look at bills you shouldn’t or don’t need to have&lt;/strong&gt;. One person that’s helped us a lot with managing our finances is Dave Ramsey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d love to help assist you on the path to financial peace by teaching you some of Dave’s rules and how to use this time wisely to get you and your family ahead when everything goes back to “normal.” It will help reduce your bills and it won’t cost you a cent.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Key Safety Measures for Showing Homes Safely</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2-3iIO1LeLY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conducting something as integral to the real estate process as a home showing can no longer be taken for granted. Here&amp;rsquo;s how to show safely during a health crisis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real estate has been deemed an essential business, though we feel we aren’t special in comparison to those on the front lines (e.g., medical professionals, first responders, truck drivers, and grocery store workers). To keep our industry moving, however, &lt;strong&gt;key safety procedures are needed anytime there’s an in-person interaction&lt;/strong&gt;, like the showing of a home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we’re demonstrating what it looks like to safely walk through a home; masks, gloves, shoe guards, and a distance of six feet are critical.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>You Have Options and We Have Answers</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1miuMd9VXPE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping a close eye on the options out there for homeowners, renters, and everyone else.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s important to know that &lt;strong&gt;there are options available for you out there if you need help paying your mortgage or rent&lt;/strong&gt; in the next couple of months. Over the last few weeks, we’ve been taking a look at the stimulus package and what that means for homeowners, renters, and everyone else. We’d be happy to educate you on the topic so feel free to reach out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to take a moment to thank all of the first responders and everyone else who is working hard to keep us safe and healthy in our “new normal.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Closer Look at Real Estate During the Pandemic</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XHkQesEn9rc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;While there are certainly a number of unknowns regarding the market, we&amp;rsquo;re still able to make sense of what we&amp;rsquo;re seeing based on past events.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With everything that’s going on, a lot of people are worried that the market is going to fail or crash. However, we don’t believe that will be the case. &lt;strong&gt;When the stock market is tanking like it is right now, people tend to take their money off Wall Street and put it into real estate because it’s generally a safe investment&lt;/strong&gt;. We saw this happen after 9/11, the financial crisis of 2008, and other periods of uncertainty. During times like this, people put their money into mortgage-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a very fluid situation, but we’re always on top of it from every different angle. If you need any advice, please reach out to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who think that you’ll wait until the market adjusts to buy, know this: &lt;strong&gt;Interest rates will probably never be this low again, so you have to take into consideration the cost of waiting&lt;/strong&gt;. Mathematically, are you going to save enough money by waiting to make up for the money you’ll save over 30 years on your mortgage? The answer is different for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=People tend to take their money off Wall Street and put it into real estate.%20http://localhost:4000/a-closer-look-at-real-estate-during-the-pandemic.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“People tend to take their money off Wall Street and put it into real estate.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We invite you to ask your parents what their interest rate was when they purchased a home. Our guess is that if you compare it to what we’re seeing today, you might want to get started buying or selling sooner than later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What the Coronavirus Means for Your Real Estate Goals</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OidB1poxVM0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Due to the coronavirus, we&amp;rsquo;re making adjustments to ensure you can move forward safely with your real estate plans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does the coronavirus mean for your real estate plans in 2020?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘The unknown’ is the full battle in this case. We don’t fully know what we’re facing and until we’re right up against it—&lt;strong&gt;the most important thing is to keep everyone safe and healthy&lt;/strong&gt;. If you’re already in the process of selling your home and have a plan in place, let’s work together so we can move forward safely as a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time, &lt;strong&gt;we’re taking the necessary precautions to keep our would-be and current clients safe&lt;/strong&gt;. Now that most people are working from home, they’re getting more and more things done on their computers, and we’ve adjusted accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Let’s work together so we can move forward safely as a team.%20http://localhost:4000/what-the-coronavirus-means-for-your-real-estate-goals.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Let’s work together so we can move forward safely as a team.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if we’re scheduled to meet with you for the first time, we can meet via Zoom instead—we don’t have to meet in person. If you’re a seller and plan on having potential buyers walk through your home, we can guide you on how to keep your home safe and clean. This can include having hand sanitizer available and leaving certain doors open so no one touches the knobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to talk more about this subject or have other real estate needs we can assist you with, don’t hesitate to call or email us. We’d love to speak with you.&lt;/p&gt;
