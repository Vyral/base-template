        <title>How the Escrow Process Works</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zjTKP-kSOW4?rel=0G1!2@3#4$5%cc_load_policy=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heather Tyler has been with me for over 17 years, helping my clients with their home purchases from beginning to end, and she’s here today to talk all about escrow. Escrow is a neutral third party that facilitates the transfer of property from a seller to a buyer. The process starts with an accepted contract and an initial deposit from the buyer and ends with a grant deed and dispersing of funds. Heather is there to cover everything from start to finish. This handy document covers pretty much everything you need to know about escrow.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Title Insurance Protects Buyers and Sellers</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJmv5uZLEYs?rel=0G1!2@3#4$5%cc_load_policy=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m joined today by &lt;strong&gt;Rod Gordy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fntic.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fidelity National Title&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who will be giving us a brief explanation of how title insurance helps buyers and sellers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, why do you need title insurance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buyers get title insurance so that when they get a new loan, the lender is insured in the proper position on the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sellers need title insurance so that when the new buyer takes ownership of a home, there isn’t anything that will cause any problems in the title policy. For example, if you bought a home that recently had a new roof installed, and a month later, the roofer says you owe them for it, the title company would step up and pay it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’d like to thank Rod for giving us a quick look at what title insurance is used for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or need more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Few Points About Homeowners Insurance</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0BVqCZeroFA?rel=0G1!2@3#4$5%cc_load_policy=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m delighted to be joined by Millie Vickovic of Farmer’s Insurance to talk a little bit about homeowners insurance and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When it comes to homeowners insurance, having the correct policy is key.&lt;/strong&gt; It should be a policy that, in the event of a disaster, allows you to rebuild your house, replace your personal property, and protect your assets in case of a liability claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Having the correct policy is key.%20https://lasells.com/a-few-points-about-homeowners-insurance.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Having the correct policy is key.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you open escrow on a home purchase, you need to have proof of insurance in a timely manner so that the transaction closes on time.&lt;/strong&gt; Millie and her team work out of Glendale and have always done a great job for us and our clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for Millie about insurance or for myself about real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Can You Expect From a Termite Inspection?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/drl_WcTtAX0?rel=0G1!2@3#4$5%cc_load_policy=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m joined by Vincent Young of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warriortermite.com/&quot;&gt;Warrior Termite&lt;/a&gt; to explain what happens when a termite inspection is ordered during a home sale. According to Vince, they look for both termites and dry rot during an inspection. The presence of termites qualifies as an active infestation, whereas the presence of dry rot qualifies as an active infection. They search all areas of the house in both the interior and the exterior, and their goal is to protect both the seller and the buyer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Home Warranties Benefit Homebuyers</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-3Nz-bmJGI?rel=0G1!2@3#4$5%cc_load_policy=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been in the real estate business for over 39 years, and do you know what I think is the best feature of this business? Home warranties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a first-time homebuyer, your budget is probably stretched pretty thin. You have to pay for the down payment, the closing costs, furniture for the house, etc. On top of that, it seems like something always happens to the home after you close escrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than just assume it’s the seller’s fault and ask them to pay for it, it’s great to have a home warranty and be able to call someone like my guest today, Stephanie Storvis of Fidelity National Home Warranty, so they can take care of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Home warranties help offset the cost of homeownership.%20https://lasells.com/how-home-warranties-benefit-homebuyers.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Home warranties help offset the cost of homeownership.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do home warranties help you specifically? According to Stephanie, home warranties help offset the cost of homeownership when an appliance or one of the home’s systems fails. If you buy a home warranty through Fidelity National Title and something in your home breaks down, for instance, you can give them a call and they’ll send out one of their service technicians to fix or repair what’s broken for just a $75 fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s really important, though, is the peace of mind a home warranty provides. If you have one, you don’t have to worry about paying $1,500 to replace a broken water heater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any more questions for Stephanie, you can email her at &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#115;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#118;&amp;#105;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#102;&amp;#110;&amp;#102;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;&amp;#115;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#118;&amp;#105;&amp;#115;&amp;#064;&amp;#102;&amp;#110;&amp;#102;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&lt;/a&gt; or give her a call at (800) 308-1424 ext. 3431.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Free Yourself From Monthly Payments With a Reverse Mortgage</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Us1FadaIgTU?rel=0G1!2@3#4$5%cc_load_policy=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you know if you’re 62 years old, you can buy a house and have no monthly mortgage payments? It’s called a Purchase Reverse Mortgage and today, &lt;strong&gt;Kathy Burns from On Q Financial&lt;/strong&gt; will be telling us more about it. &lt;strong&gt;Here’s what she had to say:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With a reverse mortgage purchase program, clients are typically required to bring in 50% to 60% cash down payment. And the unique thing about it is it comes with a flexible payment option, meaning they can make a full payment, a partial payment, or no payment—&lt;strong&gt;which can really beef up their monthly cash flow while still enjoying homeownership.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if they’re looking to buy their dream retirement home, we also have a bunch of new jumbo products that recently came on the market with low closing costs as well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=They can make a full payment, a partial payment, or no monthly payment%20https://lasells.com/free-yourself-from-monthly-payments-with-a-reverse-mortgage.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“They can make a full payment, a partial payment, or no monthly payment”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve had clients downsize and sell their property, and using a reverse mortgage, buy a new home with no monthly payments and a lot less stress involved.&lt;/strong&gt; With a refinanace reverse mortgage, clients can get access to cash flow. There are many options to choose from when taking advantage of these programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to buy or sell a home, have any questions, or would like further information, feel free to contact us. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*The borrower(s) must live in the home as their  primary residence, continue to pay required property taxes,  homeowners  insurance and maintain the home according to FHA requirements. The balance of the reverse mortgage loan grows over time and interest will be charged on the outstanding loan balance. Loan payoff is due in one lump sum upon maturity event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Fall Market Is A Great One for Homebuyers and Sellers</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/V3G-B3_FQUw?rel=0G1!2@3#4$5%cc_load_policy=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Fall! The market is still doing fantastic here in LA, and while we’re not seeing the same feverish pace we saw in the summer, it’s still a fantastic market out there for homebuyers and sellers. Homebuyers can take their pick from a ton of different homes without the craziness of the summer. Sellers can still take advantage of low inventory and high demand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Sellers can take advantage of low inventory and high demand.%20https://lasells.com/the-fall-market-is-a-great-one-for-homebuyers-and-sellers.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Sellers can take advantage of low inventory and high demand.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
