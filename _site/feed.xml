        <title>January Central Iowa Market Update</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fGmopF7J7Zk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to take a few minutes today to look back at how the market was in December 2017, and that will help us going forward as we begin the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the month of December, we had 793 new homes come on the market in the Des Moines MLS. &lt;strong&gt;The amazing fact is that 33% of those 793 homes sold in the month of December&lt;/strong&gt;—that’s 262 homes that sold in December alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;average days on market for those homes that sold was five days&lt;/strong&gt; on the market before they got an offer. Homes coming on the market that are priced right are selling right away, which is great news for our sellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Homes coming on the market that are priced right are selling right away, which is great news for our sellers.%20http://bebetterdsm.com/january-central-iowa-market-update.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Homes coming on the market that are priced right are selling right away, which is great news for our sellers.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of January 1, there are 3,201 homes for sale in the Des Moines MLS. That’s down by about 185 homes from December 1 of last year, which is normal this time of year. &lt;strong&gt;We’ll see the inventory ramp back up as we hit the springtime.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the new construction home sales for 2017. Here are the top five home builders in our Des Moines MLS as of January 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genesis Homes.&lt;/strong&gt; They sold 126 new homes, including pending sales, closings, and offers made in 2017.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greenland Homes.&lt;/strong&gt; Greenland sold 182 homes, including condos, townhomes, and single-family homes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hubbell Homes.&lt;/strong&gt; They’ve been in the area for over 150 years, and last year, they sold 203 homes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jerry’s Homes.&lt;/strong&gt; They’ve been in the metro area for over 50 years and came out of 2017 with 207 closings and pending sales.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classic Builders.&lt;/strong&gt; Located up in Ankeny, they sold 346 new homes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are big numbers for all these builders individually, but &lt;strong&gt;in terms of the entire market, we sold 2,455 new homes.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s a great number; we’re finally starting to come back from the pre-recession levels of new home sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had 262 builders build at least one house in our metro area in the past year. This is an increase of 60 homes from four years prior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more about the market or any real estate topic, you can always feel free to give us a call, send an email, or message us on Facebook. We’ll be back soon with more information. Until then, have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Need to Meet Your Continuing Education Requirements? This Resource Can Help</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YG2WnVZ4bNE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the year, I always notice that many agents are scrambling to get their continuing education requirements in for their license renewal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the state of Iowa, agents are required to take 36 hours of continuing education every three years,&lt;/strong&gt; with those hours due by December 31 of the year your license expires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This education includes eight hours of law updates, four hours of ethics, and 24 hours of electives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real estate is a complex industry, so continuing education is extremely important. Knowing industry standards, new laws, and other information helps us, as agents, be the best professionals we can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let’s be honest: it can be difficult to find time for that education when you’re keeping such a busy schedule yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As real estate professionals, we’ve got very unpredictable schedules. Fortunately, there is an alternative in Iowa to in-classroom learning. &lt;strong&gt;In Iowa, up to 24 hours of your continuing education can be done online.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I was able to schedule my continuing education around my life, instead of scheduling my life around my continuing education.%20http://bebetterdsm.com/need-to-meet-your-continuing-education-requirements-this-resource-can-help.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“I was able to schedule my continuing education around my life, instead of scheduling my life around my continuing education.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I’ve found &lt;a href=&quot;https://realestatece.com/a/misty-soldwisch&quot;&gt;www.RealEstateCE.com&lt;/a&gt; to be an amazing resource. It’s very easy to sign up and is full of informational classes relevant to things I experience in my business. Also, it’s inexpensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part of taking classes through this website, though, is that it helped me control my time. I was able to schedule my continuing education around my life, instead of scheduling my life around my continuing education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there is an amazing &lt;strong&gt;discount available to Iowa licensees through &lt;a href=&quot;https://realestatece.com/a/misty-soldwisch&quot;&gt;RealEstateCE.com/a/Misty-Soldwisch&lt;/a&gt; that you can find &lt;a href=&quot;https://realestatece.com/a/misty-soldwisch&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you’re busy, want to learn, and would like to save money, I definitely recommend checking it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
