        <title>Set Yourself Up for Success in Our Shifting Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ak4ddtSDN94?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does a shifting market mean for you as a real estate agent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not nervous about it, because I know that if I’m consistent, I keep up with the market, and I keep doing the activities I’m supposed to be doing, my team and I will continue to do well. In a shifting market, a lot of agents tend to get out of the business because they can no longer fund their lifestyle. Going into fall and winter, the market is always slower, so what can you do to set yourself up for success and keep earning the income you need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;you need to work harder.&lt;/strong&gt; You have to work more hours than your competition and time block so that you’re lead generating two to three hours a day. This is not the time to be working on your business plan; this is the time to reach out and connect. In a shifting market, you need to be touching around 25 people a day. This doesn’t mean just sending out 25 texts; this means getting responses from 25 different people. This is hard to do, but if you’re connecting with that many people a day, five days a week, you won’t feel the shifting market. If anything, your market share will increase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During your time blocking sessions, you can also &lt;strong&gt;go door-knocking.&lt;/strong&gt; If you don’t have any listings, find someone in your office who does, ask if you can sit in during one of their open houses, and go door-knocking through that home’s neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=This is not the time to be working on your business plan; this is the time to reach out and connect.%20http://realestategrit.net/set-yourself-up-for-success-in-our-shifting-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“This is not the time to be working on your business plan; this is the time to reach out and connect.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing you can do is &lt;strong&gt;set up some coffee appointments with your 20 influencers.&lt;/strong&gt; Sit down with the people who love you and would refer you and have an honest conversation with them about the shifting market and how they can help you take your business to the next level. Set those appointments, mark them down on your calendar, and don’t stop until you’ve asked for those referrals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;strong&gt;you can call FSBOs and expired listings.&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of agents make all of their business just handling these two types of listings. You may not be an expert over the phone or familiar with the scripts, but you can still pick a couple of these listings to pursue and connect with them consistently. Pick the ones you really want to have a relationship with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re really stuck, open up your database, pick 30 people you know, do a CMA for each one, and send them listings the very moment they come on the market in their area. Everybody wants to know when houses come on the market, and this way you can see when they log in to your site and whether they look at any listings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, though, I can’t stress enough the importance of time blocking for lead generation first. &lt;strong&gt;If you don’t set aside time, you won’t succeed.&lt;/strong&gt; You need to take our shifting market seriously, so don’t just sit back and wait for the phone to ring. As someone who does a lot of business, I can tell you that it’s not the way to set yourself up for success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about preparing yourself for our shifting market or you want to talk about your business plan, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be glad to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Overpricing Is the Worst Mistake an Agent Can Make</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UJOVb_cbQxw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard of being the “third agent in?” This idea came about because &lt;strong&gt;sometimes sellers will go through a couple of inexperienced agents before making a more informed choice.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quality agents know that, in real estate, the client isn’t always right. While of course we take our clients’ wants and needs into account, we must also know how to be honest with them if their goals are unrealistic. Not all agents do this, though, which is where the idea of being the “third agent in” comes into play. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, a client will hire one agent who lets them price their home however they want, then, after that fails, hire a second agent who can only convince them to lower it slightly. When this second Realtor inevitably leaves the picture, &lt;strong&gt;it’s time for a third agent to come in and present the client with something they might not want to hear. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, not all sellers will jump from agent to agent. Ideally, they should select a professional who can put their goals within reach from the start. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sellers aren’t the only ones in this scenario who must avoid certain mistakes. Agents have a responsibility to get the job done right—and &lt;strong&gt;whether you’re a client’s first choice of agent or their third, the biggest mistake you can make is to overprice their home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you know a seller’s pricing goals are unrealistic, don’t agree to them.%20http://realestategrit.net/why-overpricing-is-the-worst-mistake-an-agent-can-make.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you know a seller’s pricing goals are unrealistic, don’t agree to them.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your sake and your client’s, you should always set your sights ahead of the market when pricing. It’s always a good idea to be aware of current conditions, but it’s also important to price properties correctly to begin with, regardless of what’s going on in the market. Overpricing, even in favorable markets, is never a smart move. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So when you approach sellers to develop a pricing strategy, honesty is essential.&lt;/strong&gt; Also, make sure that you discuss both the appraised value and the market value as you make this decision. Sellers must know that if a home doesn’t appraise at the price they’d like to set their home at, this could cause major issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, the lower the price you set from the start, the more offers you’ll get coming out of the gate. As I always say: You can’t underprice a house. Even if you put a home on the market for $1, someone would still come in and offer what the home is worth—assuming you’ve opened up the property to the market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is this: If you know a seller’s pricing goals are unrealistic, don’t agree with them. &lt;strong&gt;It’s easier to have an honest conversation about price at the beginning of the process than to have a conversation about price reductions later on.&lt;/strong&gt; It isn’t always easy to have this discussion, but it’s crucial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To &lt;strong&gt;learn how to sell more homes&lt;/strong&gt; than you ever believed, attend our agent’s seminar by &lt;u&gt;&lt;a data-cms-editor-link-style=&quot;undefined&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/copy-of-how-to-sell-more-homes-than-you-ever-believed-the-20cs-of-real-estate-presented-by-kati-tickets-49998400562&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;clicking here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The 20 C's of Real Estate</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/i_DqSWWc690?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “20 C’s of Real Estate” is a real estate course I created to explain what makes a real estate agent great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea for this course came to me one day while I was reflecting on what distinguishes great agents from good agents, and both from people that don’t make it in the industry. I created a list of 20 qualities of great agents, and all begin with the letter “C.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;strong&gt;the first C is “coachable.”&lt;/strong&gt; You have to be coachable and willing to listen to other people, and you also have to be willing to do your research. Whether it be practicing scripts, roleplaying, or hiring a coach, you need to listen to the people who are providing you with constructive criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you're not taking that in an accepting responsibility for yourself, you're not really learning what it takes to be a great agent.%20http://realestategrit.net/the-20-cs-of-real-estate.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you’re not taking that in an accepting responsibility for yourself, you’re not really learning what it takes to be a great agent.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you fail, or if you lose a listing or listing appointment, you &lt;strong&gt;need to find out why so that you can learn how to improve;&lt;/strong&gt; if you’re not taking that in an accepting responsibility for yourself, you’re not really learning what it takes to be a great agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started this class because I love coaching and teaching and I want to build a better real estate industry. It’s free and open to anyone from any brokerage, and it’s also a nice way to network in a casual setting. We typically hold them every month, so if you’re interested in attending, you cansign up &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-cms-editor-link-style=&quot;undefined&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/how-to-sell-more-homes-than-you-ever-believed-the-20cs-of-real-estate-presented-by-kati-spaniak-tickets-48565488684?aff=ebapi&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. I would be happy to discuss this event with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Should Agents Select Homes to Show Clients?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/rxVQO8bWVP0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are working with a buyer, you should really only show them a maximum of eight to 10 homes. If you are providing services like a buyer consultation up front, you should not have to show them more properties than this. &lt;strong&gt;Buyers these days are very busy, so it is important not to waste their time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I like to streamline the process by having a conversation with my clients about what non-negotiable features their future home must have. It is essential that you find out what a client needs and wants in a home. Knowing what is important to them will guide you to selecting viable properties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it is also important to be honest with your clients. If their list of wants and needs isn’t feasible, you have to tell them that. Your buyers should have a realistic expectation of the kinds of homes that are available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As agents, we know what is available. &lt;strong&gt;Our clients shouldn’t have to tour 50 different homes to learn something we already know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Knowing what is important to your clients will guide you to selecting viable properties.%20http://realestategrit.net/how-should-agents-select-homes-to-show-clients.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Knowing what is important to your clients will guide you to selecting viable properties.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if a client says they have a non-negotiable budget of $500,000 or less, but they also demand to see homes of a specific size and in a specific location, you must be honest with them about their prospects. And as you explain their options, make sure you continually check whether they are comfortable with the choices you are laying out for them. Clients should understand that you are not going to show them homes that do not fit their criteria. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this does not mean clients will not ask you to show them homes that do not make sense. This is why you, as their agent, should do your research before taking them to any property they suggest. &lt;strong&gt;If the property they are pushing you toward truly is not a good fit, I would advise you to steer them away from it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you may have to reevaluate their preferences and needs later on in the process. If you have toured dozens of homes with no results, something is wrong. At this point, it is time to go back to basics and get to the bottom of what your clients are looking for in a home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Build Relationships With Potential Clients</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dYc0KiDLA9E?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it interesting to watch how people work with their clients. So today I am going to talk about how to build relationships with potential clients.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have found that &lt;strong&gt;coming across as a consultant results in people trusting and valuing you.&lt;/strong&gt; Years ago, I took a sales training class where they talked about how you cannot go into a situation feeling like you need the money. If you go in thinking that you are financially secure, you are going to build a relationship with that potential client.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I come from a place of giving back to my clients. When you meet someone, you really want to listen to what they are looking for and decide if you are really able to help them. &lt;strong&gt;If you are not able, tell them.&lt;/strong&gt; You will get much further in life with your client by being honest.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes this means that you must be a little confrontational. I am personally not great at being confrontational, so I try to tone it down. For agents who have a really hard time with needing to be liked by everyone, this can be a little challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The client needs to understand that they will not necessarily get everything that they want.%20http://realestategrit.net/how-to-build-relationships-with-potential-clients.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The client needs to understand that they will not necessarily get everything that they want.”&lt;/a&gt;An example of this is when you have a client who has specific wants. They want a 3-bedroom, 3-bathroom home within walking distance to downtown and is completely updated for $500,000. This is not possible, but some agents will neglect to tell their clients this and instead tell them they will find it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The client needs to understand that they will not necessarily get everything that they want. When they start their home search and discover that nothing is matching well, that is a problem. &lt;strong&gt;It is your job to guide them using your communication skills.&lt;/strong&gt; You must have those uncomfortable conversations so you don’t end up showing them 20 homes and none of them match. If this happens, they will eventually go to another agent.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You really have to understand what a client is looking for and be honest with them.&lt;/strong&gt; You need to guide them and communicate with them that they may not get exactly what they want. Being honest may lead to you not getting the sale, but the client will view you as trustworthy.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, when I am working with people, I really try and connect with them as a consultant. I provide them information about the real estate industry and be myself. I enjoy hearing their story and deciding if I can help them or not.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To find out more about how to build relationships with your clients, please feel free to contact me. I would be happy to speak with you further about this.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How I Slowly but Surely Built a Successful Real Estate Business</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nmMS_hc-QcI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People ask me all the time, “How did you get started in real estate?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to tell you the answer to this question. So, let’s take a look back at how I got my start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I entered this industry back in 2003 when I got my license and began working as part of a real estate team. This chapter in my career lasted until about 2008, when I left the team and took a few years off from this path. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, though, I did come back. I got a new license in 2012 and started up the team that I am still leading today. Since then, &lt;strong&gt;I have built my business to be among the top real estate professionals on the North Shore of Chicago and the No. 1 producer in Northbrook. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, actually, being in the business prior to founding my current team proved to be a great benefit as I re-entered the industry. It gave me time to really focus on my business plan, as well as my plan for daily activities. Immediately after re-entering real estate, I was very committed to dedicating certain days and times to being in the office working on my business plan. From the very beginning, my goal was to be the No.1 agent in Northbrook. I wanted people in this community to think of me as their go-to real estate professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, once I had developed a plan, I began reaching out to people. I started sending out emails, I took out a little bit of advertising space, and I began providing market evaluations for community members. And I did this because whether people are moving or not, everyone loves real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I wanted people in this community to think of me as their go-to real estate professional.%20http://realestategrit.net/how-i-slowly-but-surely-built-a-successful-real-estate-business.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“I wanted people in this community to think of me as their go-to real estate professional.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diving deeper into real estate was a slow-going process, but I kept going.&lt;/strong&gt; I continued to put my name out there and provide services for the community, knowing that it would eventually pay off. After about six months of doing this, people began to notice. They would say things like, “You’re everywhere!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In actuality, I wasn’t everywhere. I was just making sure to stay visible in the places that mattered. I kept my focus small and found my niche. Doing this, in my opinion, is one of the keys to building a business. &lt;strong&gt;Being persistent without making people feel as though they are being constantly sold to is what put me on the path to success.&lt;/strong&gt; If you hope to build a business, you have to show people what kind of value you can provide for them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if someone has no immediate real estate need, it is good to establish yourself as a resource. That way when the time does come for them to make a move, they know who to reach out to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way I got my start and established myself within the community was by hosting roundtable discussions about Northbrook. Doing this allowed me to meet a lot of people without spending a lot of money in the process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything you do as an agent should be done with a certain question in mind: &lt;strong&gt;“What do people need and want from you as a real estate agent?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being an agent is not about being a salesperson, it is about being someone who the community can turn to for their real estate needs. If you work toward this and do so consistently, you are sure to find success in your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Key to Gaining Leads From an Open House</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6YvlB0fQvnc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open houses can go really well or really badly. In any case, there will be a lot of people walking through the house to check things out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do you sit an open house to get leads? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need to focus on is having the right mindset. &lt;strong&gt;You’ve got to believe that the connections you make at the open house will either translate to a sale or to a new lead.&lt;/strong&gt; After all, when you sit an open house you’re there for two reasons: To sell the house and to gain leads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond simply having the correct mindset, it’s also important to have adequate signage. The more signage you have, the more traffic you’re going to see through the open house. Putting out a lot of signs can be time-consuming, but it will be well worth it in the end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Door knocking is another great way to generate interest in the open house.&lt;/strong&gt; Even though the people you meet this way may not be looking for a home, it’s still good to make connections. They could make a great addition to your database. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve discussed a few ways to prepare for the open house, let’s move on to what you should be doing the day of. First, make sure you arrive about 15 minutes early. There’s nothing worse than walking up to an open house to find people already waiting in the driveway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The goal of an open house is to make connections and then follow up with them.%20http://realestategrit.net/the-key-to-gaining-leads-from-an-open-house.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The goal of an open house is to make connections and then follow up with them.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s also important to have a sign-in sheet prepared and readily available to everyone who passes through.&lt;/strong&gt; You can use anything from an iPad to pen and paper. All that matters is that you’re capturing the contact information of the people who attend. This includes their names, phone numbers, and email addresses. They should also provide the name of their agent. However, people who aren’t willing to fill out the sign in sheet shouldn’t be allowed to view the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the open house is to connect with people on a personal level. Do not be overbearing as people tour the home. You want people to feel at ease. You are not there to sell them on you. If a neighbor comes over, make sure to welcome them as you would anyone else, this is a great way to make a connection.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the open house is over, it’s good to take notes about the connections you made. And don’t forget to enter these people into your database. Of course, you should always keep in mind that you’re also there with the goal of helping to sell the home. If anyone visiting the home comes along with their agent, be sure to let the listing agent know. This creates a great opportunity to get some feedback about the house. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in short, the goal of an open house is to make connections and then follow up with them. Open houses are a great way to get clients. Remember to keep your energy up and be yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
