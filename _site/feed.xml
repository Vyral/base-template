        <title>7 Tips for Selling Your Home This Winter</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XyA_KXOc_60?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste present-before-paste&quot;&gt;If you are selling your home in the fall and winter, there are a few things you need to do in order to be successful. I have seven tips to share with you today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Take photos of your home according to the season.&lt;/strong&gt; Try to take pictures of your home while the trees are still full of leaves and color, before things start to look barren. If you miss that time frame and head into winter, make sure to take really clean landscape shots. If there is snow on the ground, take pictures after a fresh snow with clean driveways and walkways. If you take pictures at dusk when there is snow on the ground, those can be really beautiful. Don’t photograph your home on a blah day with gray skies and leaves all over the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Go easy on the holiday decorations.&lt;/strong&gt; We want you to celebrate and enjoy the holiday season with your family, but if your home is on the market, tone those decorations down. Keep things tasteful and minimal so they aren’t overbearing in photos or during showings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Don’t forget about your curb appeal.&lt;/strong&gt; Just because it’s winter and there’s snow on the ground doesn’t mean you can stop taking care of curb appeal. If you have peeling paint, take care of that before it’s too cold. Replace that broken-down mailbox and fix your fence. All of those little things need to be addressed even if there is snow on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Make sure your driveway and walkways are clear of ice and snow.%20http://lioceteamblog.com/7-tips-for-selling-your-home-this-winter.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Make sure your driveway and walkways are clear of ice and snow.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Safety matters.&lt;/strong&gt; When the snow or freezing rain comes down, it’s up to you to keep your driveway and walkways clear of snow and ice. Your walkways need to be free and clear of anything that might cause people to slip and fall. After all, you are inviting people into your home to look at it and potentially buy it, so that is an open liability. If you think buyers may walk around out in the backyard on the patio, make sure that is free of snow and ice as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Invest in a good indoor mat.&lt;/strong&gt; When people come inside your house, they will track snow, ice, water, and salt into your home. It can be difficult to ask people to remove their shoes in the winter since most of them are wearing boots, so have a mat or two ready for them to clean off their shoes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Keep the entryway of your home neat and clean.&lt;/strong&gt; If your family usually dumps all of their shoes, coats, and backpacks in the entryway, consider moving them by the garage or get everything put away. Your entryway needs to be free and clear during showings. After all, buyers may want a place to hang their own coat while they look at your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) Light up the home.&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure your home is well-lit, especially if you have a showing after the sun goes down. Turn on all of the lights so that people can see the front door. Don’t leave buyers and agents fumbling for the light switch. Let them see a warm, inviting home while it’s dark outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;present-before-paste&quot;&gt;If you have any other questions about putting your home on the market this time of year, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Surprising Benefits of Buying in the Fall or Winter</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ks1qgf51zxs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you feel like you’ve missed the boat on this year’s real estate market? Although you may be seeing fewer “For Sale” signs in people’s yards, you shouldn’t give up. Today, I’d like to share five surprising benefits of buying in the fall or winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Tax breaks.&lt;/strong&gt; Any payments you make this year can be written off on your taxes, meaning that buying before the end of the year can have some great financial advantages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Home for the holidays.&lt;/strong&gt; If you are about to buy or are looking to buy soon, you’ve still got a chance of finding the right home before the holiday season. What better way to celebrate than to do so from your own new home? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=What better way to celebrate the holidays than to do so from your own new home?%20http://lioceteamblog.com/5-surprising-benefits-of-buying-in-the-fall-or-winter.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“What better way to celebrate the holidays than to do so from your own new home?”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Price Reductions.&lt;/strong&gt; Sellers who are still on the market at this time are very serious. They want to make the move just as much as you do. So, you might start to see price reductions in the market. You’ll also likely encounter sellers who are more willing to negotiate a great deal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Less competition.&lt;/strong&gt; Fewer people are currently on the market than there are during other times of the year. Many people feel as if they’ve missed their chance. They don’t realize that there are great opportunities still out there. Now is a great time to enter the market, especially compared to the spring months where you would be up against a much higher level of competition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Great sales.&lt;/strong&gt; As the holidays approach, there are a lot of opportunities to get great deals. Between Black Friday and other seasonal sales, deals are happening now, so take advantage of them while you still can to get great prices on furniture, appliances, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What 5 Expenses Do First-Time Homebuyers Often Forget?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/o3DTYINzi9U?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot that goes into the process of buying a home. Also, the expenses of owning a home go beyond what many expect. Today, I wanted to go over five expenses that first-time homebuyers often forget about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Closing costs.&lt;/strong&gt; Oftentimes, people tend to forget that closing on a home costs more than just the down payment. The costs for your appraisal, insurance, and more can add up to an additional $5,000 to $7,000 on top of your down payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Home maintenance.&lt;/strong&gt; Once you’ve purchased a property, you’re going to need to maintain it. Talk to people in your life who already own property about the costs associated with this kind of upkeep. This will give you a better idea of what to expect. You want to keep your home in good condition so that it maintains its value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The expenses of owning a home go beyond what many expect.%20http://lioceteamblog.com/what-5-expenses-do-first-time-homebuyers-often-forget.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The expenses of owning a home go beyond what many expect.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Property taxes.&lt;/strong&gt; A value assessed by your city or town combined with a determined rate will equate to your tax bill. Most of the time, this is going to be paid quarterly. Sometimes your taxes are rolled into your mortgage, and sometimes they are not. Paying your taxes is a serious obligation, so make sure you understand and pay them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Utilities.&lt;/strong&gt; Things like gas, electric, cable, and more are going to add up. They are not cheap. The cost to run a home is going to be more expensive than the cost to run a small apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Do you have an additional HOA fee or condo fee?&lt;/strong&gt; This fee will be a monthly expense that you want to consider if they are applicable to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Tips for Energy Efficiency in Fall and Winter</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fyZksbQ6Ebc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the time of year, now is a great time to go over some tips for keeping homes energy efficient in the fall and winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Use the earth’s natural heat to help warm your home.&lt;/strong&gt; In the summer months, we draw the curtains to keep the sun out and allow the air conditioning to run better. In the winter, do the opposite. Open up all of your blinds and shades so that your furnace doesn’t need to work so hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Insulate the windows.&lt;/strong&gt; Making sure your windows are well-insulated and well-sealed is very important. Having thick, solid window coverings can really help to keep the cold out and the heat in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Little changes will really add up in helping you save.%20http://lioceteamblog.com/5-tips-for-energy-efficiency-in-fall-and-winter.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Little changes will really add up in helping you save.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Have your HVAC system cleaned and serviced.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve been to many homes where the owners had never had this done. Having the dirt and grime cleaned out of your HVAC system as well as having someone tune it up to make sure it’s working properly are two things that can make a big difference in the efficiency of your home. This should be done on an annual basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Turning down or programming the thermostat.&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of people without programmable thermostats leave their temperature set at a certain level all day long. If you aren’t even home to enjoy the comfortable level your thermostat is set at, why not crank it down by five or 10 degrees in your absence? Little changes like this will really add up in helping you save. A programmable or smart thermostat is even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Don’t heat unused space.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’ve got rooms or areas that never get used in your home, why waste energy heating the space? Close the doors and shut the vents in those rooms and areas. Heating unused rooms is a giant waste that many people are guilty of doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Can You Increase Your Home's Curb Appeal?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/w9QWk7tOo6k?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first impression people have of your home will be based on its curb appeal. Today, I’ve got some easy ways to add some vibrancy to the exterior of your property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buying a Milford home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lioceteam.com/search/criteria/gp_1/s_2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a full Home Search&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people see your home, their first impression will be based on the exterior. For this reason, curb appeal is incredibly important. Today, I’ve got some quick fixes and simple tips that you can use to boost the curb appeal of your property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your home is looking a little drab, you should focus on ways to make a quick impact on the home. To do this, you should determine if the exterior of the home needs a fresh coat of paint or be power washed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paint can actually go a long way in improving the appearance of a home. However, take your time. Don’t merely throw on a coat of paint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you do, &lt;strong&gt;make sure to scrape off the old paint in places where it might cause unsightly texture beneath the fresh coat.&lt;/strong&gt; Take your time when power washing, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=A LITTLE FRESH PAINT CAN GO A LONG WAY.%20http://lioceteamblog.com/how-can-you-increase-your-homes-curb.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“A LITTLE FRESH PAINT CAN GO A LONG WAY.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if it’s your yard that is lacking luster? If you have an upcoming home showing and lack the time to mulch, you still have options. Getting already potted plants to put outside your home can add a lot of vibrancy to your home’s curb appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also remember not to neglect the appearance of your front door. As the entrance to your home, your front door is the focal point of your home. &lt;strong&gt;Repainting can go a long way, but sometimes a total replacement is a better option.&lt;/strong&gt; It all depends on the condition of your home and the door itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final way to boost your curb appeal is something many people forget: your mailbox. Your mailbox is a feature of your home that people see easily as they drive past or approach your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most people tend not to notice a mailbox, they will certainly pay attention to one that is especially attractive. &lt;strong&gt;For a quick, easy impact on your front yard—update your mailbox.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Things You Need to Know If You're Buying a Property with an HOA</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJZsf5ijNjY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I wanted to take some time to talk to you about some things you should consider before buying a property governed by a homeowner’s association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buying a Milford home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lioceteam.com/search/criteria/gp_1/s_2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a full Home Search&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Selling your Milford home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eppraisal.com/partner/index/9177/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a free Home Value Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you purchase a property with an HOA, I’ve listed five things that you should take into consideration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. What is the cost of the association?&lt;/strong&gt; What are the monthly costs going to be and what will be included in the membership? The HOA membership dues are an automatic payment that you will need to pay on top of your mortgage payment and other taxes, so make sure it’s something that you can budget in and are comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Understand what you’re actually paying for&lt;/strong&gt; and what you’re obligated to do in regards to maintenance or upkeep. There are certain HOAs that are going to take care of all the groundskeeping, and others that will require you to take care of it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. What are the rules?&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding those rules and regulations will help you make a better decision about the neighborhood you’re moving into. Sometimes it will be in regards to what facilities you can use and when they’re open. Other times it will be about which days you can set out your trash, where you can park specific vehicles (or if you can park commercial vehicles in the driveway at all), and other regulations. If you don’t follow the HOA rules, then it could result in fines or expulsion from the HOA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=UNDERSTANDING THOSE RULES AND REGULATIONS WILL HELP YOU MAKE A BETTER DECISION ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD YOU’RE MOVING INTO.%20http://lioceteamblog.com/5-things-you-need-to-know-if-youre.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“UNDERSTANDING THOSE RULES AND REGULATIONS WILL HELP YOU MAKE A BETTER DECISION ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD YOU’RE MOVING INTO.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Are you happy with the way a property looks?&lt;/strong&gt; When you’re buying a property with an HOA, you more than likely won’t have control over certain things, like the colors of the house or front door, what can be hung from the porch, or if you can have a screen door. Make sure that you like the way everything looks when you buy your property, because you may not be able to change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Can you get involved in the HOA?&lt;/strong&gt; Is it a small board or more of an open, town hall feel? See if you’re able to join that HOA so you can have a say in how it impacts your neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to consider these things carefully before purchasing a home. If you have any additional questions or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, please give me a call. I’d be happy to help!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Tips to Protect Yourself During Your Move</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cLW2PmkrcdM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I wanted to take some time to talk to you about some things you should consider before buying a property governed by a homeowners association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buying a Milford home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lioceteam.com/search/criteria/gp_1/s_2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a full Home Search&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Selling your Milford home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eppraisal.com/partner/index/9177/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a free Home Value Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to make sure you and your property are protected during a move, here are five essential tips you should follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, do your research. Don’t just look in the phone book for the cheapest person. Look into Yelp, Facebook, and other similar online sites for reviews on movers. When you see one you like, ask for a referral from someone who used them. You don’t want to hire a person who’s never done this before—there are plenty of real estate horror stories that started that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, verify your mover is licensed, insured, and meets any and all federal requirements to travel for your move—especially if you’re traveling via interstate. If you are traveling via interstate, stick to one of the national mover companies like Atlas or Mayflower or at least a local company that’s affiliated with these national movers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, watch out for the lowball bid. I’ve seen many instances of movers giving a person an extremely low bid, only to up their prices once the move starts. If something seems too good to be true, it typically is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=DON’T JUST LOOK IN THE PHONE BOOK FOR THE CHEAPEST PERSON.%20http://lioceteamblog.com/5-tips-to-protect-yourself-during-your.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“DON’T JUST LOOK IN THE PHONE BOOK FOR THE CHEAPEST PERSON.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, have a contingency plan. I always tell people to move out the day before their closing happens. That way if something unplanned happens, like the truck not showing up on time or not showing up at all, you have a day to deal with it. Get out the day before, put your belongings in storage overnight, and relieve some stress knowing that everything is taken care of and ahead of schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, protect yourself. If your mover offers insurance packages that help protect your information, pay a little extra for it. This will give you peace of mind that your stuff is protected. Whether it’s a short-distance move or a long-distance move, it’s smart to pay to have your stuff protected and you’ll be glad you did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about how to protect yourself during your move or any other real estate topics you can think of, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>4 Things That Can Make or Break Your Milford Home Sale</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCB888OTAmo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to sell your house here in the Milford area, these four things can be the determining factor in how successful your sale is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buying a Milford home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lioceteam.com/search/criteria/gp_1/s_2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a full Home Search&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you list your home, there are four things that can make or break your sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Pricing it right from the beginning&lt;/strong&gt;: In a hot market like ours here in the Milford area, many sellers think they can test the market by pricing too high. As things start to cool down in the summer and fall months, though, inventory will rise and you’ll want to avoid that mindset and price your home right at market value. The closer the price is to the real value, the more activity you’ll get, and you can even get your house into a bidding war—which is ultimately what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Amp up your marketing&lt;/strong&gt;: The days of agents or homeowners taking their own marketing photos are long gone. Hire a professional photographer to shoot the home whether it costs $100,000 or $1 million. This is a must because of their ability to get the most out of the lighting, the angles, and the skyline. Many people make real estate decisions based on the photos they see online. Focus on social media as well; Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter should all give your property exposure. It will generate more activity on the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=THE DAYS OF REALTORS TAKING PHOTOS OF HOMES ARE LONG GONE.%20http://lioceteamblog.com/4-things-that-can-make-or-break-your.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“THE DAYS OF REALTORS TAKING PHOTOS OF HOMES ARE LONG GONE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Staging&lt;/strong&gt;: I don’t necessarily mean hiring a stager to advise you, but to instead use what you have and take a decluttering approach. Make sure you remove all the extra stuff and make sure you utilize what’s available in each room. You want to stage the property by opening up floor space to showcase square footage. It will not only improve the home’s photography, it will help buyers gets a better feel for the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Be prepared to receive multiple offers&lt;/strong&gt;: Our market has very tight inventory so we’re seeing many more multiple offer situations than in the past, so it’s important to have a gameplan for it. If it’s not handled carefully and professionally, you could squander an amazing opportunity and even lose the offers. This will help you maximize the value of your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you found this information helpful. If you have any questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home here in the Milford market, give me a call or send me an email soon. I’d be happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>4 Key Factors in Determining in the Strength of an Investment Property</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XMV6nbZ56kQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you determine whether an investment property is a good fit for your goals? Focus on these four areas before closing the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buying a Milford home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lioceteam.com/search/criteria/gp_1/s_2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a full Home Search&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four key areas you need to be aware of when looking to buy a good investment property:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Projected income&lt;/strong&gt;: You want to make some money or at least cover your expenses. A good rule to follow is the 1% rule: If the property costs $400,000, you should hope to make about $4,000 a month in income. This will tell you whether it’s in line with your investment goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The tenant situation&lt;/strong&gt;: Is there a lease in place with existing tenants? How long have they been there? What’s their rental history? You also want to understand the management aspect and any issues a management company has faced, like tenants who have been late paying rent. This will help you understand what you’re buying and avoid buying into a bad rental situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=THE PERFECT PROPERTY WITH NO ISSUES OR FUTURE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE DOESN'T EXIST.%20http://lioceteamblog.com/4-key-factors-in-determining-in.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“THE PERFECT PROPERTY WITH NO ISSUES OR FUTURE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE DOESN’T EXIST.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Condition of the property&lt;/strong&gt;: You won’t find a property that’s perfect with everything ready to roll that lets you sit back for 30 years and enjoy the rental income because it doesn’t exist. Issues will always come up, so it’s important to understand what needs to be done in the short term and what you should be prepared to shell out some cash for. For example, needing a new roof obviously isn’t ideal, but it won’t disrupt the building. On the other hand, if the plumbing needs to be replaced, it will be both a huge expense and disruptive since you’ll have to tear into the units and common areas of a rental property. You might even need to have a vacant building if any tenants are displaced by issues like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Understand the utilities&lt;/strong&gt;: Be aware of all the utilities there, what is and isn’t separately metered, and how you’ll deal with it in terms of each individual unit. For example, if the gas is on a single meter, you’ll probably include it in rent. If you have separate meters, you can charge everybody individually. Most importantly, make sure that if you’re trying to pass along costs, you’re not violating any laws or state/town regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about owning investment properties or you’re considering buying one, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’m always glad to help!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Get Your Home Ready for Summer With These 5 Maintenance Tips</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Z0xcNcO0aw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that summer is officially here, there are a few things you need to do to do around your property to make sure it’s ready for the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buying a Milford home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lioceteam.com/search/criteria/gp_1/s_2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a full Home Search&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Selling your Milford home?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eppraisal.com/partner/index/9177/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a free Home Value Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we head into summer, there are five things you should focus on to prepare your property for the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;inspect all your brick and stone patios and walkways.&lt;/strong&gt; Hardscapes and brick material can freeze and shift over the winter, so make sure you fix that for both safety and aesthetic reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;feed your lawn.&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve been lucky so far because this spring produced plenty of rain, which wasn’t good for your outdoor activity schedule but good for the grass. Continue to feed your grass and replenish it with nutrients. The more time you spend doing this, the greener and lusher it will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, &lt;strong&gt;check the condition of your fences.&lt;/strong&gt; This is especially important if you have a wooden fence, as wood is more prone to take a beating over the winter. Make sure no pieces have fallen off, and if they have, tack them back on securely. From an aesthetic standpoint, another thing you can do to those wooden stockades or wooden picket fences is power wash them. This will make it look like it did the day you installed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=THE SEASON IS UPON US TO GRILL AND BARBECUE.%20http://lioceteamblog.com/get-your-home-ready-for-summer-with.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“THE SEASON IS UPON US TO GRILL AND BARBECUE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, &lt;strong&gt;mulch your flower and vegetable beds.&lt;/strong&gt; You may be a few steps ahead of me with this tip. Personally, I like to wait to address my mulch beds until as late as early June. Make sure your flower and vegetable beds are getting enough water and you continue to weed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly—and most importantly—&lt;strong&gt;get your grill in gear!&lt;/strong&gt; I love to grill pretty much all season, and if you’re like me, there are a few maintenance tasks you need to take care of with your grill. Check your grates to make sure they’re clean and in good condition. Also check all the heat diverters in the grill, the propane hookups, and the drip pan. If your igniter switch is faulty, you can go to your local hardware store, buy a new one, and ask a professional how to install it. This will add years to your grill’s lifespan and allow you to enjoy your backyard in style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about how to get your home ready for summer or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I look forward to speaking with you.&lt;/p&gt;
