        <description>

Now that we’ve entered into the new year, we’d like to wish you all the best in 2019! 

Let’s take a moment to look back at our active, yet unique, 2018 market. 

Spring of 2018 saw a strong upsurge in activity—the busiest season in our market that I can remember. On the whole, this boom was generally characteristic of 2018’s market, and it led to a strong finish. 

However, we saw changes in the market, as well.  

As spring turned to summer, activity waned a little, which was likely due to an extremely strong market performance from the previous season and other factors typical of a market slowdown like kids being out of school, families going on vacation, etc. 

We came out of the summer plateau with another burst of activity as fall arrived—it was, again, as busy as I can remember. We appeared to be well on our way to repeating (or even topping) that earlier boom we experienced in the springtime. 

“Market activity rebounded, and we were busy again as 2018 came to a close.”

But then, disaster struck—Hurricane Michael reached our shores. Though it didn’t directly impact our area, it was definitely a catalyst for some changes in our market. The level of activity we saw throughout much of 2018 sunk a little from there. 

Despite all of that, our year actually ended on a high note; market activity rebounded, and we were busy again as 2018 came to a close. This bodes well for our market in the new year. 

We have a lot of people discovering our area for the first time, and with more people working remotely from home, there are great opportunities for our residential market.

Please reach out to us with any of your real estate concerns and questions. We’d love to make your real estate dreams a reality in 2019!

I hope you enjoy this gorgeous aerial tour of everything our area has to offer, from Crystal Beach in Destin all the way to Rosemary Beach on East 30 A. It’s easy to see why people love Northwest Florida’s Gulf Coast. The clarity of our water, the white sandy beaches, and the southern charm make this place incredibly special. I was born and raised here and there is truly no place like home.

        <description>

Alys Beach and Rosemary Beach are two of the most luxurious communities along Florida’s Gulf Coast. Both of these amazing, masterplanned, urban communities are extremely pedestrian-friendly. When you’re in Alys Beach, you feel like you’re in the Greek Isles with all the whitewall architectural design, the broken stone walkways, greenspaces, and other amazing amenities. The neighboring Rosemary Beach is also extremely special, with beautiful contemporary design properties that are reminiscent of a European coastal town. CNN recently named Rosemary Beach as one of America’s most romantic towns, and for good reason—you’re surrounded by amazing parks, greenspaces, restaurants, shopping centers, and other family entertainment venues. I strongly encourage you to come by Alys Beach and Rosemary Beach today, as all your coastal desires will come true.

I have another great aerial tour to take you on today, and this time we’re flying over Watersound Beach, a world-class beach destination along scenic Highway 30A. Sitting on 256 acres of land and featuring over a mile of beach frontage, it provides a perfect blend of master-planned, ultra-luxurious homes and tons of bicycle trails, walking paths, and some of the most beautiful nature you’ll find in our area. It also neighbors Deer Lake State Park, which makes it a great place for families to explore the outdoors. Just outside the gates of Watersound, you’ll also find the Hub, which is a great place to go out to eat, listen to some live music, and enjoy all sorts of fun family entertainment.

In the wake of Hurricane Michael, Panama City, Lynn Haven, Mexico Beach, Port St. Joe and surrounding areas to the north are in a state of ruin. Buildings were torn asunder, trees were snapped under the force of the storm, and debris was scattered in thick swaths across the coastline. As harrowing as this scene may be, the mere sight of it cannot begin to truly illustrate the full experience of those affected. Yet hope is not lost. The more willing we are to offer our help to those in need, the more quickly our affected communities can recover. Your donation could make all the difference in the lives of those affected.  If you have a Facebook account and desire to contribute please, click here or you can call Nathan Abbott at 850-803-7653 to coordinate additional contribution options. These families truly need our help! Thank you.

Seaside and Watercolor is a gorgeous area. It’s so beautiful, in fact, that it’s been used in a number of films, like “The Truman Show”. These master-planned communities have a multitude of amenities and fun activities to be enjoyed by the whole family. The location takes on a perfect coastal village charm, with an infrastructure based on pedestrian and bicycle friendly communities close to everything you need to enjoy an elegant coastal lifestyle. See what life is like in Seaside and Watercolor.

Hurricanes create supernatural skies.  They always seem to deliver a beautiful sunset before and after the storm that wreaks havoc. Learning to navigate through the dark skies in between resembles life as we know it. Even in your darkest days, you can find light if you search for it.  More beautiful days ahead. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in Panama City, Mexico Beach, and to the east which has a long road of recovery.  We will be setting up our office as a headquarters to collect donations and needed items for relief efforts. We are located at https://goo.gl/maps/5iF61fFhaDC2  and will provide updates as we receive them. Thank you.

Grayton Beach is one of my all-time favorite places—as one of the top-rated beach destinations, it’s truly in a league of its own. This is one of the largest beaches in the area and connects to beautiful Western Lake, where you can enjoy by paddle boarding or kayaking. Grayton Beach is rich in history with homes dating back to the early 1900s. It’s a laid-back community where all you truly need is a pair of flip-flops and a swimsuit in order to enjoy everything it has to offer. The neighboring Grayton Beach State Park is an amazing place to explore and you are walking distance to several incredible restaurants and entertainment. Come see today what makes Grayton Beach so special.

        <description>

Topsail State Park is one of the staples of Miramar Beach and Santa Rosa Beach, and I have a quick aerial tour of the area to show you today. With many lakes and walking trails to choose from, it’s a phenomenal place to explore. The Gulf frontage is untouched, and is surrounded by some of the most incredible resorts along our coastline.

“Topsail State Park is a great place to enjoy everything our coastline has to offer.”

Grand Boulevard is also close by, and it offers a variety of entertainment options. As a local, my own office building is located just five minutes away, and I can tell you that it’s easy to avoid the traffic most times of the year. Overall, it’s a great place to enjoy everything our coastline has to offer. To get the full aerial tour, watch this short video.

Enjoy this aerial tour of Crystal Beach and Scenic Highway 98 in Destin, Florida. Crystal Beach is one of my absolute favorite locations along our coast—it’s a charming coastal town that really takes on a Nantucket feel. It’s low-density and welcoming to pedestrian, bicycle, and golf cart traffic all along Scenic Highway 98.

What’s more is that you’re centrally located just south of the Destin Commons, one of the biggest hotspots for shopping and entertainment in the Destin area. For the complete aerial tour of this scenic coastal destination, watch this short video.

        <title>Busting 3 Summer Real Estate Myths</title>

        <description>

Today I’m going to debunk three of the most commonly circulated myths about the summer real estate market. Let’s get right to it:

1. The summer is the hottest time of year for real estate sales. This simply is not the case. The summer is a great time for enjoying summer vacation in this area, but there’s not a lot of occupancy here and rates are high. We use the summer as a great time to build relationships with our clients, live the lifestyle with them, then come back strong in the spring and fall, which are actually the busiest times of year here along the coast.

“We use the summer for building relationships, not selling homes.”

2. Prices always drop after the summer. In an appreciating market like the one we’re in right now, this isn’t happening. In addition, when the fall hits, there’s a higher variety of homes that come out on the open market and it’s a much more enjoyable time for people to enjoy previewing properties. Beaches aren’t as crowded as they are in the summer and it’s my favorite time of year down here.

3. The summer is the most enjoyable time of year. Although I love living here all 12 months of the year, the summer is when it’s most hectic down here. The beaches are crowded, there’s a lot of traffic, and people are on vacation. If you haven’t been down here during fall, you’re really missing out. The water is still warm from the summer and it’s like you have the beach to yourself.

If you have any questions for me or you are looking at buying a vacation or full-time home down here, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Today I will show you an amazing aerial tour of Grayton Beach, which is one of my favorite spots along the coast. This village was one of the first communities established in South Walton, and its beach is consistently ranked as one of the best in the country.

 “This is one of my favorite spots along the coast.”

It is located along the Gulf of Mexico between Pensacola and Panama City off of Scenic Hwy 30A in Santa Rosa Beach, just west of Seaside, and it is perfect for swimming, sunbathing, surf fishing, paddle boarding, and anything else you and your family have in mind for a fun day under the sun. It is also within walking distance to dining and entertainment. To see the full tour of everything this spot has to offer, watch this short video.

Today I want to share with you a quick aerial tour of the downtown Destin area. This video will include views of Destin Harbor, Holiday Isle, Big Kahuna’s, and the various shopping centers around the downtown area. What’s unique about our coastline is every little section has its own special spot, which makes it a great place for families. To see what I mean, watch this video.

        <description>

Our market on the Emerald Coast has been extremely active lately. Time and time again, we’ve seen that procrastinating on submitting an offer could cost you. Doing this can compromise your position as a buyer. 

In multiple offer situations, the first person to put an offer on the table will have much better chances of securing the property. 

Waiting even just a day or two to submit an offer could make all the difference in whether you’re able to strike a deal. Allow me to share a perfect example of this. My team and I recently drafted an offer on a Saturday, but our buyer waited until Monday to execute it. The listing agent told us that if our offer had been submitted on Saturday, the seller would have accepted it. Procrastination was the sole reason our buyer lost out. 

“Waiting even just a day or two to make an offer could make all the difference in whether you’re able to strike a deal.”

Making your offer quickly is one of the best ways to ensure you secure a home. Beyond that, you also must be submitting an offer that is close to your highest and best. You must be able to show the seller that you’re serious. Therefore, cash buyers must bring a verification of funds from their bank, while financed buyers must be able to provide a pre-approval letter from their lender.

With as active as our market is right now, you’ve got to be proactive. You will also need to be flexible. If a seller submits a counteroffer, you may want to consider accepting it if it’s within reason. In the long run, losing out on a deal over a few thousand dollars isn’t worth it.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Today I have a special treat for you—an aerial tour of Destin Harbor. Growing up in Destin made it my favorite place along the coastline. Boating Magazine voted Destin as the No. 1 place in the country to both live and boat, and for good reason. In addition to the harbor itself, there are some great beaches to explore, several wonderful restaurants you can float to by boat, and many other sights and activities to enjoy. To see the full aerial tour of Destin Harbor, watch this video.

It’s a beautiful day on the Emerald Coast and today I want to share some numbers with you. We’re going to look at the numbers from 2016 and 2017 to determine where we’re headed in our market.

We experienced great appreciation all across our market from 2016 to 2017. In Destin, the condo and townhome market went up 11% on average, while home prices were up around 5%.

In Miramar Beach, we had a 5% increase in condo and townhome sales and a 10% increase in price per square foot for residential homes.

North Santa Rosa Beach is where I live, and it’s one of the best areas for residential living. You can avoid most of the traffic year-round, and you’re close to lots of stores, dining, and other amenities. We have some beautiful bayou and bayfront properties in this area.

Another great reason to love North Santa Rosa Beach is the we had a 25% increase in our average price in homes from 2016 to 2017. That’s a phenomenal level of appreciation. The overall sales volume is up just 4%, but the increase in price is fantastic.

Over in 30A West, there was a 15% increase in single-family homes sold, and they sold for an average of 17% higher. People are starting to realize how awesome this area is. The condo market here went down a little bit, but I think that’s mainly due to lack of inventory. There simply isn’t much available.

“North Santa Rosa Beach saw a 25% increase in price from 2016 to 2017.”

In 30A East, we didn’t see as much appreciation as 30A West, but we still saw an increase of 8% for the average price point.

Panama City Beach was on fire in the last year. We saw a 34% increase in volume and a 9% increase in price in this market. The amount of absorption there is amazing.

For a more in-depth look at our market’s statistics, click here.

We would love to provide expert advice for you whenever you need it. We know this market really well and would love to answer any questions you have. If you do have any, feel free to reach out and give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

We’re currently in Port St. Joe, Florida, which is also known as “Florida’s forgotten coast.” A lot of our clams and oysters are harvested out of this bay. There’s so much untouched beauty here, and I love visiting.

My recent trip out here was a special one because it was with my team.As a team, it’s great to get out of the office setting, spend some quality time with each other, and then come back and serve our customers on a much higher level because we work together better.

“This was great for our team to spend some quality time together.”

We are natives to Northwest Florida and live a coastal lifestyle, and we can deliver expert local advice for our customers in order to deliver the ultimate results that they desire.

One of the greatest things about being in real estate is the people that you meet along the way and the memories you share with the people that you serve.

I recently got back from one of the most amazing vacations. I’ve been snowboarding since I was a kid, and I’ve always been really into the outdoors.

I just got back from Bella Coola in British Columbia. Bella Coola is one of the most remote mountain regions in the world. There are 2.5 million acres of terrain. You have to take a prop plane, a two-day boat ride, or drive through the mountains for 12 hours to get to civilization, a.k.a. Vancouver.

“I was able to share this amazing experience with three different people I’ve served in real estate transactions.”

I was able to share this amazing experience with three different people that I’ve served in real estate transactions. They all had a passion for skiing or snowboarding like I did. I put the trip together on a whim, and we just got back with some great memories that we will share for the rest of our lives.

Check out the video above for a short film of our skiing adventure. I hope to create some great memories with you as well.

If you have any real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

Buying a new real estate property is exciting, but they often come along with some unexpected expenses right after closing.

People commonly forget about these expenses and they can certainly add up. Here are just a few examples:


  Moving expenses.
  New furniture.
  Window treatments.
  Dishes and cutlery.
  Shower curtains.


“I was amazed when I bought my first home to see just how lengthy and expensive a process it was.”

There are many more beyond what I’ve listed. I was amazed when I bought my first home to see just how lengthy and expensive a process it was to fully furnish and decorate the home. Between shelving, appliances, paper goods, and more, fine details can really add up.

For that reason, it’s important to do some budgeting beforehand. Compile a list of the things you’ll need when you move in so that you aren’t surprised at the additional costs associated with your new home. However, don’t buy these items prior to closing. This can have a negative impact on your loan.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

We’re doing a little bit of exploring today.

Defuniak Springs is a beautiful area with tons of countryside, and it’s only an hour north of the beach.

There are a lot of great places to explore in Northwest Florida and Defuniak is definitely one of those areas. Downtown Defuniak Springs has a charming, small-town feel, and was recently rated one of the best small towns in the Southeast.

“See the beauty that Defuniak Springs has to offer.”

I highly recommend that you get out, explore a bit, and see the beauty that Northwest Florida has to offer.

Check out the video above to see more of Defuniak Springs.

Located in Seagrove Beach, Deer Lake State Park provides a great opportunity for people to explore Florida in it’s natural state. The park is nestled between the Watersound community to the immediate east and Deer Lake Dunes and Seclusion Dunes to the west. Between the beautiful scenery and the beach, which is accessible by way of the boardwalk, a visit to Deer Lake State Park is a great experience. To see the full tour, watch this short video.

“A visit to Deer Lake State Park is a great experience.”

        <title>Sitting Down With Mike Ragsdale of 30A.com</title>
        <link>http://ownemeraldcoast.com/sitting-down-with-mike-ragsdale-of-30a-com.html</link>

        <description>

Mike Ragsdale, owner and founder of 30A.com, has an amazing story behind the foundation of the 30A brand, and I’m proud to be able to interview him and share that story with you.

Mike business background started at the University of Alabama, where he graduated with a master’s degree in advertising and public relations. “Despite how clever and educated I thought I was, I couldn’t get a job,” Mike recalls. He then bought a computer and forced himself to start a graphic design business. He ran that company successfully for seven years, and it grew in size to about 60 or 70 employees. After that, though, he had a long string of business failures. Those failures, however, led him to move to the Emerald Coast and start 30A.

Mike had been vacationing in this area for years, and he always felt that it was a special place. “The natural beauty is just unparalleled, and it felt like the perfect place to raise a family,” he says. When he arrived at the Emerald Coast, the area didn’t have a cohesive brand. 30A was not used to the degree that it is today—a company in Texas actually owned the URL. Every individual community in the Emerald Coast had its own brand, but the one thing that tied all of them together was Highway 30A.

“Today, we really don’t view it as a location—we view it as a lifestyle.” What he means when he says that is scenic 30A here in South Walton is just one of four 30A roads. State Road 30 runs from the Alabama state line to Perry, Florida, and there are four alternate routes (hence the “A”) that branch off that old state highway. 30A isn’t just here—there’s also a 30A in Bay County and two 30As in Franklin County. To him, the 30A idea evokes small-town America and “old” Florida.

“It’s a lifestyle brand, not a tourism brand.”

Mike originally moved here to become a writer, so he initially bought the 30A.com domain name to be a blog. He had no intention of turning it into a business, but after several years of developing the URL, people started asking him if they could advertise on the site, and he agreed. He describes this evolution as “very organic and unintentional.”

Today, 30A.com has three different divisions: the digital division, the retail division, and licensing division.The digital division includes their radio station, mobile app, Facebook page, and their websites. Their retail division includes their four 30A stores, but their apparel can be found in over 100 locations nationwide. “Think of it as Patagonia,” he explains. “Patagonia is a place, but you don’t have to go to Argentina to wear Patagonia apparel.” Their licensing division takes first-class products and licenses their brand to the companies that produce them.

Mike was surprised by how fast his company grew, but as an entrepreneur, he always has an eye for growth and business. Having 900,000 Facebook fans is something he never really anticipated, but he thinks they’re just getting started, and they’re now focused on taking the brand national. Not the tourism brand—the lifestyle brand.

“I tell people it’s small-town America at the beach, and that’s what we’re trying to capture in everything that we do.”

As to where 30A.com ranks online, it’s difficult to say and depends on a few different metrics. To them, though, the goal isn’t about online rankings. They view their website as a way to share stories. Everything they do in their company comes down to four words: “We love the beach.” That could mean loving it in ways that include music, cocktails, food, and lifestyle, and also loving it in ways that mean preserving and protecting the beach itself. That’s where they feel the company is going as much as the digital side.

What’s next for 30A.com? They’re about to launch their 30A Sessions concert, and they have Lady Antebellum as their first opening act. They also have several shows coming up next year featuring big names and world-class talent which will be captured for broadcasts on major networks.

30A is a blessing for our area, and we’re glad they’re here. We all look forward to seeing what’s next for them. If you have any questions about this interview, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to chat with you.

        <description>Fall is upon us, and with it the end of the high season for real estate.However, if you’re thinking you’ve missed your chance to sell your home, let me reassure you.This autumn actually presents a fantastic moment to sell. Here’s why.First off, housing inventory is still pretty low along the Emerald Coast.In fact, according to data from the Census Bureau and the National Association of Realtors, inventory remains well below historic averages, and is 50% less than the peak in 2006.Second, while mortgage rates also remain very low, recent announcements by the Federal Reserve might cause them to finally start rising.This would make mortgages less affordable and might turn away a significant number of potential buyers.This is even more of a concern when you consider the continuing growth of home prices—6.9% in the last year alone.Third, contrary to conventional wisdom, fall is generally a great time to list your home.Buyers in the fall are likely to be more serious because they have probably been searching for months without success.Also, because fewer homes are listed in the fall, this means there’s even less competition than we’ve seen due to the general low inventory.So what do you get when you put all those things together?Well, if you were to list your home right now, chances are good that you would be able to sell it and for a solid price.On the other hand, if you decide to wait, the situation might not be as favorable because mortgage rates might rise or because new construction might pick up.That means the time to list your home is now.You can get started with this home value calculator on my website, which takes into account recent Northwest Florida sales:Enter your home address to find out what your home is currently worth.This calculator will give you a good idea of what your home is worth.And if you would like a more precise estimate of what your home could sell for this fall, or if you have any other questions about the current Destin real estate situation, give me a call at 850.632.0136. I’m here to help.

        <description>

Today I’m super excited to bring you a look at a place my family and I have been visiting for years: the Tortoise Clinic. The acupuncture and herbal medicine they provide here are both absolutely amazing.

To help me explain what the clinic does, I spoke with medical director Drew Smith. Drew first got involved in acupuncture fairly early in life. In middle school, he developed an interest in martial arts and in Eastern culture in general.

It was specifically his junior year in high school when Drew says he first stumbled across the subject of Eastern medicine. He was browsing the shelves at a bookstore when he came across some material on the subject and was immediately fascinated.

After graduating, Drew went on to graduate school at Florida State University. There, he met his future wife. When she had to return home to Japan, he knew he had to do whatever it took to follow her there.

He received a scholarship from the Japanese government, allowing him to pick any university and course of study. On his second day of classes, he met a neighbor who happened to be a scholar of Chinese medicine The two began to practice tai chi together in the parks on campus.

Drew briefly returned to FSU, but then returned to Japan. He had sustained some injuries from judo, and found that Eastern medical treatments worked very well for them. From then on, he knew he wanted to study this kind of medicine. So, he found a school in Maryland and has been working in related fields since

“The possibilities for what Eastern medicine can achieve are as broad as the field itself.”

With all of that traveling, I wondered why Drew returned specifically to the Emerald Coast. He told me that since he grew up in Florida, he had always known and thought of our area as the state’s “sweet spot.” He didn’t originally have plans of returning to Florida, but ultimately wanted to fully pursue acupuncture and Eastern healing.

Having previously worked in a chiropractic clinic, he knew it was time to pursue his passion. It was actually when he saw an ad for an acupuncture business online that he decided to reply and see what would happen. That’s when he found the Tortoise Clinic. Next thing Drew knew, he and his wife moved to the area and have been here for nearly 10 years.

As far as the benefits of acupuncture and eastern medicine, Drew believes the possibilities are as broad as the field itself.  He says you could spend a lifetime studying the use of plants as medicine, and there would still be more to learn. In order to do this for a living, he believes you have to be able to help every pain there is.

Personally, he enjoys helping people boost their fertility. He also says that acupuncture can benefit people emotionally and digestively. Eastern medicine has been around for so long and is largely about your body healing itself through stimulation from acupuncture and herbal medicine.

If you’d like to learn more about the Tortoise Clinic, you can visit their website at www.TheTortoiseClinic.com. To drop by in person, simply go to 2441 US Highway 98 W Unit 111, Santa Rosa Beach. Their phone number is (850) 267-5611. I highly recommend checking them out.

Also, for all of your real estate needs, call The Nathan Abbott Team at (850) 632-0136. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

We’re here today at the Sunset Bay Cafe with owner Bryce Jarvis. He’s here to talk a little bit about his restaurant and why you will love it the next time you stop in for a bite.

Back in high school, Bryce worked in banquet setup with Abbott Resorts. He turned that experience into over 20 years of working in restaurants. Now, he has one of his own.

When Bryce was looking for a location for his restaurant, he wanted something unique. He found that at Sandestin Resort, where Sunset Bay Cafe is located. There’s plenty of parking and space inside the restaurant and out on the patio. The vision was to put together a nice, family-friendly restaurant that you could come to for any occasion. That vision has clearly been realized.

“The menu is as diverse as it is delicious.”

The menu is as diverse as it is delicious. For breakfast, Bryce recommends the Hillbilly Benedict. It consists of a fried gouda grit cake, topped with a fried chicken breast, a poached egg, and hollandaise. For lunch, their shrimp and grits is the way to go. Gouda grits, blackened shrimp, and a delicious red-eye gravy to top it off.It’s fantastic.

Sunset Bay Cafe is located right on the Sandestin Golf and Beach Resort inside of the Linkside Conference Center at 158 Sandestin Boulevard N. You can learn plenty more about them at www.sunsetbaycafesandestin.com.

In the meantime, if you have any real estate needs we can help fulfill or any questions at all, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

Boswell Builders have been building amazing custom homes along the Emerald Coast for over 40 years and bring an incredible level of expertise to our marketplace. You’ll see it in the level of interior detail they have in the model homes shown above.

Boswell filled an immediate need for high-quality new construction homes at an affordable price. This is how Paradise Cove was created. The homes here are priced starting at $350,000 and you’ll certainly be proud of whichever home you choose.

The Pineview floorplan is a 4-bedroom, 3.5-bathroom with 2,441 sq ft. There are a lot of great custom features in here and it’s in a great price point for this community. It also has a great open floor plan that transitions from living room, to dining room, to kitchen.

“Most builders charge extra for these features.”

In addition to the great kitchen, here are a few other amenities you’ll find in these Boswell homes:


  Self-closing drawers
  Stainless steel appliances
  Granite countertops in the kitchen and bathrooms
  Full chef’s kitchen


A lot of builders charge extra for features like these, but they’re automatically included in all of these homes. The master bedroom in this floorplan is great as well. It lets in a lot of natural light and has a spacious closet and bathroom.

As you can see, these homes in Paradise Cove have all the elements that you’d be proud of at your primary residence. To learn more about the community and the homes within it, visit the Paradise Cove website here.

If you have any questions for us or you’d like to tour one of these beautiful homes, give us a call or send us an email. We are open seven days a week and would love to hear from you today.

        <title>Have You Tried Cuvée Kitchen and Wine Bar?</title>

        <description>

Today I’m excited to feature a great local restaurant that is sure to impress: Cuvée Kitchen and Wine Bar.

The owners, Chris Ruyan and Tyler Jarvis, are both experienced restaurateurs here on the Emerald Coast. On top of Cuvée Kitchen, they also own Jackacudas and Brotula’s Seafood House and Steamer.

Since I had the opportunity to sit down with Chris and Tyler, I decided to ask them a few questions.

First, I wanted to know how the inspiration for Cuvée Kitchen came to light. According to Chris, it was an evolution of their shared vision for restaurants they enjoyed. Chris and Tyler wanted to create a great menu as well as an amazing atmosphere. From the beginning, they wanted Cuvée Kitchen to be a place where people could gather to enjoy food, drink, and company.

Staying true to this vision is something that has always been important to them—even now following their recent relaunch of the restaurant. The space has been opened up and the format of the dining experience has been changed, as well.

“Cuvée Kitchen is a place where people can gather to enjoy food, drink, and company.”

Social interaction through intimate spacing, small plates, and craft-style cocktails are all key features that Chris and Tyler have tried to bring with this relaunch. They wanted to create a fun and interactive experience instead of the more quiet atmosphere that is usually associated with upscale dining.

Also, because they use fresh ingredients, the cuisine at Cuvée Kitchen is always unique. The chefs have a lot of freedom to create different items on a daily basis. Recently, Chris and Tyler have begun to think about implementing a rotation-style menu that would change four times a year depending on the season.

But the food isn’t all that makes Cuvée Kitchen unique. The restaurant also offers a wide variety of cocktails. Cuvée Kitchen carries a lot of different craft cocktails that aren’t typically found in the area, as well as some imported spirits.

The “Corrupt Bargain” cocktail is Tyler’s personal favorite. A spin on a traditional Manhattan, the Corrupt Bargain is a blend of single barrel and rye whiskey complemented with Carpano Antica and vermouth. Finally, the drink also has a flamed orange peel, which provides a unique and delicious smokiness.

Food and drink aren’t the only things Cuvée Kitchen has to offer. Each week from Monday through Saturday between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., the restaurant hosts a social hour. From 9 p.m. to close on those same days, you can experience the reverse social hour.

Each of these hours will feature small bites, sushi, local fish beignets, cocktails, and more.

To learn more about Cuvée Kitchen, you can visit their website: www.CuveeKitchen.com. Also, if you’re interested in dropping by to experience it for yourself, you can find the restaurant in downtown Destin at 26120 Emerald Coast Parkway.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Recently, my sister Amanda Abbott was featured on Wyndham’s website. Amanda is a fantastic real estate agent who enjoys exploring all that Northwest Florida has to offer.

Our dad and our uncle started one of the first real estate companies in the area—Abbott Realty. I jumped into the real estate business soon after college, but Amanda explored a little before returning home and becoming an agent in her own right.

Somebody once called her “the Surfing Realtor,” which is a good fit. “My favorite thing is to be in the water,” says Amanda. “That’s when I feel most at peace.”

“Amanda encourages others to find a balance between hard work and taking time for yourself.”

If you grew up in Northwest Florida like we did, it can be easy to take the beauty around us for granted. However, Amanda is constantly exploring. She surfs, paddleboards, and motorbikes all around the area. “I’ve traveled all over the world, and I still think it’s one of the nicest places to be,” she says.

Amanda really believes in finding a balance between working hard and taking time for herself. She tries to encourage everyone else to do that, as well. She also does a great job helping her clients find amazing homes that encourage a wonderful lifestyle.

You can see a little of how Amanda spends her days in the video above. Congratulations on such a wonderful spotlight, Amanda!

As always, if you have any real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you.

        <description>

Instead of talking about Northwest Florida real estate, today I want to bring you along on a tour of Grayton Beach State Park.

We locals often don’t take advantage of the number of stunning state parks around the Emerald Coast. We tend to forget how special these places are. A lot of tourists may not even know about these places.

Grayton Beach is a great way to really escape and enjoy Florida’s stunning natural landscape.

This park is just north of Watercolor and there is a beautiful, natural beach right near a great coastal lake that you can see in the video above.

Western Lake is also the perfect place to paddleboard or kayak. It’s a 100-acre coastal dune lake located right in the park.

“Grayton Beach is a great place to escape and enjoy the beauty of Florida.”

I highly recommend this park. The Florida State Parks are all fantastic, and Grayton Beach will be open to the public for free through Labor Day. It really is a great place to take your family and just explore.

For more details about Grayton Beach, check out this website. I hope you take some time to get out there and roam through this beautiful state park.

In the meantime, if you have any real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

Recently, I took some time to visit The HUB at 30A.

This amazing outdoor venue has a lot of covered areas and about 10 different dining options as well as several bars. Additionally, there’s a shopping pavilion outside of the amphitheater.

The complex also holds a lot of events, typically as often as four nights each week.

This includes live music, movie nights, and football games shown on the big screen on Sundays—both of which really pack the venue in the evenings.

“The complex also holds a lot of events, typically as often as four nights each week.”

With as many options as there are for food and drink, including a nice wrap-around bar, it’s a great place to visit.

On top of everything, the venue is very conveniently located—right outside of Watersound just down from Rosemary. It’s centered within the Prominence subdivision that offers new homes and townhomes on the market. You don’t have to leave to entertain. Check out The HUB and Prominence today.

If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <title>The 10 Commandments of Buying a Home and Applying for a Mortgage</title>
        <link>http://ownemeraldcoast.com/the-10-commandments-of-buying-a-home-and-applying-for-a-mortgage.html</link>

        <description>

We give our customers a buyer’s guide that shares the 10 commandments of things you should never do when going through the process. Today I’ve listed those ten things below:

1. Thou shalt not change your job or quit your job during the mortgage approval period. Even if you’ve been awarded a promotion or offered a chance to change your environment, you don’t want to make these changes during the loan process. Lenders like consistency, not change.

2. Thou shalt not buy furniture or decor for your home before you buy it.Sometimes people use their funds that they have set aside for the closing and buy furniture or home decor. It’s easy to get excited, but you don’t even own the home yet! Focus on the mortgage first and then when you close, you can start looking at furniture for your home.

3. Thou shalt not use credit cards excessively and miss your payment due dates. Little dings can affect your credit and you’d be surprised at how much that can put you in jeopardy of not being approved for your home loan. Keep that spending at a minimum and make your payments on time.

4. Thou shalt not buy a car, boat, truck, or any large item.It’s not a good idea to get a loan on that item, and even if you’re paying cash, it’s better to wait to make that purchase until your mortgage process is complete.

5. Thou shalt not omit debts from your credit application. A lot of times folks want to make themselves look good on paper and leave stuff off their loan application. Omitting any items could get you in trouble and jeopardize your loan process if any of those things come up.

“Lenders like consistency, not change.”

6. Thou shalt not stop paying rent or your current mortgage payment during the loan process. This can greatly affect your credit if you miss payments, and you can lose your loan approval for your new home.

7. Thou shalt not originate any inquiries to your credit during the mortgage process. Lenders don’t like a lot of change. Don’t make a lot of inquiries to your credit and keep things neutral during that process.

8. Thou shalt not cosign for someone else’s loan. You may want to help a friend or family, and they may make the payments on time, but it could affect your ability to get your loan approved so it’s best to hold off while you’re going through this process.

9. Thou shalt not make large deposits into your account without letting your lender know first. These deposits have to be verified at the source that they come from and you can get some advice from your lender about which accounts to deposit the funds into.

10. Thou shalt not change bank accounts or make a lot of transfers from one bank account to the other. You don’t want to make a lot of changes while you’re going through the mortgage process, so keep those funds where they’re at as much as possible.

If you have any questions about this topic, or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, give us a call. We’d be happy to help!

        <description>

One of the first things people think of when they visit the Destin area is our white sand beaches and the Gulf of Mexico, but this is also a boater’s dream with plenty of places to explore throughout all of our coastal waterways. There are so many wonderful places to explore by water to create memories that last forever.

Recently I visited the Fort Walton Beach sound on the west side of Mary Esther to do a little boating on the adjoining intercoastal waterway and along the Destin harbor. There are many beaches like the one I’m standing on in the video above scattered up and down the coastline, and we’re fortunate to live in such a beautiful area.

“We’d be honored to give you a private tour of waterfront properties if you want.”

Destin’s original tag line was “The World’s Luckiest Fishing Village” due to our vast variety of fish, but we’re now also recognized as one of the top coastal vacation destinations in the country.

We live this lifestyle and if you ever want to explore waterfront real estate opportunities by boat, we would be honored to give you a private tour. Looking at real estate and our area by water gives you a much different perspective than by land.

If you have any questions or you think you might like to take a ride to look at some waterfront properties, don’t hesitate to give me a call. You don’t have to twist my arm to get me out of the office.

        <title>Should You Seek Out Low Condo Association Fees?</title>

        <description>

More often than not, whenever we have people looking for a resort condominium project to buy, the first thing they desire is low condo association fees. Is it a good idea to seek out low condo association fees, though?

No, it’s not. This is the wrong mentality to have because it could negatively affect you in the long run. When these fees are too low, the property typically isn’t being properly maintained, no reserves are being built for future replacements or improvements, and there’s not enough staff to properly run the HOA. Without these things, the building usually falls into disarray and ages much quicker.

I prefer to see a see a building that has great financials in place, whose budget is being met, and for which a constant reserve is being built for future improvements of the building. When a reserve isn’t being built, that’s when you get popped with an unexpected fee that’s a much larger amount in one bulk fee versus one that’s dispersed over time.

“You can see the difference between a building that’s being properly funded and one that isn’t.”

Condo association fees also cover a lot of items in the building. They cover all of your utilities except for the electric and all of your exterior insurance—the only other insurance policy you’ll usually have to get is a contents policy, which costs about $1,200 a year. They also cover liability insurance for the common areas and the maintenance for the common areas. You can really see the difference in a building that’s being properly funded and one whose fees are too low.

If you consider what those fees are compared to an individual home’s costs, it’s usually a wash. When it comes to an individual home, you pay your fees in smaller increments. For instance, if you pay an $800 per month fee for a condo as part of the association, think about what you’d pay in a home at times. You might need to shell out $150 for the landscaping, $150 for the pool maintenance, and pay for all the exterior maintenance and insurance to boot. These costs can amount to more than the condo fee itself. Condos are more convenient because they charge a flat fee and you don’t have to keep up with all the bills.

Condos also offer a great way of life down here. They allow you to be closer to the Gulf or right on the beach at an affordable price. Overall, there’s less maintenance and you can come and go as you please.

We’re extremely knowledgeable on every condominium from Fort Walton beach to Panama City Beach and everything in between, so if you’re looking for a condominium or you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love the opportunity to help you.

        <description>

Have you been to Vin’tij Wine Boutique &amp; Bistro yet? We recently sat down with owner Todd Reber to give you a taste of what you’re missing in our latest local venue spotlight.

Todd got started in the restaurant industry through a series of jobs he held in college. That experience led him to decide that the marriage of food and wine seemed like a great lifestyle. He gravitated toward it because he enjoyed the camaraderie of restaurant tours and the crowds that came through. When he graduated from Florida State, he discovered he actually made more money in the restaurant industry than he could in a professional field. He decided to challenge himself and open up Vin’tij.

“It’s been a good run for the last 17 years,” Todd says.

He chose Destin as his location because Miramar Beach was close to his home and it was a big destination for outlet stores, which allowed him to use that synergy to test out his concept. 15 years ago, all of the fine wines were earmarked for restaurants. According to Todd, if you wanted a fine wine to take home and enjoy with your friends, you had very few choices. His idea was to find boutique wines and offer them at a reasonable price that you could either enjoy at the restaurant or take home with you.

“We always feel welcome at Vin’tij, and the food is superb.”

In his opinion, the people make Vin’tij stand apart from the competition. He also noted Chef John and his fare, which is fresh and consistently good, and the employees that work there, who are all lifers and have helped to create a family atmosphere.

“We try to welcome everybody that walks in the door,” he says. “We know we’ve got only this moment to make it well and make it right, and that’s what we focus on. We don’t focus on what happened yesterday or what’s going to happen tomorrow—we’re in the now.”

He prefers guests’ experience to be simple. He knows they’re there to have a great meal, and their goal is to help them do so.

This is a place our team loves to go to, and it’s one of the top-rated restaurants in town. We always feel welcome there, the food is always superb, and they support the local residents. We highly recommend you try the experience for yourself.

We want to thank Todd for sitting down to talk with us. If you’d like to know more about Vin’tij, visit their website at www.Vintij.com.

If you have any other questions for us, feel free to give us a call or shoot us an email. We’d be happy to help.

        <description>

We’re at Pedego Bikes, one of my favorite spots. They rent and sell electric bikes here, and I actually bought one for Christmas. It’s been a ton of fun for me and my family. It lets us explore 30A without having to pedal up any steep hills.

We were delighted to be joined by Pedego Bikes owner Jason Medina. He recently retired from the Coast Guard after 22 years and created this store in part to get through some of the congestion and parking issues he faced. Jason says electric bikes are the best way to get around 30A, and I agree. They offer sales and rentals to get the whole family out there cruising around.

“Electric bikes are the best way to get around 30A.”

They are located at 174 Watercolor Way in Santa Rosa, right next door to Publix and the UPS Store. I encourage you to come check out some of these bikes and take one for a test drive yourself.

If you have any questions for me about Pedego or about real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!

Today I’m here at the Not Too Shabby Boutique, owned by Tony and Marisol Gullo. Marisol was recently chosen as the 2017 Artist of the Year! You can find Marisol’s artwork at the boutique along with many unique pieces.

“We are a one-stop shop,” says Tony. Tony and Marisol make custom pieces that you can’t get anywhere else. They use reclaimed wood for their pieces and sell upholstery by Four Seasons. You can also find Bella Notte Linens, pieces by Regina Andrew, and more from Aidan Gray Home.

“Not Too Shabby is a one-stop shop.”

Although Not Too Shabby has been around for 17 years, they moved into this plaza five years ago. You can find the Not Too Shabby Boutique at 3906 Hwy 98 West.

If you need to furnish your new home or if you need furniture for a rental property, make sure you check out Not Too Shabby. You will be amazed at the variety of furniture and art pieces here that you can use to create a unique look.

If you have any questions for Tony or Marisol, you can contact them here. As always, if you have any real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

Here are five creative tips that will help you get a great deal on the perfect property.

1. Be very specific about what you want. The more you share with us, the easier it will be to find that dream property. Don’t be afraid to let us know what you would be uncomfortable with spending, either. Everything you tell us will help us find the right pool of options that perfectly align with your needs.

2. Be financially well documented. If you’re taking out a loan, make sure you are pre-approved and have that pre-approval letter before you start looking at homes. If you’re a cash buyer, you’ll still want to have some form of financial verification to present to the seller. Having that paperwork presents you as a serious buyer. We’ll align you with the best lender for your needs that is already familiar with properties in our area.

“The more you share with us, the easier it will be to find that dream property.”

3. Act quickly. We’ll be sending you properties as soon as they hit the market, so when you see one that checks off all the boxes, be ready to see it and possibly make an offer. Chances are, you’ll be one of six or seven people also looking at that same home, so be prepared to pounce.

4. Come in with a market-appropriate offer. Don’t try to undercut the sellers. A low offer could cause the seller to reach out to other interested parties, creating a bidding war and ultimately driving up the price. If you present a great offer right off the bat, the seller will only be focused on yours so you can avoid that competition.

5. Minimize contingencies. If you write in a bunch of ways in which you can get out of or cancel a contract, a seller isn’t going to take you very seriously. You want to include some contingencies to make sure you’re protected, but limit the amount to show you are serious about closing on that property.

If you have any questions or need any help buying or selling your home, please don’t hesitate to give us a call. We’re here to help!

This week I’m honored to feature Sushimoto, one of our favorite local restaurants here on the Emerald Coast.

My wife and I absolutely love coming here for sushi that’s extremely fresh and hot dishes that are great. In fact, Emeril Lagasse himself recently featured Sushimoto as one of his favorite restaurants! Owners Andy and Sophia are great people and good friends that provide the best customer service.

“If you mention the Nathan Abbott Team, you’ll get a hot sake on the house.”

Andy wanted a way to feature local seafood and our beautiful beaches drew him here. He loves having a local spot and seeing so many new faces come try his food.

If you mention the Nathan Abbott Team, they’ll even give you a hot sake on the house.

I encourage you to check out Sushimoto because if you come once, I’m sure you’ll be back. You won’t be disappointed!

Until then, give me a call or send me an email with any questions about our local real estate market. I’d be happy to help.

As a home seller, what can you do to get your home ready for the photo shoot, the market, and for buyer showings?

When potential buyers pull up to your house, the outside needs to be just as inviting as the inside. This means having your bushes trimmed back, your driveway and home pressure washed, fresh light bulbs, and maybe some fresh cut flowers. If the exterior of your home is in disarray, that buyer may just keep driving because they got a bad first impression of your home.

As they walk through your front door, it’s important to have all of your carpets vacuumed and your home smelling clean and fresh.

You should also make sure that your home is free of all personal items. Take down family photos and make sure that there aren’t any books stacked on the counter or above cabinets. You want the buyer to feel like this can be their home, and if your personal stuff is lying around everywhere, they will feel like they are intruding in someone else’s home.

“A few small fixes can go a long way.”

It’s important to have all of the smaller items in your home functioning correctly. Check on cabinet hinges, sliding glass doors, and more.

During the showing, we recommend that you have jazz music playing or cookies baking. Doing so will show buyers that you have pride in homeownership. We provide a professional stager to all of our clients. The stager will come in and let you know what you need to do to make showings fantastic. Sometimes just switching out the comforters on the beds or adding a new lamp makes all the difference. Little changes go a long way; you don’t have to spend a lot of money to make your home more appealing to buyers.

Hopefully some of these tips will help you sell your home faster and maximize your price. It’s all about the little touches and the experience the buyer has from the moment they pull up in front of your home. If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

What’s happening in our local real estate market?

As a whole, our market is very healthy right now. There are indications that it’s converting into a buyer’s market but some of that is due to December being a traditionally slow month for a vacation market, such as ours.

We are in one of the fastest-growing areas in the country for primary residents, and we’re being discovered on a national level. Growing up in this area, I can tell you that, historically, most of our real estate traffic has come from the Southeast region. Now, though, we have residents coming from as far away as California.

“Our area is being discovered on a national level.”

In the past, whenever we had a rise or fall in the market, there was so much speculation in our area that a lot of people who bought properties didn’t have the holding power to keep them and shouldn’t have been buying those properties on the level that they were. Today, there isn’t nearly as much speculation. The activity in our market now is based more on our exposure and people wanting to live in our area.

If you get a loan, lenders are very strict right now about who they’re lending to. There is a lot of cash entering our market, and that’s a strong indication of longevity. Another indicator I always look at in gauging market strength is how the commercial growth is happening in that area, and our commercial growth has been great lately. We have a brand-new 5-star hotel, a new Whole Foods, and plenty of new shopping centers up and down Highway 98. These property developments are all signs of a strengthening market.

Shopping and Entertainment, Brand New and Expansions:

Destin Commons

Pier Park

Pier Park North

The HUB

30 Avenue

New Hotels:

The Henderson (5 star)

The Pearl of Rosemary

The Hampton Inn

If you have any questions about our market or if there’s anything I can assist you with, please feel free to give me a ring or shoot me an email. I would love the opportunity to serve you!
