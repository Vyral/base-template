        <description>

Before you hire any agent or team to assist in the sale of your home, there are certain questions you must ask them.

Before you hire an agent or team of agents to assist you with your home selling experience, you’ll need to make sure they’re the right fit for the job. The best way to determine this is by simply asking the right questions. 

To help you do this, our team recently put together a guide on the top 10 questions you must ask before hiring a listing agent to sell your home. We would be happy to send you a free copy of this guide by mail or email, but, for now, we’d like to give you a preview of just a couple of these questions. 

The first (and potentially most important) question you should ask any agent before you hire them is: “Can I fire you if I’m not satisfied?” 

No one wants to be stuck working with a professional who they aren’t happy with. Any listing agent you work with should be willing to let you walk away if they aren’t delivering the results you want and deserve. 

The second question in this guide is: “Do you have actual results?” 

“The best way to determine if an agent or a team of agents is right for you is by asking a few key questions”

Anyone can talk the talk, but only truly qualified agents will be able to back their claims up with a proven track record of success. Our team, for example, has a full list of statistics pertaining to our past and current success in the industry. 96% of our team’s listings are successful. The average success rate of other agents in our market, meanwhile, is just 61.6%. Our team also maintains a 98% list-to-sales price ratio. This is 4% higher than the 94% list-to-sales price ratio held by the average agent in our market. 

Part of the reason for our success is our team structure, which brings me to another important question: Is the agent you’re thinking about working with part of a team or are they working alone? 

Whereas a team structure allows each of its agents to focus their energy into specialized tasks, solo agents are left to handle everything on their own. As the old saying goes, “A Jack of all trades is a master of none.” 

The questions and tips we’ve shared today are just a small preview of the wealth of information that’s available in our full guide. 

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want a copy of this guide for yourself, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Today I’m answering a question that’s probably on every buyer and seller’s mind: When is it too early to take action?

The real estate market can be likened to Black Friday pandemonium: You want to beat the rush. We’re approaching that time of year when leases will be ending, and people will be looking and relocating in every area of our market. 

So when is the best time to beat the real estate rush? 

You can count on both the buyer and seller crowd storming onto the market in April and May, and even as early as March, but that doesn’t mean there will be a lack of activity in January and February. Actually, people are buying and selling in the winter months. 

As a buyer, being early will help you avoid multiple-offer scenarios that you may have encountered in last year’s market. If you’re tied to a lease for a little longer, pay your two months and close on the first of the month so you can stay in front of the busy season. 

Come April and May, the market will be inevitably flooded with thousands of properties. If you’re a seller, listing now will give you a decisive advantage and ensure that your home stands out. 

“As a buyer, being early will help you avoid multiple-offer scenarios that you may have encountered in last year’s market.”

If we can assist you with your real estate needs in any way, please reach out and give us a call. We’re never too busy for you. We look forward to meeting you at the closing table!

What’s the best way to present an offer? Let’s discuss this crucial question.

After you’ve found the perfect home, what’s the best way to present an offer?

The first thing to consider is the price. If the list price is appropriate from the get-go, then some of the work has already been done for you. 

A lot of people want to submit offers below what the seller is asking, but proceeding this way doesn’t give you any leverage as a buyer. If the home is priced at $400,000, why not appease the seller and offer $395,000? Many other buyers will be making offers around $380,000 and $385,000, so submitting an offer that comes close to what the seller wants will make you stand out. Coming in strong is key—even if you eventually negotiate a higher price as the result of a bidding war. 

Once you’ve submitted an offer with a competitive price and made a substantial earnest money deposit, ask the seller to cover closing costs. This isn’t necessary, but they may agree to handle this expense given the strength of your offer. Make sure, though, that your offer comes with an expiration date. You want the seller to realize that you won’t wait around forever.

In addition to asking for the seller to pay the closing costs, you may also choose to ask for some personal property, like the refrigerator. People tend to assume that appliances like this come with the home, but this isn’t always the case. If the home was shown with patio furniture, you could ask for that to be included as well. Sellers will occasionally be willing to part with large furniture items.

“Your price, terms, and conditions must be attractive to the seller, but they should also help you secure a great deal.”

Finally, don’t forget about home warranties. Many sellers will be willing to pay for a one-year home warranty policy to give their buyer peace of mind about proceeding with the purchase. 

The items we’ve covered are just a few of the things you can and should ask for when presenting an offer. Your price, terms, and conditions must be attractive to the seller, but they should also help you secure a great deal. 

So if you have any other questions, would like more information, or are curious how we can help you succeed with your real estate goals, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Today, I’ll go over three important marketing strategies to help you sell your home for top dollar.

If you plan on selling your home, it’s very important that it’s marketed correctly. There are three ways to market your home: 

1. Agent networking. There are 27,000 properties on the MLS. It’s impossible for agents to keep up with every single one of them. That’s why it’s your agent’s job to let other buyer agents know that your property is available. Your agent needs to have a networking system in place to tell 13,000 agents in the area about your new listing. Agents have to know about your house; that’s 70% of the reason your home will or will not sell.

2. Paid advertising. When you put your home on the market, it automatically goes on Realtor.com and Zillow. However, they will be on the last page. It costs a lot of money to have your home featured on those websites. Your agent needs to spend a couple thousand dollars a month on marketing on those websites, or your listing will live on the last page.

“Agents have to know about your house; that’s 70% of the reason your home will or will not sell.”

3. Yard marketing. We don’t just stick a For Sale sign in the yard and call it a day. We provide four ways for a buyer to contact us about your house. We have the traditional yard sign, an information sign, an “Open House Every Day, Call for Times” sign, and a “Buy This House and We’ll Sell Yours for Free.” We have 24-hour tracking so we can capitalize on every buyer who called one of those four numbers. We also have a team of agents to capture, return, and answer those calls at a high level so that you get maximum exposure for your property.

If you have any other questions about marketing your home in today’s market, just give us a call or send us an email. My team and I would be happy to help you!

We’re still in a seller’s market, but there are signs out there that we could be seeing a shift soon. Here’s what you need to know.

A lot of people have been asking me about the market lately. The one question I keep hearing constantly is, “Was 2018 a seller’s market or a buyer’s market?”

When looking at all the numbers across the board, I lean toward saying 2018 was more of a seller’s market. Although interest rates have been creeping up and we have a feeling we are going to start seeing a shift in the market, I don’t think it will be anything crazy. At the same time, things will certainly change.

Back in 2008 and 2009 we saw the bottom of our market in the Charlotte area. This is also when we saw a huge increase in short sales and foreclosures. After that, we saw a steady increase that takes us to where we are today. We’re on about a nine to 10-year increase in home prices right now. As most people know, real estate tends to operate in cycles that are usually about this long.

What are some signs out there of this shift? For starters, we’ve seen about double the amount of expired listings compared to last year. Home sales are still about equal and pricing has continued to go up for the time being, but in some areas, days on market are starting to creep up. 

“Our expired listings have nearly doubled this year.”

With homes staying on the market a little bit longer and expired listings on the rise, it doesn’t necessarily mean we’ll see a heavy shift. 2018 was and is still a fantastic seller’s market with fantastic interest rates and continually increasing home prices.

If you have any questions about the market or about how you can take advantage of the current conditions before they possibly shift, give me a call or send me an email today. I would love to hear from you soon.

        <description>

Don’t look to the seasons for when to sell—look to the market.

What is the best season for selling your house? The quick answer is: none of them.

The best time could be any time of year, but it’s always when inventory is low and there is still a high demand from buyers. 

Keeping up with the current market is vital. If you’re in a price range with 100 comparable homes for sale in your area when there are usually around 50, it might be best to wait.

Seasons do have some influence—buyers are looking around in the summer and spring while in the fall, people are looking for a new-year home. The good thing is, people are moving to the Carolinas all year long. People often wait to sell in the spring, meaning lower inventory during other seasons. This is when we sell.

Other companies often slow down during the winter months, while we speed up and sell many homes in the fall and winter seasons. We find that a lot of buyers say the same thing: “There’s no inventory, I’m just going to wait until spring.” There’s no need to wait, as we can connect those buyers directly to the sellers. All it takes is putting homes up for sale in the late fall.

“The good thing is, people are moving to the Carolinas all year long.”

I’ve helped countless homeowners take advantage of these opportune times, and I’m more than happy to help you as well with the home selling process. Please contact me if you would like my guidance, have any questions, or would simply like some information. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <title>Sellers: Stay Far Away From Companies Offering to Pay Cash for Your Home</title>

        <description>

Most of you have probably seen advertisements for companies claiming they’ll buy your home for cash. They make it sound so easy, but is it really? Are the results worth it?

Here’s the truth: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

One of our clients recently met with one such company. Over the phone, they had priced her home at $308,000—but this client’s home is actually worth about $330,000. When they visited her property, they started making price reductions based on things like the fact that she didn’t have granite countertops. And these deductions made no sense. Even though it only would have cost this client about $2,800 to install granite countertops, the company chopped $4,000 off of their offer because her home lacked them.

The company made deduction after deduction like this until she was left with an offer of about $290,000—$18,000 less than what they had originally said they’d pay.

“In addition to making such low offers, companies like these also charge a fee that knocks the price down even further.”

So instead of working with this company, this seller decided to come to us. Within the first week of having her home on the market with our team, she received an offer of $327,000.

If our client would have proceeded with the company she’d been speaking to before, she would have been in for yet another nasty surprise. In addition to making such low offers, companies like these also charge a fee that knocks the price down even further. In the case of our client, she would have been asked to pay a 7% fee to sell her home to this company and ultimately earn less than she could (and did) on the open market.

So if you have $60,000 or $70,000 to lose to a dishonest company, by all means reach out to them. But if you want to sell your home quickly and for top dollar, call us.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <title>What Questions Should You Ask an Agent Before Hiring Them?</title>

        <description>

There are a few key questions you should be asking any potential agent before you hire them. Here are just three of them.

If you want to hire the best agent to help you with your real estate transaction, there are a few questions you need to be asking before you hire one.

1. Ask how many homes they’ve sold this year. It’s good to be even more specific by asking how many homes they sold in a particular area, or how many homes they didn’t sell. If you hire someone with a track record of 10 listings in which only three sold, that’s a problem.

2. Ask about their list-to-sales ratio. If an agent is consistently selling houses for less than what they’re listed for, you may want to reconsider hiring that agent. You want to get the most money that you can for your house, don’t you?

3. Ask about their marketing plan. The average agent in the area spends a maximum of $300 per month on true marketing systems to get homes sold. However, $300 doesn’t get you very much exposure for your listing—the Dan Jones Group spends over $20,000 a month in marketing to generate buyers for our listings.

“If an agent is consistently selling houses for less than what they’re listed for, you may want to reconsider hiring that agent.”

If you’re in the market to buy or sell a home, please reach out to us. We’re prepared to answer these questions and more if you consider hiring us for your transaction.

        <description>

Today I want to discuss some of the risks of selling your home as for sale by owner.

FSBO sellers are probably having more success now than ever. In fact, The National Association of Realtors says that a little over 5% of FSBO properties are successful. Although they are selling successfully, most of them are selling for 5% to 10% less than they would have if they were sold by an agent who could’ve marketed the home and generated foot traffic. 

Most FSBO properties attract unqualified buyers, which means you’ll have people who are not pre-qualified walking through your home. They also attract tire-kickers and people who are looking for owner financing. Or, you could just attract people who will steal your things.

“Although FSBO properties are selling successfully, most of them sell for 5% to 10% less than if they would if they were sold by an agent.”

Recently here in Charlotte, we had a home seller who let a random couple come and see their house. During their time in the house, the couple unlocked a couple windows. They later broke in and robbed the owners when they were out of town, stealing all of their valuables. 

If you’re selling your home as for sale by owner, congratulations on taking the initiative to do it by yourself. But, be careful not to leave 10% to 15% of the purchase price on the table, because it could end up costing you $20,000, $30,000, or even $40,000+ depending on the price range. 

If you love the idea of getting your home sold in a reasonable amount of time for top dollar, give us a call. We would be happy to help you sell your home and give you the comfort of allowing us to handle everything for you.

        <description>

What makes our team different than the rest? Here are five advantages that we offer to our clients.

There are a lot of real estate agents out there, so potential clients always want to know what makes us different. Here are five reasons why our team stands out:

1. Negotiating. Most new or inexperienced agents aren’t good negotiators. From the price, to closing costs, to repairs, they are unsure what to do, what to ask for, and when to ask for it. Choosing the right agent can give you a $10,000 to $15,000 swing on your final price.

2. Knowledge. If you are buying or selling a house, you need to be with someone who is working consistently in the market and knows the trends, when to buy, and how to buy it. You want to avoid neighborhoods that might lose value in the future–we are tuned into that.

3. Lenders. Knowing the best local lenders are huge. We stopped working with a local group a few years ago because they almost doubled their rates. The preferred lenders we use don’t charge those same fees, but do just as good of a job. There are hundreds of agents still using the company that we used originally, and they’re simply passing the extra cost along to their clients.

“We know the market inside and out, including the best local lenders to work with.”

4. Marketing. It all starts online, and continues with aggressive yard-marketing from a full team. We make sure that your home is shared with all agents around the Charlotte area, while most agents will just list the home on the MLS and leave it at that. That’s not the best way to get your home sold. Our method is.

5. Being full-time. There are so many part-time agents out there who really don’t know the market and frankly, the business in general. If you don’t work with someone who is full-time, you could be leaving tens of thousands of dollars on the table.

If you have any questions for us about how we do business or if you need any advice about buying or selling a home in Charlotte, please feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon

Instead of talking about real estate today, I wanted to introduce you to our newest team member: My 6-month-old daughter, Charlotte.

I just wanted to show you one of the biggest reasons why we’re in business: my 6-month-old daughter. She may have many things to learn from us, but hopefully she will be answering some of our phone calls in the near future.

“Charlotte’s only 6 months old, but she’s going to be with us for a very long time.”

She is my big reason why we do all that we do for our friends, family, and clients. To see her full debut, watch this short video.

In the meantime, if you have any real estate-related questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

There are a lot of misconceptions about the real estate industry out there. Today I’ll be tackling three common myths, in particular.

There’s a lot of confusion about what’s true and false about the real estate industry, so today I wanted to address and debunk three common myths people believe about this business.

1. Real estate agents are paid a salary. The truth is that real estate agents unfortunately don’t earn a salary. If we do, then something is seriously wrong with my payroll. We actually work on commission.

“While Zillow has a lot of good, fun information, its Zestimate tool is not an accurate way to determine home value.”

2. Zillow is a reliable real estate tool. People often cite Zillow Zestimates as a basis for home value, but the estimates produced by this online algorithm can be 50%, 60%, or even 70% off. So, while Zillow has a lot of good, fun information, its Zestimate tool is not an accurate way to determine home value.

3. Inspections work on a pass/fail system. In the state of North Carolina, home inspections don’t operate on a pass/fail system. Instead, home inspections simply outline any issues that have been found with the property. Buyers have the right to walk away from a contract if the inspection report comes back with information they find to be unacceptable, but properties undergoing a home inspection don’t receive a pass/fail grade.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <title>Why You Should Reconsider Having an Open House</title>

        <description>

If you are planning an open house, you should reconsider. Today I will explain the risks.

&nbsp;

Today I want to talk to you about open houses. There are a lot of people who think open houses are the best thing ever. They think that they will get a lot of qualified people walking through their house on a Saturday and end up with offers on Sunday morning. 

Unfortunately, this is wrong. 

In general, open houses do not work. Usually, the people who come into an open house are nosy neighbors who want to peek around and see what you have done to your house. Unqualified buyers are also a risk. Many people go to an open house with a lower budget than what your home’s price range is in. 

There are people who have been looking for a home for five to eight years. They are known as “true tire kickers” and when they see an open house sign they coming running in, but are more interested in free food and drinks than in purchasing a home.  

Theft is also a risk during an open house. With so many people walking through a home, valuables could wind up missing. Monitoring every single person in attendance simply isn’t possible.

So, with all the risks, why do we still do open houses every day? 

“I am hesitant to do an open house because it is difficult to watch multiple people as they walk through a home at the same time and valuables could wind up missing.”

Because we hold open houses for qualified buyers only. Before we do an open house for you, we make sure that every buyer who walks through the door has a loan approval. We will work hard to get qualified people through your door, not your nosy neighbors. 

If you have any additional questions about this or are interested in selling with us, please feel free to contact me anytime. I would be happy to help.

        <title>Our Market Is Red Hot—But For How Long?</title>

The market is currently going strong, but how long can we expect that to last?

&nbsp;

The market right now is on fire—but how long will the market remain hot?

Inventory is generally low, so we are still in a seller’s market. In the higher-end price ranges (above $750,000), things are stabilizing, but for anything under $400,000, inventory is still scarce. For the low-end price range, you would be lucky to find anything to choose from at all. For those homes that do appear on the market, you better be prepared to put out an offer fairly quickly because homes are receiving multiple offers more often than not.

Around 40% to 43% of all properties in the Charlotte area that are priced above $750,000 or $800,000 are selling, which is an all-time high for us. But with around 50% of those homes not selling, like I said, the market is stabilizing. Hopefully that bleeds over into the mid- and lower-range markets.

Interest rates have crept up a little bit, and they are expected to continue to do so throughout the year. Despite that, I do not think that will slow anything down much; we still have low inventory and the economy is still generally hot.

“I do not see this red-hot market slowing down.”

With the exception of mid-range properties, which have begun to plateau a little, home prices have increased dramatically over the last three or four years. However, it is not as drastic as it was three or four years ago, which is a healthy sign that we will, hopefully, avoid another real estate bubble in the near future.

In summary, I do not see this red-hot market slowing down. Even if interest rates are creeping up, they are still extremely low compared to historical averages of the past 30 to 40 years.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I would be happy to help you however I can.

        <description>

A lot of homeowners like to hire the agent that values their home at the highest price. Here is an example of why that is not such a great idea.

&nbsp;

What are the biggest reasons that homes fail to sell in Charlotte? We are going to look at the biggest culprits today.

The No. 1 reason homes fail to sell is because sellers choose the wrong agent. We went on a listing appointment around seven months ago, and the gentleman chose to list the home with a different agent instead of with our team.

The agent told the seller that his home was worth way more than it was, so they listed it way too high which caused the home to sit on the market for six months. When a home sits on the market that long, the more people think something is wrong with the house. This results in leaving a ton of money on the table. Having the home on the market for six months cost the sellers at least $12,000.

Finally, the homeowners re-listed the house and came down to the price we suggested. It took just two months to sell the home this time, although they had to eat another $4,000 on monthly mortgage payments. That cost the sellers a total of $14,000 on mortgage payments. Because people already know it has been on the market for so long, they probably will have to come down in price more.

In conclusion, do not choose a listing agent just because they tell you the price you want to hear. The agent that listed this home also had 15 to 20 properties listed, with zero under contract.

“These sellers left tens of thousands of dollars on the table by hiring the wrong agent.”

A lack of marketing, a lack of communication ,and a lack of professionalism caused this home to fail to sell. In this case, these sellers are going to leave $20,000 or $30,000 on the table by making this mistake.

If you are looking to sell your home the right way, give us a call or send us an email. We would be glad to help out by putting you in the best position possible to succeed. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <title>3 Common Mistakes That Could Ruin Your Home Sale</title>

        <description>

Over the years, I’ve noticed a few common mistakes that sellers make when preparing their homes for the market. I’ll go over three of them for you today. 

First of all, a lot of people hire the listing agent that gives them the highest price. You may think your home is worth a certain amount, and then this listing agent tells you a huge number. You think, “Wow! That’s really good. My home is really worth that much? I’m going with that agent.” 

That listing agent might not sell a lot of houses or do much marketing, but he’s offering a higher price than the other agents to get your listing. 

Recently, one of the sellers we had a listing appointment with decided to hire an agent who offered a higher price for their home than what they expected. We looked at this agent and found that out of their 28 listings, only one was under contract. We did a little more research and discovered that this agent’s strategy seemed to be to overprice all of his listings. 

So, be careful of your price. If you have an idea what your home is worth and other agents confirm that, don’t just hire the stray agent who offers a higher listing price. If you are serious about hiring an agent who offers a higher price, do your research. See how many homes they have actually sold and how many homes they have under contract.

“Price your home with the market.”

The second mistake to avoid is overpricing or underpricing your home. The best way to sell for top dollar in the least amount of time is to price your home with the market. Then, you are able to let the market chase you instead of chasing the market. 

You can’t underprice your home by $20,000 and hope that multiple offers will drive the sales price up. You also don’t want to overprice your home by $20,000 or $30,000. If you do, your home will sit on the market and you will have to do a number of price reductions, which will cause buyers to wonder what’s wrong with your house. As a result, you won’t get any offers.  

Finally, you need to have a checklist. We have a 75-point checklist to get our clients’ homes ready for the market. We want to make sure that every aspect of the house is cozy and up to date as best as we can. We’ll help you through decluttering, staging, and taking professional photos and videos. We also offer 3-D imaging to create a virtual tour of your home. 

It’s important to have some kind of checklist when preparing your home for the market. More often than not, sellers aren’t sure what they need to do in order to make their home more appealing to buyers so they can get top dollar. 

Make sure you avoid these three mistakes. There are 1,500 people here in the Charlotte area who have failed to sell their homes over the past few months, even though Charlotte is in the best seller’s market we’ve seen in years. Make sure that you prepare your home properly for the market. 

If you have any other questions about selling your home, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

I believe 2018 is going to be a great year for real estate. However, if you’re thinking of trying to buy or sell a home without the assistance of a real estate agent, you might want to think again.

For homebuyers, purchasing a home without an agent is not advisable. Especially for new construction homes. We had two folks last year who bought new construction homes without an agent in the past and it ended up biting them when it came time to sell. One couple thought they were getting a deal at $350,000, but it turns out they shouldn’t have paid a cent over $315,000. They ended up selling the home for less than they bought it for because the builder pulled one over on then.

“FSBO homes sell for 10% to 15% less on average.”

If you’re planning on buying a new construction property or you’re even entertaining the idea, let us know and we’d be glad to provide you with the knowledge and experience necessary to get a fair price on your new home.

Some people think selling their home on their own is a good idea. However, the numbers don’t back this up. Depending on where you’re priced, selling your home FSBO will result in you selling for 10% to 15% less than normal. Is it really worth it to try and save 3% on an agent’s commission when you’re going to end up selling for at least 10% less anyway? The answer is no. Hiring an agent is the right decision here.

If you’re interested in buying or selling a home in the near future, keep us in mind. We sold over 250 homes last year, so we know what we’re doing. We’ll do a killer job and make sure you get a great deal without overpaying. If you have any other questions or any other real estate needs we can assist with, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.

        <description>

When looking at our upcoming 2018 market, most people will notice that money is cheap, which means it’s a good time to buy. They’ll also notice that inventory is low, which means there are lots of buyers out there and it’s also a great time to sell. 

For the majority of people, 2018 will be a seller’s market. However, this can depend on who’s marketing your home and how that house is marketed. We had a meeting the other day with a couple selling their home who ended up deciding to do business with a friend. At the end of the meeting, they apologized for having us over because they were going to go with their friend regardless. They felt bad for wasting our time, but we told them it was okay and to let us know if things didn’t work out. 

What happened with their listing? It’s been on the market for a little over two months, and our office—which has sold over 250 homes in this area—hasn’t received a single email or phone call notifying us that this property was on the market.

“Our buyers are in a buyer’s market and our sellers are in a seller’s market.”

For that couple, are we still in a seller’s market? Just because homes are selling fairly quickly doesn’t mean your home doesn’t need to be marketed. There are a ton of buyers out there, but if the agents in our area don’t know about your home, buyers might never find it. This couple eventually reached out to us and asked us to market their home, so from now on, all 12,000 people in our area will know about their home. 

On the flip side, we’re going to argue that for our buyers—or the folks who work with Carolina Real Estate Experts—it’s a buyer’s market. This is because we focus on getting our buyers priority access to all the better deals out there the second they come on the market so they avoid entering multiple offer situations with other buyers. 

In that case, our buyers are in a buyer’s market and our sellers are in a seller’s market. 

No matter which side of the fence you’re on, we’d love to help you. If you have any questions about our market or any real estate topics you’d like us to address, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to speaking with you.

        <description>

As we approach the end of 2017, it’s time for a real estate wrap up. As a firm, we had a great year, but let’s take a look at the Charlotte market in general. 

This year, the $250,000 and under market was probably the hottest it’s ever been. Homes spent 50 days on the market at most. 

The $250,000 to $500,000 price range had a killer year as well. However, if you listed your home and hired an agent who didn’t do any real marketing, then your home did spend more time on the market. The average days on market was 60. Homes without proper marketing stayed on the market for 120 to 180 days and went through an average of 2.5 price reductions before selling, if they sold at all. 

For homes priced $500,000 and above, the average days on market was close to 80, depending on the area, part of town, and inventory at the time. That is a very good number for this price point. 

In fact, these numbers are really good overall. 

If you tried to sell your home in 2017 and didn’t price your home appropriately, buyers knew something was up. Those buyers saw your home all over Realtor.com, Trulia, and Zillow. They didn’t come to see your house, and after you went through a price reduction or two, they thought something was wrong with your house. 

“2017 was a great year for real estate, and it looks like 2018 will be, too.”

If you plan on selling your home, it’s important that you price it correctly and work with an agent who will properly market your home. 

So, what will happen in 2018? 

Money is still very cheap, and 2018 should be another fantastic year for buying and selling real estate. If the interest rates stay low and the economy stays healthy, we are in for a solid 2018. Jump in before real estate goes too high and rates start to sneak up as well. 

If you have any questions about buying or selling a home in 2018, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

Today, I want to talk about what buyers look for in a home, as well as a few upgrade ideas for your current home. 

When it comes to preparing your home for the market, the most basic thing you need to understand is that buyers expect a house to be clean. When someone walks through the door, your home must feel clean, fresh, and cozy. 

So, what about upgrades to your property? If you are thinking about selling at some point later on, there are a few ways you can prepare now. 

One upgrade that will definitely attract buyers is the installation of a smart thermostat. Smart thermostats allow you to remotely control heating and cooling in your home and aren’t that much more expensive than a normal thermostat. Also, home surveillance systems can be a big plus.

“Small upgrades can make a big difference for buyers.”

Kitchen upgrades are another good option. Small features that don’t cost a lot can make a big impact on buyers. You shouldn’t feel obligated to spend a ton of money upgrading your home, but some subtle changes can definitely make a difference. For example, touchless faucets are fairly inexpensive and will help your home stand out to buyers.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

A lot of people out there seem to think that if they don’t use an agent to help them buy their home, they will save a lot of money by not having to pay the agent’s commission. However, the reality of the situation is far from that. 

You won’t save a penny by not hiring an agent to help you buy a home. You see, when a seller puts a home up for sale, there is automatically a split commission that is set aside for both agents. If a buyer comes in without an agent, the listing agent usually ends up collecting two checks. This can lead to some awkward situations.

“Not hiring a buyer’s agent is unwise.”

Recently, we had a couple who were looking to buy a home and called up the listing agent whose number was on the yard sign.They ended up paying the full listing price for the home because they didn’t know that the home had been on the market for 150 days prior without any offers. This information wasn’t hidden from them, they just didn’t have quick access to that information like a buyer’s agent does.

If you’re thinking about buying a home, there’s no reason to not hire a buyer’s agent. Their commission is covered by the seller and their expertise will help guide you to the best deal possible. Why wouldn’t you want someone looking out to make sure you get the best price, terms, and conditions possible?

If you have any questions for us or need help buying or selling a home, give us a call or send us an email. We’d be happy to help.

        <description>

Today I want to talk to you about what’s going on in the general Charlotte area for the fourth quarter. Quarters one, two, and three have been a killer time to buy and sell real estate. Here in the Charlotte area, interest rates are still low and you can still get a decent deal.

First, let’s talk about what’s going on with the inventory and compare it to last year.

Last year, around this time, we were looking at about 50 to 60 days’ worth of inventory depending on what Charlotte market you were looking at. If you took out some of the new construction that stayed on the market for 300 to 400 days, it went down a couple of days. 

Right now we’re looking at about 48 to 50 days of inventory, which is roughly the same as last year. A lot of people were concerned that that market would slow down, or that we were headed for a bubble. We could be headed that way if interest rates keep going lower and prices continue to skyrocket, but we’ll follow that market and keep you up to date.

Currently, there are just under 2,000 properties in the Charlotte area that are actively being marketed. In the last three months, we’ve had almost 3,300 properties closed, which puts us right at 1,100. The numbers come out to be about 1,075 or 1,080 closings on a monthly basis.

“If you’re buying a house, it is truly important, now more than ever, to make sure you have an agent who knows the market extremely well.”

Some people are now overpricing their homes substantially and they’re not selling, so we’ve had almost 1,400 or 1,500 people in the last few months that were not able to sell their house in this incredible seller’s market.

In regards to selling your house, just because we’re in a really good seller’s market doesn’t mean you can price your home at, say, $550,000, when the house is truly worth $30,000 to $40,000 more. In that case, what’s going to happen is that people will see the house and think it’s overpriced. As you do price reductions until you get to the point where you should have been originally, people will undercut you because they think something’s wrong with the house, and they might not even come to see it.

If you’re buying a house, it is truly important to make sure you have an agent who knows the market extremely well. Your agent should be someone who can get you access to all the best deals the moment they come on the market so that you’re the first in line. A lot of our houses in the $250,000 and less range are going off the market within hours.

Finally, out of those roughly 3,300 people, about 1,800 sold their property in 10 days. There are tons of agents out there underpricing homes, and there are a lot of sellers leaving tens of thousands of dollars on the table, so be careful.

At the end of the day, we can’t be over- or underpricing; you have to hit the nail on the head. You will get top dollar for your house every time.

If you’re really looking to get your home sold, give us a shout. We’d be happy to help.

        <title>Is the Holiday Season Really a Good Time to Enter the Market?</title>

        <description>

Why is the holiday season a good time to buy or sell? The months of October, November, December, and January actually present a lot of great opportunity. Also, the market is much less competitive during this time.

People tend to say they want to put their home search on hold during this time of year, but the truth is that these months are a great time to buy or sell.

Ultimately, great homes will move off the market very quickly. During the spring and summer months, these kinds of listings are going to go especially fast and see several offers. However, as the year rolls around to these later months, people step away from the market and listings get a lot less attention.

This presents a great opportunity for those who are willing to stay in the market during these months. Less competition means you can likely negotiate a lower price as a buyer.

“Why wait to list or buy until the busier, more competitive months of the year?”

However, there are a lot of benefits for this time of year from a seller’s perspective as well. The only buyers on the market at this time of year are buyers who are very serious about finding a home. While you still need to price your home aggressively, you definitely won’t need to worry about flaky offers.

Selling your home at this time of year isn’t like selling your home in spring or summer. Buyers aren’t merely floating from open house to open house; they are actually serious at this time of year. As a seller, you’re going to be able to dictate who, when, and how your home is sold at this time of year.

Why wait to list or buy until the busier, more competitive months of the year? Waiting will only make things harder for you.

Earlier this year, I had a client call and tell me they wanted to sell their home in the next two years. At the time it was June, and they asked if I thought they should list right then and there. Because they weren’t in need of an immediate sale, I actually advised them to wait until the later months.

For homes in smaller neighborhoods, the level of competition you see in the spring and summer markets actually makes those more popular times of year less than ideal to list in. Being caught up in a lot of competition isn’t the ideal way to enter the market.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <title>How Does Square Footage Affect Your Home’s Value?</title>
        <link>https://www.listwithdanjonesblog.com/how-does-square-footage-affect-your-homes-value.html</link>
        
          <category>Home Seller Tips</category>
        
        <author>Dan Jones</author>
        <pubDate>2017-10-09 11:00:17 -0500</pubDate>
        <guid>https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/Dan+Jones/2017/Dan+Jones+Home+Selling+Team-+How+Does+Square+Footage+Affect+Home+Value%253F.mp4</guid>
        <description>

How much does your home’s square footage affect its value? There are several factors to consider.

If you own a two-story, 3,000 square foot home that Zillow says is only worth $275,000 and you’re comparing it to a home across the street that’s also 3,000 square feet but has just sold for $350,000, why is that?

If the home across the street is a ranch-style home where all 3,000 square feet are on one level instead of two, your home won’t sell for the same price. One reason for this is ranches are much more desirable in our Charlotte market. Secondly, ranches are more expensive to build. The base of a ranch home is much larger, and it’s more expensive to build out than it is to build up because that involves more concrete, more plumbing, and more structure to be built around the property. This is why when you see homes that are $20 or $30 more per square foot for a single level, you can’t compare that. 

What about homes with basements? What if your home is 6,000 square feet with two stories and a basement and all the other two-story, 6,000 square foot homes without basements are selling for $125 per square foot?

“When it comes to calculating your home’s market value, you have to do a full equity evaluation.”

Your basement doesn’t cost as much to purchase as a home whose two stories account for all 6,000 square feet because your home’s square footage is 4,000 feet above ground and 2,000 feet below. That basement in general, depending on what sort of finishes it has, could be 30%, 40%, or 50% of the actual square footage cost of a home that has two stories instead of three.  

If a home across the street sells for $500,000 and it’s the same square footage as yours, be careful in assuming yours will sell for $500,000 too. You don’t know what upgrades that home has had or if the previous homeowners made any structural differences to make it a completely open floor plan. If both of your homes were built at the same time, that kind of renovation and other kinds of renovations might make it look newer than yours.

When it comes to making sure you know what your home is worth, you have to do a full equity evaluation that will account for square footage to a certain degree, but also the overall condition of a home, what upgrades have or have not been done, the location, and—most importantly—supply and demand. 

In addition to the square footage, all of those factors determine the value of your home. 

If you have any questions about this topic or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in the Charlotte area, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

        <description>

A lot of people ask me whether selling For Sale By Owner (or FSBO) is a good idea.

When you list FSBO, the people who come to your home wanting to negotiate a deal are generally unqualified. They’ll come to your door without an agent and without a pre-qualification letter. In fact, most FSBO buyers need owner financing. 

Most people who want to sell their home simply can’t do owner financing, since they typically want to buy another home with what they earn from their listing. 

As you might expect, these kinds of buyers aren’t bringing great offers to the table. People who know that you’re listing FSBO will be well aware of the fact that you aren’t being represented. Therefore, you can be sure they’re going to try to take advantage of this fact by giving you a lowball offer.

Recently, the National Association of Realtors did up the percentage of successful FSBO listings from 2% or 3% to 5% or 6% depending on the part of the country. Still, this leaves FSBO sellers with just a 6% chance at best to sell their homes on their own.

“Don’t get caught without representation.”

On top of that, those 6% of successful closings really aren’t that successful at all, since the final sale price is almost always far below the home’s true value.

People sometimes falsely assume that they’re saving money by not working with a Realtor, but the truth is that FSBO sellers ultimately walk away with much less money. You really need to be careful trying to list on your own. 

Last year, my team and I encountered a FSBO seller who only wanted $525,000 for a property. We were of course able to find a client willing to give that amount, but the home actually appraised for $615,000. 

The seller was ecstatic at closing, since they believed they had gotten a great deal. From the perspective of our team, though, we saw that they actually still left a lot of money on the table. This could’ve been prevented with the help of a qualified agent.

Don’t get caught without representation. The chances of success aren’t good, and people who are successful in listing FSBO still end up receiving 5%, 10%, or 15% less for their homes. 

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

There is a common misconception that you need a down payment of 10%, 15%, or 20% in order to purchase a home. However, there are actually a few options out there that allow buyers to put zero down on their home purchase. 

The first option pertains specifically to people who are serving, or have previously served, in the military. As a way to thank our veterans and active duty military members for their service, the VA loan allows them to purchase a home for no money down and with a very low interest rate.

For those who aren’t in the military, there are still options.

The USDA loan, for example, is a great route for anyone considering living in a rural area. There are a few different applicable areas around the outskirts of Charlottesville, Belmont, Mount Holly, Troutman, and certain other places all qualify. 

This loan is a great option, since it has low interest rates, no down payment, and requires no PMI—which is mortgage insurance. 

If neither of these programs is applicable to you, there are still options. 

“There are a few options out there that allow buyers to put zero money down for their home purchase.”

Certain programs exist that allow you to pay as low as 1% down. A couple of our in-house lenders actually allow buyers to qualify for a conventional loan with just a 1% down payment. To qualify for this, you do need a credit score above 640 to 660 depending on your job and assets. 

Finally, grant programs through the state can also provide down payment assistance. The North Carolina Grant Program is still offering $15,000 for first-time homebuyers. This is a great program. If you are a new buyer or haven’t bought a home in a few years, we’d love to help you look into this product.

These days, making sure that you have the best financing options is incredibly important and could save you hundreds on a monthly basis. When you work with us, we do our best to make sure you get the best rates, terms, and conditions. 

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

What is the key to getting multiple offers on your property?

Many people assume they have to price their home $20,000 or $30,000 below market value, but that’s not true. What you do have to know, though, is how your home will fit into today’s market. To find this out, you have to do a full equity valuation on your property and a market absorption analysis to calculate its true market value. 

The average person in our area does a CMA, or comparative market analysis, to calculate a home’s market value. This is an old-fashioned, real-estate-101 process that typically uses as little as three sold properties to come up with a number your home might be worth. 

“If you allow a CMA to determine the market value for your home, you’re in trouble.”

CMAs offer a little value, but when it comes to knowing the market, the problem with a CMA is you don’t know what happened with those three sold properties. Were they relocation homes? Was one of the properties a distressed home? Was there a divorce involved somewhere? 

If you allow a CMA to determine the market value for your home, you’re in trouble. You might get multiple offers, but they’ll likely be for $20,000 or $30,000 less than what your home’s actually worth and you’ll end up leaving money on the table. 

On the flipside, you can’t price your home extremely high, either. Regardless of the quality of your home’s marketing, overpricing it will turn off a large segment of buyers and force you to eventually reduce its price. Doing that will also cause buyers to wonder what might be wrong with your home. By the time you do finally reduce your home’s price to where it should’ve been in the first place, you’ll earn 5% to 10% less because buyers will deduct you for the number of days the home spent on the market. 

To generate multiple offers the right way, I recommend hiring a professional team of agents like us to help you. We can come into your home, give it a full equity evaluation, and price it appropriately. From there, we’ll use aggressive marketing to attract a lot of offers from qualified buyers within a handful of days your home gets listed. 

If you have any questions about getting multiple offers on your property, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to seeing you at the closing table.

        <description>

A lot of people are asking if we’re in a bubble. To figure that out, the first place we should look is at the numbers themselves.

A lot of people have been asking if right now is a good time to buy or sell. But, another broader question I’m hearing a lot is, “Are we in a bubble?”

To figure that out, I think it’s important to look at the numbers. Over the last three years, **the market has seen consistent growth and the interest rates have generally stayed low. **

We can see from this that there isn’t a very high likelihood that the Feds will be raising interest rates in a significant way. In fact, some people are saying interest rates could even drop.

The lower interest rates are, the more people can afford. This is especially important since the somewhat drastic increases we’ve seen in prices over the last two to three years. Right now in our area, we’re starting to see prices similar to those we saw in 2006, 2007, and 2008.

Though interest rates typically rise along with price, this isn’t a trend we’re currently seeing. We can expect prices to continue to rise.

**We’re also seeing homes spending fewer days on market, as well as lower inventory overall. **

“IF YOU’RE THINKING OF BUYING, NOW IS STILL A GOOD TIME.”

However, if you’re thinking of buying, now is still a good time.

If you’re considering selling, the most important thing is to pay attention to supply and demand within the market.

Overall, I’d have to say that most people would not agree that we’re in a bubble.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

When you are looking for an agent to help with your real estate transaction, how can you know if they will do a good job?

With the recent influx of agents into our area’s market, a lot of people have come to me asking, “How do I find the right agent?”

The answer depends on what kind of real estate transaction you’re about to undertake. If you are in the market to purchase a home you should be looking for a lender.

But don’t settle for your first encounter, be sure to shop around to get the best rates and the best terms and conditions on your mortgage. You should also get a buyer’s roadmap. A buyer’s roadmap will show you how we get priority access to all the best deals on the market.

This will help you win out against the competition. Having the roadmap will be your guide to success as a buyer, but you’ll still need a quality agent. When looking for the right agent, be sure to ask how many homes they sell per year, how well they know the area, and how well they know financing.

Sellers will need a game plan, as well. Having a selling guide and using high-quality marketing will be key. **My team and I offer a 151-step marketing guide that can help you have as smooth and successful a transaction as possible. **

“VERY FEW OTHER AGENTS, OR TEAMS OF AGENTS, CAN DO WHAT WE CAN.”

Full-disclosure, full-detail marketing strategies are also something we do. From 3D tours to aerial drone shots and more, we have all the resources to help our sellers make their listing as attractive as possible. We also offer a 75-point photography checklist designed to ensure that your home is being presented in the best light.

Very few other agents, or teams of agents, can do what we can—let alone at such a high level.

To find out if an agent will be able to get you top dollar, there are a few questions you should ask as a seller. How many homes have they sold this year? Do they have a resume?

With as many agents as are coming in our area, we’re seeing a few of them underpricing homes and therefore only selling between two to four properties a year. Selling quickly isn’t worth it if an agent is undercutting their client’s profit by thousands.

One of the things that sets my team apart is that we only accept full price offers for our clients. You need an agent who has a game plan for getting you at or above list price.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

If you want to sell your home that’s currently being rented, should you try to sell it through the leasing company? Here’s why I advise against it.

There are a few common questions I’ve received in recent weeks that I wanted to address for you.

Q: Is there any benefit to choosing a team of real estate agents versus a leasing company?

A: A client had a home rented and was looking to sell it. The people leasing the home really wanted to list the house. I told them that the problem was that they wanted to list the house—not try to find a buyer and sell it in a reasonable amount of time for top dollar.

“DON’T ASK SOMEONE TO SELL YOUR HOME UNLESS THEY SELL HOMES REGULARLY AT A HIGH LEVEL.”

Someone once told me that when you ask someone to do something they don’t normally do at a very high level, you probably won’t get the best results. Just like you wouldn’t call your kids’ orthodontist for a root canal, you shouldn’t call your leasing company to sell your house.

If you have a home that’s rented that you’re looking to sell, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help!

Whatever you do, don’t start the new home building process without an agent’s help. You could be setting yourself up for failure without even trying.

We’ve been noticing that a lot of our clients over the years have misconceptions about how buying new construction homes work. We wanted to go through the process and clarify any questions you may have today.

If you’re considering building a new home, it’s always best to go into the process with an agent who has experience working with and negotiating these kinds of deals. You might think that you could save some money as a buyer by not using an agent, but you would be completely wrong.

If a builder knows you don’t have representation, they are going to run you over and you will end up overpaying for a property. Until you have an agent who knows what they’re doing when it comes to negotiating with these builders, you won’t have as successful of a home purchase as you could have had.

“AN AGENT CAN HELP YOU GET A LOWER INTEREST RATE AND BETTER UPGRADES.”

By working with an agent, you can get a lower interest rate, better upgrades, and other discounts that you wouldn’t be able to get on your own. The expertise of an agent really pays off in situations like this. If you’re working with one of our buyer’s agents here at the Dan Jones Team, let them know if you’re interested in this kind of property.

Speaking of our great agents, let me give a shout out to one of our new agents, Karen, who has been doing fantastic as of late putting homes under contract and is working with several new construction buyers right now.

In the meantime, if you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

It’s not summer yet, but the Charlotte real estate market is the hottest market we have ever seen. I’ll go over more details for you today.

If you are thinking about selling a home in the next three to six months, you should know that **the real estate market is on fire right now. **

This is the hottest market that we’ve seen. Homes are selling after 30 to 40 days on the market; some homes are selling in 60 to 70 days. This is a much faster pace than the usual 130 to 140 days.

“ON AVERAGE, HOMES ARE SELLING IN 30 TO 40 DAYS.”

If you are thinking of buying or selling a home, we would love to show you what we do differently to help you reach your real estate goals. We can sell houses in half of the average days on market; in other words, **we can sell your home in 15 to 20 days. **

One marketing tool we like to implement is our “Full Price Offers Only” sign that we put on each of our listings.

For buyers, interest rates are still incredibly low, but they are starting to creep up a bit. Now is a great time to jump into the market while rates are still low.

If you have any questions about navigating our current market, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

If you’re thinking about selling your house this year, you need to reach out to us. Allow me to explain why.

If you’re thinking about selling your house this year, you need to reach out to our company.

We do a lot of things to sell your house quickly and for top dollar, including our VIP Seller Program. This is a ‘coming soon’ type of program that markets your home to thousands of people before it even hits the market. Our average days on market has been cut in half simply because of this program.

It could be the difference in you needing to make an extra mortgage payment or two on your home while you sell, and that’s huge.

We also offer a 151-step marketing tool, which we’ll happily send you. Whether you’ve sold a home recently or not, you’d be surprised at all the things we do to sell your house for top dollar every time.

We’d also be happy to send you our 2016 resume. **We sold more than 200 homes last year, and we’re well on our way to 250 to 300 sales this year. **

“WE SOLD MORE THAN 200 HOMES IN 2016 AND WE’RE WELL ON OUR WAY TO 250 THIS YEAR.”

When you sell your house, most agents will come out for a comparative market analysis (CMA) based on square footage, but it’s impossible to know the exact condition that every single home sold under. It could have been the result of a divorce, an estate sale, or a short sale, to name a few.

We do a full equity evaluation based on a market absorption sheet. We’ll look at everything that’s happened in the last 12 to 24 months to figure out where we need to be and what we need to do to sell your house for top dollar.

If you’re thinking about selling, it’s a must. Just give us a call or send us an email if you’re thinking about selling, we’d love to help.

If you’re thinking about selling your home this spring, there are some great affordable ways you can prepare to ensure you get top dollar.

“DOING THE BASICS IS GOING TO GET YOU THE BIGGEST RETURN.”


  
    Declutter. Box up all of the items you don’t need and put them in a storage unit. Decluttering ensures your home feels cozy, and buyers are more likely to see the value in a decluttered home.
  
  
    Repaint the doors. Adding a fresh coat of paint to the doors will make them feel and look new. Buyers will take notice and really appreciate that detail.
  
  
    Repaint the trim. You don’t need to paint every bit of trim in the house, but make sure you hit the main walking areas, bathrooms, hallways, and the kitchen.
  
  
    Spruce up the landscaping. Get some mulch and freshen things up. Also, make sure two days before you get pictures taken you mow the grass and clear the driveway off.
Assuming there are no major issues with your carpet or flooring, hitting the basics is going to get you the biggest return. By doing so, your home will be 75% more likely to sell than other homes. Just remember not to over improve your home by taking on huge projects like the ones on HGTV. Those projects won’t always get you the best return.
  


If you have any other questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!

        <description>

Our market moves fast, especially for buyers. You can gain an advantage on your competition by hiring the right people to help you.

What makes our buyer specialists different from the rest? There are a lot of things, actually. If you’ve spoken to one of them already, you have an idea of what we’re all about. However, there are a lot of specific advantages to using our services over other firms out there.

There are so many real estate agents out there, but not many of them specialize in getting their clients priority access to all the best deals on the market. If you’ve been looking for a home lately, you already know how fast the market moves. That’s why we prioritize getting our clients a backstage pass to the MLS so they are aware of homes that match their criteria as soon as they hit the market, sometimes even before.

“WE GIVE OUR CLIENTS A BACKSTAGE PASS TO THE MLS.”

Another unique advantage our team offers is that we are coached at a very high level. This means we are more in-tune with the market, have better negotiating skills, and know how to handle stressful situations better than most agents.

The average agent sells five homes per year and doesn’t know how to get their buyers the best deal possible. With our unique training and experience, we do. If you have any questions for us or would like to work with one of our expert buyer specialists, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

The Charlotte market is on fire right now! I’ll go over what’s making our real estate market so hot today.

The Charlotte real estate market is on fire right now, so I wanted to give you a rundown on what’s happening.

Many people thought home prices would come down as interest rates increased, but that hasn’t been the case so far. However, **price per square foot is expected to decrease as interest rates continue to rise in 2017. **

So, if you’re thinking about selling your home or investment property this year, now is the time. In fact, some people are saying that this year will be the best year ever to sell an investment property.

“2017 COULD BE THE BEST YEAR EVER TO SELL INVESTMENT PROPERTY.”

If you’re looking to make a move, whether you are downsizing or upgrading to a larger home, right now is the best time to take advantage of a low interest rate and secure the most profit from your current home sale.

All in all, right now is a great time to buy or sell real estate. Also, if you have been thinking about buying new construction, I know **a lot of builders have been accepting contingency offers, so make sure you keep that in mind. **

If you have any further questions or want to discuss how you can take advantage of Charlotte’s hot market, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!

        <description>

North Carolina recently brought back its $15,000 grant program. This is a great program for first-time home buyers. I’ll go over a few important details for you today.

Today I have some great news for North Carolina home buyers: the $15,000 grant program is back!

If you’re a first-time home buyer or if you haven’t owned a home in the last three years, you may be eligible for this program.

Basically, the state will give you $15,000 towards down payment assistance, closing costs, and/or buying the loan amount down.

There are a few requirements that you have to meet in order to qualify for this program.

First of all, you cannot make over a certain amount of money. Check in with your lender for the details. Secondly, you have to buy a home in the $240,000 to $245,000 price range.

“THE STATE WILL GIVE YOU $15,000 TOWARDS DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE.”

This is a great program for first-time home buyers. I certainly wish it was around back when I bought my home!

If you are working with one of our agents already, they know tons about this program. Make sure you ask them about it.

If you’re not a first-time home buyer but you know someone who is, make sure that they are looking in Mecklenburg or Cabarrus County in order to qualify for this program.

Last October, 3,000 grants were issued to home buyers. There are not many left today. Get in touch with us to take advantage of this great loan program. We would be happy to help you!

There are a lot of serious buyers out in the market right now. Here’s why listing now will help you capture this segment of buyers.

There are some great benefits to be had by getting your home on the market during this time of year. A lot of people tell us they are waiting until next month to get their home on the market, but we have been advising them to move up their timeline. Why?

Well, if you look at the numbers and how many homes are on the market versus what actually sells and closes, the percentage is ridiculously high. In February and March, the same number of buyers are out there, but inventory doubles or triples.

“YOU MIGHT NOT GET AS MANY SHOWINGS, BUT YOU WILL MOSTLY DEAL WITH SERIOUS BUYERS.”

Right now, the only buyers out there are serious ones. This is because they may have had a shift in income or a job change. Whatever their reason, they need to close on a home quickly. You might not get as many showings right now as you would during the rest of the year, but the people looking will always be serious buyers.

If you’ve been thinking about selling, get a time set up with one of our listing specialists to get a full equity evaluation on your property to see what’s going on in the market in your area and what your competition is trying to sell for. Then we can determine whether it makes sense for you to sell your home now or if you should wait.

As always, if you have any questions, we would be glad to answer them. Just give us a call or send us an email. We can’t wait to hear from you!

        <title>What Makes Zestimates Inaccurate?</title>

        <description>

I’ve gotten a lot of questions recently about Zestimates, and I’m going to address them today. A Zestimate is just what its name implies - an estimate of your home’s value. An estimate is a reasonable approach to value in regard to real estate, but an estimate is, by definition, inexact. Enjoy using a Zestimate as a tool, but don’t be surprised by the inaccurate information that you receive from it.

Why are Zillow’s Zestimates so inaccurate? There are a few reasons. First off, Zillow doesn’t look at supply and demand. They look at recent comps, but not recent appraisals. They also pull from tax records, which can be extremely inaccurate as well. If you use that data, you could be misrepresenting your home’s value by as much as $60,000 or $70,000. Tax records aren’t a good tool for estimating a home’s value.

“Your home could be worth $60,000 or $70,000 more than you think.”

Another thing Zillow’s Zestimate doesn’t take into account is location. Your home may have five or six different good comparables, but Zillow won’t be able to determine whether you live in a location that would boost your home’s value. If you live on a golf course, cul-de-sac, or a wooded lot, Zillow would not factor that in.

Finally, Zestimates don’t take upgrades and updates into account. Your home’s value will be determined in the same way whether you have a fully remodeled kitchen, bathroom, or basement. Assigning a list price to your home based on a Zestimate could be hugely detrimental to your sale.

I have a rental property that Zillow recently told me is worth $80,000 more than it really is. If anyone out there would like to buy the home for the Zestimate price, let me know and we’ll get a contract written up. Otherwise, if you have any other questions or want to know what the true market value of your home is, give us a call. We would be happy to do an equity evaluation for you and give you a professional opinion on how much your home should sell for.

        <description>

There are several hidden costs of selling a house people usually don’t find out about until they get to the closing table. What I want to talk about today are some of those major expenses.

First of all, if you haven’t lived in your house for very long, there is a good chance you’re going to be paying a capital gains tax. It’s a good idea to speak with your accountant to confer over this.

Next are the seller closing costs. A lot of agents like to beat around the bush about who pays what, but it’s important to know this up front when you’re deciding who you’re going to sell your home to and at what price. Closing costs consist of attorney’s fees and deed stamps.

“It’s important to know your closing costs up front.”

Repairs to the house is another cost to consider. They might be simple, or they might be complicated, but almost all homes end up having repairs. Just getting an electrician through the door can cost as much as $150. A lot of buyers also like to ask for a home warranty. We don’t encourage our sellers to buy those up front because we’d rather wait for the buyer to negotiate that in and move up the asking price of the home.

Finally, you have costs like additional repairs or attorney’s fees. If there are any title issues, we strongly suggest that you clear them up beforehand.

Be sure you’re aware of these omissions when it’s your time to sell so you’re prepared for the process. If you have any questions, please send me an email or give me a call. As always, I look forward to your referrals and talking to you soon.

        <description>

Homeowners can lose thousands of dollars when they sell their house for a number of reasons. How is it possible to lose money when selling, you ask?

In Carolina, we’re probably in one of the best seller’s markets we’ve seen in a decade. We have great comps to get homes sold, but when people are valuing their home, they aren’t doing a full equity evaluation and really understanding what the market can absorb. Many people are simply getting a comparative market analysis (or CMA) and underpricing the home, only to see it sell in a few days for up to 6% less than they should have.

If your home is worth around $300,000 or more, that’s a lot of money to leave on the table.

“Pricing a home too high or too low will cost you in the long run.”

Secondly, overpricing is a way people are throwing away money. I have people tell me they want to start their home priced $30,000 above what it should be. The downside is that the home’s going to sit on the market for a long time, and even if you find a buyer, the home probably won’t appraise for that price. If a home sits on the market, you’ll have to lower the price. By the time the price comes down to where it should be, buyers will think there is something wrong with the house and they won’t even come view it.

What you end up with is a house that sat on the market for around 200 days that ends up selling for up to 15% less than it should have if it was priced appropriately.

Finally, choosing the wrong agent can cause you to lose tens of thousands of dollars. You want to make sure the agent you hire has a full marketing budget to get your house proper exposure. There are a lot of new agents out there who just don’t know the market. If you’re not selling a lot of homes, they may end up underpricing and losing you money.

Let me know of any questions you have about pricing your home, or if you’re considering buying or selling a home. I look forward to speaking with you!

Now is a great time to sell your house. In the last three to six months, we’ve had a lot of problems getting homes appraised because the market jumped up so quickly. However, now there are plenty of comparable sales to support those increases, and the market is on fire.

Why is the market so hot? The main reason is we have very low supply and very high demand right now. We are shifting into a seller’s market as there are not a lot of homes to choose from. Properties that are prepared properly and positioned well in the market sell pretty quickly and for top dollar.

Secondly, interest rates are very low. Two or three years ago, many people suspected we would see 5.5% interest rates in 2016, but rates have held consistently over the last year or so. In fact, rates have actually come down a little bit. These low rates mean it is still very affordable for you to buy a slightly bigger home or even build a house.

“Do not underprice your home in this hot market.”

If you are thinking of selling in this market, I have one warning: Do not underprice your home. Since the real estate market is picking up, there are a lot of newer agents getting their licenses and diving into the market. These agents don’t necessarily know how to price your property for this market. You could lose 5% to 10% of your true home value when you underprice your property.

If you are thinking about selling, give us a call or send us an email. We will do a full equity evaluation of your property so you don’t leave a lot of money on the table. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

There are unfortunately a lot of mistakes that buyers can make in the Charlotte market. Most of the time, it comes down to choosing the wrong agent.

Our team of agents here at Carolina Real Estate Experts have professional coaching and they’re full-time agents who really know and understand today’s market. There are too many agents out there who went out and got a real estate license a few years ago when the market got hot, and don’t truly understand what the market was and where it is today. They really don’t care about you getting the best price, terms, and conditions, because they’re really just interested in getting a check at the end of the day.

It’s very important to us at Carolina Real Estate Experts that you get the best price, terms, and conditions on your property and that we do a great job for you from start to finish.

“Ask good questions when hiring an agent.”

Make sure that if you’re going to work with someone, you don’t make the mistake of working with an agent who has a license but doesn’t have proper training yet. Be careful about asking good questions, because seeing two or three properties with an agent doesn’t exactly mean you’re “working with an agent.” Interview a few agents to make sure they’ll get you the best conditions.

If you or your friends, family or co-workers have questions or real estate needs, reach out to us. I’d love to speak with you and help you with your real estate needs.

Purchasing a home is not as easy as people think. Most of the time, a buyer will go look at homes and actually purchase a home through the first agent they speak to. That’s probably the worst way to go about purchasing a home.

You really need to talk to an agent and figure out what they do. Do they work with a team? What kind of support staff do they have? You need the answers to these questions so you hire an agent who will make sure you get the best price, terms, and conditions when it comes to negotiating and understanding the market.

The last thing you want to do is walk into a transaction with someone who just got their license or only sells two homes a year. That agent really just doesn’t know what’s going on with the market. They won’t know what it will be like for you to sell that property again in the next five to 20 years.

“Interview more than one real estate agent.”

Think twice about what agent you’re using. Interview more than one agent. Make sure you work with someone who really knows the market. You need someone from the area, who sells 30 homes a year, and works on a team of agents that can get you the best price, terms, and conditions.

My team and I can get you to the closing process with the least amount of trouble. We can make this a very easy experience for you. If you have any questions, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
