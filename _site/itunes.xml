While the rest of the country is still dealing with the tail end of
winter, right now in Arizona we’re in our prime home selling season.
Here in Tucson in particular, February through June are our strongest
months. If you’re a seller, how can you maximize your sale price while
minimizing your costs? 

Let’s start with maximizing your sale price. Your home must give a
strong first impression, and that first impression starts outside on
the street where people pull up in their cars. The front yard
landscaping, the front entry, and your home’s exterior painting all
contribute significantly to your home’s curb appeal. 

Once you get inside the house, the carpeting, flooring, and windows all
need to be clean. Layer on a fresh coat of paint if possible. Making
these areas look spotless might seem like a nuisance, but doing it will
help your house sell quicker. The earlier a house sells in its listing
period, the higher the price it generally sells for. 

What about minimizing your costs? Not many sellers do this, but we
recommend getting your home inspected. Have a home inspector go
through your home with a fine-toothed comb so you can repair any items
with a vendor of your choice. You lose a lot of cost control if you let
the buyer do their own inspection after you’re under contract and select
which vendors to use.

Whether you’re a buyer or a seller looking to make a move in our market,
please give us a call so we can help you out. We look forward to hearing
from you!

Today I’m discussing the post-election market in Tucson and what things look like going forward for buyers and sellers. As many of you are aware, interest rates were slightly over 3% in the last quarter of 2016. Since then, they have shot up to as high as 4.5%. That swing is certainly affecting buyers because it’s making homes more expensive and forcing buyers to come down from their previous purchase prices a little bit.

There are a few factors that you need to consider if you’re buying or selling in Tucson. One of these is the abundance of new construction in town. We’ve had virtually no new construction here since 2007, so there’s pent-up demand for new homes.

If you’re a seller, you need to be cognizant of new construction in your area because of how it could affect your home sale. If you’re selling under $300,000 however, you shouldn’t have to worry about it too much. Home sales are up 12% over a year ago and inventory is down 28%. This puts you in a strong seller’s market. Homes in this range are selling quickly and very close to, if not over, list price. Some homes are even getting multiple offers.

If you’re buying in this market, you need to be prepared to move and move quickly on a desirable property. However, it might take losing a few properties to get the right one, so be cognizant of that as well.

If you have any questions for me or if you’re thinking about buying or selling in Tucson, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

I’d like to take this chance to reach out to potential investors and renters to talk a bit about the Tucson market and how it may affect you.

First, let me point out that rental rates are rising two to three times faster than the appreciation of new homes. If you’re a renter, you already know this, because you’re probably seeing your rent go up.

Here in Tucson, our average sale price for a home is $217,000, which is pretty competitive as far as the country goes. If you pay $1,300 to $1,400 a month in rent, you can actually buy an average-priced home in the Tucson market for the same amount. Interest rates are still very low, but they will start to inch up as the economy improves.

If you’re a renter getting pushed around with rent and you’re thinking about buying a home, talk to a lender and seriously take a look at what you could buy for the same amount of money you pay every month in rent. Then, you could have the additional tax write-offs at the end of the year that you don’t get as a renter.

As for investors, now is a good time to start looking at properties. Prices are going up and inventory is going down, so it’s getting a little more complicated. The point is that the return on investment today in the Tucson market for investors buying a rental property is probably higher than it’s been in the last couple decades.

If you’re a renter or an investor looking to buy a property, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I’d be glad to help you in any way that I can.

Now that 2017 is underway, I wanted to bring you a quick update on the Tucson real estate market.

As it turned out, 2016 was actually a great rebuilding year. Our average list price is up about 4% and our average unit sales are up about 3% from last year. Things are looking pretty positive, and we are still in a recovering economy, which means the market is recovering as well.

On the other hand, we have seen a large decrease in inventory. The active listings in the MLS are down to about 4,000, which is a 20% decrease from last year. As supply goes down, prices go up, which means we should see continued upward movement in prices in 2017. This is great news for sellers, but buyers need to be prepared to move fairly quickly to purchase a property.

Last year, our average days on market was 60, and today it’s 47. Homes that are in the right areas and priced right are selling very quickly. In fact, 68% of our sales happen in the first 60 days. If you are looking to buy, make sure you have met with your lender and are ready to jump on a property.

2017 is going to be a great year for real estate based on a few things that are happening here in Tucson. Raytheon, one of our largest employers, just got a $2 billion government contract and will be hiring somewhere close to 2,000 people over the next couple of years. Caterpillar, from Peoria, Illinois, is moving some of their management level people here. The University of Arizona will be opening a graduate veterinary school in Oro Valley which will bring in 500 students initially, then grow to 800. Roche Medical is also continuing to expand. All of these factors will be great for our market growth.

If you are looking to buy or sell a home or if you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!

Today I want to talk to renters who are considering buying a home. In the past four years, rental rates have gone up at a dramatically higher rate than home values. Rental rates are skyrocketing right now, so we are going to talk you through a few statistics when it comes to renting vs. buying.

The median sale price last month in Tucson was $173,000. If you were to buy that house with 10% down, your monthly payment would be right around $900. If you were to rent that same house today, your payment would be around $1,360 per month.

As you can see, you are paying a premium for renting. I strongly suggest that renters reach out to a real estate professional or a lending professional and have them explain the details to you. I’m sure you will find that buying is in your best interest.

I suggest you talk to someone soon. Interest rates are still at record lows but housing prices are starting to inch back up as the market recovers. It’s a great time to take a serious look at becoming a homeowner, no matter what your situation.

If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

When you make an offer on a home in Arizona, you will present a home seller with our residential purchase contract. The primary point to that offer is what you are physically offering – the financial side of things.

This includes your down payment, your earnest money, and your pre-approval if you’re buying with financing. We put all of this together and submit an offer so it’s taken seriously. The purchase contract contains three contingencies, which are in there to protect you as a buyer.

The first contingency is the inspection period, which gives you 10 days to order and complete any inspections on the home that you choose. We then send the inspection report to the seller with a list of items that we want them to repair. If they don’t respond in the way you want or you can’t come to an agreement, you are then free to cancel the contract. At the same time, we use a title company to make sure the home will be easily transferable if you choose to proceed.

If you and the seller come to an agreement on the repairs, it’s time to move on to the next contingency – the appraisal contingency. Your lender is going to order the appraisal for an appraiser to come up and inspect the property and confirm the property is worth what the offer is. This ensures you don’t overpay.

The final contingency is the loan contingency. Through the entire process, the lender is going to give the seller updates on how the loan is proceeding. If something were to happen in the middle of the transaction that resulted in you not being able to afford the home, you won’t be forced to buy the property.

If you manage the transaction properly, your earnest money is never at risk. We have never lost a penny of clients’ earnest money in 16 years and we don’t plan on starting now.

If you have any questions for us or would like to take a look at a copy of our purchase contract, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

I wanted to revisit the topic of mortgages so that buyers have an idea of what to expect in today’s market.

The Dodd-Frank Act brought a lot of changes to the mortgage industry in the last couple of years, and most of them were implemented this year. This affects you, the consumer, in terms of the time it takes to close a home loan. Before the act, a mortgage usually took about 20 to 30 days to close, whereas today, it’s closer to 30 to 45 days. Some of the government-backed loans like VA loans or FHA loans are stretching out even longer.

If you’re a buyer, you’ll want to get your lending issues resolved as early in the process as you can so your lender can move quickly once you go under contract. On the seller side, you can also expect delays. Typically, agents write contracts with a 30- to-45 day closing, and if the lender runs into any difficulties getting it approved, we end up having to push them out a bit.

Make sure you coordinate with your agent so that neither of you encounters any surprises like having to move out of the house earlier or later than you originally thought.

Another issue in the mortgage world that’s affecting both buyers and sellers is appraisals. With new government regulations, lenders don’t reach out directly to appraisers anymore; instead, they go through a central clearing house so that the lender can’t affect the results of the appraisal.

Appraisers are backed up as well. Normally, they have a 10-day window from the time they’re ordered to respond back with the appraisal. With the volume of activity we’re having right now, the appraisers are also backlogged. That 10-day period is now closer to a 12- to 15-day norm.

If you’re thinking about buying or selling a home or you have any questions about mortgages and how they’ve changed, give us a call. We’d be happy to help you in any way we can.

As everyone knows, the economy is recovering and people feel more optimistic. Interest rates have also been historically low lately. As a result, the nationwide real estate market has been very strong for the last couple of years. The same is true for the current Tucson real estate market.

Right now, housing inventory in Tucson is dropping. That means buyers have fewer options to choose from and need to be a little better prepared. You need to be able to move fast on a property because as inventory continues to drop, you will face more competition for that same property. In fact, multiple offer situations are happening right now. Buyers who are able to put in a strong offer will prevail and win those properties.

If you are a seller, falling inventory is good news. As inventory goes down, home prices go up. Prices are currently on the rise in Tucson and have been for the last couple of years. Sales are also up by 14% year to date, further depleting our existing housing inventory.

What does this mean for you? If you are buying a home, you need to get everything squared away with your lender so that you are ready to make an offer on a property right away. Homes are spending fewer days on market, so not only will you face more competition in today’s market, you also have less time to make a decision on a property.

If you are a seller, now is a good time to talk to a real estate professional and figure out what your home is worth in the current market.

As everyone knows, the economy is recovering and people feel more optimistic. Interest rates have also been historically low lately. As a result, the nationwide real estate market has been very strong for the last couple of years. The same is true for the current Tucson real estate market.

Right now, housing inventory in Tucson is dropping. That means buyers have fewer options to choose from and need to be a little better prepared. You need to be able to move fast on a property because as inventory continues to drop, you will face more competition for that same property. In fact, multiple offer situations are happening right now. Buyers who are able to put in a strong offer will prevail and win those properties.

If you are a seller, falling inventory is good news. As inventory goes down, home prices go up. Prices are currently on the rise in Tucson and have been for the last couple of years. Sales are also up by 14% year to date, further depleting our existing housing inventory.

What does this mean for you? If you are buying a home, you need to get everything squared away with your lender so that you are ready to make an offer on a property right away. Homes are spending fewer days on market, so not only will you face more competition in today’s market, you also have less time to make a decision on a property.

If you are a seller, now is a good time to talk to a real estate professional and figure out what your home is worth in the current market.

If you have any other questions about today’s market, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

If you aren’t from Southern Arizona, you are probably in for a bit of a surprise. Our listings here have heating and cooling, just like any other home in the country. However, some properties have evaporative cooling in addition to regular air conditioning.

What is evaporative cooling? Evaporative cooling dumps a high volume of moist air into the house. Since our area has low relative humidity, the moist air evaporates and cools the home. You don’t see this in other parts of the country because our area is so dry.

Evaporative cooling can save you a lot of money on utilities. In fact, you can run an evaporative cooling unit at 25% of the cost of a standard AC unit. The downside is that once monsoon season starts in July, our humidity goes up and evaporative cooling doesn’t work as well.

However, you can still use evaporative cooling during the first half of the summer. When monsoon season hits, you can use your regular air conditioner.

If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

Last October, the Dodd-Frank ruling finally went into effect and changed a lot of rules for mortgage lending. It doubled, maybe tripled the workload of lenders behind-the-scenes, so lately we’ve run into frequent delayed and extended closings.

Today I just wanted to alert everyone to this problem and remind them that, when you write an offer in this market, it’s prudent to be pre-approved. You’ll want to get this up-front before you start looking so you can make an offer right away to get the process moving on quickly.

Write your closing date out into the future, around 35-45 days. With the recent changes, very few lenders have been able to do the standard 30-day close with these new rules and regulations.

If you have any questions for me, please reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to hear from you.

        <title>Why You Should Have an Agent With You Viewing New Construction</title>

It’s been pretty quiet lately in Arizona regarding new construction. A lot of developers are starting to develop subdivisions and large tracts of properties in Tucson. I‘d like to take the opportunity to reach out to buyers and let you know that it doesn’t cost you anything to be represented in a new construction site. If you bring an agent along with you, that agent can represent you and your interests throughout the transaction at no cost to you.

It may not be obvious to everybody, but the person behind the counter you meet when you walk into the sales office is working for the builder and the developer. They’re not working for you. If you want somebody to look after your interests, you should recruit your real estate agent to go in with you and get you registered on your first visit so they can represent you through the whole ordeal. The new construction contract is also quite a bit different than the standard residential resale contract, so you’d be well-advised to have your agent review it and talk you through the nuances.

If you have any more questions, send me an email or give me a call. Make it a great day.

The crooks on the Internet are getting creative. They’ve figured out a way to intercept the wiring of funds to and from escrow companies. In fact, they know how to scan for keywords in emails about wiring situations within real estate transactions.

Maybe you’re a buyer that needs to wire a down payment or other money in a transaction. You could also be a seller and might receive wired money back from the title company soon. Either way, you need to be careful. The wiring instructions you’re receiving should come from the proper entity. Crooks sometimes pose as the title or escrow company to trick you and steal from you.

Consider this an alert! In my next video, I’ll talk about this topic further with an expert from a title company. If you’re a buyer or seller in this situation, please use caution!

If you’re thinking about buying or selling a Tucson home, contact me by phone or email. I’d be happy to help you and answer any questions you might have!

It’s June now, and things are starting to warm up in Tucson. As our temperature goes up, the number of visitors goes down. Tourism doesn’t stop, but it slows down a bit. We go from 100% to about 80% to 85%. It’s still possible to sell in this market, but only if you approach it the right way. That means avoiding overpricing.

First of all, buyers who are shopping are studying all the inventory on the market, and if you overprice, they’ll know you’re overpriced. This will cause them to skip over your home and not even look at it until you make price reductions to bring it down to market value.

Secondly, by overpricing, you are going to make your competition look more attractive. Buyers will perceive the competition as a better value, and they will be more interested in those homes. As always, it’s important to price your home right at market value and not a penny higher. You’re better off pricing it there and letting us do the negotiation for you.

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out by giving us a call or sending us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!

Our team here uses a professional photographer for our marketing, and there are key reasons why it’s important in today’s modern market. Consumers probably look at thousands of photos when home shopping, so what will make your listing stand out? High quality photos!

Most buyers start their home search online, so that’s where you need to make that great first impression. Properties that have the best photos are the ones that they are going to see when they begin their search. Almost 92% of home showings actually begin online with a person in front of a computer screen, so photography cannot be underestimated.

You want to avoid any kind of dark, grainy, or low-resolution photos. When you put pictures like that up on a website or on the MLS, it isn’t very appealing to buyers, and you likely won’t capture many buyers.

The pictures of your home need to be in high definition and taken by a professional photographer. Wide-angle lenses help tell the story of a home by capturing the home from ceiling to floor.

If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!

The inventory of available homes in Tucson is shrinking, and this is also occurring on a national level. However, what are you to do if you’re trying to buy a home? That’s what we’ll be discussing today.

One simple thing you can do is speak with a mortgage lender and get pre-qualified for a home loan. When you’re crafting offers to sellers, you need to stand out, and being pre-qualified is one way to push your offer to the top of the pile. In fact, most sellers will not even entertain an offer from a buyer who has not been pre-qualified.

Why let someone purchase your home if you are unsure that they can afford it? That’s what sellers are thinking when you submit an offer without a pre-approval or a pre-qualification. This is why you absolutely have to be approved to buy a home.

You will also need to hire a Realtor in order to craft a more attractive offer to a seller. We can also help you find homes that you might not have found otherwise. We work with other Realtors who have pocket homes that are unavailable to most of the public.

We can help you find your dream home - and we can help you purchase it for a fair price. Please don’t hesitate to contact us!

Construction season has arrived in Tucson, and today I’ll be giving you tips to help you when you’re buying a newly-built home. The last few years have been a little slow, but the developers are coming back and we’re going to see a particularly strong year. New subdivisions are going up everywhere.

However - be warned - you might want to hire an agent to help you buy a new home. The agent at the home works exclusively for the seller, so they will not be attempting to help you buy the home. When you do hire a buyer’s agent, the builder will pay their commission, so there is no reason not to hire some help. If you don’t you have a very large chance of not getting the best deal possible.

Our team of agents has established relationships with builders and we can get you a great deal on a new home. Interest rates are low, so it’s a fantastic time to purchase a home. Please don’t hesitate to contact us!

Construction season has arrived in Tucson, and today I’ll be giving you tips to help you when you’re buying a newly-built home. The last few years have been a little slow, but the developers are coming back and we’re going to see a particularly strong year. New subdivisions are going up everywhere.

However - be warned - you might want to hire an agent to help you buy a new home. The agent at the home works exclusively for the seller, so they will not be attempting to help you buy the home. When you do hire a buyer’s agent, the builder will pay their commission, so there is no reason not to hire some help. If you don’t you have a very large chance of not getting the best deal possible.

Our team of agents has established relationships with builders and we can get you a great deal on a new home. Interest rates are low, so it’s a fantastic time to purchase a home. Please don’t hesitate to contact us!

We expect this to be a great year for home sellers in Tucson. Rising interest rates will push home buyers out onto the market, and you can capitalize on this if you are looking to sell in 2016. It could be a very profitable time to put your home on the market.

Keep in mind that the most important thing you do while selling your home is finding an accurate price for it. The best person to talk to about this is your local Realtor. My team will come out to your property and run a competitive market analysis. We research the market and comparable properties around your home in order to find a reasonable sale price.

Another option is to hire an appraiser to come take a look at your home. This will cost a bit more, but it’s a good way to get an independent estimate for the price of your home.

Something we like to do is analyze the three C’s of your home. This is the condition, the competition, and the consumption in your area. These statistics can tell us a lot about what buyers might be willing to pay for your home. Ultimately, it is the buyer that will determine the final sale price of your home.

If you have any questions, or would like to schedule a time for us to come and speak to you about your property, please don’t hesitate to contact me.

About 92% of showings begin on a computer screen. Buyers utilize the Internet to look for their dream home, and they’re likely to stumble upon your MLS listing before your physical address. It could even be on a smartphone. That’s why images are extremely important. They reveal your property, and you want to make sure they’re dazzling. We hire professional photographers to provide quality photos to accompany your listing.

Be sure to increase curb appeal. The first impression is everything for prospective buyers. If buyers don’t like your home from the outside, it’ll deter them from going inside. Clean up the front yard, front door, and the sidewalks. Bring in some bright colors and plant some fresh flowers in the garden.

The inside of your home matters, too. We bring in professional stagers to help our clients make their home shine. We focus on interior design, such as how furniture is arranged and repurposed. When you hire us, you’ll meet with our Interior Decorator; in fact, this consultation is included in our real estate seller program.

Ultimately, we want to do everything in our power to reach out to those 92% of buyers that will see your home for the first time online. That’s our strategy to get as many people through your front door as possible. If you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, reach out to us today. We’d be happy to hear from you and serve your local real estate needs!

When you rent a home, you’re essentially paying off your landlord’s mortgage. You could be taking that same monthly payment and instead, be using it towards a home of your own. Now is an opportune time to seriously consider making a move. Here’s why.

Rental rates are rising faster than single-family homes are appreciating. You’re in a situation where rent is increasing and will only continue to do so. You can dodge high payments by locking in a 30-year fixed mortgage.

Interest rates are at record lows. That’s why timing is so crucial. Don’t wait, because these rates are expected to increase. Don’t miss out on locking in a low rate.

Due to the economic crunch we experienced in the last decade, the lending industry tightened up standards. However, since our economy is quickly recovering, standards are becoming loose again. This is yet another advantage to acting now. You can get into a home with as little as 3% down!

Now is a great time if you’ve been seriously considering turning into a homeowner, renters! Reach out to a real estate professional today. If you’re thinking about buying, let’s talk through that idea. Give me a call or send me an email today!

        <title>Three Ways That Buyers Are Protected in Arizona</title>

Arizona contracts are very sensitive towards buyers because they have three contingencies that would allow them not to proceed with the contract. Today we’ll talk briefly about these contingencies.

The inspection contingency is important, and I would recommend an inspection every time that you buy or sell a home. In Arizona, sellers will provide you with a seller’s disclosure statement, but that is just the seller’s opinion of the home.

The appraisal contingency is another major one. This is not required if you’re paying cash, but the bank will always want to run an appraisal to ensure that they’re not lending you too much money. This is kind of a safety net to ensure that you don’t overpay for a home.

The loan contingency is important because it protects buyers in the case that they are not able to proceed with a loan. If a buyer loses a job, suffers from a medical attack, or any other cataclysmic event occurs, the buyer is protected.

These are three ways that buyers are protected when they purchase a home in Arizona. If you need to buy in 2016, please don’t hesitate to contact me. This is a great year to purchase because interest rates are only getting higher.

As some of you prepare to list your home in January, I wanted to reach out today and talk about the importance of pricing your home correctly. Many people think they can get a better price than the home that sold across the street.

If you price your home accurately, it will sell faster and for more money. According to the Tucson MLS, homes that sell without a price adjustment sell within 33 days on the market at 98% of list price. Homes with just one price adjustment are on the market for 110 days and sell for 96% of list price.

Clearly, the Tucson MLS data reveals overpricing your house in our market will cause you to be on the market for three times as long and get you 2% less money. Pricing your home correctly the first time is the best way to be successful when selling your home.

Before you list your property, consult with a professional. Hire someone who understands the market, your neighborhood, and will price your house properly. This is extremely important!

If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

The holiday season is finally here, and the weather here in Tucson has been wonderful. This is the time of year when a lot of people start wondering whether they should wait until the beginning of the year to list, or if they should put their home on the market now.

In the next week or two, we will be seeing a lot of visitors coming to our area for the holidays. Homes are going to sell in this time frame and if yours isn’t on the market, you won’t be able to capture those buyers.

Many people do wait until after the holidays to list their homes. January is the #1 month in Tucson for new listings on the market. It can be very easy for your home to get lost in the shuffle when there are over 1,000 homes coming on the market. Listing it now means your home will sell faster and stand out more to buyers.

The people that are out looking for a home to purchase during the holidays are usually highly motivated buyers, otherwise they wouldn’t be out looking until all the homes come on the market in January.

If you have any questions for us at all, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to speaking with you!

Today I wanted to update you on the luxury market here in Tucson. Any property that’s valued over about $900,000 will qualify as a luxury property. This is a smaller section of our market, but I hope this information is still valuable to you.


  Currently, the active listings are down by 19% since the beginning of the year
  Our supply has been reduced to 13 months of inventory (down from 20 months at the beginning of 2015)


What does this mean for you? Well, the market is heating up and inventory is relatively low, so now is a good time to get your home on the market. You may be able to draw multiple offers on your home and increase your sale price through a bidding war.

If you’re on the fence about selling, please don’t hesitate to contact me. I would love to consult with you to see if we can sell your home quickly and for top dollar.

I look forward to speaking with you!

It’s June right now, which is a fantastic time to sell a home in Tucson. Today I’d like to speak to the home sellers in the area and let them know how to take advantage of this market.

Homes that are priced above $300K are seeing a buyer’s market right now, meaning we have a lot of supply and not enough buyers to respond to the supply. This is great news for home buyers, but sellers will have to be strategic because buyers have the upper hand right now.

If you’re trying to sell in this price range, I recommend speaking with a Realtor who knows your area and who can pinpoint an attractive price for your home. If you can price it right at market value, you have a chance to sell quickly and for top dollar.

I would love to help you with this, so please don’t hesitate to contact me if you’re looking to sell your Tucson home this year.

I look forward to speaking with you!

Today I’d like to take a moment to speak about the recovering market we’re seeing in Tucson. Traditionally, a market recovers from the bottom up, so that’s what is happening right now.

We’re currently in a very strong seller’s market, which means there is very little supply for homes that are valued at less than $300,000.

This means if you’re planning to buy a home, you need to be ready to pull the trigger. Competition will be stiff, and so you need to be pre-qualified if you want to have a good chance at getting a home.

Overall, we’re seeing a very strong seller’s market if you’re looking for homes that are valued under $300,000. If you’re selling in that range, you can look to make top dollar right now.

Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you’re buying or selling in Tucson, now is a great time to be in the real estate market!

Hey everyone, welcome back! I’m here to give you a mid-year market report for the Tuscon real estate market today, and I think you’ll like what we’ve been seeing lately.

Our average sales price right now is $210,000, up 7% from 2014. Our active listings are sitting at a 4-month supply right now, which puts us in a pretty balanced market.

The average days on market in Tuscon is trending downward, which is a good sign. We started the year at 70 days and are into the mid-60’s now.

If you’re a seller, you can plan on selling your home within 60 days of being on the market if you list with us. With a good property that is priced correctly, it should be no problem!

If you are a buyer, you can expect to buy at a bit of a discount, as the average list-to-sale ratio in Tuscon is down to 95%.

The Tuscon market is returning to more normal levels. Whether you are a buyer or a seller, we have a team of folks that can help. If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to speaking with you!

As the year comes to a close, we thought we would share a recap of what we saw in Tucson real estate over the last year.

This last year was a fantastic one for real estate in Tucson and the surrounding areas. The average sales price jumped 7.8% since 2013, which makes it three consecutive years of strong appreciation. Currently, our average sales price is $207,000, while the total units sold are slightly off last years pace.

The average days on market is as low as it has been all year at 58 days. This is up from the 51 days it typically took to sell a home in 2013. Currently, our inventory in the MLS has 5,800 units, and we’re selling anywhere from 1,200 to 1,300 a month, which means we have less than six months of supply. This means most areas of town have a fairly balanced at this time.

Where is the market and where is it going?An interesting data point in our market has to do with how quickly homes are selling. Two-thirds of our sales every month are houses that have been on the market for less than 60 days. Essentially, if homes are priced right, in good condition, and in a good location, they are turning in 60 days.

As you can see, we saw a very active and robust market in 2014. But what can we expect in 2015? We’re expecting prices to continue appreciating, although softening slightly compared to the rates we’ve seen in the past few years. Across the city, you can probably expect a 3% to 5% price increase across the city. As far as interest rates go, we’re expecting upward pressure on interest rates in the coming year.

If you’re a buyer, it would probably be smart to buy sooner than later. If you’re getting a mortgage, the cost of money and the price of the house are going to rise. If you’re a seller, there are very specific areas of town that are experiencing favorable conditions, while there are other areas that aren’t. It’s best to speak with a real estate expert if you’re thinking about selling, as they will be able to tell you what’s best given your specific circumstances.

Have questions about conditions in your area? Give us a call! We would love to sit down, provide you with relevant information, and discuss your options.

Thanks, and Happy New Year!

“When we were searching for a home with Don, we still were trying to figure out whether we wanted to live in Portland or in the Tucson area. After a while we decided to live in Tucson but we were still living in Portland so when we were doing some remodeling on the home we relied on Don to take measurements and other things of that nature. He was very willing to step up and provide very accurate information for us. The whole relationship was cooperative, collegial and it was one of the easiest home buys that we’ve encountered!”-Bob Hopkins, Home Buyer

There are a few things almost all buyers resist: coming to meet us in our office so we can figure out the specifics of the property they are looking for, and meeting with a lender at the front end of the process instead of waiting. Today, we explain why doing both of those things are actually beneficial for all parties involved.

Sitting down with a real estate professional will save you time and frustration in the long run. Why? For one, you can save a lot of time by hashing out exactly what you require a home to have and what needs you want met. An agent will show you only homes that satisfy the requirement you laid out, so you don’t have to waste time seeing homes you have no interest in buying. The initial interview is crucial if you want to save time and stress.

Talking with a lender is also a crucial part of the process that buyers would rather put off. However, we have had buyers who loved a home they saw, went to get approved by a lender, but were unable to purchase the home once they were approved because someone else had already gotten to it. When you have approval up front, we can act quickly to get the home you like under contract and negotiate a very good deal for you.

As you can see, sitting down with an agent and seeing a lender before jumping headfirst into the buying process can be incredibly beneficial. If you have any further questions on this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’re proud to be your number one source for real estate information here in Southern Arizona!

As the market begins to normalize and more people come out to look for homes, you may find yourself competing with several buyers for a single home. If you want your offer to be accepted, take note of the following tips:


  Get Pre-approved: You need to get a pre-approval letter from a lender before you begin your home search. You need to have it ready when you submit your initial offer, or the seller won’t take you seriously. We counsel all of our clients to get it done up front, so we can present an offer in a strong manner.
  Send copy of proof of funds and earnest money checks: Sending these documents will give the seller confidence in you. Many buyers don’t go out of their way like this to show how serious they are, so this gesture will make your offer the most attractive.


These are just a few tips that can be done a day or two before you prepare to make an offer, but they could be the difference between getting your offer accepted and missing out on your dream home. If you would like more buying tips, or have any questions about real estate, give us a call. We would be pleased to assist you in any way possible!

When selling a home, there’s nothing better than receiving multiple offers. The problem is deciding which offer to accept. It goes without saying that every offer isn’t created equal, but it can be difficult to determine the best one. Today, we want to share some tips that might help you during the process.

Recently, an incident happened to one of our team members we thought we should share. They submitted an offer with everything that’s needed in our Tuscon market and gave it to the listing agent. The listing agent responded by telling us the seller didn’t want to entertain any contingency offers. Our offer was contingent on the closing - our client already had their house under contract, had the inspections and appraisals completed, but was simply waiting for the official close.

We had to explain to the listing agent that over 70% of the buyers in the market have contingencies of some sort - they need to get equity out of an existing property in order to make their next purchase. That’s why, when you’re selling, you should expect certain contingencies when you receive an offer. The important thing is to separate the offers that have inconvenient contingencies from those that have minor ones. We are experts at this and would love to help.

If you have any questions about accepting offers, or have any general real estate questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to hear from you!

As the rest of the country slows down during the fall and winter months, our market here is Tucson starts to get busy. We see a flurry of activity during this time as winter visitors flood the area to escape the cold. With October underway, the season for who we affectionately call “snowbirds” has just begun.

We are starting to see an increase in traffic in listings and open houses because of the recent activity. Because inventory is just under 6,000 homes and we sold about 1,200 last month, we are at around 5 months of inventory. It’s a balanced market that slightly favors sellers, as 6 months is generally considered a perfectly balanced market.

Now is a great time to list your home if you are thinking about selling. There will be a ton of buyer activity up until the holidays, where you’ll see fewer, but more serious buyers. We recommend taking advantage of this highly active market!

If you have any questions about conditions in your specific area, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to give you a hand!

Just about everyone we work will bring up their home value according to what their “zestimate” was. Zillow gathers certain data from the local market and plugs it into an algorithm designed to establish a value for your home. The site is good for establishing a ballpark estimate and informing consumers where the market is heading - but not much else.

Zillow doesn’t service customers very well when it comes to supply and demand. For homes under $275,000 in Tucson, we currently have a strong seller’s market, with less than a 3-month supply in most areas. On the other hand, the $700,000 and above range is seeing a strong buyer’s market, with an inventory of over 12 months. These differing markets have a huge effect on pricing, and Zillow doesn’t take the variables into account.

Another way Zillow fails to assist the consumers is its inattention to the location of properties. Some neighborhoods demand much higher prices than surrounding areas. For instance, we just listed and sold a home with a $300,000 “zestimate” in three months and for just under $600,000. Zillow fails to take location and home improvements into account, which may lead them to undervalue your home.

As real estate professionals, it’s our responsibility to get you the highest possible dollar amount for your home. Zillow provides some basic tools for the curious consumer, but serious buyers should stick with the experts. If you have any questions about what we offer over Zillow, give us a call or shoot us an email. We would love to hear from you!

The market here in Tucson is looking pretty strong. We currently have a balanced market, meaning we have an equal number of buyers and sellers. The amount of available inventory is at 6 months, which is always a good sign heading into the fall months.

If you’re pricing your home at $250,000 or less, it’s a very hot market - as many buyers are looking to purchase property in that range. If you’re in the $250,000-$500,000 price range, you’re in a pretty average market - as homes are sitting on the market for about 65-75 days. The luxury market is fairly slow at the moment; we have a growing number of homes on the market that aren’t getting absorbed - but this is dependent on the area.

Rates are still very competitive, which is a great sign for buyers. Interest rates are just over 4%, which is about as low as they’re likely to get. In fact, many experts are thinking rates are going to jump soon. Now might be the time to make your move in the Tuscon area because home prices are inching up and rates are likely to rise within the next year.

Conditions also look good if you are looking to sell. In the last 24 months home prices have increased 14% and we can expect a rise of 3% to 5% this year. If you price your home competitively, perhaps a little under the market value, you are likely to get a great value for your home in this market.

Since real estate is local, conditions may be slightly different in your area. If you would like specific details about current trends in your neighborhood, don’t hesitate to give us a call or shoot us an email. We would love to chat!
