        <description>

Today we’re going to talk a little bit about property taxes. The big question people have is, “How are they calculated?” We’re going to answer that for you right now.

The county you live in assesses the value of your property every year, typically in late spring/early summer. There are also taxing entities that are associated with your property, such as the school district, community hospital, community college, and sometimes a water district. Each of these entities taxes at its own rate.

“The county assesses your property’s value each year.”

To determine which entity taxes your property or a property you want to buy, you can go to your county’s assessor’s website (ex. Dcad.org or dentoncad.com). This will help you figure out what the taxes will be on your current property or on the property you are thinking of buying.

If you have any other questions about this topic or anything else related to the real estate or mortgage worlds, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Today I want to talk about mortgage rates. What makes them go up? What makes them go down?

First, I want to start with who owns mortgages. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae fund virtually all of the traditional mortgage loans in the United States.

They sell securities to investors such as private investors, corporate investors, insurance funds, and even foreign governments to fund loans that we write. These places buy these securities because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. What causes the rates to go up and down is the demand for those securities.

If investors are buying the securities, then the yields that they pay are going down. This would mean that your interest rates decrease.

“Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae fund virtually all of the traditional mortgage loans in the United States.”

Meanwhile, if the demand for those securities decreases, then they raise the yield to encourage them to buy more. This, then, would increase the interest rates.

Thinking about it in terms of the stock market, if your 401(k) is going well, then interest rates are probably going up. If your 401(k) is not doing well, interest rates are probably going down.

If you have any additional questions about this or anything else that is mortgage related, please feel free to give us a call. We would be happy to help you.

        <description>

Do you know how much home you can afford? Depending on the loan type you’re using, whether it’s FHA, VA, or a conventional loan, 43% to 50% of your gross monthly income can be used to cover the cost of the home purchase and any associated credit liabilities. The home purchase itself will be comprised of expenses such as taxes, insurance, and, potentially, homeowners association dues. To hear my full message on this subject, watch this short video.

        <description>

When it comes to receiving gift funds for non-conventional loans, there are certain requirements you need to be aware of and restrictions that are placed on the donor.

First, full account ownership of the donor must be documented and the donor’s ability to gift the money must be verified. A full bank statement from your donor must be provided, showing their name, address, account number, and their account balances before and after the gifts funds are taken out.

There are a variety of ways the donor can transfer you the funds in this scenario, but if the money is being transferred to you directly, then we need to document your receipt of that money with an updated transaction history.

“There are a variety of ways the donor can transfer you the funds in this scenario.”

Lastly, if the donor has large deposits on the monthly statement that they provide, they have to document where that money came from, as stated in the Patriot Act.

If you have any other questions about the requirements of gift funds for non-conventional loans or you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to us. We would be more than happy to help you.

        <description>

What is an escrow account? How does it work?

In short, an escrow account is put in place during a home purchase to keep the recurring costs associated with homeownership.

When you use a mortgage loan to buy a home and you put down less than 20%, federal law requires that there be an escrow account involved in the transaction. Escrow accounts are also required whenever you use an FHA or VA loan to purchase a home.

“When you use a mortgage loan to buy a home and you put down less than 20%, federal law requires that there be an escrow account involved in the transaction.”

Essentially, you “escrow” the future tax and insurance payments of that home. One-twelfth of your tax bill is added to your monthly mortgage payment and held in the escrow account so that when your tax bill is due, the mortgage company has enough funds to pay it. The same goes for your insurance bill.

The due dates for each payment don’t always align—your insurance payment is typically due on the anniversary of your mortgage, and your property tax payment is typically due in December.

If you have any other questions about escrow accounts and how they function, don’t hesitate to get in touch with me. I’d be happy to speak with you.

        <description>

You’ve got questions; we’ve got answers.

Why would we need a letter from someone who’s not on the loan documenting access to an account?

Consider this example: A husband and wife have a joint account, but the wife is the only person on the mortgage. There can be a lot of reasons why this may happen—maybe only she has an income, he has bad credit, etc.

“The account owner must give the other person access to those funds.”

When we do not have both account owners on the loan, however, the account owner must give the other person access to those funds. We will need an access letter to do this.

If you have any other questions, please contact us. We look forward to speaking with you.

Today I want to take a quick look at how to get started with the mortgage approval process.

We start by collecting your name, social security number, address, residence history, and employment history. This information helps complete the base of the application.

“However you prefer to submit your information, I would be happy to assist you.”

There are three different ways you can provide this information.

1. Face-to-face. You are more than welcome to come into my office. I would love to see you.

2. Over the phone.

3. Online.

Whichever you prefer, I would be happy to assist you.

If you have any questions, please feel free to let me know by phone or email. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

        <description>

How quickly can we close your home?

“Closing speed largely depends on you, the appraiser, and the terms of the loan.”

There are some federal regulations that require waiting periods from the date of the application to the first eligible closing date. There is also a waiting period for the appraisal, as well as for when you receive the initial closing disclosure. We’ve closed loans in eight days, but most between 20 and 25 days.

Ultimately, it’s up to you. If you have further questions about this or anything else real estate related, please give me a call. I would be happy to speak with you.

        <description>

Today we are answering your questions about closing costs. First, what are closing costs?

At the closing table, the three kinds of expenses buyers can expect are the down payment, one-time closing fees, and pre-paid items. 

Let’s begin by talking about down payments. A down payment is a deposit made toward the cost of the home, and usually amounts to a specific percentage of the total list price.

“The amount of money that you bring to closing will vary based on several factors.”

Next, closing costs are one-time fees associatedwith the home purchase. This includes the appraisal fees, the survey fees, the lender costs, and the cost of title insurance.

Finally, prepaid items are recurring charges. These are things which you will pay continually as a homeowner, such as homeowners insurance, property taxes, or mortgage insurance.

The amount of money that you bring to closing will vary based on the price of the house, your down payment, and your creditworthiness.

If you have further questions about this or anything else real estate related, please give me a call. I would be happy to speak with you.

        <description>

What is rapid rescoring and what does it do for your credit report? 

There are certain circumstances where people have high-revolving credit balances, but are on 0% interest so they don’t feel like it’s a problem to have a high limits-to-balance ratio. They may also have a furniture account that they’re paying monthly installments on, but it’s being reported as a revolving account. 

These kinds of situations can have a negative impact on your credit score, but if you have the ability to pay those account balances, we can help you print off a new statement that shows what your updated balance is and “force-report” those account balances through rapid rescoring.

“We can do these rapid rescores in usually four or five days.”

Typically, creditors only report to the credit scoring models only once a month, and if you have a 25- or 30-day timeline for your mortgage approval or closing, you need the ability to do these rapid rescores to get your score up and save money. We can do these rapid rescores in usually four or five days, depending on which creditor you’re paying off. 

If you have any more questions about how rapid rescoring works or you’re in need of a rapid rescore, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. If you have any other questions, I’d be happy to answer those too. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

If you’re a buyer, what really goes on in the appraisal process?

On our team, we order appraisals through our panel of appraisers to see the house that’s being bought. The appraiser measures the house’s dimensions, takes some pictures, verifies some condition items, and then goes back to their office to compare the house to other houses that have recently sold.

“The appraiser’s primary objective is to determine the home’s worth.”

The appraiser’s job is to find the most comparable properties—ones that are similar in size, age, proximity, etc. Their primary objective is to determine what the house would be worth if, for whatever reason, you couldn’t pay for it and the mortgage lender had to resell it.

If you have any other questions about the appraisal process or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in our market soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. I’d be glad to help you.

        <description>

How do gift funds work for conventional loans? Well, when it comes to gift funds for conventional loans, my team and I are much less intrusive on the donor in terms of documenting account ownership.

If you follow the set of specific instructions we will lay out for you, then we won’t need to see bank statements from the donor. Here’s what you need to do.

“If you follow the set of specific instructions we will lay out for you, then we won’t need to see bank statements from the donor.”

First, have your donor write you a check. Next, deposit that check into the account we’re verifying for your funds to close. Then, send us an updated transaction history from your account to show that those funds are now available.

After that, you will need to call your donor to have them send us a copy of the front and back of the processed check from their bank. Once you’ve followed these instructions, you should be good to go.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Are you better off waiting to buy a home or buying now?

Every market is different, just like everyone’s financial situation is different.

“Waiting to buy may cost you, but it’s more important that you buy when the time is right for you.”

Two things we can’t control are the rise and fall of home prices and the rise and fall of interest rates. That’s why the best time to buy a house is whenever is best for you, your family, and your financial situation.

Waiting to buy may cost you, but it’s more important that you buy when the time is right for you. I know I’m not worried about the cost of waiting.

If you have any more questions about the right time to buy a home or you’re thinking about selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

What can you do to improve your credit before applying for a mortgage?

First of all, you need to have a basic understanding of what your current accounts look like. To do this, my team and I can perform a soft pull that won’t affect your credit score.

“The most important thing on your credit score is your revolving balances.”

The most important thing on your credit score is your revolving balances, specifically in relation to your limits. If we can get these below 50%, this will help to improve your score. Your score will be even better still if we can get them below 10%.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

What income is considered when qualifying for a mortgage?

These days, everything has to be verified through W2s, paystubs, or tax returns. Certain types of income are verified in different ways.

For example, a self-employed person would need tax returns to verify their income. A self-employed person is someone who owns 25% or more of a company or is a contract employee whose employer doesn’t take out taxes so they have to file their own.

For a W2 employee who has a commission or a bonus, if that bonus or commission is greater than 25% of their annual income, they also need tax returns.

“Understanding how incomes are verified for mortgages isn’t as difficult as you might think.”

Understanding how incomes are verified for mortgages isn’t as difficult as you might think. If you have any questions, just give us a call or shoot us an email and we’d be more than happy to walk you through the process and explain exactly what the underwriter will be looking for. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

A lot of people have questions about down payments. Today, I’m bringing you some answers.

Today, we’re going to be talking about down payments. This is a topic that raises a lot of confusion, which is why I’m here to clear up the subject.

One of the main things people ask is, “How much do I need to put down?”

The truth is that it all depends. We need to ask ourselves if we can meet your financial budget, if we can meet your monthly payment requirements, and if we can buy the house you have in mind with the funds you have on hand.

“The amount people put down varies a lot more than some might tend to believe.”

Most of our clients put down between 3% and 10%, but some put down more and others put down less. The amount people put down varies a lot more than some might tend to believe.

We even have programs available that allow you to buy a home for nothing down at all.

Ultimately, we’d love to walk you through the process and determine what route is best for you.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Home remodeling is as hot as it’s ever been. Here are five projects that bring the best return on investment.

According to researchers at Harvard University, remodeling investment is up 6% over last year and now makes up a $324 billion market.

According to a survey of remodelers and real estate professionals, there are five remodeling projects that offer the best returns:

1. Your kitchen. Kitchen remodeling can be as simple or as elaborate as you like. However, to maximize your return, keep your investment to under 20% of the value of your home—as is recommended by surveyed real estate professionals. The outcome? A whopping 85% return on your investment.

2. Your bathroom. A thorough bath remodeling project can cost up to $20,000. However, not only will it pay for itself, it should give you an added 80% return.

3. Your deck. Replacing your deck can cost you anywhere from a few thousand dollars to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the size. The expected benefit will be similar to a bathroom remodeling project—around an 80% return for a fresh, new deck.

4. Your siding. Fading or worn-out siding can turn off potential buyers before they even step foot in your home. Replacing old siding will make it much easier to sell your home, and in addition, it should give you an 80% return on an investment of around $10,000.

5. Your windows. New windows can mean greater energy efficiency, increased thermal and acoustic comfort, and a more modern look. Homebuyers are well aware of this, and they are willing to pay accordingly. That’s why a typical window replacement should yield at least a 70% return on your investment.

“Some will make more sense for your home than others.”

Clearly, some of them will make more sense for your home than others. If you’re considering selling your home, then just one of these projects could add tens of thousands of dollars to the price you’ll be able to get.

If you have any questions or want additional advice about which remodeling projects make sense for you, give me a call or send me an email. We can discuss all the details and I can give you an accurate estimate of what these projects could cost, and how to go about financing them. I look forward to hearing from you!

        <title>How the Feds Recent Rate Hike Impacts Our Market</title>

        <description>

The Fed’s recent rate hike shouldn’t have any significant impact on our market. In fact, it might actually stimulate it.

On June 14th, the Federal Reserve increased its federal funds interest rate by 0.25%. They’re also widely expected to raise rates once or twice more over the course of 2017. What does this mean for the real estate market?

While any action by the Fed always garners a lot of attention, I believe these increases will not have any significant impact on our market.

First of all, mortgage rates have actually trended lower in the wake of the Fed’s recent announcement. The 30-year mortgage rate recently hit 3.9%, the lowest level in 2017. In fact, it’s a common pattern for the mortgage rate and the Fed rate to move in opposite directions, and the same thing has happened the last two times the Fed raised rates.

Second, the economy continues to do well. The Fed decided to increase its rate because unemployment and inflation are low, household spending is picking up, and we’ve seen steady growth for the past nine years. This is good news for the real estate market. As expected, we continue to see strong demand and a corresponding increase in home prices.

“These increases will not have any significant impact on our market.”

Third, while the Fed’s rate increase is normally meant to cool off the economy, it might actually stimulate it in this case. Because interest rates were so low for such a long period of time, experts believe the recent increases might ease pressure on the financial system and encourage lending.

Case in point: since the Fed started raising its rate in December 2016, total mortgages are up 2.5% year over year.

In conclusion, while any move by the Fed is likely to lead to a lot of hand-wringing, I believe the real estate market will not be affected and will continue on its own healthy course. Nonetheless, it’s clear that right now is a uniquely good moment for everyone in the real estate market. Today’s low mortgage rates are good for homebuyers because they make homes more affordable.

If you have any questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help.

        <description>

Today I want to inform you about how Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest underwriter of mortgages, recently introduced three new rules that will affect those with student debt.

If you have a student loan or you are a cosigner on one, I have some good new for you.

Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest underwriter of mortgages, recently introduced three new rules that will affect those with student debt.

These new rules can make it easier to get a mortgage, and they can make it easier to pay off your (or your kids’) student loans.

The first change is for those on income-based repayment plans, where having a high debt-to-income ratio is the No. 1 reason for not being approved for a mortgage.

Fannie Mae previously used a very conservative 1% of the total loan instead of the actual monthly payment. This can drastically lower your debt-to-income ratio and give you a much better chance of qualifying for a mortgage.

Some folks are lucky enough to have their student debt paid by their parents or even by their employer. The thing is, Fannie Mae didn’t take this into account when calculating the debt-to-income ratio. That’s the second new change.

If your employer or your parents have been paying off your student debt and you can show evidence of this for the past 12 months, then this debt won’t be counted in your debt-to-income ratio. This makes it more likely you will qualify for a mortgage.

“If you can qualify for a mortgage right now, you definitely should.”

If you can qualify for a mortgage right now, you definitely should. Rates are still at a historical low, and lots of great houses have recently come on the McKinney market.

Fannie Mae also makes it possible to refinance your mortgage for more than the value of your home. Normally, there is a 0.25% fee that applies to any cash you take out in this way.The third big change is that Fannie Mae will now waive that fee when you use this cash to pay off a student loan.

This applies whether the loan is yours, or you’re a cosigner. If the mortgage rate is significantly lower than the student loan rate, it can make sense to refinance in this way, and the new rule makes it cheaper to do so.

If you need help understanding these new guidelines to see whether they’re right for you, or you have questions about putting them into practice, get in touch with me. I’ll be glad to help.

I hope to hear from you soon!

        <title>You Dont Need a Down Payment</title>
        <link>https://thespringmortgageteam.com/you-dont-need-down-payment.html</link>

        <description>

Today, I want to share with you all the options you have for an affordable down payment as a homebuyer.

What’s the biggest obstacle to homeownership?

According to a recent survey, “saving enough for a down payment” comes at the top of the list. A whopping 55% of prospective homebuyers cited this as their main stumbling block.

And with the continuing growth of home prices, things aren’t getting any easier. In fact, homeownership rates reached a 20-year low last November.

It wasn’t always like this.

A decade ago, many lenders were offering easy, no-money-down mortgages.

However, after the financial crisis, mortgage standards have become more restrictive. A typical mortgage now requires a 20% down payment.

“55% cited the lack of a down payment as their main stumbling block.”

Here’s the good news.

If you have decent credit and a steady income, you might be qualified for a number of specialized programs that require no or very little down payment. Here are a few of the top options.

First, there’s the USDA loan, which is valid for homes in certain regions, such as rural and suburban areas.

With zero money down and lenient credit requirements, the USDA loan can be a great choice for many homeowners.

Second, there’s the VA loan, which you can apply for if you or your spouse served in a branch of the military.

It’s possibly the most generous zero-money-down mortgage because of low interest rates and low closing costs.

Third, there’s the FHA loan. It does require a 3.5% down payment — still drastically more achievable than the 20% required for a conventional mortgage.

Finally, there are a number of credit unions and first-time homebuyer programs that might apply to your particular situation.

There’s one important thing you should know.

If you get one of these no-money-down mortgages, chances are good you will be required to pay private mortgage insurance, which can drive up your monthly payments.

Fortunately, private mortgage insurance will disappear after your mortgage balance is under 80%. Also, the money you do pay will be tax deductible in most cases.

In short, there are lots of options to make owning a home a reality for you, even if you haven’t saved up tens of thousands of dollars.

Standing out as a buyer can be tough in a seller’s market. Here are three ways to make it easier.

When competing for a home in a seller’s market, you need to do everything you can to help your offer stand out. Here are three surefire ways to make your offer more attractive to sellers in this type of market:

1. A professionally written offer. This means no mistakes and no questions left for the listing agent to ask. The No. 1 pet peeve of listing agents is a sloppy offer.

“Listing agents hate sloppy offers.”

2. A heartfelt, handwritten letter to the seller. Explain why you want to buy their house and what it means to you and your family.

3. A fully underwritten approval. That’s where we come in.

If you have any questions for us about any of these topics or you’d like to get pre-approved for a mortgage today, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help out.

We’ve developed an in-house down payment assistance program that can help clients who previously wouldn’t have been able to afford a down payment.

Today I want to share some exciting news regarding down payment assistance.

In the past, we’ve had clients that didn’t quite have enough money saved for a down payment. In response to this, we’ve developed an in-house down payment assistance program for up to 3.5% of the sales price. The credit qualifications are minimal and the income caps are much higher than the state-funded DPA programs or bond programs.

We’d love to help you achieve the path toward homeownership, so if you have any questions about this new program, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We look forward to helping you!

Choosing the wrong lender can lead to a home sale not closing on time and other unwanted scenarios. Luckily, whether you’re a buyer or a seller, there are steps you can take to ensure this doesn’t happen.

Why is choosing the right lender critical if you want to close on time?

For one thing, statistics show that not choosing the right lender can be disastrous. Every month, mortgage services provider Ellie Mae produces a report they call the “Origination Insight Report.” In this report, they track and pull all kinds of data from all the lenders who use their software to process loans. We’re talking millions of loans.

What does the data from the latest report tell us?

Firstly, it tells us that the average numbers of days it takes to close a loan from the application to the closing is 46 days. That’s way too many! Secondly, it tells us that only 74% of purchase loans that are submitted end up closing. That means that one out of every four deals falls through, or 25% of the people end up having to put down earnest money, lose their inspection costs, and possibly lose their appraisal fee.

“Don’t end up as a cautionary statistic.”

What can you do to make sure you don’t end up becoming one of these statistics?

If you’re a home buyer, start the pre-qualification process as early as possible. Get your documentation in order and choose a lender that has a track record of success.

If you’re a seller, do what you can to verify the pre-approval. Check out things like what kind of lender the buyer is using, how much they’re putting down, and how many days they need for the financing contingency.

If you or anyone you know has questions about the mortgage process or about real estate in general, please don’t hesitate to call us or visit our website. We look forward to hearing from you!

As your processor, my job is to package your loan for the underwriting. I’ll reveal all the documents you’ve already sent to your loan officer and I’ll request anything else we might be missing so we can be sure we have all necessary documents.

“It’s very important to know who your insurance agent is.”

Next, I’ll order all of our third party things like verification of employment, tax transcripts, title, appraisal, and insurance. It’s very important that you know who your insurance agent is early on! We can help with that if you need some referrals.

The next step is to send it to underwriting, which only takes a couple of days. Sometimes that review goes perfectly and we don’t need anything else, but there may be follow-up questions or more documents that we need.

I’m always here to help! If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

Today and I wanted to talk about the home renovation program, which helps homeowners finance improvements, repairs, and upgrades into their mortgage so they don’t have to pay for these things out of pocket.

For this loan, you can finance up to 95% of the cost of the house and the improvements, or the total improved value (whichever is less). This can also apply to refinance customers, who can refinance their current mortgage plus the cost of the improvements for up to 95% of the improved value.

“Start with your ideal location and use this loan to create your ideal home.”

If you’re in the market to buy but you just can’t seem to find the perfect house in the perfect location, this loan program is perfect. Start with the perfect location, and you can use this program to buy a fixer-upper to turn into your perfect home.

If you already own a home and are dreaming of repairs, you can still take advantage of this program, depending on the equity you have in your home.

This program allows for all kinds of renovations. The only requirement is that the upgrades are affixed to the home and that they increase its value. This could mean a kitchen remodel, new fixtures, or even a pool.

If you have questions about this program, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email today. I’d love to hear from you.

As a homeowner, there are many ways you can save money without refinancing.

First, you can have your conventional mortgage insurance removed. If you bought a house in the last five years, there is a good chance you can remove mortgage insurance because home values have gone up 8% to 10%.

You should also check on your home insurance. Insurance rates change all the time. For instance, if a company with higher exposure in certain areas gets hit by a storm, their rates will go up. A company with less exposure would probably keep the same rates despite the storm, giving you good coverage for less money. Switching insurance companies could save you a lot of money in the long run.

“Home Insurance rates change all the time, so shop around for a better one.”

If you’re happy with your insurance, consider checking your utility rates. You don’t have much choice when it comes to things like gas, water, and trash. However, you can save money on your electricity, phone, cable, or internet bill. You can research different rates on your own by checking PowerToChoose.org or we can hook you up with a free concierge service that will shop the rates and get you the best program.

Finally, file that homestead exemption to save 15% to 20% on your property taxes. You have to be the owner of record on January 1st and you have three months to file the exemption. Once that exemption has been filed, it’s good for that year and all the other years you spend in that house.

As you can see, refinancing is not the only way you can save money on your house. If you have any questions for me, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

Our team here at Spring Mortgage is different in a lot of ways. Most of the work we do is behind the scenes, but we wanted to share some of that with you today. Here’s how we differentiate ourselves from the pack:


  
    Knowledge. We know the business, including all the guidelines and how to make things work in an ever-changing mortgage world.
  
  
    Flexibility. We have home loans for everyone. Whether you need to buy a mansion with a super jumbo loan, or you’re a first-time buyer who needs down payment assistance, we can help you. We have loans for those with great credit, and those who have some hiccups. We even have loans for people who have gone through bankruptcy or a foreclosure last week.
  
  
    Communication. We work really hard at it. The level of communication between Realtor, lender, and customer in this industry is horrible. We don’t accept that. Our process is fine-tuned so that no Realtor or customer will ever be in the dark. If you ever have questions for us, we’ll get right back to you.
  


Finally, we have our $10,000 closing insurance program. We are so proud of our process that if we fail to perform on our commitment to a customer, we will pay them $10,000. If that’s not different, we don’t know what is.

“We have home loans for everyone.”

If you have any questions for us, please give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you!

If you’ve ever applied for a mortgage, you know how much documentation is needed. If not, it’s important to know exactly what you’ll need to keep the process going smoothly.

Your type of income determines the documentation you’ll need to provide in most cases.

If you’re a W-2 employee (taxes are taken out of your paycheck) will need two years of W-2 forms, and if you rental property or commissionable income, or your bonus exceeds 25% of your salary, you’ll need two years of income tax returns.

“It’s important to know exactly what is needed.”

You also need 30 days worth of recent paycheck stubs, two months worth of account statements for check, savings, retirement; anywhere that your money comes from. You also need to provide 24 months of employment residence history, along with identity verification like a driver’s license, social security card, or passport.

For those who are self-employed or a contractor (taxes aren’t taken out of your paycheck) you’ll need two years worth of 1099 and K-1 forms, two years of full personal tax returns, and if you own more than 25% of the business, you’ll need two years of the business tax returns as well.

Everyone will also need to provide a year-to-date profit-loss, to show that your income is in line with the tax returns from an income and expense standpoint. We’ll help you with that.
