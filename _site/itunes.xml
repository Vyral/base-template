Recently, Jason sent in a great question. He says, “I really want to sell my home and take advantage of the higher prices, but I’m afraid I can’t find a house that I’ll want to buy.”

This fear comes from a lack of inventory.

Normally, our market has about 8,000 homes for sale at any given time. Now, there are only 4,675 homes for sale. On top of that, we are selling homes twice as fast as we did at this time last year.

“We work to find off-market homes for you to purchase.”


So, what can you do?

Our solution is to create homes for sale. We do whatever it takes to find you a home. From daily calls to door knocking in desired neighborhoods, we work to find homes to sell that are not yet on the market.

Our hard work can help you find a home in this competitive market.

If you have any other questions or need any help finding your next home, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
