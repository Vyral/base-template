Neal Bros Home Renovations is offering a full commission for any agent who brings us a pre-MLS or off-market property that fits the criteria of homes we’re looking to buy and renovate.

If you bring us a property, we’ll pay you a full commission up front and give you a 5% equity stake in the home’s renovation. We wanted to offer agents an easy, no-hassle way to make a transaction and get into the home renovation business, and this program fits that description.

Jim Bell is the first agent to participate in this program. He was able to make a quick and easy 3% commission on the sale of the property we’re standing in front of in the video above, and he’ll also be able to make 5% of the profits once we renovate and sell it.

“We’ll pay you a full commission up front and give you a 5% equity stake in the home’s renovation.”

Jim was working with a client on the purchase of a condo, and she mentioned to him that she had a property that needed quite a bit of repair. She was looking for a quick, easy sell and didn’t like the idea of putting it on the market, so Jim set up an appointment between us and his client and we were able to come up with an agreeable sale price.

It was a win-win for all parties involved. If you want to be the next agent to take advantage of this new program we’re offering or you have any questions about how it works, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to speak with you.

Are you an agent who has a property in mind that could be a good flip?

We’ve been flipping homes for three years now through another company apart from our real estate team called Neal Bros, LLC which specializes in house flipping and investments. With this company, we now offer a program for agents who come across properties that could be a good flip in the San Antonio and all surrounding areas.

For example, if you’ve ever gone on a listing appointment with a seller who is in a distressed situation, or may not have enough money to fix-up the property to sell, we’d love to take a look at the house to see if the numbers will work. This is just one of many different scenarios that sellers may find themselves in and we are willing to consider anything!

“This program is a way for agents to earn the normal commissions and also be a part of the actual profit made on the deal at zero cost!”

With this program, we pay the commissions to you when we close on the house while truly catering to the needs of the seller (lease backs, quick close, extended close, etc). We also give you an equity stake, 5% of net profit, after the house has been renovated and sold in the future. There are no strings attached and no risk involved on your end! 

There are a lot of agents who want to get into this business, so this program is an opportunity for agents to become involved with no added cost creating a total win/win.  Not only can you earn money on the profit of each sale, but you can also build a strong referral network.

If you have any questions about how this process works, give us a call or reply to this email and we’d be happy to sit down and talk with you. We look forward to hearing from you.
