        <description>

I’m here today at the Toledo Geller interior design studio with Jessica and Virginia, who are with me to discuss a big topic—empty nesting. They have been in business together for 12 years, and their projects run the gamut from full house renovations, apartment renovations,  and everything in between.

Many of their clients are parents whose children have now moved away, leaving strong emotions and extra house space in their place. Together, Jessica and Virginia will discuss what topics and questions about empty nesting come up most frequently and how they help those going through this phase of their life.

““How?” How can an empty-nester adjust to their new life and use their home to the fullest?”

For myself, almost 65% of my clients are empty-nesters, and the first question almost all of them have for me is simply, “How?” How can an empty-nester adjust to their new life and use their home to the fullest?For your convenience, I have included timestamps below so that you can skip around to the portions of the conversation that interest you most.


  1:40—How Toledo Geller tackles the question, “What do I do now?”
  4:00—The craziest thing an empty-nester has ever asked for.
  6:20—The reason people hire Toledo Geller for their design needs: No “copy and pasting.”
  8:40—Customizing closets.
  10:00—In terms of pricing, what is the range that clients can work within?
  11:05—When is the best time for an empty-nester with a house on the market to contact Toledo Geller?


This was simply the first of a line of videos I’ll be posting with regards to to empty nesting and how we can help you through the process.

I’d like to thank Jessica and Virgina for their time and insight today. For more photos of their work and instructions on how you can set up a consultation with them, you can visit their website here.

Otherwise, if you have any questions about real estate, empty nesting, or other topics you’d like me to address, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to answer your questions, and if we choose your topic for a future video, we’ll send you a gift! We hope to hear from you soon.

        <description>

Appealing your property tax assessment is a challenging topic, which is why I’m joined today by attorney Eliot Malone to discuss everything you need to know about it.

“The closer your property’s equalization ratio is to 100%, the more likely your appeal will fail.”

I’ve provided timestamps of the video above so you can jump ahead to the sections of our conversation that interest you the most:

1:04 - What is a tax appeal?

2:50 - When can you appeal your property tax assessment?

3:15 - What steps do homeowners need to take to appeal their tax assessment?

6:15 - What is the equalization ratio and when does it change?

8:20 - When does a town change its equalization ratio?

10:34 - Why don’t towns want tax appeals?

14:15 - Will the town reassess when a home is sold?

16:01 - Is it true that it’s not a good idea to argue your assessment when your home is for sale?

17:56 - How do tax attorneys charge for their services?

If you have any more questions for Elliot, you can give him a call at (201) 608-5221 or email him at em@emalonelaw.com.

As always, if you have any other questions for me, feel free to call or email me anytime. I’d be happy to help you.

        <description>

I am joined once again today by Shani Weiss, our top stager and designer. She tells us what a stager does to change a home from a place with specific, personal decor to something a potential buyer could see themself living in from the moment they walk in.

Shani begins her process by removing everything from a listing’s rooms. She then replaces it with other furniture and decor that won’t overpower the space. She works with the current homeowners to decide what they can do to help the home sell easier.

“Shani tells us what a stager does to change a home from a place with specific, personal decor to something a potential buyer can see themselves living in as soon as they walk in.”

You can see a bright and open flow from the kitchen into the family room for the home featured in today’s video, in particular. In this case, she makes the home more modern and contemporary with fresh white paint on the fireplace and encourages natural lighting by removing the window coverings. This creates a focal point for the potential buyers to see as opposed to looking at the furniture. Shani says that when you are staging a home the family room should be a place where people imagine not only relaxing and being comfortable, but can also see themselves entertaining and being themselves.

Shani tells us that almost all of the furniture she has brought in is owned by the staging company. However, they do make strategic business partners so that they have access to certain pieces without purchasing them. Home Dynamix, for example, owns all the rugs that they use for staging purposes. She says that she prefers to use Wayfair because they have great customer service.

If you have any further questions about staging or are thinking about buying or selling, please feel free to contact us. My team and I would be happy to assist you in any way that we can.

        <description>

Today I’m joined by our team’s top designer and stager, Shani Weiss, to continue our discussion on styling a home. For this segment of our conversation, we’ll be specifically focusing on the importance of coffee tables.

At this point, you may be wondering: What makes a coffee table so important to selling a home?

What most people don’t realize is that coffee tables serve as the focal point for socialization in a room. This is why people spend so much time and energy determining what to put on top of this central surface. Or, in many cases, what not to put on it.

“When it does come time to go live on the market, a successfully staged home will tend to sell quickly and for top dollar.”

Some will advise you to remove every single personal item and knick-knack from on top of your coffee table. However, a completely empty coffee table will look adequate at most. And at the Stacy Esser Group, we don’t settle for things being “just fine.” We believe that homes should look phenomenal, not mediocre.

The best way to style a coffee table is actually to, first of all, make it reflect your personality, and second, to pick four points that lead to all other visual aspects of the room. You can see how this works in a real-life application by referencing the video above.

From a design perspective, everything you place on a coffee table should be done with purpose. This is certainly the case for how Shani approaches staging projects. She keeps in mind not only how the space will appear in person, but how decor pieces will impact the way a space will look in photographs.

It’s also important that staging not interfere with the seller’s lifestyle while they’re still occupying the home. This is why Shani finds it so important to get to know clients. Forming this kind of organic connection will foster a more successful and pleasant experience for everyone involved. Then when it does come time to go live on the market, a successfully staged home will tend to sell quickly and for top dollar.

        <title>What’s the Difference Between Neutralizing a Home and Sterilizing It?</title>

        <description>

Our team’s head stager, Shani Weiss, and I are back at our beautiful listing at 24 Lincoln Street in Demarest, New Jersey to show you the difference between sterilizing a home and neutralizing it before it’s on the market.

To demonstrate how we approach every room, we will focus on this home’s living room. When we did our initial consultation, the room had beautiful red damask wallpaper. That wallpaper, though, was too specific, so we painted the room in a nice, neutral color. Once we decluttered the room, we also found some gorgeous furnishings that were owned by the homeowner.

From there, we decided extra furniture was unnecessary. All it needed was some trendy items and accessories (pillows, fabrics, etc.) to make it come alive. We always try to stay on trend and add color to rooms to help them visually pop, and here we refashioned the room’s white sofa by adding a few cerulean blue pillows. Suddenly, that traditional sofa became a more updated, more transitional sofa.

“We always try to stay on trend and add color to rooms to help them visually pop.”

Someone without our unique perspective on design and home sales might have just taken everything out of this room, which would have been sterilizing it instead of neutralizing it.

Across the room, you will see a bench that was originally in another part of the home that Shani added to the room because its color matched that of the added pillows. Between those two items, you will see a big, empty coffee table that Shani was able to make more exciting, personable, and marketable.

But that is a story for our next video, so stay tuned for the next installment of our home staging series.

In the meantime, if you have any questions about home staging or you are thinking of buying or selling a home soon in our market, please feel free to reach out to us. My team and I would love to help you.

What kind of opportunities can a top real estate team and a top designer/home stager working in tandem offer buyer and sellers? Our head stager, Shani Weiss joins us today at one of our new listings at 24 Lincoln Street in Demarest, New Jersey to answer that question.

When we work with sellers, we often talk about the benefits of staging a home. More specifically, we talk about how we can take the home back to what made them fall in love with it in the first place. Sometimes this process can be difficult because we have to explain to them what might not work in terms of how to stage and sell their home.

“A good home stager will give prospective buyers a visual roadmap about what makes your home beautiful.”

Once they tell us what they loved about the home when they first bought it, though, we tell them to take a second look around. What they usually see is 20 years’ worth of stuff.

That’s when Shani steps in. After our listing appointment, she comes to the house and gives the seller room-by-room consultation, asking the same question for each room that we asked about the house in general.

After that, she offers the seller her advice in terms of how they should declutter, which can be tricky. According to her, this is why it’s much harder to stage a resale home than a new construction home. She always makes sure to reassure the seller that her job isn’t to get rid of their memories. Rather, it’s to give prospective buyers a visual roadmap about what makes the home beautiful.

Sometimes sellers are concerned that removing certain items from certain areas of their home will leave that area looking sterile. When a stager, a Realtor, and a home seller work together, though, their objective is to neutralize rather than sterilize.

In our next video, we’ll show you what it means to neutralize a home in order to improve its sale potential.

In the meantime, if you have any questions about this topic or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you.

Today we’re going to focus on Zillow. More specifically, their Zestimate. What is it? Essentially, it’s a starting point for determining the value of your home. Zillow will predict the value of your home, and people ask me all the time if this prediction is reliable. Let’s take a bit of a deeper look.

Basically, the Zestimate pulls from two data sources: The first is user-submitted data and the second is public data. The public data comes out of tax records or the MLS, but the user submitted data is something to focus on. A homeowner can change the user submitted data for their home. In doing that, they can manipulate and affect the price that Zillow comes up with for your house.

Once you go into Zillow and claim your house, you can go in and change the facts. Maybe you’ve made an improvement since your recent public data was pulled and you want to add to your home’s value. Once you do this, Zillow will update the value of your house within 24 hours.

“Any homeowner can change the user-submitted data for their home.”

Now you know how to manipulate the Zestimate a bit, but does that make it any more accurate? Listen to this. In 2016, the CEO of Zillow went and sold his house for more than 40% less than his Zestimate. That’s a pretty clear indicator that the Zestimate is not very accurate. It’s definitely not an appraisal. It would be called a “Zappraisal” in that case.

Nevertheless, we do use Zestimates to give us an idea of a property’s value. They have a lot of valuable data, but it’s not the end-all-be-all of pricing. Zestimates are more accurate in certain areas than others,** you can check the accuracy chart for your area here.** Make sure you claim your home if you haven’t yet as well.

In the meantime, if you have any questions about the market value of your home, we would love to help. We are local experts that can help you understand the value of your home, your neighborhood, and the current market conditions.

If you have any other questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
