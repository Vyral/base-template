Hey there, I just wanted to take a second and say thanks for joining us on our blog. I wanted to talk for a few minutes today about new construction here in Savannah. Now that the real estate market is booming once again, we are seeing more and more new construction out there, pretty much anywhere you can think of in the area.

If you’re looking at purchasing a new construction property, that’s great. However, you should know that if you aren’t represented by a Realtor, you are making yourself very vulnerable. While the builder’s agent is credible, they are still looking out for the builder’s best interest. You need a professional on your side to counteract this, and protect your best interests.

I hope this gives you a little bit of insight into new construction. If you have any questions about this or about any other topic, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. We look forward to speaking with you!

Today, I want to give you a quick update on the Savannah market, so you can make informed real estate decisions this summer!

Conditions are great in our area right now; we’re seeing a lot of activity and values are on the rise. The good news is that not only are home values increasing, but they’re increasing at a sustainable rate.

We’ve been fortunate to see incredibly low interest rates for an extended period of time and they are still quite low. However, rates are beginning their upward climb and are likely to jump significantly over the next year or two, making now a great opportunity to lock in low monthly payments on a new home.

If you have any questions about the market in your neighborhood, or if you want to explore your options in real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’re always happy to talk with you, and encourage you to do so soon!

Last time, I touched briefly on the great market conditions we’ve had here in Savannah. Today, I want to follow up with some tips about this exciting spring season! If you’re considering selling, there are some things you can do to increase your chances of a successful home sale.


  Plan: There are always tons of little things that need to be done around the home. If you plan well enough, you can list your home before the market gets too busy, which will generate interest and attract buyers.
  Landscaping: This is something that needs to be addressed every season. Anything you can do to increase your curb appeal should be done!
  Stage your home: Having a professional stager come in and make your home look fantastic will give you a huge advantage in the marketplace. Staging will show buyers the space in your home to its fullest potential.
  Touch up and make little repairs: Fix stains in the carpets and dents in the wall. New construction is making a comeback in Savannah, so many of the homes you’ll be competing against will be brand new. Having your home looking the best is going to increase your chances of standing out in a crowded market.


If you have any questions about preparing your home for the market, or if you would like our assistance for any of your real estate needs, give us a call or shoot us an email. We look forward to helping you soon!

Today, I’m going to give you a quick recap of the Savannah real estate market!

The market has been incredibly active over the last few months and we’ve kept very busy. In 2014, the market continued its steady growth and price levels continued to rise as well. Since the turn of the new year, the positive signs we were seeing have only accelerated!

As you know, real estate is all about supply and demand. Homes are flying off the shelf when they’re priced well, staged well, and marketed well. As far as interest rates are concerned, most experts are predicting an increase in interest rates around May or June, which may have an affect on our market.

As it stands, we’re heading into spring with our hands full. The market is active, and we’re expecting it to get even busier as the year moves along!

If you have any questions about our market, or if you could use our help in any way, give us a call or shoot us an email at www.McIntoshRealtyTeam.com. We look forward to hearing from you soon!

With the spring selling season just around the corner, we figured it would be a good time to discuss open houses.

Are they worth it? If so, what value do they provide?

Today, we’ll answer those questions, so you can make informed decisions when selling your Savannah home.

The McIntosh Team often holds open houses, but we prefer to do them when the home is vacant. The reason we prefer showing an empty or properly staged house is because a lot of people will come through. If you have valuables or cherished family items, you put them at risk during an open house.

In most cases, you’ll only have a few Realtors watching your home. If five different people show up at the same time, you may have strangers wandering through your home, which is never a good thing. Obviously, we try to do the best we can to keep an eye on everyone, but it can be very difficult. The biggest risk of having an open house, then, is how uncontrollable it can be. While rare, it’s something to keep in mind.

On the other hand, there are many advantages to having an open house. Any exposure is good exposure when it comes to selling your home. Will their be tire kickers, neighbors, and professional lookers? Of course, but they might have friends, family, or coworkers who are looking to buy. The chance that they might spread the word about your home makes an open house completely worth it.

It’s all about weighing the risks against the rewards of having an open house. Ultimately, it comes down to your specific situation. If you have questions about whether an open house is the right move for you, give us a call or shoot us an email. We would love to help you make the decision that will benefit your home sale!

Recently, we’ve received many questions from those of you who watch our videos, and we are going to do everything in our power to answer them in future videos. Today, we want to address the questions of HOA fees and how they can affect you, whether you’re buying or selling.

Not long ago, we worked with a seller who ran into HOA fees and was taken by surprise. When we first listed their home, we looked at the mortgage payoff, property taxes, real estate commission, and all the things that are usually figured in to help sellers understand what to expect on the HUD statement.

The one thing the seller was not aware of was a HOA fee in the amount of $850. He didn’t realize that he had agreed to it back when he purchased the house. Any time the title is transferred, under the agreement he made, he had to pay an $850 fee to the homeowners’ association in order to do so.

We just want this to be a warning to you, so you aren’t caught off guard when selling a home. You need to be aware of the homeowners’ association fees you agreed to years ago when you first purchased your home. It’s something you’ll want to keep in mind and think about when budgeting for your move.

On the buyer side of things, be aware that you may have to pay an initiation fee to join the homeowners’ association in your new neighborhood. They’re typically not too expensive, but you need to keep an eye out for them as well.

If you have any questions about this topic, or would like real estate assistance of any kind, don’t hesitate to give us a call or shoot us an email at any time. We would love to hear from you!

The end of the year is right around the corner, so we thought we would take this time to recap what we saw in Savannah real estate this year, as well as make our predictions for 2015.

Overall, 2014 was a fantastic year for real estate in our area. Sales rose in all but one price point, with the $250,000-$500,000 price range leading the way with a 10% increase in sales! The only price point that saw a loss in sales was the $0-$100,000 range, which saw a drop in sales of 7.4% in 2014.

As far as interest rates are concerned, we’ve been hovering just under 4% all year long, which is fantastically low. According to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Mortgage Banker Association, and the National Association of Realtors, interest rates are predicted to rise to anywhere from 4.7% to 5.4% by the fourth quarter of next year. That increase in rates may seem small, but it will make a significant difference in your mortgage payments and your ability to qualify for a loan.

Another topic worth discussing is distressed property sales. Back in 2011, 35% of sales in our market were distressed properties. As of September of 2014, we’re down to 10%! It’s great that the number of distressed properties is falling, as they adversely affect varying price points. We expect that percentage to drop even lower next year.

Foot traffic rose substantially in 2014, when compared to the same time period in 2013. We’re expecting yet another increase in 2015, which is a great indicator of how active the market is going to be. Let’s just say we’re excited for what the new year is going to bring us!

If you have any questions about market conditions, or would like real estate advice of any kind, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to help you solve your real estate problems!

We hope you have a safe and happy Christmas and New Year! We look forward to talking to you soon!

When you are selling your home, you want a buyer who will offer you a good price for your home.

However, there are some relatively unknown pitfalls you should be aware of with buyers.

For one, you need to make sure that the buyer is pre-qualified before they submit an offer.

This is an exciting time of year for us in Savannah as the weather warms up and our buyers and sellers enter the market. Today’s topic will actually be more focused on our buyer’s side. We have a lot of questions coming in, especially from first time home buyers. We’re going to briefly list some things that first time buyers can do to prepare to buy a home.


  Contact a Lender: You need to have an idea of what kind of home you will be able to buy so that we can narrow your search options and find you the best available home. We can refer you to a lender to start your home search. Your lender will let you know what you qualify for and how you can prepare to buy a home.
    
      Lenders can also give you an idea about what your monthly payments would be and what price point you would then fall under so you don’t waste time looking at properties that you cannot afford.
    
  
  Make a Wish List: After talking to a lender, sit down and make wish list of what you would like to see in your next home. Highlight on that list the things that are ‘must-haves’ such as a good school district or a large backyard. The more you can narrow down what you want in a home, the easier it is for us to find what you want. Keep in mind that some of these ‘must-haves’ can be added on to your property after a purchase, like a fence or a shed, for example.
  Get a Realtor: You want to make sure you’re partnering with someone that you can trust and someone that will be looking out for your best interests. There is no cost associated with having a buyer’s agent, because those costs are included in the seller’s expenses. The buyers agent will be working in your favor, and will help to find you the right home at the right price.
  Start Looking: After you have completed these steps, you can then begin to start looking for a suitable home. Your agent can search the MLS for the features that you want in your home and you can get signed up to be notified when a suitable property becomes available on the MLS. Always refer to your agent for any questions about homes you’re looking to buy.
If you’re looking to buy a home, please contact us and we would be glad to aid you in your home search. We have all the best systems in place to find you the best homes at the best available prices. We are here to serve all of your Savannah real estate needs.

Today I’ll be updating you on our real estate market here in Savannah in order to better serve you. To start, I’ll just briefly touch on 2013, where we saw prices stabilize and interest rates remain low to push buyers forward into the market.

What 2014 has Brought Us…


  Market activity has nearly doubled since this time last year.
  Interest rates are still very low, which aids both buyers and sellers.
  Home prices will continue to rise, which sellers will like to see. But buyers will probably like this too, as they will know that the home they have purchased will appreciate in value.
  Low interest will keep buyers excited about purchasing, and this in turn will help sellers to close their properties faster as interest rates are expected to rise as we head into 2015.


New Office on Wilmington Island

I am also proud to announce that we will be opening a new office on Wilmington Island that will be affiliated with Keller Williams. We will be located on Johnny Mercer Boulevard in Mercer Plaza. Feel free to drop by and say hello sometime. We are very excited about our new location and would love to help you with real estate in that area.

As always, feel free to give me a call if you need any assistance finding real estate in Savannah, or if you have any other questions you would like addressed. You can reach me at 912-658-7255 or email me at TheMcIntoshTeam@gmail.com

Welcome back. I wanted to thank you for watching our videos and submitting questions. We want to be your real estate resource and we appreciate your responses!

One question we were asked recently was about how much it costs to sell your home. Often we forget about the costs of selling. Here are a few things to keep in mind.


  Commission - If you use an agent you are responsible for paying their commission.
  Moving - Are you going to hire a professional mover?
  Home warranties - While these are negotiable, often times buyers ask sellers to provide a home warranty on the property.
  Closing - This is negotiable too, but depending on how the offer is structured, a buyer may ask the seller to contribute or pay all of the closing costs.


If you have any questions about the above costs or just about anything real estate, give me a call at 912.658.7255

When you sell your home you want as much money as possible. Sometimes we forget that to do this, there are some costs.


  Repairs and upgrades - Buyers will always have a home inspection done. If an inspector finds something wrong or broken, the buyer may require repairs before buying.
  Staging - This doesn’t necessarily mean decorating. Staging is meant to showcase the best features of your home and sometimes that means renting a piece of furniture.
  Vacancy insurance - If you move into your new home before you sell your current, you are required to purchase vacancy insurance which is different than just home owner’s insurance.
  Utilities - You want to keep the utilities on when showing your home.
2.
These are all some costs that people forget about. If you have any questions about selling your home, please give me a call today!

Welcome back! The holiday season is here and every year we get asked whether it’s best to sell during the holidays or wait until spring. You might be surprised to find out that selling during the holidays actually puts you at a huge advantage.


  There is less competition - During the winter and holiday months, fewer people put their home on the market, making your home more valuable.
  Buyers are more serious - If buyers are taking the time out of their busy holiday celebrations, you know they are ready to buy. So while you may have less showings, the ones you do have will be quality.
  You don’t have to move during the holidays - You might be thinking selling now means packing up and moving Christmas day. The truth is banks are slower and the closing process
  takes longer - about 45-60 days. That means you won’t have to move until January!
  Homes look better - Who doesn’t love holiday decorations and lights and the smell of holiday cooking? Buyers become emotional seeing your home look so perfectly.


These are four great reasons why you should consider selling your home now. If you have any questions, please give us a call at 912.272.3463

Happy Holidays!

Welcome back to our video blog. We at the McIntosh Team really appreciate all the questions you are sending to make this blog successful. Today’s question is from a FSBO (For Sale By Owner) and they wanted to know why their home isn’t selling. While I don’t know the exact details of the home, there are five elements to selling a home.


  Price - Price is the most important factor. Make sure your home is priced competitively with others comparable.
  Condition - Make sure your home shows well, not only in person but also through marketing.
  Marketing - Make sure everyone who is looking for a home, knows yours is for sale. Get on as many websites as possibles.Most buyers today start their search online.
  Location - Obviously we can’t change location, but we can make up for location through price and condition.
  Accessibility - A lot of times it’s hard to be as accessible as needed when selling a home. Sometimes buyers don’t give much notice, but it’s important to let them come.


These are five elements important to selling your home. If you have any questions about your home specifically, please give me a call. Let’s figure out what’s going on with your property.

Welcome back to my video blog! Have you ever heard of contingency offers? I get asked about these a lot.

There are different types, but the most popular occurs when a potential buyer wants to purchase a seller’s home, but the buyer must sell their property first; the sale of one home is contingent on the sale of another.

How do you handle this situation as a seller? The good news is you have some options. You can decline their offer or you can accept the offer with the contingency, but you can add a ‘kick out clause’

What’s a ‘kick out clause’? The seller tells the buyer they accept the offer, but they will continue to market their home. If the seller receives another offer they will get the first buyer a deadline to either move forward or withdraw their offer. This way as a seller you have the choice between two solid buyers.

I hope this answers questions you may have about contingencies. If you have any other questions, please give me a call. Thanks so much for watching!

How important is curb appeal when making a first impression?

Curb appeal is extremely important. Buyers often like to drive by a home so its vital that your lawn is manicured. If you have children, limit the number of toys in the area. Clean up the oil stains on the driveway.

Just as important, if not more, is how your home looks online. Did you know that 95 percent of buyers start their search online? The photographs and virtual tours are the determining factor whether a buyer wants to take the time to see your home in person.

You need good photographs and a proper staging to showcase your home in the best way possible.  Your online profile is like an open house to buyers behind their computer screen. Put your best foot forward.

If you have any questions, please give me a call at 92.272.3463. Thanks for watching!

Welcome back to our video blog! A lot of sellers ask us what they can do to get their home ready for the market.

The most important step in getting your home ready is to make it appealing to the buyers. How do you do that? Imagine your home is a model home. Go ahead and start packing; take down the personal items and remove any clutter. Your buyer should be able to picture their life in the home.

You also want your home to be in good condition. That doesn’t mean just aesthetically, but structurally and mechanically, as well. It’s important to address any repairs before the buyer looks at the home. If you leave it up to the buyer, one of two things could happen: 1) the buyer could disregard your home all together because they don’t think you have the means to fix it or 2) they will automatically reduce their offer because they think the home is worth less than the listed price.

Addressing the problems before can prevent you from losing a bid and losing money.

I hope you found this information helpful. If you have any questions or are thinking about buying, selling, or investing, please give me a call at 912.272.3463

Thanks for watching!

        <title>The Government Shutdown Effects On the Real Estate Market</title>

        <description>

The government shutdown is here. Whether it’s not being able to get a new Social Security card or visit a national park, Americans will immediately feel the effects. But there’s one bright spot of the economy that stands to be affected as well: housing.

One of the biggest questions regarding the shutdown and how it will affect housing has revolved around the mortgage market, specifically prospective buyers’ access to new home loans. After all, more than 90% of all loan activity is underwritten, insured, or owned by the government and its affiliated entities.

Initially at least, the mortgage market is likely to be only minimally impacted. New loans will continue to push through most government agency pipelines. What will change is how long the process takes, as many agencies expect to experience delays.

Mortgages purchased and securitized by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be unaffected because their operations are paid for by fees charged to lenders. And the Department of Veterans Affairs will continue to guarantee mortgages for Americans that have served in the military since these loans are funded by user fees as well.

But if the government shutdown of 1995-1996 is any indicator, the process will take longer than usual. “Loan Guaranty certificates of eligibility and certificates of reasonable value were delayed,” the VA warned in its September 25th contingency plan.

Where there has been mounting concern is the Federal Housing Administration, which currently endorses about 15% of the entire single-family mortgage market. Several media outlets recently reported that the FHA would be unable to endorse any single-family loans and that no staff would be available underwrite and approve new loans.

That prospect would be somewhat worrisome – if it were actually true. The FHA’s Office of Single Family Housing will indeed remain open for business, albeit with a smaller staff. “FHA will be able to endorse single family loans during the shutdown. A limited number of FHA staff will be available to underwrite and approve new loans,” the report now states. In other words, other lenders’ loans will continue to be insured and some in-house lending will continue to take place at a reduced rate.

The reason for that mix-up: the initial draft of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s contingency plan mistakenly stated that single-family loan operations would cease. The report was amended over the weekend.

The FHA’s single-family loan operations are funded through multi-year appropriations, meaning their budget is not tied to the government’s standoff over funding for the new fiscal year that starts in October. On the other hand, what will be more affected is the agency’s Multifamily Housing Office, which is funded through yearly appropriations.

“Because we are able to endorse loans, we don’t expect the impact on the housing market to be significant, as long as the shutdown is brief,” continues the HUD report. “If the shutdown lasts and our commitment authority runs out, we do expect that potential homeowners will be impacted, as well as home sellers and the entire housing market.”

One government lender that will indeed suspend its home loan activity, however, is the Department of Agriculture. The USDA says that no new housing loans or guarantees will be issued through its Rural Development programs in a shutdown. The department also warns that such a scenario could cause “a setback in construction start-up,” and if the shutdown lasts for an extended period, “a substantial reduction in housing available in rural areas relative to population.”

“The government doesn’t generally approve loans, they basically just insure them,” says Don Frommeyer, president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers and a vice president at Amtrust Mortgage Funding. “For the most part you aren’t going to see much of a hit in the mortgage market unless it goes for a long period of time.”

If it does stretch on, he adds, the worry will be what mortgage rates do in a market shrouded in fiscal uncertainty and how that will affect the home buying, especially in light of recent rate spikes.

Home lending aside, many economists and real estate experts are keeping a close watch on how Americans will react to this shutdown. “Administratively everything should keep moving along, but it’s more about the confidence of consumers and whether they perceive that the government shutdown could lead to a recession,” says Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.

Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi recently told the Senate Budget Committee that a partial shutdown could shave as much as 1.4 percentage points off of fourth quarter economic growth if it drags on for several weeks.

Americans’ confidence in their ability to buy and sell homes hit a record high in May, according to a Fannie Mae survey. Since then, as mortgage rates jumped more than a percentage point, that confidence level has plateaued.  If prospective homebuyers fear that the country’s economic recovery will stall, or worse slip back into recession, they will pull back on purchases, worries Yun.

“Home sales is always the first housing variable that changes so one would see sales declining and that would naturally lead to more inventory on the market and eventually put pressure on prices,” he says. But that would be a worst-case scenario based on a long-term shutdown.

Jed Kolko, chief economist at Trulia TRLA +6.43%, notes that if the shutdown lasts longer than a few days, the first places to feel the impact will be local economies with large concentrations of federal government workers. Metro areas like Washington, D.C. and Bethesda, Md., where 19% and 13% respectively of total local wages go to federal employees, would be the feel the negative effects of unpaid furloughs and with them, tightened consumer spending and weakening local economic growth. Though not all will be equally affected, other metro areas like Virginia Beach, Va., Honolulu, Hawaii, and Dayton, Ohio are areas that Kolko is keeping an eye on: “Whether there is a big effect depends on how long the shutdown lasts, how long people think the shutdown lasts, and whether people get back-pay. All those things matter for the impact.”

Still others are worrying even more about the next fiscal standoff, in  mid-October, surrounding the debt ceiling debate and its accompanying threat of debt default by the U.S.  ”With the threat of an impending partial government shutdown and yet another battle over the nation’s debt ceiling, in particular, we are really messing with fire right now—even if it doesn’t seem to bother some legislators,” says Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow.

“But the effects of a government default associated with the impending debt-ceiling deadline would be more pronounced because of its greater impact on domestic and international markets. This will rattle consumers and investors alike, slow down the overall economic recovery and further slow the housing recovery, which is already undergoing a moderation in the pace of home value gains due to rising mortgage rates,” he warns.

The government shutdown is here. Whether it’s not being able to get a new Social Security card or visit a national park, Americans will immediately feel the effects. But there’s one bright spot of the economy that stands to be affected as well: housing.

How do you choose the best real estate agent when buying or selling a home? It’s very important to interview at least 3-4 different agents. You want to find an agent that has a personality you will mesh well with. You also want an agent with experience.

Some new agents have a lot to offer, but depending on your needs, choosing a realtor with years in the field can help make the process a lot easier for you.

Hey, everyone! There has been a lot of talk about interest rates lately and how they affect our market. In the past 30-45 days, interest rates have crept up. This has created a sense of urgency for many buyers; they want to get the most house for their money.

Today, I wanted to tell you more about how increasing rates affect your monthly mortgage payment. If you borrow $200,000 from the bank at a 4 percent interest rate, your monthly payment for a 30 year fixed rate loan is $954.

If rates rise to 5 percent, that same loan will cost you $1,073 a month. And if interest rates increase to 6 percent, your payment will be $1,199. That’s a $245 difference per month.

The good news is it is still a great time to buy; buying is cheaper than renting. Buy that new home now before rates increase and you lose buying power. Give me a call at (912) 272-3463.

Hi everyone! Today I wanted to speak with you about a topic that’s come up a lot during listing appointments. Clients want to know how to sell their home in a changing market.

What I am finding is often sellers want to price their home at top value and see what happens. If the activity isn’t there, then they will just drop down the price. It’s important for sellers to know that buyers are very informed these days. They have access to countless resources especially on the Internet. Statistics show the 9 out 10 buyers actually start their search on the Internet.

Even though we are in a shifting market, buyers still want to get a good price. One thing to remember is each neighborhood will have an average price per square foot and if a home comes on that is listed higher than that, that new listed home is less desirable.

We find that the greatest chance of activity happens within 3-7 weeks. After a few months on the market, often buyers will think sellers are more motivated to sell, so they offer less. Statistics show when you price a home properly in the first place you will sell quicker and closer to your asking price. Remember, the largest determining factor on whether a home will is its price.

I hope I’ve given you some things to think about when you are getting ready to sell your home. If you want a free market analysis, get a hold of us! We would love to help you make your next real estate move!
