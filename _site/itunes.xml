        <description>

Today I’d like to illuminate some key points of the sales funnel philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of creating a strong pipeline of clients to work with.

Specifically, I want to share the approach of using “seeds, nets, and spears” to attract business. You probably realize I’m not speaking about these items in a literal sense, so allow me to elaborate. Each of these things refers to a different method for acquiring and moving business through your sales pipeline.

To begin, “seeds” are clients and opportunities that can be grown into future business. Because, obviously, you’ve got to plant something in order for it to grow. Referral business and business from your sphere of influence constitute prime examples of “seed” clients. This provides a great base for your business, but focusing solely on “seeds” can cause some major issues. It will likely be a long time before any of these clients have a real estate need, so it’s best to divide your attention between different kinds of clients.

“Focusing on all three methods is the key to creating a balanced and steady business.”

The second way of capturing business is with “nets.” Casting a “net” for your business is when you put out a wide message in order to capture and draw in as wide a range of clients as possible. The advantage of using a “net” is that you’ll likely reach people who are ready to enter the market immediately. However, using this method can be expensive, as putting out marketing materials does not come cheaply. Buying leads and sending out advertisements can quickly add up.

Finally, the last way to acquire clients for your business pipeline is with “spears.”  Sometimes gaining leads will require you to take on the role of a hunter. In other words, you’ll need to proactively search for clients active in the real estate market. Getting clients with “spears” means going to them instead of bringing them to you. Contacting sellers with expired listings and for sale by owner sellers are both examples of this strategy. However, this can be a painful approach. It can lead to a lot of rejection. But if you are confident in presenting your message, you will find success.

Overall, I tend to find that agents may be good at pursuing one of these methods but have a weak performance with the other two. Focusing on all three, though, is the key to creating a balanced and steady business.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Today I want to talk to you about business planning workshops. Recently, we launched our first in a series of upcoming business planning workshops. It was a fantastic experience.

“The session is designed to be collaborative and fun.”

10 agents from different companies got together for a three-hour session where we discussed the six key pillars of building a successful real estate business, which are:


  Lead generation
  Lead conversion
  Listing presentations
  Buying presentations
  Transaction management
  Reviews and referral systems


The level of experience in the room ranged from three months to 18 years. We all talked about the different methods for success, what I have used successfully in my business, and what they have used in theirs. It was a great collaboration on how to approach things differently in our businesses.

The session is designed to be collaborative and fun. It will give you tangible tools that work here in central Iowa to help you have a successful year. It’s so important to take time not to just work in your business, but also on your business. When you do that, we all can be better.

If this sounds like something you would be interested in, be sure to sign up for one of our upcoming events. If you have any other questions of me in the meantime, please give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <title>The True Benefits of Backup Offers</title>

        <description>

Most of the agents I’ve spoken to have expressed a common frustration: They don’t like showing clients properties that have already received offers. It can be disheartening to see how quickly opportunities can pass. 

Something other markets see often that isn’t as common in our Des Moines area is active backup offers. Today, I want to talk to you about how to make this kind of offer, as well as the benefits of doing so. 

An active backup offer is a fully executed offer that is clearly stated as being second to an offer the seller has already accepted. If, for any reason, something were to cause that first offer to fall through, the active backup offer would automatically be accepted and move forward toward closing.

This kind of offer poses a number of advantages for your client. It can help them get their foot in the door instead of having to wait around for another opportunity. 

“Backup offers are uncommon in our Des Moines market, but don’t let this discourage you from pursuing them as an option for your buyers.”

There are many reasons a deal can fall through, so it isn’t unrealistic to believe a backup offer may end up being accepted after all. Beyond that, the first buyer will have a lot less leverage during inspection situations if the seller knows there is another interested buyer waiting for the opportunity to secure the home. 

One concern I often hear about backup offers is that agents don’t want to lock their buyers into a hopeless situation. However, putting clear terms in a backup offer can alleviate this issue. You can always stipulate within the offer that your buyer can cancel at any point after a certain amount of time has passed. 

This type of offer may be a little more work for us as agents, but it will absolutely show your client that you’re on their side. If your buyer truly loves a home, then I definitely recommend considering this type of offer.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

A few days ago, we had a fantastic new agent mastermind where we collaborated with agents from different companies in the Des Moines market that had been in the business for 18 months or less. We talked about which things have been successful for them, what kind of challenges they are facing, and then we had a great question and answer session about what’s brought me success in my 18 years in real estate.

One thing that really surprised me was the number of agents who said that their brokers had discouraged them from buying any sort of internet leads, particularly from Zillow. They asked me if I bought Zillow leads and, if so, how do I work with them?

“If you’ve paid to find out that a lead is a serious buyer, don’t give up on the first try.”

We all know that agents love to hate Zillow, but the truth is that Zillow is an extremely consumer friendly tool. You need to decide if you are going to collaborate with them or work against them. I think it’s important to collaborate with a tool that consumers love. Just make sure that you know as much about it as possible so that if you do decide to play Zillow’s game, you are playing to win.

There are three important things that you need to know about working with Zillow leads.

The first is that the rules are always changing. Constantly follow how they are selling and distributing leads, because it could change. They do give notice somehow, but it’s in a very subtle way, so it’s up to you to understand how the lead flow process works and how they are showcasing your listings so that you know what’s going on.

With Zillow, if you get a lead, you’re likely not the only person who got that lead. Being quick, friendly, and effective is the key to converting that lead into something. Follow up with that Zillow lead is just as important as being quick with your initial response.

Many agents fall into the trap of getting a lead, calling them, and maybe not being the first one to call them. The person says, “No thanks! I’ve already been helped.” The agent then gives up, thinking the opportunity is gone.

The truth is that they are still not obligated to anyone. Where you’re going to shine as an agent is in following up, so check in with them. Say, “Hey, I saw another home in that neighborhood pop up on the market. Would you like that information?” or even a simple, “How is your home search going?”

Don’t just follow up with them once or twice; follow up with them again and again.

If you know that they are a real buyer and you’ve paid to get the information that they are a buyer, don’t give up on the first try. Be consistent.

The third thing you need to do really well is to leverage the effectiveness of reviews. Zillow reviews are special in that they are moderated by actual people. Looking at the reviews, they check the IP address and other information submitted to determine if it really is a genuine review. Having a good number of reviews can set you apart from other agents very quickly. The number of reviews you have also affects the algorithm for who pops up in different areas and how agent searches are sorted. Having a large number of great reviews can really set you apart.

If you have any other questions about Zillow leads or would like more tips about how to be effective as a real estate agent, just give me a call or send me an email. Let us know if you would like to attend our next Be Better Des Moines mastermind. We look forward to hearing from you!

I’d like to take a few minutes today to look back at how the market was in December 2017, and that will help us going forward as we begin the new year.

In the month of December, we had 793 new homes come on the market in the Des Moines MLS. The amazing fact is that 33% of those 793 homes sold in the month of December—that’s 262 homes that sold in December alone.

The average days on market for those homes that sold was five days on the market before they got an offer. Homes coming on the market that are priced right are selling right away, which is great news for our sellers.

“Homes coming on the market that are priced right are selling right away, which is great news for our sellers.”

As of January 1, there are 3,201 homes for sale in the Des Moines MLS. That’s down by about 185 homes from December 1 of last year, which is normal this time of year. We’ll see the inventory ramp back up as we hit the springtime.

Let’s take a look at the new construction home sales for 2017. Here are the top five home builders in our Des Moines MLS as of January 1:


  Genesis Homes. They sold 126 new homes, including pending sales, closings, and offers made in 2017.
  Greenland Homes. Greenland sold 182 homes, including condos, townhomes, and single-family homes.
  Hubbell Homes. They’ve been in the area for over 150 years, and last year, they sold 203 homes.
  Jerry’s Homes. They’ve been in the metro area for over 50 years and came out of 2017 with 207 closings and pending sales.
  Classic Builders. Located up in Ankeny, they sold 346 new homes.


These are big numbers for all these builders individually, but in terms of the entire market, we sold 2,455 new homes. That’s a great number; we’re finally starting to come back from the pre-recession levels of new home sales.

We had 262 builders build at least one house in our metro area in the past year. This is an increase of 60 homes from four years prior.

If you want to know more about the market or any real estate topic, you can always feel free to give us a call, send an email, or message us on Facebook. We’ll be back soon with more information. Until then, have a great day!

        <description>

Toward the end of the year, I always notice that many agents are scrambling to get their continuing education requirements in for their license renewal.

In the state of Iowa, agents are required to take 36 hours of continuing education every three years, with those hours due by December 31 of the year your license expires.

This education includes eight hours of law updates, four hours of ethics, and 24 hours of electives.

Real estate is a complex industry, so continuing education is extremely important. Knowing industry standards, new laws, and other information helps us, as agents, be the best professionals we can.

But let’s be honest: it can be difficult to find time for that education when you’re keeping such a busy schedule yourself.

As real estate professionals, we’ve got very unpredictable schedules. Fortunately, there is an alternative in Iowa to in-classroom learning. In Iowa, up to 24 hours of your continuing education can be done online.

“I was able to schedule my continuing education around my life, instead of scheduling my life around my continuing education.”

This is why I’ve found www.RealEstateCE.com to be an amazing resource. It’s very easy to sign up and is full of informational classes relevant to things I experience in my business. Also, it’s inexpensive.

The best part of taking classes through this website, though, is that it helped me control my time. I was able to schedule my continuing education around my life, instead of scheduling my life around my continuing education.

Additionally, there is an amazing discount available to Iowa licensees through RealEstateCE.com/a/Misty-Soldwisch that you can find here.

So if you’re busy, want to learn, and would like to save money, I definitely recommend checking it out.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
