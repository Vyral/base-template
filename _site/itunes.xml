Here are the latest numbers from our Chicago market so far in 2021.

How is our 2021 real estate market doing so far? In the single-family market in Chicago, compared to this time last year, more properties have closed, but fewer have come onto the market, making it more difficult for buyers to find the ideal house. The median sales price has increased by 8.8%. 

“Many active buyers are out in the market, but the inventory across the board has been reduced.”

In the condo market, which includes townhomes and any other attached housing, more have been listed, sold, and gone under contract compared to last year. Their median sales price has risen by 3.9%, and there are fewer properties available. In the two-bedroom, two-bath condo market specifically, prices have dropped by 2.5%. 

In the multi-unit property market, we’ve seen fewer properties listed, but more have sold. The median price for multi-units has climbed by 12.7% from this time last year. 

Many active buyers are out in the market, but the inventory across the board has been reduced. If you or anyone you know is considering making a move and needs help figuring out their situation, give us a call or shoot us an email or text. Contact us if you have any questions, as well. We’re always glad to help.

These are the top four reasons you need to stage your for-sale property.

Today, in the first installment of our two-part series about home staging, I’m sharing four reasons why staging works when selling your home:

1. Living is different from selling. The way we live in our homes is different from the way we sell houses. The way you live in your home accommodates your lifestyle, family size, and how you want the space to function. A professional stager or interior designer puts a space together to present it in its most photogenic and appealing way to buyers.

2. The right furniture. Unfortunately, you don’t have the right furniture. That’s not a criticism; most of us don’t have the appropriate furniture to stage a house to appeal to buyers in the best way. We inherit furniture, bring two families together, or buy furniture over time; most people don’t have an entire matching set. Some also have too much furniture, and a stager knows what to eliminate.

“Staging is still one of the key things we can do to prepare your house for the market.”

3. Buyers expect staging. Due to online listings, HGTV, Instagram, Pinterest, and so on, buyers have been trained to think that a staged appearance is how a property should look when it’s for sale. A very high bar has been set over the last few years for sellers that you need to match.

4. Your competition is staging. Your competition is painting, decluttering, and usually staging to prepare for sale, and you don’t want a buyer choosing their home over yours simply due to its staging.

The real estate climate has shifted, but staging is still one of the key things we can do to prepare your house for the market. Pricing correctly is the most crucial thing, but the property’s physical condition and appearance is the second-most essential aspect of a sale. We don’t see that changing anytime soon.

Stay tuned for part two of this home staging series where we’ll do a case study of a staged home! If you or anyone you know is considering making a move and would like to speak with us about what to do to prepare for a sale, please reach out via phone or email. We’re happy to help.

Here are some before-and-after pics that prove staging’s efficacy.

In today’s case study of the power of proper staging: a vintage condominium in the Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago that had been fully remodeled 13 years ago and is presently in good condition. Starting at 1:36 in the video above, you’ll see some before-and-after photos of rooms in the property—the former having been taken by the latest top-model iPhone camera, the latter having been captured by our professional photographers post-staging. It’s clear just how beneficial a professional’s use of digital image correction tools can be. 

People relate better to fully furnished properties because they have a hard time otherwise understanding how the dimensions of their possessions will square with the dimensions of the space they’re seeing online. How big is my couch? Would my lamp look good in that corner, or would it seem a little too awkward? Where would I hang artwork?

“Staging fosters that all-important leap in a buyer’s mind from ‘This is a nice place’ to ‘Wow, I can see myself living here.’”

Speaking of which, artwork has a huge psychological and emotional effect on people; if we go into a property void of decorations, the buyer’s interaction with the home would be fundamentally different. It’s not that the walls would somehow seem to be in worse condition, but rather that the artwork so greatly enhances the feel of the space. Towels and a few tiny, appropriate decorations can make bathrooms feel cozy and homey. With staged dining rooms, buyers will be able to get a baseline of many guests they’d be able to entertain and what they could then do with the space to make it reflect their tastes. 

Ultimately, we aim to facilitate that all-important leap in a buyer’s mind from “This is a nice place” to “Wow, I can see myself living here,” or, “I can imagine how my family would use these spaces.” Staging shows the buyers what it could be like to live in a property. Instead of scratching their head and wondering whether their couch will fit, buyers can truly engage with the spaces. Remember: The initial decision to buy a property is largely an emotional one; logic is used retroactively to justify the positive feelings. 

Hopefully, this case study has helped you to understand how even the most gorgeous, move-in ready properties benefit from professional staging and photography. If you have further questions on this or any other topic or are thinking about making a move soon, please feel free to reach out by phone or email. We’d love to hear from you and consult you on a wide range of options for staging your home and preparing it such that it fetches top dollar on the market.

        <title>Why Sell in the Winter?</title>

        <description>

Here are the three main reasons winter is an excellent time to sell.

Believe it or not, you may want to consider selling now instead of waiting for the spring. Though spring is the “traditional” time to sell, it’s not always the best option. Here are the three top reasons you may want to sell in the winter:

1. Less competition. There are many homeowners who wanted to sell but decided not to, their home didn’t sell so they took it off the market, or they’re debating it so they’re waiting to list. This means fewer properties competing against yours.

2. Focused and serious buyers. Buyers who didn’t need to buy likely wouldn’t be looking this time of year, so they’re motivated to purchase. Since there’s not a ton of new inventory on the market this time of year, your house will stand out more than it would in a busier market.

“Spring is the ‘traditional’ time to sell, but it’s not always the best option.”

3. Decorated homes show well. Your property is probably decorated for the holidays, and that looks appealing this time of year. What people see, smell, and feel when they walk into your home is all part of the showing process. These senses help them make a personal connection and imagine themselves living in the space. Houses often show their best this time of year.

Many people have needs or goals to move sooner than spring, but they hold themselves back because they think spring is a better time. Thankfully, you don’t have to, it’s still a great time to sell during the holidays and winter months. 

If you’d prefer to get the buying or selling process rolling or have any questions, reach out to us via phone or email. We would love to help you.

How did our market manage to stay afloat during COVID?

Our real estate market has been surprisingly strong, so today I’m going to take a deep dive behind the scenes to explain why and how the real estate market has defied gravity during COVID. One figure in particular that we’ll focus on is the unemployment rate—first, we’ll compare this year’s rate to that of the Great Recession in the last decade; next, we’ll look at unemployment rates by industry; and then we’ll look at how unemployment varied by age group. 

Feel free to follow along with our conversation in the video above or else use the timestamps below to navigate the discussion at your leisure:

0:43—Unemployment rates and the U.S. marketplace

1:15—Comparing today’s market to that of the Great Recession

3:15—Unemployment rates by industry

4:33—People who are most likely to own a home have been the least affected by COVID

6:56—Unemployment and housing by age groups

8:26—Which age group was hit the hardest?

9:40—Wrapping up the conversation

Hopefully, this data will help you understand why our market has managed to stay so strong despite all the chaos in the economy and the world at large. 

As always, if you have any questions about buying or selling homes, or would like to know more about the market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.

        <description>

Here’s how our area market performed over the last six months.

Unsurprisingly, during the time between March and September of this year, the number of home sales dropped by 8.5%. What might surprise you, however, is that prices have actually gone up by 3.2% in that same time frame. That kind of price jump would have been a marker for a very robust and strong market even over a 12-month period.

With the uncertainty that came along with COVID and the resulting shelter-in-place orders, many home sellers put the brakes on their home sales while buyers were still active in the market. That increased competition among buyers in that short period, which is what led to our price increase over the last six months.

Another major factor that we track in the residential market is the interest rates. Rates were already incredibly good in March, hovering around 3.75% at that time, and now they’ve gone down more than a full point. Rates for regular condos, townhomes, and single-family homes are hovering somewhere between 2.5% and 3%. Good rates don’t hurt, but I think the main driving force behind the demand was that people were anxious about getting into their next homes so they could shelter in place.

“Rates were already incredibly good in March, hovering at that time around 3.75%, and now they’ve gone down more than a full point.”

One point of concern that we’re keeping an eye on is the unemployment rate. Obviously, some industries have been hit much harder than others, but this number could have an impact on our market. I’ll discuss that in more detail in my next video.

        <description>

Here’s why it’s so important for sellers to be flexible when it comes to scheduling showings.

One of the most important things we talk about with our selling clients is the fact that they need to be flexible when it comes to scheduling showings. That means, when your home goes on the market, you’ll have to set your personal lifestyle aside so that you can make your home always look show-ready.

According to my business partner Laura Jones, the process is usually a bit more work than many sellers realize. Buyers have many things going on in their own lives, as do their agents, such that balancing everyone’s schedule can be difficult. Many buyers end up blocking off a limited four-hour period to go view homes. During this period, Laura can schedule showings of multiple properties in a row, which means that she has to stay right on time.

“That’s why it’s critical for sellers to be flexible with their own schedules; failure to be open could result in losing buyers.”

If a property was unavailable at the requested time (which doesn’t often happen), then the property often falls off the buyer’s radar—they often find the home they want within the first couple of days when they start viewing houses. 

It takes about four or five days for a client of Laura’s to go from being just a lead to actually getting in the car to go out for a showing. During this time, they compile and fine-tune a list of houses the buyer is interested in, and 48 hours before going to a showing, she puts together a schedule of showings for the properties that were narrowed down. That’s why it’s critical for sellers to be flexible with their own schedules; failure to be open could result in losing buyers.

Here’s what sellers should know before listing their home.

Today I’m joined once again by my friend and business partner Laura Jones so she can answer some important home seller questions and offer her best advice. Laura handles the buyer side of our team’s transactions, so she brings a unique perspective that can help you sell quickly and for top dollar if you’re putting your home on the market soon. 

First, what’s the most important thing a seller can do when preparing their home for the market? 

According to Laura, it’s pricing your property according to the market. None of her buyers get excited about the prospect of overpaying for a property they like and going through the uphill battle of negotiating. Testing the market and overpricing your home by $20,000 or $30,000 will never work to your advantage. 

What do buyers think if they assume a property is testing the market in this way?

First of all, Laura tries to find out whether the seller did some extra work to the home that’s not showing up in the photos. In general, though, buyers feel discouraged. They’re comparing the property to several others, and they’re definitely not thinking, “We’ll go ahead and offer $20,000 or $30,000 more for this home than the one down the street.”

“A buyer’s mindset is affected by their reaction to a home’s value package.”

They’re going through a comparative shopping experience and looking at multiple properties in a row, so the reality of this is fresh in their minds. They’ll pretty easily be able to make a strong comparison between Property A and Property B. If one home goes off the market, they turn their attention back to the same pool of listings, and the best ones always sell quickly. Condition, location, and price are the most important factors. 

A buyer’s mindset is affected by their reaction to a home’s value package. Does it have the same features other properties have, and is it priced reasonably for what’s included? When buyers look at homes online, they make all kinds of determinations and value judgments on sellers and their agents in terms of what they have and haven’t done to their listings. You can’t know what they’re looking at specifically; all you can know is who wants to see your home in person. 

Stay tuned for future videos where we’ll dive deeper into what goes on behind the scenes in real estate transactions. If you have questions about this topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.

        <title>“Inside the Mind of a Buyer” With Laura Jones</title>

        <description>


I’m interviewing buyer specialist Laura Jones to gauge how buyers think.

When buyers hop in the car, buckle up, and get ready to view a home on which they could potentially submit an offer, what’s going through their mind? Generally speaking, what’s their approach? As Carter Property Group Buyer Specialist Laura Jones reminds us, buyers have already narrowed down a location and a budget by that point.

Now, they’re asking these all-important questions: “What is the best thing we can get for the money? What is the best overall value? Which five things are most important to me, and which property delivers on them?”

Once they’ve figured out the geography and budget, the most common criterion for buyers is the general condition of the property—is it a fixer-upper, or is it move-in ready? Other major considerations include bedroom count, outdoor spaces, and storage areas. How a buyer then defines value beyond those common criteria becomes a highly individualized matter. 

“The most common criteria for buyers is the general condition of the property.”

In today’s environment, buyers will often claim that they’re willing to fix up a bathroom if the house is perfect otherwise or that they don’t mind putting in a little work to turn a good home into a great home. While they may genuinely mean that, Laura pointed out that buying behavior doesn’t quite reflect that sentiment: “Once we get out and look, the [property] that goes the quickest, the property that everyone seems to make offers on, is the one that’s in the best condition. One that’s been decluttered, its carpets are clean, and the one that’s likely the most updated.” 

Buyers see a home that’s in great condition as a sort of relief; they won’t have to put as much money into the home. “It might seem like a selfish answer, but buyers are looking for the best home for their budget. They’re not really thinking about who’s on the other side of the transaction and who’s selling the property,” Laura said. 

So there you have it: An inside glimpse into the mindset of the modern buyer. Remember, sellers: If you want a successful home sale, you have to think like a buyer and be willing to take a step back and view your home from their perspective. 

As always, if you have further questions on this or any other real estate topic, please feel free to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you!

Our market has slowed, but you can still buy and sell amid COVID-19.

During this pandemic, I keep getting asked the same questions: How’s the market, and am I still selling homes? When the health crisis hit, we were in a very busy market here in Chicago. We’re now a month into the shelter-in-place order, so naturally, the market has slowed. However, if you’re still considering buying, selling, or investing in real estate, please give me a call, I’d love to speak with you. Homes are still being bought and sold, even during the coronavirus. To hear my full message, watch the short video above.

Here’s how we’re still conducting business during the pandemic.

Today I’m answering a couple of questions we keep getting asked during the pandemic. First, yes, we’re still doing business. We’re using photos, virtual videos, and floorplans to view properties. If the house is vacant, I can go to the property and do FaceTime calls with clients so they can see a live tour. 

We’re taking many precautions when doing anything on-site, including wearing gloves and masks, using antiseptic wipes, limiting contact with surfaces, following social distancing guidelines, and reducing the number of people on-site. If you don’t absolutely need to see the home in person, we encourage you not to be there. We’ve used virtual technology for years in the real estate industry because it can reduce friction when doing business, but now we’ve begun using online documentation such as DocuSign. If you’re unfamiliar with it, we can provide a quick demonstration. 

“Even during the health crisis, life is still happening.”

Even during the health crisis, life is still happening. People are having life events like births, job changes, relocations, and more. Plenty of people still need to move. Though there has been a reduction in real estate transactions, we’re still seeing 30% to 35% of our regular volume.

If you have further questions, please give me a call or send an email. I would love to speak with you.

Here are the three steps you should take to buy a home during COVID-19.

This question is on many people’s minds right now: “I want to buy a home, but how can I do it during a pandemic?” I’m sharing three easy steps you can take to get this done in 2020. 

1. Get pre-approved. No matter when you’re buying, this is a crucial first step. You need to know what your budget and parameters are. Lending guidelines have changed a bit during the health crisis, so your pre-approval must be up to date. This also gives you the upper hand when submitting offers. 

“You need to know what your budget and parameters are.”

2. Virtually connect to discuss your goals. Your real estate agent needs to know the locations you’re considering, the type of property you want, and must-haves.

3.Make a list. Your agent will help you create a list of active properties that match your criteria and budget. This can be done easily; online you can view virtual and 3D tours before seeing the home in person. Then we can visit properties with social distancing and other safety measures. 

If you or anyone you know has questions about buying in 2020 or real estate in general, reach out via phone or email. We would love to help you.

        <description>

If you still need to sell your house during the pandemic, what do you need to do?

For those who still need to sell their house during COVID-19, here are the steps that you’ll need to take in order to keep your transaction on schedule:

1. Set up a virtual walk-through of the property. We can do that via Zoom, FaceTime, or similar apps to give your buyers a better sense of the space, layout, and condition of your property.

2. Schedule a follow-up appointment. This can also be done over Zoom, which would allow us to share our screen and market data with you so we can come to a decision about pricing, strategy, and marketing that we need to use, as well as any updates or tweaks that need to be done to the property.

3. Put together a plan regarding your timing. We know that the market will eventually bounce back, but we don’t know exactly when shelter-in-place orders will be lifted. My advice is to keep your plan on schedule; we can adjust the time frame a lot easier than we can get your home ready to go if we haven’t already been planning. As we learn more about the status of the situation, we’ll be able to adjust our timing as necessary.

If you have questions or need any assistance with your real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.

        <title>How Has the Shelter-in-Place Ordinance Affected Our Market?</title>

        <description>

Though the shelter-in-place ordinance has caused our market to slow down, it’s still moving forward at a decent clip.

To get a true sense of the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our market, I’ll compare year-over-year numbers from when the shelter-in-place ordinance went into effect, March 21, all the way up through April 18. 

The property categories we track for these statistics are single-family homes, attached housing (condos and townhomes), and multi-unit properties. Across the board, these properties are contracting between 31% and 36% of expected volume. That’s a pretty strong indication that demand is still there and our market can get past this. Everyone’s doing their part to flatten the curve and not put others at risk, and despite what some may think, the market’s moving forward at a decent clip. 

How are prices being affected? In the condo market, the median asking price is virtually unchanged compared to last year, although this may change as more contracts reach the closing table. There’s been some downward pressure on the single-family market, but that began before the shelter-in-place ordinance was passed. 

“Despite what some may think, the market’s moving forward at a decent clip.”

Multi-unit properties have been a hot commodity because there are less of them and they have income-generating potential, and although they’ve faced some downward pressure due to reduced demand, this market is trending at about the same rate as the others. 

If you have questions about our market or are thinking of buying or selling a home soon, please let us know. We’re open for business virtually, and we can help you accomplish all of your real estate goals while keeping you and your family safe.

        <description>

I’m excited to introduce you to my new company, Listing Ready. Here’s why I started it and why you should be excited, too.

I have an exciting announcement to share today, but first I have a question: Do you have any projects around the house that you need to do, such as bedroom painting, floor sanding, or updating countertops? If so, I can help.

About 18 months ago, I started a second company called Listing Ready that was born out of the experience of seeing clients’ properties and the list of things we needed to do to get them ready for the market. My partner Mike and I had partnered together in the past and had great success, so we decided to finally make it official with Listing Ready.

“Listing Ready is here to help make home sellers more money on their sales.”

In nearly every house, we’ve found  there are a lot of projects on nearly every house that need to be completed in order to help the home sell for top dollar. With Listing Ready, we can help you with a wide range of general contractor service, with a focus on the high-impact areas that give you the biggest bang for your buck. 

If you have a project that needs to be done around the house, even if you don’t plan on selling anytime soon, reach out and give us a call and we’d be happy to help.

If you have any other questions for me, feel free to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Our real estate market remained pretty stable in 2019. Here’s what you can expect in 2020.

I’ve got a quick market recap for you today on what we saw in the real estate world in 2019 and what we can expect in 2020.

We finished the year positively in Chicago. The median sales price was up by 1.7%, and a positive number here is always good. Another interesting stat is the total number of closed units. We’ve seen a gradual decline in the last few years, and while it hasn’t had a big impact on price yet, it could down the road.

“2019 ended as a strong, stable market.”

The other important data point we track is the inventory. We’ve seen it remain stable, but our level of inventory still technically has us in a seller’s market. As we slow down a bit, things have become a bit better for buyers, especially with the low interest rates we’ve had for the last few years.

Overall, 2019 ended as a strong, stable market. As we look forward to 2020, the data indicates that we should see more of the same. The market won’t be too strong in either direction and should remain pretty balanced. There’s no reason to hold back if the time is right for you to buy or sell a home.

If you have any other questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

What is trapped equity and why might it be holding you back? Let’s discuss.

While the amount of equity you’ve got built up in your property might contribute to your overall net worth, it doesn’t actively make you money. This is where the concept of “trapped equity” comes into play. 

In short, trapped equity is personal wealth that is tied up in an asset, like your home, and can’t be “released” unless you sell or refinance. Even if you’re using the property as a rental instead of a primary residence and are therefore generating positive cash flow, selling or refinancing are still your only means of accessing the home’s full value. 

“Trapped equity is personal wealth that is tied up in an asset, like your home.”

In short, having trapped equity in a property isn’t a bad thing, but it definitely isn’t conducive to certain goals. If you want to increase your net worth more quickly, then please reach out to us about how your property’s trapped equity might be holding you back from further growing your wealth. 

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

If your home is overpriced and you’re wondering why buyers won’t even pitch you a lowball offer, pay attention to today’s video.

Occasionally, we’ll represent a seller who, despite having difficulty finding a buyer, chooses not to make a price reduction to their home. When no buyer comes along, they wonder, “Why won’t someone just make me an offer?” 

I don’t know the exact science behind the answer to this question, but as someone who’s been in this business for a long time, I can tell you that buyers (and people, for that matter) don’t think or act that way. If your home has sat on the market for quite some time and you’ve yet to adjust its price, you can’t expect a buyer to come in with an aggressive, but lower, offer. That’s simply not how the U.S. consumer is wired. 

Plus, how would you feel if a buyer was to make an offer between 10% and 20% below your asking price? You’d probably be so offended that you wouldn’t want to work or negotiate with them at all. 

“If your home has sat on the market for quite some time and you’ve yet to adjust its price, you can’t expect a buyer to come in with an aggressive, but lower, offer.”

It’s important to understand that, as a rule, buyers won’t take a flier price on your home. They know that the more time your home spends on the market, the more likely it is that you’ll reduce your price, and when you do, that particular buyer will strike.  

We want to avoid these types of scenarios if we can help it, and a major part of that is making sure your home is well-priced and well-prepared from the very beginning. 

If you or someone you know would like help in the buying, selling, or investing process, please let us know. My team and I would be happy to help!

        <description>

As a condo owner, certain factors can make or break your home sale—factors unrelated to your actual unit.

Today I have a question for condo and townhome owners: Is your building helping or hurting you? 

When you’re selling one of these properties, you’re inextricably connected to the entire building, and certain factors can affect your prospect of finding a buyer. Take a moment to look around. What kind of first impression does the building give off from the sidewalk, lobby, etc.? Does the building contain elevators? Put another way, what do you see as you make your way to your unit? 

To buyers, the building your condo is situated in is a direct reflection of the unit itself. They’ll pass judgment on the building’s overall maintenance and whether it looks like a high level of care goes into the property. Before the buyer ever sets foot in your actual home, there’s a chance that they’ve already decided whether they’ll give it serious consideration just based on their perception of your building. Needless to say, it’s very important that the building you choose to move into doesn’t work against your future sale. 

“My advice is to be involved and do your due diligence along the way to ensure some easy wins when you go to sell your property.”

In addition to the building’s appearance, buyers will want to know how much your condo association has in cash reserves and the property’s history concerning its maintenance schedule. 

Answering these questions will only help you as a future seller. Too often, condo sellers have to overcome buyers’ objections to the building’s mismanagement or its poor condition—the effects of which put you at a disadvantage right out of the gate. 

My advice is to be involved and do your due diligence along the way to ensure some easy wins when you go to sell your property.  

If you have any questions or if you plan to sell your condo sometime in the future and you’d like some help determining what you should be spending your time and money on, please reach out to the Carter Property Group. We’d be happy to counsel you in that effort, and we look forward to hearing from you!

        <description>

Preparing your home properly is essential in having a successful home sale. Here’s why.

When we’re consulting with home sellers, one of the most common questions we hear is, “Is staging worth it? Does it really work?”

There are two things that we can do to most effectively sell properties. The first is pricing competitively. The second is preparing the property for sale. Typically, staging is directly tied to both of these components. 

If a property has too much furniture, not enough furniture, or not the right size of furniture, staging can make a significant difference. If you have oddly shaped rooms, staging can really help there, too. 

“Staging helps with small or oddly shaped rooms.”

In an ideal world, your property should be cleaned, painted, and staged. The staging is the icing on the cake of the final presentation that buyers are looking for. It’s a major factor in the home-selling process.

If you have any questions about selling a home or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Are homebuyers still eyeing fixer-uppers these days? 

The short answer is no. We live in an increasingly fast-paced world where people want what they want on demand, and real estate is no exception. Homebuyers are seeking move-in ready, hassle-free properties that they can swiftly close on. 

For years, the running joke has been that buyers are looking to have the moving truck show up at 10 a.m. sharp, so they can welcome guests to the cookout at their new home by 5 p.m. that evening. 

“Buyers of today don’t want to have to tackle a long list of upgrades after closing on a home.”

Obviously, this is meant to be hyperbole, but the fact remains: Buyers of today don’t want to have to tackle a long list of upgrades after closing on a home.  

I can’t emphasize enough how important it is for you, as a seller, to get your home in prime condition. Otherwise, buyers won’t even give it a second glance because they know they’ll have the ability to borrow more money for a home in better condition and at an exceptionally low interest rate.  

Simply put, as a seller, you want to extract the most value out of your home sale, so we need to make a concerted effort to ensure your home is in turnkey shape. For any questions related to real estate or if you or someone you know would like to make a move, please let us know today. We’d be happy to help!

Sellers often ask me when the best time to sell their home is in today’s market. The answer actually depends on one key thing: you. Ask yourself—are you ready to put in the time, money, and energy that’s necessary to prep your home for sale? In today’s competitive market, your home needs to look and feel perfect from the moment a buyer steps foot inside. So the best time to list is actually whenever your home is ready to show. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

        <description>

Sellers are often under the impression that there’s a particular time of year when they should be putting their home on the market—that time is, of course, spring.

As I’ve discussed in previous videos, the reality is that **the right time to sell your home is when it best suits your situation. **

We’ve been doing this a long time, and we’ve found that it doesn’t make sense to wait an entire year for the spring market to come back around. Unless your goals specifically line up with that time of year, here’s something to consider: Buyers populate our Chicago market and are looking to make a purchase every week and month of the year.

“Why wait a whole year when you’re unsure of what the future will bring?”

Therefore, you’re probably not doing yourself any favors by trying to sync up your home sale with a seasonal market. There’s no telling what market conditions will be like a year from now. Home prices could very well flatten out or even go down and, given that the market is always shifting, that’s a real possibility.

Shortening your time frame to a comfortable point gives us a chance to predict what the market will be doing and will lead to greater certainty in your sale. **Why wait a whole year when you’re unsure of what the future will bring? **

If you or someone you know would like an evaluation of a property or you’re thinking about making a real estate move, don’t hesitate to let us know. We look forward to speaking with you!

        <itunes:subtitle>The spring market is often viewed by home sellers as the “right” time to take action. In reality, realizing a successful home sale has less to do with the season and more to do with the time that you’re ready, willing, and able to sell.

        <description>

I’d like to take the opportunity today to give you the full rundown of how our 2018 market fared.

There are five central data points that drive real estate: home sales, home price, months’ supply of inventory, mortgage rates, and affordability. I’ll take a deep dive into these stats on the national scale.  

National home sales for 2018


  5.3 million total homes sold
  Down from 2016 and 2017
  Matched the number for 2015
  Projected to fall slightly to 5.2 million in 2019


National home prices for 2018


  Finished with a year-over-year appreciation of 5%
  Anticipated to increase in 2019
  Increase is projected to be in the 1% to 5% range


National months&rsquo; supply of inventory for 2018


  Finished with four months’ worth of inventory
  Dating back to 2013, our seller’s market has persisted due to:  
    
      Number of new construction homes remaining low
      Ever-increasing interest rates
      Homeowners staying put for longer
    
  


National mortgage rates for 2018


  Increased almost a full percentage point from early 2018 to year’s end
  Currently hovering at 4.5%
  Rates are still at historical lows


National affordability for 2018 


  Finished slightly up, as compared to 2017’s market
  Since 1970, we still sit below average affordability index


What do these numbers bear out for the future of our real estate market?

All in all, the national housing market is relatively healthy and will remain stable in 2019—homes are selling well and interest rates have stayed fairly moderate.

As for those looking to buy in 2019, we aren’t going to see homes flying off the market nor will they appreciate to an astronomical extent. If your real estate goals for this year include making a home purchase, a golden opportunity awaits you.

If you’re interested in a conversation around what your options might be in any aspect of residential real estate, please give us a call. We look forward to having that conversation with you!

Fall will be over before you know it, and with winter will come plenty of snow. This is why, if you plan on selling your home sometime between now and next spring, it’s an opportune time to take exterior photographs of it now before the white stuff comes down.

Because 92% of homebuyers see homes online first, it’s important that you have photographs that leave a good impression. If you take photos now, potential buyers will see a home bathed in autumnal colors instead of a white winter wasteland.

“We will come and take professional photos for you.”

To help you make this great first impression, we will come and take professional photos for you if you’re planning on selling this spring.

If you’d like to take advantage of this offer, have any questions, or would like some more information, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

A question we get asked almost every day in our business is, “When is the best time for me to sell my house?”

With our area being so dense, buying or selling a home can be done at basically any time of year. However, this doesn’t mean there aren’t seasonal factors at play. We live in a cold-weather market, which means our market cycle is different from those located in warmer climates.

When the weather here starts to warm up, then the market tends to heat up too. If you want to know when the best time to sell is, you’ve got to pay attention to current market statistics. Understanding market trends is the key to success in real estate.

“If you or anyone you know is thinking of selling, now is a good time to make your move.”

So far this year, we’ve seen a decrease in the number of contracts being written compared to what we saw this same time last year. Still, there has been a slight increase in inventory after a very long period of decreasing supply.

The market is set up statistically for a shift. With that information in mind, think about anyone you know who is thinking of selling in the next three to 18 months. Conditions are now slowly shifting to benefit buyer’s more, so if you or anyone you know is thinking of selling, now is a good time to make your move.

My team and I watch market statistics on a weekly basis, so we have clear evidence that this shift is on its way.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Today we’re counting down the top three mistakes that home sellers make when they put their home on the market.

3. Not saying “yes” to a showing request. You should always say yes. The buyer and the buyer’s agent have carved out time in their schedules to come and see your home. If we ask them to schedule for another day, ask to move the time, or decline altogether, we may never hear from them again. Even if we follow up and ask them to please reschedule, they will probably go out and find another home.

2. They don’t rise to the occasion and prepare the property to show in the best light possible. It’s so important that your property looks great. Make sure that you declutter, clean, and make repairs and updates. With wide-angle lenses and enhanced photographs, our first sale is online. Your home has to look amazing online, or the buyer may not come into your home to start with.

“You should always say “yes” to a showing request.”

1. They refuse to listen to market data and price the home correctly for the market conditions. You cannot afford to overprice your home. When you are getting your home ready for the market, it’s important to pay attention to market conditions and price your home accordingly.

Those are the three most important things you should keep in mind when preparing to sell your home.

If you are thinking of selling your home and would like to know what your home is worth in the current market, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

Today, I want to go over what interest rates are doing in the local market and how they impact buyers and sellers.

Since the beginning of 2018, mortgage interest rates have increased from 4.0% to 4.625% for a 30-year mortgage. That might not seem like a significant jump, and, historically speaking, a 4.625% interest rate is still very low.

Here’s the thing—that increase has an impact on a buyer’s ability to borrow money to buy real estate.

“An increase in interest rates means a decrease in buying power.”

If you are a homebuyer and you want a specific monthly mortgage payment based on your income, you’ve lost 7.2% in purchasing power. That means you have the ability to buy 7.2% less home for the same monthly payment.

As a seller, since people who are interested in buying your home have lost some purchasing power, there will be a downward effect on prices and the offers that they might be able to make.

That said, the real estate market in Chicago is still very strong. This is a fairly recent development but it is significant, so I wanted to make sure that everyone was aware of it.

It looks like rates will continue to increase over the course of 2018. If you have any questions about how rising interest rates will impact your 2018 real estate goals, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

Today I wanted to introduce you to Laura Jones, the buyer’s agent for our team here at Carter Property Group, so that you can get to know her and have some of your questions answered by her.

What’s a buyer’s agent?I focus solely on the purchase of our clients’ homes. First-time homebuyers, investors, upsizing, downsizing—I only work on the buy side of the transaction.  Any client we have has to sit down with me for a consultation. I’m able to get an idea of their needs in about 30 to 40 minutes.  Once we do that, we begin searching and going out into the field to look at homes. After that, when we’re ready, I write the contract and negotiate the terms.

So essentially, I do needs-assessment through a consultation, preview homes on the MLS, set up searches for people, take people out into the field to view homes (sometimes as many as 40 properties a week), write offers and negotiate terms once a property is selected, and eventually get it under contract. I’m able to service clients at a very high level.

What does a typical day look like for you?

I wake up in the morning, shake my son awake and take him to school, and then I get to the office. I generally block off my morning for business calls and finding properties that aren’t yet on the market for our clients. I’ll take lunch and maybe make time for a workout, and then for the rest of the afternoon and evening I’ll block out that time period to be able to go out into the field with clients.

So the MLS is only one source that you use to find properties for clients?Absolutely. Sometimes I’ll send out mailers and follow it up with a call. Sometimes the property for our clients isn’t always on the market at the time. That allows me to block a whole morning to find properties and preview them.

What’s your favorite part of your job?As a buyer’s agent, my favorite part of my job is the fact that I do get to know my clients in a really intimate way. I spend a lot of time with them and their families, I get to know personal things about them, and after the transaction, we don’t really fall off. I love checking in with them. They send me photos of remodels, updates, babies, and more. It’s just really rewarding. I don’t take it lightly that buying a home is probably the most money you’re ever going to spend.

“Helping someone get into their new home is pretty powerful. I love it.”

Helping someone get into their new home is pretty powerful. I love it.

If you have any questions about property, taxes, or anything real estate-related, give us a call. We’re always happy to help.

Today we’re coming at you with the second part of our two-part series, where we continue to answer the question “What happens when the agent becomes the buyer?” For the first part of this series, click here.

The next step in the home buying process for Paul was the home inspection phase, which always creates moments of apprehension. Going in with a 203(k) loan, Paul is borrowing a little bit more money than the purchase price of the property in order to put some money back into that property.

““We train really hard on stuff like that—how to listen, how to find out where people are, and how to ask a question to dig deeper about emotions.””

Knowing that extra money was there to handle problems created a sense of calmness, but the home’s inspection revealed three relatively big ones: asbestos, residual termite damage, and some fascia on some of the gutters, which is a complicated fix. Moving forward, we’ve uncovered a layering of information and still have some unknowns to decide on in order to proceed.

Paul jokes that he’s almost fired two people so far, but having the experience of feeling like he’s not being heard was invaluable to him because he always wants our clients to feel like they’re being heard, as do I.

What we’ve seen for a long time, and what partially explains this feeling if you’re a homebuyer, is that the further away a person involved in the transaction is from the actual transaction and the core facilitators of that transaction (i.e., the agent), the more you’re just a file to them. They don’t have the first-hand connection to your goals, your situation, and your timeline. We always keep these factors in mind when working with our clients.

“We train really hard on stuff like that—how to listen, how to find out where people are, and how to ask a question to dig deeper about emotions.”

We’ll keep you posted on the next steps of this transaction and relay some more first-hand knowledge on the subject. In the meantime, if you have any questions or are looking to buy or sell a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help.

Today we’re coming at you with a two-part series, where we answer the question “What happens when the agent becomes the buyer?” For the second part of this series, click here.

So, what exactly happens when the agent becomes the buyer?

Paul Popp, our transaction coordinator and operations manager, is purchasing a property right now, which means he’s going through all the same steps our clients go through when buying a home.

So far, Paul’s been calm where he didn’t expect to be calm and feeling different emotions in situations he thought he’d know how to handle better. Being in the same shoes as you are has helped him understand the process better.

“This experience has been invaluable to Paul as an agent.”

“It’s been unique,” he says. “It’s a constant reminder of where our clients are at different stages of the process and how those stages are being influenced, either by the other agent, the seller in this situation, the home inspector, timeliness of response—all of that stuff is really kind of communicated in a heavy, tangible way what our clients are going through.”

The amount of documentation buyers have to provide to their lenders has stood out as the most vivid part of the process for him. As easy as lenders make that exchange, he’s found that it can still be tense as far as the level of detailed knowledge they have about you. Once he finished getting pre-approved and entered negotiations, keeping his end-goal in mind helped him deal with the emotions of that situation and navigate all the hypothetical scenarios that arose.

“Continually coming back to the goal made it crystal clear what we were trying to accomplish.”

In the next part, we’ll discuss what happens during the home inspection. To watch the second video in this series, click here. In the meantime, if you have any questions or are looking to buy or sell a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help.

        <description>

Welcome to Part Two of our series on investing in short-term rentals. Joining me again is Rees , a client of ours who has recently used short-term rentals in her investing strategy.

To watch the first part in this series, click here.

In the first part of this series, Rees explained the return she received on this investment. Initially, returns were in the single digits. From a percentage standpoint, though, short-term rentals produced a 50% higher return than long-term rentals. Her family also decided to outsource the management of these properties, so they hired a company who handles the management of similar internal units, and that 50% was after that management company’s fees.

When it comes to managing the property itself, her workload has decreased because their management company, like most management companies, has a handyman on call for maintenance issues within short-term properties. Many people wonder how much time they’ll have to devote to managing residential rental property, and the answer is usually less than you think.

“Always have a good team in place when investing in short-term rentals”

Rees has two main points of advice for anyone thinking about buying an investment property. The first is to leave a little bit of a buffer from a dollar standpoint, especially with short-term rentals. This is because there is a little bit of upfront capital investment required, and issues can arise that you’ll need money set aside for.

It’s also critical to have a good team in place. Rees had a great real estate attorney and a home inspector working for her, and they advised her against buying a different property that would’ve caused her a lot of headaches.

We want to thank Rees for joining us today to help us explore the topic of short-term rentals. If you have any more questions about investing in short-term rentals, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help you.

        <description>

Today we’re coming at you with a two-part series, where we take a much deeper dive into the topic of short-term rentals. For the second part of this series, click here.

To discuss how short-term rentals can make a wise real estate investment strategy, we’ve brought in Rees, a client of ours who’s recently found success investing in short-term rentals.

Rees had a few goals in mind when she got into real estate investing. Though she wasn’t initially thrilled about the idea, after a few conversations with us, it became clear to her that it was a great option to add to the current investments she has from a diversification standpoint. She also considered it important to gain some passive income in addition to her job. On a more personal note, it was important for her to have an investment dedicated to the medical needs of her son.

“From a percentage standpoint, though, short-term rentals produced a 50% higher return than long-term rentals.”

To clarify, whereas “active income” is whatever comes from your primary occupation, “passive income” is typically the category where real estate investing falls, and that’s the way the IRS categorizes it as well.

Rees was initially looking for multi-unit properties (specifically three-unit) with long-term renters, and she was identifying them specifically based on whether they would be a good investment numbers-wise and make sense from their return perspective.

One property in particular came up that was significantly higher in return. That property had one of its three units as a short-term rental. She then realized that short-term rentals could be applied to other three-unit properties with long-term renters. Once she was able to take that idea and apply it to other properties, several more options became available.

Initially, returns were in the single digits. From a percentage standpoint, though, short-term rentals produced a 50% higher return than long-term rentals. Her family also decided to outsource the management of these properties, so they hired a company who handles the management of similar internal units, and that 50% was after that management company’s fees.

We want to thank Rees for joining us today to help us explore the topic of short-term rentals! If you’re considering investing in short term real estate, we encourage you to watch the second part of this series, where we discuss what it takes to manage an investment property, and give advice to those looking to diversify their investments with real estate.

When Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Houston, it brought with it over two feet of rain and left in its wake tens of thousands of displaced people and hundreds of thousands more without power.

“Overall, this experience has been incredibly rewarding.”

We recently had the opportunity to travel down to the Houston area with my Keller Williams colleagues to lend a hand to homeowners whose homes had flooded due to Hurricane Harvey. One home, in particular, belonged to a couple in their 90s, who needed help getting the drywall cut out, the carpet removed, and baseboards replaced.

Overall, this experience has been incredibly rewarding. We got to help a lot of families, but there are many more people who still need help. Because of this, our Keller Williams Chicago-Lincoln Park office has pledged to contribute $100,000 back to hurricane relief. We want to work together to make the biggest impact possible, so we’ll be hosting a telethon that gives us the opportunity to give back to our communities on a local and national level.

For more information on how you can give back, visit https://www.reliefnow.info/

In the meantime, if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to give us a call or shoot us an email. We’d be happy to speak with you.

        <description>

The residential rental market is being revolutionized.

Airbnb, if you haven’t heard of it, is a short-term rental service that allows landlords and tenants to connect on properties currently for rent.

The amount of money that can be generated in this way is actually much higher than what the landlord could earn from renting out a property on an eight to 12-month basis.

This is largely due to the fact that the rent can be made higher for these properties since they are short-term and are often utilized similarly to a hotel.

“The residential rental market is being revolutionized”

The nightly rental rates of a hotel over a 12-month payment would be much more expensive than a typical 12-month rent.

But not only are short-term rental landlords earning more income, they are also cutting certain costs typically associated with renting out property.

However, there are some added expectations and requirements for a short-term rental property. From a management perspective, you as the landlord must offer the property furnished. Managing bookings and turnover is also different than it would be in a month-to-month rental property.

There are now companies that specialize in the turnover process. They’ll change sheets and help turn properties around for the next resident. So, there are absolutely resources out there that can help.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Get to know the Carter Property Group. Today, we’d like to introduce you to Shannon Kelly, our listing manager.

As listing manager, Shannon gets involved in the process whenever a home seller decides they want to work with us. “I help prepare the home to go on the market,” says Shannon. Shannon lines up a professional photographer, gets all the keys necessary to access the property, and gathers background information on the home or condo.

She also puts together our online and print marketing materials and keeps everyone updated on the process until the seller gets a contract on their home.

“One of my favorite parts of the job is getting to go through the house with the photographer and making sure everything looks its best,” she says. “It’s really fun to get the look and feel of the property. I also enjoy staying on top of our online marketing presence. There are cool things going on with Facebook marketing, and online marketing changes every day, which I get excited about.”

“Shannon keeps everyone updated on the process until you get a contract on your home.”

A typical day for Shannon starts with making sure that everyone on the team has what they need. For example, a selling agent may have questions about how to access a property. She also puts together brochures and marketing materials, and sometimes she gets to go to a photo appointment or make keys for a property.

As for a few fun facts about Shannon: “I like to bike a lot. I’ve really gotten into biking recently; it’s my primary way of getting to work. I also have a dog that I probably talk too much about,” Shannon says, laughing. “Just ask anyone on the team.”

If you have any questions for Shannon or anyone else in the Carter Property Group, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

        <description>

Hello, my name is Paul Popp, and I am the transaction coordinator and operations manager for the Carter Property Group.  As a transaction coordinator and operations manager, my job involves handling the benchmarks and communication from the time a property goes under contract all the way through closing.

Between attorneys, other agents, clients, lenders, and appraisers, about six other people enter the transaction once a property goes under contract.

What this means is that I communicate with all of these people to make sure we’re on track with hitting all the dates in the contract, making sure all agreed-upon money is delivered, and to ensure the process goes smoothly overall.

“The opportunities I’ve found here remind me of the reason I got into real estate to begin with.”

Additionally, I make sure that the client is in the know all the way through the process.

After getting my license in 2005, I worked first as an individual agent before meeting Ashley in 2008.

One of the things I found most interesting about my job with the Carter Property Group is that I’ve been put in a position where I’ve done the things I am best at.

There’s a high level of customer service, communication, and organization here. The opportunities I’ve found here remind me of the reason I got into real estate to begin with.

So if you’re interested in working with us or have any other questions, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

In many cases in our market, you can actually buy a property for less money on a monthly basis than it costs to rent. It seems too good to be true, but the math checks out. Here’s why.

Even though prices have gone up steadily over the last five years, the key question is how much it costs to borrow money from a mortgage lender to buy a home. At 4% interest—the prevailing rate we see right now—the principal and interest payment for a $100,000 loan is only $477 a month. It would be just under $1,200 a month for a $250,000 loan, before taking into consideration any association fees or ‘assessments’ if you buy a condominium, as well as a county property tax bill.

“In many cases, your monthly payments to buy a house are cheaper than your rent.”

Rental rates here in the Chicagoland market have been high and increasing over the last five years. If you rent now and you’re getting sick of paying your landlord’s mortgage, you really should consider buying a home. Those low interest rates are what make buying a home so affordable right now.

If you or anyone you know wants to talk about the costs of buying a home and how it compares to renting, give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to sit down with you soon!

        <description>

There are four main statistical numbers that we track to understand what the market is doing. Today we’re looking at those numbers from March 2016 to March 2017. 

“The median days on market has gone down 16% compared to this time last year.”

1.) The first is the median increase in sales price. In the last 12 months we’ve seen a 7.6% median increase in sales price across all property types in the entire metro area.

2.) The second number, the median days on market, is decreasing. In fact, we’ve seen the median days on market go down by 16% compared to last year.

3.) The next number is the month’s supply of inventory, which is a measurement of how many months it would take to sell all the inventory currently on the market if no new properties were added, is very helpful in determining if we are in a seller’s, buyer’s, or balanced market. We’ve actually seen a decrease in the months supply of inventory of 16% in the last year and have been hovering in a firm seller’s market.  

4.) That brings me to the final number to look at, the number of properties for sale. There are more than 6,000 fewer properties for sale than this time last year, which means competition is increasing. So what does that mean for you? More competition is great news for sellers because houses are selling faster and for more money. On the buyer’s side, interest rates are still low, so you still have a good amount of purchasing power. 

If you or anyone you know is looking to buy, sell, or invest in real estate, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m happy to help and look forward to hearing from you!

If your property is out of date, you might be wondering what updates you should make before putting it on the market. In our last video, we covered improvements you can make to your surface areas to spruce up your home. Today we’re back with a few more upgrades that will make your home really stand out.

First and foremost, you want to be strategic and economical about the updates you undertake, but keep in mind that upgrades are crucial as buyers are very critical.

The areas you’ll want to focus on are the kitchen and bathrooms.

For the kitchen, you’ll want new countertops, a new sink and faucet, new hardware for the cabinets and drawers, and new appliances. You should also consider adding a backsplash or at the very least, painting. Those things will get you the most bang for your buck in your kitchen.

“The areas you’ll want to focus on are the kitchen and bathrooms.”

As far as the bathroom goes, the first thing you’ll want to look at is the condition of the flooring. Also, make sure you take a look at the area surrounding the tub and/or the shower, as well as the condition of the vanity. The good news is that vanities and sinks are generally inexpensive upgrades. Another inexpensive update to consider is adding a new light fixture as that will really make the bathroom pop.

Updates can bring some pretty significant returns and there are ways to update your home on a budget. On the other hand, if you really believe you don’t have the money to upgrade those rooms, you’ll need to be prepared to sell at a lower price.

One of the things my team and I have successfully done over the years is help navigate sellers to the best upgrades for their homes that will have the best returns. If you’re thinking about selling, we can definitely help you key in on the things that will be the most important to buyers.

If anyone you know is looking to buy, sell, or invest in real estate or you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I’m happy to help!

        <description>

We’ve got some breaking news to share with you today. The Federal Reserve has just increased their interest rates by 0.25%.

The media may lead you to believe that it will have a direct relationship to the interest rates on the open market, but that’s not the case. We saw rates creeping up toward the end of last week and throughout this week in anticipation of the announcement.

“We’re still in a strong seller’s market.”

If you’re buying or selling a home in today’s market, what does this mean for you? In Chicagoland, we have a very strong seller’s market for the most part. We’re in the heart of our spring selling season and homeowners are able to sell quickly and at or above list price. Because there are fewer properties available, buyers are competing for limited inventory. That’s driving prices up.

If you’re looking to make a move later this year or early next year, you should take a look at the market now and see if you would have a better advantage with rates where they are now. If rates continue to go up, it makes sense for you to buy now. As they increase, your buying power will decrease. We wouldn’t be shocked to see them go up two more times this year alone, so now is a good time to consider making a move.

If you have any questions for us or you are interested in buying, selling, or investing in real estate, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

What are the three areas of your home that need to be in tip-top shape before listing? It really comes down to the big surface areas.

That being said, the first thing you want to spend money on is paint. By the time you are ready to sell your home, your walls probably have accumulated some scratches. A clean coat of paint will make your property shine and you’ll see a great return on that investment.

Next, you want to focus on your floors.If you have carpet and there are signs of wear and tear, replacing it is your best option. Otherwise, make sure to give it a thorough cleaning if the carpet is still in good shape. Hardwood flooring is a favorite among buyers, so if there is damage to the hardwood floors, it might wise to have them professionally buffed and refinished.

It is very important to buyers that a home is move-in ready and all the major surface areas are taken care of, so spending the extra money to make sure the hardwood floors are in great shape will pay off.

Finally, consider investing in some new lighting fixtures. If a room or space is dark and doesn’t produce a lot of light, it will be a huge turnoff for buyers. LED lights have become a new standard in the real estate industry, both for their cost effectiveness and their ability to really brighten up a room.

“It is very important to buyers that a home is move-in ready and all the major surface areas are taken care of.”

Investing in those three things will not only give your home a fantastic, fresh feeling, but will almost always guarantee a great return. If you or anyone you know is looking to buy, sell, or invest in real estate, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help!

Today, I wanted to take a moment to compare the 2016 Chicago real estate market to that of 2015.

As we left 2016, we found that we’re in a slight seller’s market here in Chicago; homes sold at a faster pace and for more money than in 2015. That’s all good news for sellers.

On the buyer side, you’ll find that you have to be ready to make a decision once you find a property that’s the right fit. That’s because properties are selling faster than they typically would. However, there is good news for buyers. Interest rates are still incredible. Due to low rates, buyers have a lot of buying power.

“Due to low rates, buyers have a lot of buying power.”

Have you been considering getting into the real estate investment market here in Chicago? Are you already the owner of an investment property? It continues to be a really strong market for us here in Chicago. Demand for rentals keeps going up as well. In fact, we’ve seen increases for the last four years in a row. The speed at which units re-rent is very fast.

If you have any questions about the Chicago market or you’re thinking about selling your house or buying an investment property, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email with any questions at all. I’d be happy to help.
