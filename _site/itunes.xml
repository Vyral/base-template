        <description>

The closing process is the culmination of the contract—the transaction that has taken place between the buyer and the seller.

Closings typically take place at a closing attorney’s office. The closing attorney is generally chosen by the buyer’s side of the transaction.

That said, it’s important to keep in mind that the closing attorney does not represent the buyer or the seller when there is financing involved. In that case, the closing attorney actually represents the lender.

Sometimes the attorney is chosen by the seller’s side of the transaction. For example, if the seller is dealing with probate, they may choose to use the attorney they’ve already been working with to handle the closing for a smoother transaction.

If you are buying a new construction property, the builder will choose the closing attorney. Builders are very fond of their closing attorneys and will do what they can to keep their closings all in one place. It’s more convenient and it helps the builder with record keeping.

“The closing attorney represents the lender.”

The closing attorney’s job is vital to the closing process. The attorney will make sure that the title will transfer with no liens or encumbrances. They will do a very thorough title search and offer you a title insurance policy at the end of closing. I recommend that you take advantage of that policy; it protects you from anything that might not have been found in that search.

If at all possible, we do like to have all parties involved present at the signing of the contract. It’s important that we are able to answer any questions that the buyer or seller might have. It’s also important to make sure that both parties have completed all of their obligations to the contract. For example, we need to make sure that the buyer has brought their funds and are capable of closing. We also need to make sure that the seller provides the title and has completed any repairs or replacements as negotiated in the contract.

Sometimes, though, not everyone can make it to the closing table. That’s okay. We just need to know that information as soon as possible so that we can take the proper steps to close the transaction. We may need to get power of attorney or put together a mail-away package in order for that closing to transpire.

If you have any other questions about the closing process, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

Every buyer should have a home inspection done on the home they plan to purchase. However, not all inspectors are created the same. You need to know that you are dealing with a reputable inspector, so we have some tips to share today to help you do just that.

First, let’s talk about how you should go about finding a home inspector. Your best resource is going to be the real estate agent or team you are working with. They should have a short list of inspectors who they have worked with, like, and trust that they can provide you. We always give our clients at least three different names of inspectors so they can have options and figure out which is best for them.

“An inspection is necessary for every home purchase.”

The inspector you choose should be licensed, first and foremost. To be able to ask for repairs from the seller at a later date, the inspection must be done by a licensed inspector. We also recommend that you choose an inspector that has errors and omissions insurance. This is a type of insurance that covers inspectors in case there was a defect in the home that they missed during their inspection. This doesn’t happen often, but it does happen.

The inspection will be completed during the window of time after the home goes under contract called the due diligence period. If there are any specific repairs that need to be addressed, this gives you the opportunity to do that and renegotiate the deal. Oftentimes, the price can be adjusted as well. In some rare cases, you may want to eliminate the contract. You can do that.

We always recommend a home inspection for any buyer. It doesn’t make sense to skip it. If you have any questions for us or need a recommendation for a good home inspector in Savannah, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <title>Avoid These 5 Mistakes When Doing an Online Home Search</title>

        <description>

There are five mistakes homebuyers make when searching for homes online that you need to avoid.

The first is using an agent simply based on a phone call from an inquiry you may have made online or on a search site. When using a home search engine such as Zillow, Trulia, or Realtor.com, if you ask a question about a particular home or click that you’re interested in that home, you’ll receive a call from a real estate agent. Don’t make a decision based exclusively on that phone call. Interview several agents and use someone who has your best interests in mind.

The second mistake is trusting values from home valuation sites. For example, Zillow has a tool on their site called a Zestimate. If someone’s looking at values in a particular neighborhood or they want to refinance their house, they’ll type in the address of a property and get back a Zestimate. The problem is Zillow is only using other homes within a particular radius and averaging those values together to formulate that Zestimate. It doesn’t have the ability to see what has sold in that neighborhood or know certain characteristics of a home that affect its value, like if it has an updated garage. To obtain an accurate value of a home, reach out to a real estate professional.

The third mistake is shopping for a home on inaccurate sites. By “inaccurate,” I mean that sometimes the bigger real estate search engines won’t update their sites as often as real estate professionals update theirs. This leads to buyers finding a home they like on one of these sites only to find out that it’s already under contract or it sold several weeks earlier. Make sure you search for a home on a website that offers real-time information so you don’t get your heart set on something that may no longer be available.

“To obtain an accurate home value, reach out to a real estate professional.”

The fourth mistake is using online mortgage calculators to obtain a potential payment on a house. While these are great tools to get an idea on a payment for a house, you should know that these calculators are only giving you payments based on principal and interest. There are other factors to consider, such as escrow payments, that get figured into what a real payment looks like. If your home is located in a flood zone, for example, that too would be figured into the monthly payment. Always talk to your local lender to get an accurate idea of what your mortgage will look like.

The fifth and final mistake is acquiring a mortgage through an Internet lender. We encourage you to work with a local lender whenever possible because they usually use local appraisers that know our market. Out-of-town lenders or Internet lenders tend to use appraisers who are unfamiliar with our neighborhoods and values, and that can complicate the loan process significantly.

If you have any questions about shopping for homes online or you have a topic in mind you’d like us to share in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We look forward to talking with you soon.

        <title>How Much Do I Need for a Down Payment?</title>

        <guid>https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/Jason+McIntosh/+Videos/2017/June/Savannah+Real+Estate+Agent-+How+Much+Do+I+Need+for+a+Down+Payment%253F.mp4</guid>
        <description>

Many potential homeowners and renters think that they need a large amount of money in order to make a down payment on a home.

In fact, 87% of non-homeowners think that you need a minimum of 10% down, which is not always the case. There are lots of different loan programs out there. Depending on where you are looking to buy, you can get a home for 5% or 0% down.

“Speak with a local lender to figure out what your options are.”

If you are interested in buying a home, I recommend that you speak with a local lender. Local lenders know the options available in the area and generally are better at communicating than national or online lenders. Your lender will help you know which programs are available to you, and you may be surprised at how little of a down payment is required.

Since we’re talking about the lending process, I’d like to mention that now is a great time to buy a home. Overall, interest rates are still low, and our market has certainly stabilized, so there’s not as much risk from a value standpoint.

Again, talk to a local lender so that you know what your mortgage options are going forward. If you have any other questions about buying a home, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

When you’re gearing up to purchase a home, it’s important that you are represented by an agent. This agent could represent you as either a customer or a client. The agent you want is the one who will represent you as a client.

When you’re a client, the agent has your best interests at heart. They aren’t just looking at you as a number or someone they can provide a service for; they want to share their opinion, their expertise, and guide you through the process step by step.

Always make sure your agent is included in the transaction. Sometimes buyers will go look at homes without their agent and jump the gun, so to speak. They will make an offer or write a contract with the seller’s agent and totally forget about the agent working on their behalf.

“Always make sure your agent is included in the transaction.”

It’s important to know that any agent on a yard sign who is showing a home to you is actually representing the seller. They have their best interests in mind, not your own. You don’t want to hire that same person who is representing the seller. You want someone who can look out for your best interests instead.

Whether you are working with an agent now or not, I encourage you to reach out to a few different agents to interview them for the job. That’s how you’ll get the best results for your home sale.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

A multiple offer situation occurs when more than one offer has been submitted on a piece of real estate that’s for sale.

As a seller, when you have a property that has multiple offers, there are certain things you should look for. One is the type of financing. If one offer is a cash offer, that eliminates the possibility of complications that could occur with a buyer going through the mortgage loan process. You should also consider the closing date and the amount of due diligence time. All of those things play a part in the actual makeup of an offer.

“Oftentimes there are components of an offer that are actually more important to sellers than the sales price.”

As a buyer, if you find yourself competing against other offers, there are a few things you can do to make your offer stand out. Oftentimes there are components of an offer that are actually more important to sellers than the sales price.

For example, if a seller needs a quicker closing date, they might accept a lower price if an offer accommodates that. Cash offers are always very attractive as well. You ultimately want to make sure your agent communicates with the seller in order to find out what is most important to them and what key factors should be present in your offer to make it the most attractive.

If you have any questions about multiple offers or any other real estate questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!

        <description>

What happens during the home closing process and what does that mean to you as a buyer or seller?

First of all, how long does the closing process actually take? Unless a home is being purchased with cash, it takes an average of 30 to 40 days to close. If a home is being bought with cash, then the closing process may happen much faster.

Ultimately, the lender will dictate how quickly the transaction will close. It’s essential that a buyer is pre-approved before they make an offer to a seller. A pre-approval does a couple of things. First, as a buyer, it strengthens your offer. The pre-approval shows that a lender has checked your credit report, verified your employment, and looked at your bank accounts. From the seller’s perspective, accepting a pre-qualified offer gives you more security and peace of mind because the buyer is more likely to close.

“The lender dictates how long the closing process will take.”

You should also know that real estate closings are usually handled by a real estate attorney. Before a house can close, all of the terms of the agreement have to be met. What does that mean? In a purchase contract, you may have a due diligence period, a home inspection, a termite inspection, or other obligations that need to be met before you can close on the house. If there are any lender-required repairs or negotiated repairs after the inspection, those must be completed before you close on the home.

The due diligence period is basically a window of time that allows the buyer to confirm that they want to move forward with the purchase of the house. During this time, all of the terms will be negotiated before you move forward with closing.

Now, there can be delays during the closing process. For example, if the buyer incurs new debt or the appraisal comes in low, then closing will be delayed. If a lien or judgment on the title is discovered, that can also delay closing. A delay in closing must be agreed upon by the buyer and the seller before you can move forward with the closing.

        <description>

What is a counteroffer and what role does it play in a potential real estate transaction?

Typically, a counteroffer is generated by a seller when a buyer presents an offer that has some items or terms that the seller does not agree with. Items addressed by a counteroffer can include closing costs, the purchase price, the closing date, or particulars in the loan agreement, among other things.

However, the seller is not the only party that can submit a counteroffer. A buyer can submit a counteroffer back to the seller and there are no limits on how many counteroffers can be presented until both parties agree.

“Make sure all required signatures are present and the counteroffer is submitted before the expiration date.”

There are a couple ways in which a counteroffer can be rejected. If you’re a buyer, your agent will let the seller’s agent know that there are still some items you are not in agreement with. You can then submit a counteroffer back to the seller. It works the same way if you’re the seller. The other way to reject a counteroffer is to let the time on it expire.

Just like a purchase agreement or sales contract, there will be lines for everyone to sign on a counteroffer. A counteroffer has been officially accepted when all the required signatures are present. You want to make sure those signatures are present and the counteroffer is submitted before the expiration date.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!

        <title>3 Tips to Help You Get the Home You Want in a Competitive Market</title>

        <description>

Today I want to share three tips to help you get the home you want in a competitive market like ours.

The first tip is to be informed and know the marketplace. If there’s an area in town that you are interested in, there are probably a few social media sites you can join that will keep you updated on community events and neighborhood functions. This will give you a chance to meet some neighbors from that area and familiarize yourself with it. It’s also important to spend some time in the neighborhood you’re interested in. You could take a walk or drive through the area several times so you know it as well as possible.

“Getting pre-approved puts you in a much stronger position as a buyer.”

The second tip is to make sure you are pre-approved for a loan. Being able to make an offer with a pre-approval letter puts you in a much stronger position than you would be if you made an offer without one. You don’t want to make an offer to a seller and leave them hanging on whether you’re pre-approved or not. When you speak to your lender, depending on the location of the home, remember that there are several different financing options or types of loans available to you. By knowing your loan options, you can greatly reduce the amount of money you put down.

The third and final tip is to communicate to your agent all of your must-haves in your prospective home. Whether it’s a garage, a pool, or a single level, you need to let them know what you need. As Realtors, we’re constantly familiarizing ourselves with what’s on the market so we can present you with many options. Communicate what your needs are so we can be on the lookout on your behalf.

When selling a home, you might find yourself getting an offer with a contingency. Today I’ll go over what a contingency is and how to sell your home with one attached to an offer.

A contingency is when a buyer wants to buy your house, but they need to sell their home first in order to do so. As a seller, there are a couple of things you need to look out for.

If your home has been on the market for a while, an offer with a contingency could be a good option for you.However, you need to make sure you have a timeline on the contingency so it doesn’t turn out to be a long, drawn-out process.

“A contingent offer can benefit both the buyer and the seller.”

You can also add something called a “kick out” clause. That clause would allow you to keep your home active, and the original purchaser with the contingency would have a certain amount of time to decide if they want to go through with the sale before you could accept another offer. If the buyer backs out, you would give them back their earnest money and proceed with the new buyer.

A contingency can benefit both the buyer and seller as long as you have a knowledgeable agent in place who is keeping everyone informed as to what is going on throughout the process.

If you have any other questions please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help!

What’s going on in our local real estate market?

As a whole, Savannah has seen a great start to the year. Inventory is really low right now. Although interest rates fluctuated over the past 30 days or so, they are fairly stable right now.

Just 20 days ago, interest rates were in the upper 4% range (depending on what kind of loan you were getting) and now they are closer to 4%. If you are thinking of buying or selling a home, you have a great opportunity to do so right now. Interest rates are low, which is good news for buyers, and buyer demand is high, which is great news for sellers.

“Interest rates are low, which means buyer demand is high.”

Over the past couple of weeks, homes that are priced correctly and marketed well are selling very quickly. If you’re thinking of selling your home, I encourage you to get on the market sooner rather than later.

Why? As we head more into the spring, a lot more people will put their houses on the market, which will increase inventory. Right now, we have low inventory and increasing demand, which is the ideal market to sell your home in.

If you have any other questions about the current real estate market, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

Hey there, I just wanted to take a second and say thanks for joining us on our blog. I wanted to talk for a few minutes today about new construction here in Savannah. Now that the real estate market is booming once again, we are seeing more and more new construction out there, pretty much anywhere you can think of in the area.

If you’re looking at purchasing a new construction property, that’s great. However, you should know that if you aren’t represented by a Realtor, you are making yourself very vulnerable. While the builder’s agent is credible, they are still looking out for the builder’s best interest. You need a professional on your side to counteract this, and protect your best interests.

I hope this gives you a little bit of insight into new construction. If you have any questions about this or about any other topic, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. We look forward to speaking with you!

Last time, I touched briefly on the great market conditions we’ve had here in Savannah. Today, I want to follow up with some tips about this exciting spring season! If you’re considering selling, there are some things you can do to increase your chances of a successful home sale.


  Plan: There are always tons of little things that need to be done around the home. If you plan well enough, you can list your home before the market gets too busy, which will generate interest and attract buyers.
  Landscaping: This is something that needs to be addressed every season. Anything you can do to increase your curb appeal should be done!
  Stage your home: Having a professional stager come in and make your home look fantastic will give you a huge advantage in the marketplace. Staging will show buyers the space in your home to its fullest potential.
  Touch up and make little repairs: Fix stains in the carpets and dents in the wall. New construction is making a comeback in Savannah, so many of the homes you’ll be competing against will be brand new. Having your home looking the best is going to increase your chances of standing out in a crowded market.


If you have any questions about preparing your home for the market, or if you would like our assistance for any of your real estate needs, give us a call or shoot us an email. We look forward to helping you soon!

Today, I’m going to give you a quick recap of the Savannah real estate market!

The market has been incredibly active over the last few months and we’ve kept very busy. In 2014, the market continued its steady growth and price levels continued to rise as well. Since the turn of the new year, the positive signs we were seeing have only accelerated!

As you know, real estate is all about supply and demand. Homes are flying off the shelf when they’re priced well, staged well, and marketed well. As far as interest rates are concerned, most experts are predicting an increase in interest rates around May or June, which may have an affect on our market.

As it stands, we’re heading into spring with our hands full. The market is active, and we’re expecting it to get even busier as the year moves along!

If you have any questions about our market, or if you could use our help in any way, give us a call or shoot us an email at www.McIntoshRealtyTeam.com. We look forward to hearing from you soon!

With the spring selling season just around the corner, we figured it would be a good time to discuss open houses.

Are they worth it? If so, what value do they provide?

Today, we’ll answer those questions, so you can make informed decisions when selling your Savannah home.

The McIntosh Team often holds open houses, but we prefer to do them when the home is vacant. The reason we prefer showing an empty or properly staged house is because a lot of people will come through. If you have valuables or cherished family items, you put them at risk during an open house.

In most cases, you’ll only have a few Realtors watching your home. If five different people show up at the same time, you may have strangers wandering through your home, which is never a good thing. Obviously, we try to do the best we can to keep an eye on everyone, but it can be very difficult. The biggest risk of having an open house, then, is how uncontrollable it can be. While rare, it’s something to keep in mind.

On the other hand, there are many advantages to having an open house. Any exposure is good exposure when it comes to selling your home. Will their be tire kickers, neighbors, and professional lookers? Of course, but they might have friends, family, or coworkers who are looking to buy. The chance that they might spread the word about your home makes an open house completely worth it.

It’s all about weighing the risks against the rewards of having an open house. Ultimately, it comes down to your specific situation. If you have questions about whether an open house is the right move for you, give us a call or shoot us an email. We would love to help you make the decision that will benefit your home sale!

        <title>How to Avoid Being Surprised by HOA Fees When Selling Your Savannah Home </title>

Recently, we’ve received many questions from those of you who watch our videos, and we are going to do everything in our power to answer them in future videos. Today, we want to address the questions of HOA fees and how they can affect you, whether you’re buying or selling.

Not long ago, we worked with a seller who ran into HOA fees and was taken by surprise. When we first listed their home, we looked at the mortgage payoff, property taxes, real estate commission, and all the things that are usually figured in to help sellers understand what to expect on the HUD statement.

The one thing the seller was not aware of was a HOA fee in the amount of $850. He didn’t realize that he had agreed to it back when he purchased the house. Any time the title is transferred, under the agreement he made, he had to pay an $850 fee to the homeowners’ association in order to do so.

We just want this to be a warning to you, so you aren’t caught off guard when selling a home. You need to be aware of the homeowners’ association fees you agreed to years ago when you first purchased your home. It’s something you’ll want to keep in mind and think about when budgeting for your move.

On the buyer side of things, be aware that you may have to pay an initiation fee to join the homeowners’ association in your new neighborhood. They’re typically not too expensive, but you need to keep an eye out for them as well.

If you have any questions about this topic, or would like real estate assistance of any kind, don’t hesitate to give us a call or shoot us an email at any time. We would love to hear from you!

The end of the year is right around the corner, so we thought we would take this time to recap what we saw in Savannah real estate this year, as well as make our predictions for 2015.

Overall, 2014 was a fantastic year for real estate in our area. Sales rose in all but one price point, with the $250,000-$500,000 price range leading the way with a 10% increase in sales! The only price point that saw a loss in sales was the $0-$100,000 range, which saw a drop in sales of 7.4% in 2014.

As far as interest rates are concerned, we’ve been hovering just under 4% all year long, which is fantastically low. According to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Mortgage Banker Association, and the National Association of Realtors, interest rates are predicted to rise to anywhere from 4.7% to 5.4% by the fourth quarter of next year. That increase in rates may seem small, but it will make a significant difference in your mortgage payments and your ability to qualify for a loan.

Another topic worth discussing is distressed property sales. Back in 2011, 35% of sales in our market were distressed properties. As of September of 2014, we’re down to 10%! It’s great that the number of distressed properties is falling, as they adversely affect varying price points. We expect that percentage to drop even lower next year.

Foot traffic rose substantially in 2014, when compared to the same time period in 2013. We’re expecting yet another increase in 2015, which is a great indicator of how active the market is going to be. Let’s just say we’re excited for what the new year is going to bring us!

If you have any questions about market conditions, or would like real estate advice of any kind, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to help you solve your real estate problems!

We hope you have a safe and happy Christmas and New Year! We look forward to talking to you soon!

When you are selling your home, you want a buyer who will offer you a good price for your home.

However, there are some relatively unknown pitfalls you should be aware of with buyers.

For one, you need to make sure that the buyer is pre-qualified before they submit an offer.

This is an exciting time of year for us in Savannah as the weather warms up and our buyers and sellers enter the market. Today’s topic will actually be more focused on our buyer’s side. We have a lot of questions coming in, especially from first time home buyers. We’re going to briefly list some things that first time buyers can do to prepare to buy a home.


  Contact a Lender: You need to have an idea of what kind of home you will be able to buy so that we can narrow your search options and find you the best available home. We can refer you to a lender to start your home search. Your lender will let you know what you qualify for and how you can prepare to buy a home.
    
      Lenders can also give you an idea about what your monthly payments would be and what price point you would then fall under so you don’t waste time looking at properties that you cannot afford.
    
  
  Make a Wish List: After talking to a lender, sit down and make wish list of what you would like to see in your next home. Highlight on that list the things that are ‘must-haves’ such as a good school district or a large backyard. The more you can narrow down what you want in a home, the easier it is for us to find what you want. Keep in mind that some of these ‘must-haves’ can be added on to your property after a purchase, like a fence or a shed, for example.
  Get a Realtor: You want to make sure you’re partnering with someone that you can trust and someone that will be looking out for your best interests. There is no cost associated with having a buyer’s agent, because those costs are included in the seller’s expenses. The buyers agent will be working in your favor, and will help to find you the right home at the right price.
  Start Looking: After you have completed these steps, you can then begin to start looking for a suitable home. Your agent can search the MLS for the features that you want in your home and you can get signed up to be notified when a suitable property becomes available on the MLS. Always refer to your agent for any questions about homes you’re looking to buy.
If you’re looking to buy a home, please contact us and we would be glad to aid you in your home search. We have all the best systems in place to find you the best homes at the best available prices. We are here to serve all of your Savannah real estate needs.


Feel free to contact us by calling (912) 272-3463 or email us at ChristinainSavannah@gmail.com

Today I’ll be updating you on our real estate market here in Savannah in order to better serve you. To start, I’ll just briefly touch on 2013, where we saw prices stabilize and interest rates remain low to push buyers forward into the market.

What 2014 has Brought Us…


  Market activity has nearly doubled since this time last year.
  Interest rates are still very low, which aids both buyers and sellers.
  Home prices will continue to rise, which sellers will like to see. But buyers will probably like this too, as they will know that the home they have purchased will appreciate in value.
  Low interest will keep buyers excited about purchasing, and this in turn will help sellers to close their properties faster as interest rates are expected to rise as we head into 2015.


New Office on Wilmington Island

I am also proud to announce that we will be opening a new office on Wilmington Island that will be affiliated with Keller Williams. We will be located on Johnny Mercer Boulevard in Mercer Plaza. Feel free to drop by and say hello sometime. We are very excited about our new location and would love to help you with real estate in that area.

As always, feel free to give me a call if you need any assistance finding real estate in Savannah, or if you have any other questions you would like addressed. You can reach me at 912-658-7255 or email me at TheMcIntoshTeam@gmail.com

Welcome back. I wanted to thank you for watching our videos and submitting questions. We want to be your real estate resource and we appreciate your responses!

One question we were asked recently was about how much it costs to sell your home. Often we forget about the costs of selling. Here are a few things to keep in mind.


  Commission - If you use an agent you are responsible for paying their commission.
  Moving - Are you going to hire a professional mover?
  Home warranties - While these are negotiable, often times buyers ask sellers to provide a home warranty on the property.
  Closing - This is negotiable too, but depending on how the offer is structured, a buyer may ask the seller to contribute or pay all of the closing costs.


If you have any questions about the above costs or just about anything real estate, give me a call at 912.658.7255

When you sell your home you want as much money as possible. Sometimes we forget that to do this, there are some costs.


  Repairs and upgrades - Buyers will always have a home inspection done. If an inspector finds something wrong or broken, the buyer may require repairs before buying.
  Staging - This doesn’t necessarily mean decorating. Staging is meant to showcase the best features of your home and sometimes that means renting a piece of furniture.
  Vacancy insurance - If you move into your new home before you sell your current, you are required to purchase vacancy insurance which is different than just home owner’s insurance.
  Utilities - You want to keep the utilities on when showing your home.
2.
These are all some costs that people forget about. If you have any questions about selling your home, please give me a call today!

Welcome back! The holiday season is here and every year we get asked whether it’s best to sell during the holidays or wait until spring. You might be surprised to find out that selling during the holidays actually puts you at a huge advantage.


  There is less competition - During the winter and holiday months, fewer people put their home on the market, making your home more valuable.
  Buyers are more serious - If buyers are taking the time out of their busy holiday celebrations, you know they are ready to buy. So while you may have less showings, the ones you do have will be quality.
  You don’t have to move during the holidays - You might be thinking selling now means packing up and moving Christmas day. The truth is banks are slower and the closing process
  takes longer - about 45-60 days. That means you won’t have to move until January!
  Homes look better - Who doesn’t love holiday decorations and lights and the smell of holiday cooking? Buyers become emotional seeing your home look so perfectly.


These are four great reasons why you should consider selling your home now. If you have any questions, please give us a call at 912.272.3463

Happy Holidays!

Welcome back to our video blog. We at the McIntosh Team really appreciate all the questions you are sending to make this blog successful. Today’s question is from a FSBO (For Sale By Owner) and they wanted to know why their home isn’t selling. While I don’t know the exact details of the home, there are five elements to selling a home.


  Price - Price is the most important factor. Make sure your home is priced competitively with others comparable.
  Condition - Make sure your home shows well, not only in person but also through marketing.
  Marketing - Make sure everyone who is looking for a home, knows yours is for sale. Get on as many websites as possibles.Most buyers today start their search online.
  Location - Obviously we can’t change location, but we can make up for location through price and condition.
  Accessibility - A lot of times it’s hard to be as accessible as needed when selling a home. Sometimes buyers don’t give much notice, but it’s important to let them come.


These are five elements important to selling your home. If you have any questions about your home specifically, please give me a call. Let’s figure out what’s going on with your property.

Welcome back to my video blog! Have you ever heard of contingency offers? I get asked about these a lot.

There are different types, but the most popular occurs when a potential buyer wants to purchase a seller’s home, but the buyer must sell their property first; the sale of one home is contingent on the sale of another.

How do you handle this situation as a seller? The good news is you have some options. You can decline their offer or you can accept the offer with the contingency, but you can add a ‘kick out clause’

What’s a ‘kick out clause’? The seller tells the buyer they accept the offer, but they will continue to market their home. If the seller receives another offer they will get the first buyer a deadline to either move forward or withdraw their offer. This way as a seller you have the choice between two solid buyers.

I hope this answers questions you may have about contingencies. If you have any other questions, please give me a call. Thanks so much for watching!

How important is curb appeal when making a first impression?

Curb appeal is extremely important. Buyers often like to drive by a home so its vital that your lawn is manicured. If you have children, limit the number of toys in the area. Clean up the oil stains on the driveway.

Just as important, if not more, is how your home looks online. Did you know that 95 percent of buyers start their search online? The photographs and virtual tours are the determining factor whether a buyer wants to take the time to see your home in person.

You need good photographs and a proper staging to showcase your home in the best way possible.  Your online profile is like an open house to buyers behind their computer screen. Put your best foot forward.

If you have any questions, please give me a call at 92.272.3463. Thanks for watching!

Welcome back to our video blog! A lot of sellers ask us what they can do to get their home ready for the market.

The most important step in getting your home ready is to make it appealing to the buyers. How do you do that? Imagine your home is a model home. Go ahead and start packing; take down the personal items and remove any clutter. Your buyer should be able to picture their life in the home.

You also want your home to be in good condition. That doesn’t mean just aesthetically, but structurally and mechanically, as well. It’s important to address any repairs before the buyer looks at the home. If you leave it up to the buyer, one of two things could happen: 1) the buyer could disregard your home all together because they don’t think you have the means to fix it or 2) they will automatically reduce their offer because they think the home is worth less than the listed price.

Addressing the problems before can prevent you from losing a bid and losing money.

I hope you found this information helpful. If you have any questions or are thinking about buying, selling, or investing, please give me a call at 912.272.3463

Thanks for watching!

        <title>The Government Shutdown Effects On the Real Estate Market</title>

The government shutdown is here. Whether it’s not being able to get a new Social Security card or visit a national park, Americans will immediately feel the effects. But there’s one bright spot of the economy that stands to be affected as well: housing.

One of the biggest questions regarding the shutdown and how it will affect housing has revolved around the mortgage market, specifically prospective buyers’ access to new home loans. After all, more than 90% of all loan activity is underwritten, insured, or owned by the government and its affiliated entities.

Initially at least, the mortgage market is likely to be only minimally impacted. New loans will continue to push through most government agency pipelines. What will change is how long the process takes, as many agencies expect to experience delays.

Mortgages purchased and securitized by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be unaffected because their operations are paid for by fees charged to lenders. And the Department of Veterans Affairs will continue to guarantee mortgages for Americans that have served in the military since these loans are funded by user fees as well.

But if the government shutdown of 1995-1996 is any indicator, the process will take longer than usual. “Loan Guaranty certificates of eligibility and certificates of reasonable value were delayed,” the VA warned in its September 25th contingency plan.

Where there has been mounting concern is the Federal Housing Administration, which currently endorses about 15% of the entire single-family mortgage market. Several media outlets recently reported that the FHA would be unable to endorse any single-family loans and that no staff would be available underwrite and approve new loans.

That prospect would be somewhat worrisome – if it were actually true. The FHA’s Office of Single Family Housing will indeed remain open for business, albeit with a smaller staff. “FHA will be able to endorse single family loans during the shutdown. A limited number of FHA staff will be available to underwrite and approve new loans,” the report now states. In other words, other lenders’ loans will continue to be insured and some in-house lending will continue to take place at a reduced rate.

The reason for that mix-up: the initial draft of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s contingency plan mistakenly stated that single-family loan operations would cease. The report was amended over the weekend.

The FHA’s single-family loan operations are funded through multi-year appropriations, meaning their budget is not tied to the government’s standoff over funding for the new fiscal year that starts in October. On the other hand, what will be more affected is the agency’s Multifamily Housing Office, which is funded through yearly appropriations.

“Because we are able to endorse loans, we don’t expect the impact on the housing market to be significant, as long as the shutdown is brief,” continues the HUD report. “If the shutdown lasts and our commitment authority runs out, we do expect that potential homeowners will be impacted, as well as home sellers and the entire housing market.”

One government lender that will indeed suspend its home loan activity, however, is the Department of Agriculture. The USDA says that no new housing loans or guarantees will be issued through its Rural Development programs in a shutdown. The department also warns that such a scenario could cause “a setback in construction start-up,” and if the shutdown lasts for an extended period, “a substantial reduction in housing available in rural areas relative to population.”

“The government doesn’t generally approve loans, they basically just insure them,” says Don Frommeyer, president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers and a vice president at Amtrust Mortgage Funding. “For the most part you aren’t going to see much of a hit in the mortgage market unless it goes for a long period of time.”

If it does stretch on, he adds, the worry will be what mortgage rates do in a market shrouded in fiscal uncertainty and how that will affect the home buying, especially in light of recent rate spikes.

Home lending aside, many economists and real estate experts are keeping a close watch on how Americans will react to this shutdown. “Administratively everything should keep moving along, but it’s more about the confidence of consumers and whether they perceive that the government shutdown could lead to a recession,” says Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.

Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi recently told the Senate Budget Committee that a partial shutdown could shave as much as 1.4 percentage points off of fourth quarter economic growth if it drags on for several weeks.

Americans’ confidence in their ability to buy and sell homes hit a record high in May, according to a Fannie Mae survey. Since then, as mortgage rates jumped more than a percentage point, that confidence level has plateaued.  If prospective homebuyers fear that the country’s economic recovery will stall, or worse slip back into recession, they will pull back on purchases, worries Yun.

“Home sales is always the first housing variable that changes so one would see sales declining and that would naturally lead to more inventory on the market and eventually put pressure on prices,” he says. But that would be a worst-case scenario based on a long-term shutdown.

Jed Kolko, chief economist at Trulia TRLA +6.43%, notes that if the shutdown lasts longer than a few days, the first places to feel the impact will be local economies with large concentrations of federal government workers. Metro areas like Washington, D.C. and Bethesda, Md., where 19% and 13% respectively of total local wages go to federal employees, would be the feel the negative effects of unpaid furloughs and with them, tightened consumer spending and weakening local economic growth. Though not all will be equally affected, other metro areas like Virginia Beach, Va., Honolulu, Hawaii, and Dayton, Ohio are areas that Kolko is keeping an eye on: “Whether there is a big effect depends on how long the shutdown lasts, how long people think the shutdown lasts, and whether people get back-pay. All those things matter for the impact.”

Still others are worrying even more about the next fiscal standoff, in  mid-October, surrounding the debt ceiling debate and its accompanying threat of debt default by the U.S.  ”With the threat of an impending partial government shutdown and yet another battle over the nation’s debt ceiling, in particular, we are really messing with fire right now—even if it doesn’t seem to bother some legislators,” says Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow.

“But the effects of a government default associated with the impending debt-ceiling deadline would be more pronounced because of its greater impact on domestic and international markets. This will rattle consumers and investors alike, slow down the overall economic recovery and further slow the housing recovery, which is already undergoing a moderation in the pace of home value gains due to rising mortgage rates,” he warns.

Hey, everyone! There has been a lot of talk about interest rates lately and how they affect our market. In the past 30-45 days, interest rates have crept up. This has created a sense of urgency for many buyers; they want to get the most house for their money.

Today, I wanted to tell you more about how increasing rates affect your monthly mortgage payment. If you borrow $200,000 from the bank at a 4 percent interest rate, your monthly payment for a 30 year fixed rate loan is $954.

If rates rise to 5 percent, that same loan will cost you $1,073 a month. And if interest rates increase to 6 percent, your payment will be $1,199. That’s a $245 difference per month.

The good news is it is still a great time to buy; buying is cheaper than renting. Buy that new home now before rates increase and you lose buying power. Give me a call at (912) 272-3463.

Hi everyone! Today I wanted to speak with you about a topic that’s come up a lot during listing appointments. Clients want to know how to sell their home in a changing market.

What I am finding is often sellers want to price their home at top value and see what happens. If the activity isn’t there, then they will just drop down the price. It’s important for sellers to know that buyers are very informed these days. They have access to countless resources especially on the Internet. Statistics show the 9 out 10 buyers actually start their search on the Internet.

Even though we are in a shifting market, buyers still want to get a good price. One thing to remember is each neighborhood will have an average price per square foot and if a home comes on that is listed higher than that, that new listed home is less desirable.

We find that the greatest chance of activity happens within 3-7 weeks. After a few months on the market, often buyers will think sellers are more motivated to sell, so they offer less. Statistics show when you price a home properly in the first place you will sell quicker and closer to your asking price. Remember, the largest determining factor on whether a home will is its price.

I hope I’ve given you some things to think about when you are getting ready to sell your home. If you want a free market analysis, get a hold of us! We would love to help you make your next real estate move!

        <description>In a competitive market like ours, these three tips will help you get the home you want.



Today I want to share three tips to help you get the home you want in a competitive market like ours.

The first tip is to be informed and know the marketplace. If there’s an area in town that you are interested in, there are probably a few social media sites you can join that will keep you updated on community events and neighborhood functions. This will give you a chance to meet some neighbors from that area and familiarize yourself with it. It’s also important to spend some time in the neighborhood you’re interested in. You could take a walk or drive through the area several times so you know it as well as possible.

“Getting pre-approved puts you in a much stronger position as a buyer.”

The second tip is to make sure you are pre-approved for a loan. Being able to make an offer with a pre-approval letter puts you in a much stronger position than you would be if you made an offer without one. You don’t want to make an offer to a seller and leave them hanging on whether you’re pre-approved or not. When you speak to your lender, depending on the location of the home, remember that there are several different financing options or types of loans available to you. By knowing your loan options, you can greatly reduce the amount of money you put down.

The third and final tip is to communicate to your agent all of your must-haves in your prospective home. Whether it’s a garage, a pool, or a single level, you need to let them know what you need. As Realtors, we’re constantly familiarizing ourselves with what’s on the market so we can present you with many options. Communicate what your needs are so we can be on the lookout on your behalf.
