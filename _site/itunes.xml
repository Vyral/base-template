}I’ve got some really exciting news to share today. I’ve recently decided to start sharing some of my expertise with you through a real estate video blog. I wanted to make sure I included all of you.

Each month, I’ll be sending out two emails addressing trends in our local real estate market. I’ll also touch on changes in the lending world and providing you with tips to navigate this wonderful world of real estate. All of those industries are intertwined, and in order to take full advantage of the real estate market, you need to know about all of them.

Rather than simply guess what’s on your mind, I wanted to reach out to you and find out what you have specific questions about.

“What questions do you have about real estate?”

Are there concepts that confuse you? Are you curious about the market in your particular neighborhood? If you have a question, there is probably someone out there with a similar question. If you have one, reach out to me and I’ll do my best to answer the question via video so someone else who has that question can hear the answer too.

If you have any questions at all about buying or selling real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.
