        <description>

Whitney Muncey began her career with Jeff Cook Real Estate in 2017. Since that time, her life has changed in so many ways. Joining our team has not only lifted a big financial burden off her shoulders, but it has also allowed her to set her own schedule so she can be present with her family when she needs to.

Whitney is also a huge part of our training. During your first week, she will teach you how to prospect, how to manage your database, and how to present to buyers and sellers.

Her favorite thing about working on our team is getting to work with and meet so many different families.

“She will teach you how to prospect, manage your database, and present to buyers and sellers.”

If you’re considering jumping into a real estate career, there are a few different questions you’ll need to ask your prospective employer, including how they are investing in you and whether they offer any type of training. Finally, what is their culture like? Will people be there to help you become a better person and a better agent? If you’re interested in beginning the process of joining us, head on over to our website.

If you have any other questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Need ideas for something to do with a small space in your home? Try these three great, easy tips: 

1. Choosing the right paint. Using colors like neutrals, whites, creams, and grays can make a room feel larger than it really is. Pairing the right lighting and paint color is also very important; be sure to choose lighting that will enhance your colors, and avoid those bulbs and colors that cause glares.

“Be sure to choose lighting that will enhance your colors, and avoid those bulbs and colors that cause glares.”

2. Use high shelving in closets for those rarely used items. Also utilize high ceilings and walls for guitars, surfboards, or any item that can double as decoration.

3. Use furniture for storage. Don’t have a lot of floor space? Use tables and benches with hidden storage compartments. Crates, boxes, and containers that are low in depth but wide are great for under-bed storage.

If you’re looking for a new home, check out our inventory on www.JeffCookRealEstate.com, and feel free to reach out to us for any questions you have.

To have a successful holiday home sale, you need to make sure you show your home in its best possible light. Here are a few tips to help you do just that:

1. Create appealing aromas. Scents like apple pie, cookies, and cinnamon are popular, but avoid using artificial fragrances like perfumes or candles that may affect a buyer’s allergies.

2. Offer warm treats. Follow up your delightful aroma with tasty treats like freshly baked cookies. This will allow the buyer more time in the home to feel welcomed and visualize how living there could be.

“Comfort is truly the key to making a buyer feel as though they belong in your home.”

3. Make the home bright. A bright home is a sold home. Turn on the lights, open the curtains, and allow in as much natural light as possible. Amber-colored bulbs in your fixtures will also give a warm glow that’s perfect for fall and winter.

4. Play uplifting music. Silence during the winter months can come across eerily to buyers and make your home seem empty. Play soft instrumental music in the background to make the buyer feel invited, and it may even trigger a “where do I sign” mood in them.

5. Emphasize comfort. Luxurious blankets, tablecloths, and even soft pillows make a home seem a bit more inviting. Comfort is truly the key to making a buyer feel as though they belong in your home.

If you follow these tips, you’re setting yourself up for a successful sale this holiday season. With a Jeff Cook Real Estate agent, you can also ensure that you’ll find the home you’ve always dreamed of.

Until then, feel free to reach out to us for any questions you have.

        <description>

Today we’re excited to introduce one of Jeff Cook Real Estate’s amazing team members: Brad Williams.

Brad usually starts his day bright and early at 6 a.m. with a hot cup of coffee and a trip to the gym to get his energy levels up. In his words, “coffee equals contracts.”

Of course, even the most motivated individual still needs the right environment to thrive. Before coming to Jeff Cook Real Estate, Brad was working on his own. He was doing a few deals a year, sure, but he wasn’t seeing the level of success he knew he was capable of.

When he came to us in 2016, everything changed. He began producing at a much higher level almost right away. In fact, he sold over $12 million in sales volume and was named “Agent of the Year” within his first full year on our team.

Better yet, Brad was able to do all of this without having to shell out any business expenses. Not having to pay money upfront for marketing is one of the things he loves most about working with us. We offer our agents the resources, support, and financial freedom they need to succeed.

“If you’re ready to take control of your future and steer your life and career toward the success you deserve, don’t hesitate to reach out.”

And this is just a small glimpse into what sets us apart from the industry standard. Our agents are also highly knowledgeable about recent trends and statistics, meaning they’re able to help our clients earn the best possible deals as they navigate the market.

At the end of the day, Brad is living proof of what’s possible for real estate professionals who join our team. He went from selling just a handful of homes to nearly 50 a year, and his career isn’t the only area of his life that’s been transformed. He’s also now a successful real estate investor, as well.Joining us has allowed him to have the life he’s always dreamed of—living on a beautiful island, visiting Mt. Pleasant in his free time, and working at a great brokerage that makes it all possible.

With all of that said, we’ve got some great news: We’re hiring. If you’re ready to take control of your future and steer your life and career toward the success you deserve, don’t hesitate to reach out.

After all, in Brad’s words, “Joining Jeff Cook Real Estate has opened a lot of doors for me, and it can for you too.”

You can learn more about our team and the opportunity to join us by visiting www.joinjcre.com.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, please give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

With all of the holiday noise and Black Friday messages flooding your inbox, I just wanted to take this opportunity to say Happy Thanksgiving from the Jeff Cook Real Estate Team.

I know that I personally am so grateful for my amazing family: My incredible wife, Sarah, my two children, Ava and Jason, and our dog, Johnny.

I’d also like to give you a challenge. It’s very easy to get caught up in everything going on during the hustle and bustle around this time of year, but I’d like you to pick one person you know and one person you don’t know and lift their spirits this Thanksgiving.

“We are better together when we love and encourage one another.”

Not everybody is as fortunate as we are to have a great holiday season, so it’s important to make sure everybody knows that they’re appreciated.

At Jeff Cook Real Estate, this is our mission. This means that my job as the team leader is to empower my team so that we can empower the whole community. We are truly better together when we love one another and encourage each other.

Again, I just wanted to say Happy Thanksgiving to all of you. Enjoy your time with your friends and family and don’t eat too much turkey!

In real estate, the sky’s the limit. You can make however much you like in this career, so long as you’re willing to put the time and energy into earning it.

        <description>

When potential homebuyers are looking to be approved for a home loan, there are a few questions and concerns I often receive.

“What about my credit score? My money saved? My down payment? Will I even be able to afford the monthly payment?”

How do these factors affect your chances of approval? Today, you’ll find your answers. You will typically need:


  Employment by the same company for at least two years
  $4,000 to $6,000 in savings
  A credit score of at least 620


Let’s say you can only check off the first two boxes. There’s no need to worry, as banks can often provide you with a conditional loan approval. With this, you’ll have time over the following months to work with your banker, raise your credit score, and eventually be issued your home loan.

“A mixture of down payments, monthly payments, credit scores, and time employed influences how much of each factor is needed for home loan approval.”

We have partners at Tabor Mortgage who are more than happy to tailor a plan for your personal financial situation. They’ll put you on track toward homeownership—determining how large your home could be, what you can afford, what your down payments and interest will be, and ensuring you receive a safe, fixed-rate mortgage. You will find out exactly what you can afford.

Do you have extra money saved to go toward a down payment? This is a compensating factor, which may mean you can lower the requirement of a two-year concurrent employment.

These scenarios create many different outcomes—a mixture of down payments, monthly payments, credit scores, and time employed influences how much of each factor is needed for home loan approval.

There’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but if you have two out of three, there are definitely options for getting approved. If you have any questions or need more information, feel free to contact me through phone or email. I look forward to helping you.

        <description>

Today we’d like to share the amazing success story of one of our team members: Julia Umoren.

Before coming to Jeff Cook Real Estate in March of 2018, Julia was working in one of the largest hair replacement centers in Atlanta. According to her, this transition has transformed her life and career for the better.

In fact, the move to a successful career in real estate has propelled her toward personal real estate success, as well. Julia is about to purchase her own home, all thanks to her hard work with our team.

There have been day-to-day changes for Julia, too—like the fact that she now has more time with her family.

“With our top-quality training and a culture that is second-to-none, Jeff Cook Real Estate makes the transition into real estate seamless and simple for first-time agents.”

Also, while Julia says those entering a real estate career should have savings built up to draw on while they adjust to their new path, she also says that Jeff Cook Real Estate is one of the best places for new agents to dive into the industry.

With our top-quality training and a culture that is second-to-none, Jeff Cook Real Estate makes the transition into real estate seamless and simple for first-time agents.

Even in just the few months Julia has been with us so far, she has already sold three homes and has two more currently under contract.

Getting to know the families she works with and helping them find the perfect home is what Julia says is her favorite part of being an agent.

So if you, too, are looking to help families find homes, while working in a family atmosphere yourself, visit www.joinjcre.com.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Sometimes, homeowners may fail to notice the parts of their property that are outdated or in need of repair. It’s easy to overlook issues in one’s own home. However, when it comes time to list, homeowners should realize that the buyers they’re bringing in will certainly notice these flaws.

Thankfully, there are a few ways you can boost your home’s value before you sell, and today I’ll be sharing four of the most effective:

1. Update the bathroom. Changing out hardware like towel racks or the knobs on cabinets can be an inexpensive way to give your bathroom a facelift. Or, if money permits, upgrading your tile can be even more beneficial.

“Even before stepping foot in your home, buyers will judge what they expect to find inside by how your property looks on the outside.”

2. Update your home’s lighting. Good lighting can instantly make rooms appear larger and more welcoming. So before you list, take some time to assess the lighting fixtures throughout your home. Replace any burnt out bulbs, and, if necessary, swap out a few fixtures for newer, more luminous ones. Speaking of lighting, mounted lighting strips beneath cabinets can be a great addition. Buyers love this simple feature.

3. Repaint as needed. Giving the home a fresh coat of paint will make it appear bright and clean. Even just the smell of fresh paint can help leave buyers with a positive impression of your home. However, make sure you stick to light, neutral colors, and that you also update your trim.

4. Fix up the home’s landscaping and curb appeal. Even before stepping foot in your home, buyers will judge what they expect to find inside by how your property looks on the outside. A freshly mowed yard, well-trimmed landscaping, and the addition of darkly colored mulch will all go a long way in boosting your home’s curb appeal.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

David Carter joined our real estate team in October 2016. Since then, he has found great success and he joined us recently to tell us how.

 

We have an amazing real estate team that’s been in business for 15 years. Whether you already have a real estate license or not, I’d like to talk to you today about our team and why we’ve been so successful.

We help our real estate agents become successful by providing the systems, marketing, leads, processes, presentations, and operations that they need.

If you’re interested in learning in how you could have a six-figure income and truly get paid for the amount of effort and work that you put in, then you need to learn just a little bit more about this opportunity. Instead of listening to what I have to say, listen to what a very successful agent on our team has to say.

David Carter started with us in October 2016 after working at an hourly job where he was spending 80 to 90 hours of his week. He was tired of the grind and needed to have more time to spend with his family, so he joined our team.

“David has found both personal and professional success with our team.”

Now, David sets his own schedule, makes the most use of his time, and is excited about the opportunity for growth he has on the Jeff Cook Team. In his first full year, he sold 17 houses. This year, his goal is to double that to 34.

His advice for anybody who is looking around at different agencies and trying to decide which one to join? The biggest thing you need to look for is culture. Do you like the people that you’re going to be working with? You also want to make sure that whoever is in charge of the company is invested in your success.

David’s decision to join us was a big leap of faith for him. Looking back, he can say that it was a fantastic decision and he’s really glad he made it.

If you have any questions for me about our team or want to learn more about how we can help you take your career to the next level, visit us at our website today.

        <title>3 Reasons Why You Should Stage Your Home</title>

        <description>

Today we are going to talk about the three reasons staging your home is one of the keys to getting it sold quickly and for top dollar.

1. A staged home helps you have better listing photos. The very first showing is not whenever potential buyers come into your home to look around, but instead when they look online. By having your home staged with furniture, it allows us to showcase your home better online so that buyers are more likely to come and look at it.

2. A staged home helps buyers know how they would live in the space. Buyers want to see how they would live in your home. However, they sometimes have a very tough time trying to imagine where to put their own TV and bed. By having your home staged, it allows buyers to easily see where they may be able to put their own things, which helps sell your home faster.

“Buyers want to see how they would live in your home.”

3. A staged home helps you stand out from the competition. When a home is photographed while vacant, small issues like worn carpet and nicks in the wall will be more apparent. A well-staged listing is far more likely to earn top dollar than one that has been left bare.

I encourage you to get your home staged. We have a wonderful vendor list for this that includes Miss Shannon Hawkins of Refresh Your Nest. You can visit her website here to learn more.

If you have any additional questions about staging or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to contact me by phone or email. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

        <description>

If you’re curious about how we went from 100 to 200 to 500 to 1,000 home sales per year in just a few short years, I’m here today to tell you how.

Over the past 15 years, we’ve used a precise, very simple system to grow our business to over 100 agents and an average of 97 transactions per month, allowing us to serve over 1,000 families per year.

Because so many people have been asking how we’ve done it, we are inviting you to be part of “Inside JCRE” to see what being on this team actually looks like.

“We want to give everyone the opportunity to learn what we’ve learned.”

This event will allow you to learn the ins and outs of my company. You’ll hear from team members, vendors, and myself about how we became one of the top real estate teams in the entire country.

We’ll also have a number of breakout sessions, ranging in topic from lead generation to lead conversion, ISA management, recruiting agents, marketing tactics, investing, expansion, and so much more.

We aim to give everyone the opportunity to learn what we’ve learned in the real estate business to empower real estate agents all over the country to be able to take their vision for their company and make it a reality.

The “Inside JCRE” event may just be the change that you’re looking for. For more information, visit insidejcre.com. If you have any other questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

We’ve got an amazing real estate team that’s been in business for 15 years, and now our team has an opportunity for you. Whether you’re already a licensed agent or not, I’d like to talk to you about what joining our team could do for your life and career.

We help our real estate agents be successful by providing marketing, leads, processes, presentations, back-end support staff, and more. So if you’re interested in getting paid what you deserve for your efforts and skills, and earning a six-figure income as a result, you’re going to want to hear more about what we’ve got to offer. But don’t take my word for it. Instead, listen to what Christopher Schiffiano (one of the amazing agents on our team) has to say.

“Before I came to Jeff Cook Real Estate, I was in the United States Army. After my term was up there, I went into real estate in the Florida market. When I decided to come home, where I was born and bred, Charleston, South Carolina, I joined the Jeff Cook Real Estate team.”

“Here at Jeff Cook Real Estate, we have many ways to get you to your success.”

“In my first year of real estate, I sold 18 homes. My second year, I sold 20, and my goal continues to grow from that point. Working for Jeff Cook Real Estate over the years has changed my life in such a way where I can set personal goals and achieve them. A lot of times people get into real estate and they don’t have a way of making goals because they’re too worried about getting their first deal, trying to find an office to work for. With Jeff Cook Real Estate, from day one, you start your success path.”

“My favorite part of working with Jeff Cook Real Estate is the comradery and the family environment. There is not a day that goes by that you can’t walk into an office and see someone and they ask you about how all your kids are doing or how school is. There is definitely a family environment and I definitely challenge you to compare this aspect to other big-box offices.”

“People always say you have to spend money to make money, with Jeff Cook Real Estate, a lot of that pressure is taken off of you. There are times I’ve worked for other agencies where you had to generate your own business; you had to generate your own work. Being with Jeff, we are able to come in here and automatically start making money.”

“Here at Jeff Cook Real Estate, we have many ways to get you to your success.”

Now that you’ve had a look at Christopher’s success story, I encourage you to visit www.JoinJCRE.com to learn more about this opportunity and set up an appointment.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, please reach out. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

How do you know when it is time to move? Maybe you feel like your family is constantly elbowing for more room. Or, maybe your life recently changed. You could even be looking for a fresh start. Whatever the reason may be, I am here today to provide you with the four main reasons why people decide that it is the best time to move. 1. Space. If your kids have moved out and you are tired of cleaning a big house, now may be the time for you to downsize. Size may be an issue for new families or families with kids who require more space. In this case, it may be time to upgrade. We have a specialized trade program that gives our upsizing and downsizing clients the ability to transition out of their existing home and move into a new one. 2. Commuting. Maybe you are spending too much time in your car commuting across town and would rather spend that time enjoying the back porch of your new home.

“Knowing if and when it is time to move can be confusing.” 3. School district. You may want your kids in a different school district and you now have the ability to put them into a better school district to get a better education. 4. Financial situation. Your financial situation may change because of winning the lottery. Or, you may have the opposite issue. Either way, we have an immediate buyout program where we have the ability to purchase your existing home from you no matter what your circumstance. Knowing if and when you should move is confusing. We have the ability to sit down with you and do a free consultation to determine if now is the perfect time for you to move. We can tell you exactly what you could get for your existing home, how much you will have left over, and what available options there are for you to transition seamlessly. If you would like to speak with us more about this, please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

        <description>

The home selling process can be an emotional nightmare. We know this. Therefore, we’ve prepared a comprehensive strategy on how to help you navigate the twists and turns of selling a property.

1. Take time to choose the right agent. You’ll want to make sure that you choose an agent who you feel comfortable with, one who has a proven track record of selling lots of homes. We market for buyers all over the country who are relocating to our area. When you put your home on the market, we take those buyers and bring them to your house, marrying them into the perfect real estate transaction. That sounds simple, but most real estate agents will put your home on a whole bunch of websites to market it, meaning that they list your home before they find buyers. Before you even call us, we already have our buyer list put together so that when you do list, we’ll have buyers in mind already, allowing you to sell your home fast and for top dollar.

“A pre-inspection is a way of showing your buyers that your home has a clean bill of health.”2. Get a pre-inspection. A pre-inspection is a way of showing your buyers that your home has a clean bill of health. Since a buyer will request an inspection anyway, getting one done before you list means you can preemptively make any repairs or upgrades. When they see your home in such good condition, they’ll feel more comfortable moving forward with the purchase of your home without having to do extra research and time-wasting activities. 

3. Keep in constant communication with your agent. With us, we’ll have a conversation with you every Friday to update you on how the process is going, how we’re marketing your home, what activity is upcoming, and what’s happened so far. That way, you’re in the loop and you can enjoy the process of selling your home.

If you’re interested in selling your home, we would love to talk with you and interview for the job, explaining our comprehensive process. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to us—it is our goal to eliminate your stress during your real estate transition.

        <description>

Long-distance house hunting has a lot of similarities with long-distance relationships. It may seem scary at first, but it can be very rewarding in the end. Today I’d like to share a few tips on how you can purchase your forever home, even if you’re still living out of town.

1. Do your homework. You need to figure out what you’re looking for in a home. Things like price range and amenities are important, but the top factor you must determine is location, location, location. Our team would be happy to help you determine what kind of home you can afford, and then locate relevant properties based on the list of your top 10 wants and needs.

2. Find an experienced agent. It’s critically important for you to have professionals working on your behalf throughout the process. Jeff Cook Real Estate is more than qualified to meet this need.

3. Have a travel budget. Sure, we can Facetime or Skype you to bring you on virtual tours of homes, but chances are that you’ll want to check out your dream home in person. We can go ahead and write a contract before you arrive and make it contingent upon you viewing the home, or contingent upon you getting a home inspection. This ensures that you are protected and can back out of the deal if need be.

“Using these tips will set you apart from the average homebuyer.”

Using these tips will set you apart from the average homebuyer. They will help you find the best home, achieve an easy process, and stay protected throughout the transaction.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want to know how my team and I can help you pursue your real estate goals, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

For our latest testimonial, we’re joined by Susie Shultz. Here’s her story.

Susie has been with us since October 2014, when she moved here from Tennessee. She has a real estate marketing and property management background and has been working in that field for the last 12 years. Since joining us, she’s been able to triple her income.

“Coming from a mediocre career which I was satisfied with, I had no idea the opportunity I could have in real estate,” Susie says. “I have five children, and to be able to provide for them in a way that I’ve never been able to before has been amazing. It’s been completely life-changing for me.”

In her first full year, she sold 25 homes and ended up being named our Rookie of the Year.

“I just did what Jeff told me to do, and it worked for me.”

“I just did what Jeff told me to do, and it worked for me. When I came to Jeff Cook, they surrounded me and encouraged me constantly. I look forward every single day to coming to my office and being around these people, who are so encouraging and uplifting and supportive. That’s absolutely my favorite thing about my company.”

If you’re interviewing with another company, Susie suggests asking them what type of training they provide and how often. What type of lead system do they have? How can they help you grow your business? Also, ask what type of culture they have. When you walk into the office, do you feel like you’re with an encouraging and supportive team?

“I think that you’ll find a lot of these things here at our company, which has empowered me to just grow my business and become more successful. If you’re looking into getting into the real estate business or changing companies, I encourage you to look into Jeffcookrealestate.com. Check it out. See what we have to offer. For me, it was life-changing, and I bet it would be for you as well.”

If you’d like to learn more about the Jeff Cook Real Estate Team or you’re interested in joining us, feel free to explore our website or reach out to us by phone or email. I’d be happy to speak with you.

Moving can be a stressful process for you and your family, so here are some things to keep in mind and tips to follow to make your move as seamless as possible.

First, who’s going to help you move? Will you call in a few favors from some family and friends or call a professional moving company? If you’d rather use a professional moving company, we recommend Move Buddies. They do a wonderful job, and I even used them for my own move. You can get in touch with them by visiting www.movebuddies.com or calling them directly at (843) 972-9039.

Second, you need to prepare for the big day. Oftentimes, moving companies can come by and estimate how many boxes it will take to haul your stuff, and they can also bring their own boxes ahead of time so you can start packing. Sometimes, they’ll even help you pack those boxes, depending on what level of service you request from them. In any case, make sure you have plenty of boxes.

Keep in mind that what you have in a guest bedroom in your old house might not necessarily go in a guest bedroom in your new house. Floor plans vary and can change how you may organize that new room. The best thing you can do in this case is label everything ahead of time and specify where it’s going in the new house. This way, you won’t have people constantly asking you “Where does this go?” on moving day.

Organizing the move on the day of the move is another important task. Consider where the moving truck is going to go—are there parking spaces available or a driveway that will be cleared for it? What needs to happen to get that moving truck as close to the front door as possible?

Once the moving starts, it goes fast, but unloading the truck takes a lot longer than loading it. Make sure you have plenty of drinks and snacks on hand so when your moving crew comes over, they can focus on the task at hand.

If you have any more questions about how to make your move seamless or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.

“Save yourself some time by labeling everything ahead of time and specifying where it will go in the new house.”

        <description>

Today I want to let you in on how to maximize what you earn for your home sale while minimizing your expenses. There are three key ways to sell your home quickly and for top dollar.

Use online marketing. With the power of the internet, your first showing is actually what buyers see online. Times have changed a little bit in this regard. My team and I can help you navigate through this marketing process. We feature your home across over a thousand websites to gain the maximum exposure for your home.

Look at comparable homes. Examining home listings that are similar to yours can help you determine your own sale price. However, be careful with the figures you look at. Home values have been rapidly increasing lately. A $300,000 home is worth around $10,000 to $20,000 more now than it was a year ago. When you look at comparable homes that sold in the past six to 12 months, you have to factor in the 5% or 6% appreciation rate we’ve seen over that time. My team can help you with this. Not only can we look at what’s sold in the past, we can also predict how quickly inventory will move in various neighborhoods.

“A little bit of money will go a long way in improving your home.”

Make key home improvements. There are a few very simple, relatively inexpensive home improvements you can make to help maximize your sale. Did you know that, during showings, 80% of buyers make up their mind about whether they want to go into a home before they even exit their vehicle? This decision comes from the quality of your curb appeal, but also from the opinion they formed based on your online listing. A little bit of money will go a long way in improving your home. Make sure your home is clean and free of clutter both inside and out.

If you have any other questions or would like more information feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

We have an amazing real estate team. We’ve been in business for 15 years. Whether you already have a license or not, I’d like to talk to you. We help our real estate agents be successful by providing the marketing, leads, systems, processes, presentation, and operation staff you need.

Instead of just listening to me, here’s what Whitney Muncey has to say:

I started working with Jeff Cook Real Estate at the end of February in 2016. I had no real estate experience prior to working here. I did a few different things. I worked at a domestic violence and sexual assault shelter, coached JV basketball, and ultimately ended up teaching second grade.

Working at Jeff Cook Real Estate has changed my life in so many ways. My financial freedom has certainly changed from being a teacher and doing the things I used to do. I have a little bit more room there that ultimately makes me happier and makes everyone happier.

The other thing that working at Jeff Cook Real Estate has done is made me realize my why. If you don’t know what your why is, stop whatever you are doing and figure that out. Until you do that, you’re not living. So many of us go through life and it’s the one thing we really only get one shot at. We find our comfort zone and sail along. If you do that, you cut yourself short from so many things, so many experiences, and education.

With Jeff Cook Real Estate, I was able to figure out what my why was. Once I dug that up, it was my motivation to push forward to financial freedom and it gave me the ability to push myself to find out what I can do. Jeff Cook Real Estate changed my life in many ways.It can certainly change yours as well.

If you’re looking to get into real estate, there are a few things I would suggest before you start that venture.

The first and most important is that you want to be happy with where you are. Culture is a huge thing. In real estate, you deal with a ton of different people with different personalities. You have to work with people who have fun, and you need a support system. That’s what I got here at Jeff Cook Real Estate.

Equally important to culture is that during the process of our 60-hour or 30-hour class for real estate, people from different agencies and brokerages are going to tell you, ‘Come work with me, we’re amazing. We’ll make you $1 million right out of the gate.’ However, there is no commitment from them to you. They all say, ‘Show me what you’ve got. You’ll spend a lot of money and a lot of time away from your family. Six months from now, if that doesn’t work out, I’m sorry.’ And that’s all there is to it.

When Jeff came in, he had an entirely different story. He talked about the systems we have here at Jeff Cook Real Estate and confirmed that he is investing in me prior to my having to prove myself. To have someone who doesn’t know you invest a lot of time, money, and effort in you before you prove yourself means a lot and it really stood out to me.** That was my decision-maker.** If this man is willing to take something that he’s worked so hard to achieve and invest in me, then I can’t go wrong.

I would like to thank Whitney for taking the time to share her experience today. If you have any questions about joining our real estate team, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

“Jeff Cook Real Estate changed my life in many ways.”

Are you ready to buy a home but don’t know exactly where to start? We can help. Here are the top five steps you need to know in order to buy your forever dream home:

1. Check your credit score. It’s not so much that you need to have a score over 650 in order to get approved. If you have a credit score closer to 650 or 700, you can get a better interest rate than you would with a 600 score. Knowing your credit score can help you determine exactly what your down payment situation looks like.

2. Don’t open new lines of credit. You don’t want to let anyone else pull your credit while you’re going through this process. We worked with a family once that got pre-approved, had an amazing home search, and found the perfect house. Then they went out and bought new furniture and a new car on credit. Opening those new lines of credit dropped their credit score significantly, which meant they couldn’t get financing on the house. They had a truck full of new furniture and no home to put it in.

Luckily, we were able to work our magic and get it done. I’m just telling you that you don’t want to open new lines of credit or have other people pull your credit score. Don’t make any large purchases while you go through the process because it could count against your debt-to-income ratio.

3. Find a really good mortgage lender. Don’t worry, we have one for you: Tabor Mortgage Group. You can call them at 843-408-0856 or Google them. You can find everything you want to know about them online. We would be happy to pair you up with someone over there to help you with step four.

4. Get pre-approved before you start your home search. Getting pre-approved will help you find out exactly how much the bank will lend you based on your specific financial information. They will look at your income, expenses, and credit score. They can help you figure out how much of a down payment you’ll need, what your monthly mortgage payment will be, and what kind of interest rate you will have. Getting pre-approved ahead of time is important so that you don’t waste your times looking at homes above or below your price range.

5. Start your home search with us. We will help you find your forever dream home. We have a free program where we will walk you through each of the steps of finding your perfect home. We will make sure that the title is clear and that the home is everything you thought and hoped it would be.

If you are ready to start your home search or have any other real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

“Don’t make large purchases during the home buying process.”

        <description>

Today I’m going to share the top three things you need to do to prepare your home for sale in 2018. Let’s jump right in.

1. Have a consultation with one of our listing specialists. They will come over and meet you at your home, walk through a little bit of the process, and give you an estimate of what you can sell your home for and what your profit will be. They can also help you determine what the next steps are. We provide this to you for free.

2. Begin preparing the home for sale. You don’t have to do it all now or all in one weekend, but start putting away things that you don’t need. Start decluttering, cleaning, and double checking your light bulbs, your yard, and every other detail of your home.

“Our professional photographer is one of the most important members on our team.”

3. Have a professional photographer. That’s one of the most important members on our team. We give all of our clients a free certificate for a free photography shoot whenever they are ready. We can then take those pictures to all of our relocation buyers and they can use it as a tool to determine whether or not they want to come and see your home. You bring the house, we’ll bring the marketing and photography, and we’ll marry it for an absolutely perfect real estate transaction.

I would love and be honored to help you with the sale of your home. If you have any questions for me or need my help in any way, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

We have an amazing real estate team that’s been in business for 15 years. Whether you have a license or not, I’d like to talk to you about a career with our team.

We help our agents succeed by providing the marketing, the leads, the systems, the processes, and the presentations that they need, along with the operation staff.

If you are interested in learning how to get a six-figure income and get paid for the amount of effort you put in, reach out to me to learn more about this opportunity.

Don’t just take it from me—here’s the story of one of our agents:

“I’m Stan Taylor, and I started working for Jeff Cook Real Estate in January of 2016. Before I started with Jeff Cook Real Estate, I worked for a small business downtown that helped all the attorneys here in Charleston with document management. I did that for about 15 years.“Jeff Cook Real Estate has changed my life in significant ways, from income to flexibility at work to freeing up time to be with family and friends. I’ve also learned quite a bit about leadership and how to grow a business. It’s been amazing and I’ve loved every minute of it.

“Jeff Cook Real Estate has significantly changed my life.”

“It’s a very intense industry and very demanding, but it’s also extremely rewarding and worth every bit of hard work. Culture is huge, and the culture here is second to none. I cannot express how important it is to love going to work every day, going to an office where everyone wants to help and be supportive.

“Since day one, I’ve felt like I’m being groomed for leadership. This company devotes a lot of energy, effort, and time to all of the staff so they can be the best at what they do and pass that on to the next person.

“In my first year, I sold 15 homes. In my second year, I sold just under 30 homes. This year, I am set to sell 40 and 50 homes.”

        <description>

Today I’m excited to talk to you about our exclusive immediate home buyout program. Here’s how it works.

We can either help you sell your home traditionally, or we can show it to our investors who can give you an immediate cash offer. Let’s say that you have time on your side and you want to get the most money as possible for your home sale. Listing it traditionally through our team would probably be the best idea. The only drawback here is that your home’s condition has to be great and you have to go through the entire transaction process.

“We can help you sell traditionally, or through a cash offer.”

However, if you don’t want to deal with all that stuff, we can get you a cash offer from our investors. If you like it, you can take it. If you don’t, we will just proceed with the traditional home sale.

If you’re thinking of selling your home any time in the near future, we’d love to get to work for you. If you’re interested in learning more about how we can help you get your home sold, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

In 2017, the Jeff Cook Cares Program was able to do some amazing things that I want to share with you today. I also want to tell you about our plans for 2018.

In 2017, we were able to donate $100,000 back to the community thanks to your support of our real estate company. 1% of our revenue is donated; we call it the 1% For Good. This 1% goes directly to the Jeff Cook Cares Program, which goes out and services all the people in the community.

Here are a few things we did in 2017: 


  Helped rescue 257 dogs from the Charleston Animal Society and paid for their adoption fees.
  Sent people on mission trips. 
  Supported Little League teams. 
  Got yearbooks for high schools.
  Supported high school baseball teams


We then finished off the year by donating $10,000 to the Shawn Jenkins MUSC Children’s hospital.

“We have some great plans to give back to the community in 2018.”

How does this affect you?

Whenever you refer our real estate company or purchase a home with us, 1% of our revenue gets donated back to the community. Thanks to your business and referrals, you helped the Jeff Cook Cares Program donate around $105,000 back to our community. Thank you so much for your help, love, and support.

We have a few great plans on how to give back in 2018, including down payments for veterans and teachers as well as teaming up with State Housing Heroes, Habitat for Humanity, and the Charleston Animal Society.

We really want to focus on helping kids and children—that’s where our heart is in this. So, we are calling out to Little League teams, high school football and baseball teams, and more. If we are able to support you, we would be happy to donate to you and your cause.

You can send an email directly to sponsorships@jeffcookrealestate.com. The committee will meet and decide if we are able to help you out.

Again, we wouldn’t be able to do this without your referrals and your business. If you have any questions about real estate, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

Purchasing a home is a big investment. Finding the right home takes a lot of time, energy, and money, so it’s important to know what you’re really getting into before you make the decision to buy.

Today, I’d like to talk about some things you should consider when buying a home.

“It’s important to know what you’re really getting into before you make the decision to buy.”


  The neighborhood. Considering where you’ll be living and who you’ll be living near should be a big factor in whether you decide to buy a certain home. When you’re looking at a property, ask yourself if the neighborhood is a good fit for you and your family. Also, consider any upcoming life changes. You should also keep in mind whether a neighborhood will continue to be a good fit for you as you move into the future.
  The commute. How long will it take you to get to work, school, or other important places you frequent from the new home you’re considering? You may think you want to live super close to the beach or the downtown area, but you need to be careful with such a big decision. Think about this: You likely commute to work far more often than you do to the beach. So, is it better to live closer to the beach or to your place of work? Living 10 minutes away from the beach might not be everything you dreamed of if it means you’re 40 minutes away from work each morning.
  Do your research. Before settling on a home, there are a number of questions you should ask. Is the property within a homeowners association? If it is, what’s covered? Will you be required to get flood insurance? What additional costs will be associated with the property? My team and I can help you answer these questions and others. The important thing is that you know exactly what you’re getting into. 
  The equity swing. Is this going to be the best investment possible for the amount of money you’re putting in? My team and I can help you maximize your investment. We would love to help you find the perfect home.


If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

I’ve just received the most recent statistics hot of of the press for the Greenville real estate market, and I want to share them with you today.

Before I get there, I want to let you know that on the corner of Orchard Park in Haywood we’ve just opened a real estate office to service the entire area. We’re very excited about it. Our experienced agents are on standby  to help you in selling, buying, or answering your questions.

What’s going on in the Greenville market? Well, it is booming. People ask us why we opened up an additional office from Charleston into Greenville. We have access to an amazing relocation network that moves buyers into the Southeast. A lot of people are coming from Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, and even Florida into the Greenville area, which is why we’re now servicing the area. That said, we’re in need of homes for sale. If you’re interested in selling your home, we have a pool of buyers who may want to purchase your home.

“The Greenville market is booming.”

We’ve had almost 17,000 homes on the market in the past year, and around 12,000 of those have sold. This leaves about 5,000 unsold homes left in the market. This is why it’s important to work with an agent who’s got your best interest in mind. We have a great marketing campaign going here, including billboards, radio advertising, and more. It doesn’t matter what price range your home falls in; we have buyers available in all ranges. 

How much have values increased? So far, the average sales price is $223,116, which is a 6.9% increase from the year before—around a $15,000 jump. 

You may not know what your house may be worth, but it could be more than you’d think. We can tell you exactly what your neighbor’s homes are selling for, what your home is worth, and what a buyer would be willing to pay for your home. 

Believe it or not, you may not have to do a ton of work to it in order to sell your home, so give us a call before you spend thousands on renovation. If you have questions about this or are wanting to sell your home, you can reach us by responding to this email, by phone, or by email. We can’t wait to hear from you.

        <description>

I’ve got some very interesting statistics about the Columbia real estate market that are hot off the press! 

Before I get to those, I wanted to share with you that I’ve partnered with Kris Ancone to launch Jeff Cook Real Estate to serve the entire Midlands area. Our office is at 602 East Main Street in Lexington, South Carolina. We’d love for you to stop by.

So how’s the Columbia real estate market doing? So far this year, Columbia has had 16,035 homes enter the market via the MLS. Of those, 12,000 have sold, which means that 25% did not, even though the market is getting better.

This is why it’s important to work with an agent who’s got your best interest in mind. We have a great marketing campaign going here, including billboards, radio advertising, as well as a vast relocation network of people moving into the Midlands. This is why we’re servicing the area now; our network is pushing a lot of people into the Midlands area.

“We expect real estate to continue to be a sound investment in 2018.”

How long on average will it take for your house to sell? Coming out of the holidays, it will take on average between two and three months to find the perfect buyer, relocate them, and get them into your home. 

Here’s the interesting part: we’ve already started working with a lot of relocation buyers that have already started the process, so if you need to get out in, say, 30 days or so, we have the ability to help you with that too. If time is of the essence, we’re the people to call.

Last but not least, how much have homes appreciated in the last year? Average sales prices went from about $188,000 to $191,000, so homes have increased by about $3,000 on average. We expect that to continue to increase this year as well, and for real estate to continue to be a sound investment.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reply to this email or give us a call. We’d love to chat with you.

        <description>

Today, I just wanted to share some interesting statistics hot off the press. I just got the year-to-date stats for up until the end of November.

What an absolutely phenomenal year in real estate it has been. The biggest challenge that we have is the amount of inventory for sale in the market. On that note, if you’re thinking of selling your home, please reach out to us because we do have buyers in all price ranges available and interested in purchasing homes.

Year to date, we had over 22,000 homes enter the market, which is a bump of about 5% over last year. During that same time, we’ve had a bump of over 1,000 properties, up to about 17,000 properties come on the market and sell. This means over 5,000 properties still didn’t sell. That said, it’s important to know that you have an agent who’s on your side helping you price it properly—one who has the buyers and will help you market and negotiate it properly.

“What an absolutely phenomenal year in real estate it has been.”

How long does it take for an average home to sell? The average home takes about 60 days to sell. Something I’m very proud of is that my team and I are able to sell a home, on average, in about 32 days. You’ll sell a little bit faster with us because we spend extra money on marketing and really trying to put your home out there. Not to mention we’re already hunting buyers before you ever call us. We have a database of buyers available before you pick up the phone and call us.

Last but not least, how much have prices gone up? It depends on whether you’re in the first-time homebuyer range or you own a luxury home. On average, prices this year have gone up about 4% to 5%. If you have a $250,000 or $300,000 home, your house values increased somewhere around $10,000 or $15,000 this past year, which is great news.

If you want to know what your home specifically is worth, feel free to reach out to us for no cost and no obligation. We would be happy to walk with you through that analysis.

        <description>

Today I’m going to share the top four features that buyers are really searching for in their new dream homes. If you’re thinking of selling your home, you may want to take special note of this so that you can see how your home stacks up in regard to what buyers are looking for in the home.

First, did you know that buyers make up 90% of their mind about whether or not they like your home before they ever get out of the car? This means that they already know about the price and about the size of the home, but when they pull up and see your home for the first time, they want to know if they can envision themselves pulling up to this home on a daily basis and hanging outside with their families. 

Since that’s the case, you need to make sure that the outside is awesome; make sure the pressure washing is done (including the driveway), the landscaping is neatly pruned, and that there is straw or mulch in the plant beds across the board. Do whatever it takes to make the curb appeal look amazing.

Second, is the home family-friendly? How is the floor plan arranged—do you have an extra, unused bedroom that you could envision being used as a bedroom by another family? Is the backyard neat and clean? The backyard should show as wonderfully as the inside of the home.

“Buyers base 90% of their decision to buy your home based on curb appeal before they ever step foot inside.”

Third, does your home need any updates? Are the air conditioner filters clean? Do all your light fixtures work properly? Are there odors present? Essentially, ask yourself if there’s anything you can do to give the interior a little facelift to make it look and feel neat and clean. We’d be happy to come over and give you a free evaluation to determine if there’s something that you need to do in order to get it show-ready.

Last but not least, consider your asking price. Set the price to maximize the return on your investment, but not at such a range that buyers won’t even come look at the home. We see that when sellers price outside of the acceptable range, they eventually have to lower their price over time, ultimately causing them to end up at the bottom of that range. 

Pricing is one of our areas of expertise. We’ll come over and discuss exactly what your home could sell for in today’s market so that you can maximize the value of your home and avoid lowball offers.

If you’re thinking of selling your home, we’ll be happy to give you a free evaluation. Simply call or email us and we’ll help you with any questions you have. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Everyone knows how stressful moving can be, but I have a few quick tidbits to share with you that will help your move go off without a hitch. I just moved myself, so I speak from experience.

First, separate all of your stuff into three piles: things you will keep and move with you, things you will give away or sell, and things you’ll throw away. I know it’s hard to put any stuff into that last pile, but if you’ve moved multiple times, it might be a good idea to consider what really has to come with you. 

“Declutter your home before you put your house on the market.”

Second, declutter your home before you put your house on the market. Whenever we show a house, it looks amazing if it’s decluttered. Clear anything that can be packed up into boxes and store it in the garage, in a closet, or somewhere else. 

Third, use clear storage bins. This will save you the time of having to look through each box for what’s inside after the move is over. 

Fourth, label everything with blue painter’s tape. This is a tip my wife and I used. We labeled everything with blue painter’s tape and wrote down where it was supposed to go in the new house. This will keep you from having to double-move all your boxes after your movers or helpers have already left. 

If you’d like a free estimate of what your move will cost, reply to this email and I’ll put you in touch with Move Buddies, a local moving company that we partner with. They can also provide boxes and a moving truck and take care of everything in just one day if you decide to use them. 

If you need any more moving tips or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in the Charleston market, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be glad to help you.

        <title>3 Reasons to Sell Your Charleston Home This Fall</title>

        <description>

Many people get discouraged when they think about selling their home in the fall or winter season. There are actually three really compelling reasons why fall may be the best time to sell your property. 

Maybe you’re thinking, “Thanksgiving and Christmas are coming up. I just don’t want to think about putting my house on the market.” 

If that’s the case, I can tell you that all of your neighbors who plan on selling their homes are thinking the exact same thing. They will wait until spring and summer to do so. 

If you put your home on the market in the fall or winter, there will be fewer homes on the market for yours to compete against. 

Buyers also tend to be more motivated during the fall and winter. Some life circumstance has caused them to have to buy a home now, so those are two important things to consider: less competition and more motivated buyers. 

“There is a lot of pent-up buyer demand this fall.”

Finally, there is no better time to take listing photos of your home than the fall. Your home will look amazing. We’ll put those photos online and do what we do best—market your home, bring buyers to you, and get top dollar for your property.  

This year, there is another reason to list your home on the market during fall or winter. 

We’ve had several storms coming up the east coast which, combined with a number of other factors, have caused the real estate market to be a little slower the second half of the year.  People have been waiting for the storms to pass or for school to start up again before entering the market. 

As a result, there is a lot of pent-up demand. 

These buyers are working with us in real time to find the perfect home, which is just another reason to put your home on the market, sell quickly, and get your asking price this fall or winter.

If you have any other questions about selling your home, just give me a call or send me an email. My team and I would be happy to help you!

What’s the latest outlook on our fall market here in Charleston?

There have been a lot of discussions out there about the real estate market stalling, and it’s true that there are some factors that have caused the market to temporarily slow down here in our area.

First off, any time a storm hits any part of the southeast, it causes an economic slowdown all across the area. This year, for the first time in a long time (maybe ever), there were two large-named Category 4 storms that hit the southeast. That, the current political uncertainty, kids going back to school, and the fourth quarter in general have all contributed to this temporary slowdown.

Now, let’s look at the raw statistics and how they’ve changed since this time last year.

The number of new listings decreased by 11.2%, and the number of pending sales were also down. Inventory shrank by 17%, so not only did we have over 11% fewer homes come on the market, but an additional 6% of sellers took their homes off the market during this time.

“Even though the media says the real estate market is stalling, you can still get top dollar for your property.”

The problem with these numbers is new buyers that are coming into the market are having a hard time finding that perfect home.

Continuing with the statistics, home prices rose 5% year over year, and the median sales price is $256,000. The average days on market shrank to 53 days, and the supply of homes also shrank 20%.

Because home prices are up, the average days on market is down, and the supply of homes is low, even though the market has slowed down slightly, now may be an amazing opportunity to put your house on the market. If you put your home on the market, it’s priced effectively, and we put a world-class marketing system behind it, it will sell at a record pace and you’ll be able to get top dollar for it.

All real estate markets are different, but because of the job growth and industry growth in our area, our market is still on fire.

If you’re interested in putting your home on the market, you want to buy a home, or you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you.

Are you considering renting your home out? If so, I want you to think about the benefits of working with a property manager. 

To help me cover the subject, I’m joined today by special guest Jessica Lewis. Jessica is from our sister company, RentHolyCity.com, which has a team of specialists to market your home. These specialists will bring in a high volume of potential tenants to your property. 

Once they’ve done so, they then aggressively screen potential tenants to make sure they are fit to rent. Not only do they perform a credit check, they also verify employment and income, criminal history, and residential history. 

Additionally, Rent Holy City’s specialists will get in touch with any potential tenants’ previous landlords, to make sure that they were responsible with rent and were generally good tenants.

“Whether you’re a homeowner renting out or a tenant searching for somewhere to live, Rent Holy City is a great resource.”

So, how does the accounting side of things work? If you choose to work with Rent Holy City, you will have access to their experienced accounting team and easy-to-use online portals. The online portals allow tenants to pay their rent digitally, and also allows Rent Holy City to pay you, the property’s owner, each month. 

Truly, Rent Holy City makes property management hassle-free for the owner. They have many great systems in place which can be tailored to meet your needs. Rent Holy City can even help owners who are operating from afar. If you have relocated, they will be happy to perform property checkups for you. 

Not only are Rent Holy City’s services extremely helpful, they are also very affordable. Investing in their services typically costs homeowners just 8.5% of collected rent. Many other companies out there will charge 10% or more for similar services. 

Rent Holy City also deals with rent-to-own homes. Whether you’re a homeowner renting out or a tenant searching for somewhere to live, Rent Holy City is a great resource.

Whether you are buying a home, selling a home, or happy where you are, here are a few clever things you can do to make sure that your home is protected and secure:

First, go around and inspect the locks on your doors. Over time, locks can deteriorate, especially if it’s a door that you don’t use very often. Make sure that they are all functioning properly. 

You can also install safety lighting around the exterior of the house. Motion-activated floodlights are sure to scare off any bad people lingering outside. 

Be aware of what you showcase in your home. If you are selling your home, make sure that you don’t have any valuables or personal items out in the frame of the pictures. Even when you have guests over to your home, you don’t want to leave anything out that would entice someone to break into your home. 

I also recommend that you take account of all your spare keys. If you’ve gone out of town and given a friend or neighbor the spare key, make sure you get it back so it’s not just laying around their house. It may also be helpful to change your locks every once in awhile.

“Be very careful about posting to social media when you’re out of town.”

When you go out of town on vacation, do you post on Facebook that you’re going away? If someone is interested in getting into your home and they know that you’re going to be out of town for a week, that’s when they’ll break in. You have to be very careful about your social media posts. Whenever I go out of town, I wait until I’m home to post any photos or anything about my vacation on social media. 

Finally, our partner CPI Security offers free alarms to all of our clients, family, and friends. If you are interested, simply reach out to alarm@jeffcookrealestate.com. Doug will reach out to you to discuss the different programs that are available to you. You can even monitor your home on your phone. There is a monthly monitoring fee, but the alarm and the system itself is completely free. 

If you have any other questions about protecting your home or if you are curious about what’s happening in our local real estate market, just give us a call or send us an email. My team and I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

First impressions are incredibly important, especially when selling your home. Before the buyer gets out of the car, they’re already 80% sure about whether or not they are seriously interested in your home. 

In order to attract more buyers to your home, there are a few things you can do to enhance your curb appeal: 

1. Maintain your lawn. Make sure the grass is neatly manicured. 

2. Don’t overlook pressure washing the exterior of your home. Pressure washing only costs a few hundred dollars and it makes all the difference in the world. Whenever a buyer comes to a home that hasn’t been pressure washed on the outside, they automatically judge what the inside will look like. Don’t let those buyers get a bad impression of your home. 

3. Don’t overlook the driveway. When you do the pressure washing, you can also have them do the entire driveway for a few extra dollars. 

“Put yourself in the buyer’s shoes and look at your home.”

4. Invest in outdoor lighting. Serious buyers will drive by your home after dark to check things out, so install some landscape lighting in the flowerbeds to make your home more presentable. 

5. Add more color to your flowerbeds. Vibrant flowerbeds will catch a buyer’s eye. Shrubs, annuals, and perennials will help your home show in its best light. 

6. Make sure everything is clean. Put yourself in the buyer’s shoes. Would you enjoy hanging out in the backyard? Clean up the interior of your home too so that you are always ready for showings. 

If you follow these tips, you will attract more buyers to your home. At the end of the day, these tips help you net the most money for your home sale. 

If you have any other questions about selling your home or about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

I purchase three to four homes every month for people interested in selling their homes without going through the hassle of a traditional real estate sale.

How is this possible? Through our immediate buyer program with Titan Home Buyers.

Let’s say you needed to sell your current home without going through the headaches of preparing it for the market, allowing showings, and possibly needing to move across country and time isn’t on your side. What we do in this case is provide a fair written offer to you to analyze and determine whether or not you’re interested in selling your home. We have the ability to work with your existing mortgage or pay cash so you can transition to your next point in life.

“With this program, time is on your side.”

For example, a client of ours named Cynthia recently came to us needing to sell her home in Summerville because her father is elderly and sick and she needs to move in with him in order to take care of him. Instead of facing the prospect of commuting back and forth between the two properties and needing to maintain two separate homes, she called Titan and said she needed to sell her property as quickly as possible. Within 10 days, we were able to pay cash for her house. She was then able to take that money and move in with her father.

Another client of ours—Miss Monteford—came to us as a single mom who worked in the military and had orders to move to Florida by August. She previously listed her house in the traditional manner and even had it under contract, but her buyer had a financing issue that caused the deal to fall through. Despite this, we were able to work with her existing mortgage and help her start the next chapter of her life.

The interesting thing about this program is that time is on your side. We have the ability to close within a few months or a few days—it all depends on you and your situation, and you can stay in the home as long as you desire. We’d be happy to map out a timeline to fit your schedule

If you’re interested in a confidential analysis detailing how we’d be able to make a fair written offer on your home, just reply back to this email. If you have any other questions, feel free to give us a call. We’d be happy to help you.

        <title>Is Our Charleston Market Really as Hot as They Say?</title>
        <link>http://jeffcooktv.com/is-our-charleston-market-really-as-hot-as-they-say.html</link>

        <description>

Everybody’s saying our real estate market is hot right now, but is it really that hot? How easy is it to buy or sell a home?

We can get a good idea by comparing year-over-year statistics, so let’s compare the year-to-date statistics from 2017 to where we were at this point in 2016.

Right now, there are about 5,000 available homes for sale, which is about 600 more properties that have been put on the market than last year. This is a decent number, and it means there are more available options to choose from. It’s true that homes are selling fast, but there is still a healthy number of homes for sale.

So far this year, 9,300 homes have sold. Last year, that number stood at 8,700. The fact that we’re listing more homes at about the same rate that we’re selling more homes means our market is balanced. If the number of homes being listed was declining and the number of homes selling was increasing, then we’d have a major problem.

“Now is a tremendous time to buy and sell in Charleston.”

In total, 13,400 homes have come on the market in 2017—which means almost 4,000 homes failed to sell. Part of this represents the market’s level of excess inventory. If this proves anything, it’s that you still need the help of a professional to price your home properly and create good marketing so you can create demand for buyers relocating outside the area.

The average days on market currently sits at 58 days, though the total market time from listing to closing is about 90 to 120 days.

From 2016 to 2017, the average home price increased 4.8%. For example, a $238,000 house last year would now be worth $250,000. We anticipate prices to continue to grow over the next several years, so if you’re interested in buying a home, now is a tremendous time to do it.

Now is also a good time to sell because there are so many buyers relocating to Charleston in droves. Last month, we generated more than 3,800 inquiries about the homes we have listed for sale. The majority of those came from outside our local area.

This relates to the prospect of creating demand that I spoke of above. Once those relocation buyers arrive in our area, what our team does is show those buyers the homes our clients have hired us to sell and get top dollar for. We show each home to several buyers and determine who’s most interested in it by creating a demand for it so it drives the price up.

If you have any questions about these latest trends from our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We have many options tailored specifically to your home, your family situation, and what you may have going in in the next chapter of your life. We look forward to speaking with you.

        <title>Why Are Home Inspections So Important?</title>

        <description>

Whether you are buying a home, selling, or have simply lived on a property for a long period of time, it’s a good idea to have an inspection done. 

Recently I was joined by Bill Whitmire from On The Square Home Inspections.

Bill and I agree that getting a home inspection is the best way to make sure any property is in proper condition. On The Square performs inspections on structural, electrical, plumbing, and other major components of a home to make sure they are functioning safely and correctly. 

Moreover, home inspections also ensure that the property is a good investment. Realtors will structure your contract in such a way that you are able to view the full report prior to any obligation you have to move forward in the process.

These reports are usually 20 to 30 pages in length and include pictures of all the items commented on. The comments within can be good or bad. 

“Home inspections ensure that the property is a good investment.”

But, in either case, the report is designed to give you an overview of the home’s condition.

It also may surprise some to find out that it’s actually recommended for sellers themselves to get the inspection prior to listing their home rather than expecting it to be the responsibility of the buyer.

As Bill points out, this will allow sellers to repair components of the home at their leisure. It’s also a much cheaper option than waiting to have it performed later in the process.

This is especially true because sellers will often times not realize that certain smaller issues have damaged their home over time. Accumulated issues can lead to the buyer demanding a decrease in price or other stipulations. 

By having an inspection done ahead of time, the seller is able to make sure the home has a “clean bill of health” before proceeding. 

However, Bill and I both personally recommend that you get an inspection on your home whether you’re selling or not. If you have lived in a property for a long time, it’s good to uncover potential repairs before they become an issue.

If you’d like to reach out to Bill with any questions or for more information, you can give him a call at (843) 203-9418 or visit his website: OTSInspections.com.

And if you have any other questions for me or would like help with your real estate needs, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

The first impression your home leaves a buyer with is the most important. When we bring a buyer through a home, we have one good shot at showing it in its best possible light. Here are a few home staging tips you can use to capture that light when it comes time to sell.

It’s important to know that buyers really care about kitchens and bathrooms. It’s also important to know that before they even make their way to those rooms, 75% of buyers have already made up their mind about a home by the time they get out of the car. Observe your home as a potential buyer, and pay close attention to its curb appeal. Note how it feels to walk up the driveway to your house to get an idea of what buyers see. Is there fresh paint? Does it smell nice?

“WE ARE THE NO. 1 TEAM IN CHARLESTON.”

Here’s the good news: Our market is on fire. Inventory is down a whopping 17%, which means buyers have fewer homes to choose from. Because of this, homes can take anywhere from 30 to 90 days to sell. During this period, we want to present your home in its best possible light to the buyers on the market. Because we are the No. 1 team in Charleston, we have the ability to bring our technology, our resources, and our marketing to you to ensure that your home sells in the shortest time period and for the most amount of money.

If you have any questions for us about home staging or anything else related to buying or selling a home, give us a call or send us an email. We are always here to help.

Which improvements and renovations can you do to your home to maximize its value?

First, keep your renovations moderate. When you’re attempting to do a renovation or an upgrade, ask yourself one question: Will the majority of buyers coming through this home appreciate this renovation, or will I have to do it again if I decide to sell this home at a later date?

Second, pay attention to curb appeal. Your curb appeal creates the first impression of your home. In our office, we abide by something we call the three second rule. This means whenever we bring a buyer to a property, they will determine whether they want to seriously consider purchasing that property or not within the first three seconds of pulling in the driveway. Spend some money on landscaping and other areas out front to make your home more inviting for any prospective buyers.

“SPEND THE MAJORITY OF YOUR MONEY IN KITCHENS AND BATHROOMS.”

Third, have as much hardwood flooring in your home as you can. Buyers love neutral, hardwood floors. If you can’t afford to install hardwood floors, make your current flooring as clean and neat as possible.

Lastly, spend the majority of your money in kitchens and bathrooms. These are the places in the home where you’ll get your best return on investment. You can typically achieve a two-to-one return on investment, meaning you’ll get $2 in return on the sale of your home for every $1 you spend.

If you have any questions about how to maximize your home’s value or you’re thinking about buying or selling a house, feel free to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.

Are you a pet owner looking to sell their home? If so, there are four rules you need to know.


  
    Remove the pets from the home. I know it’s a challenge, but when I bring a buyer into your home I want to show it off in the best light possible. A cat or dog following a buyer around the house might make it difficult for them see all of the features that your home has to offer.
  
  
    Take a long look at the backyard. Make sure holes are filled in and pet toys are put away. I want a buyer to be able to envision having picnics or their kids playing in the backyard, so making sure it’s manicured is essential.
  


“ASK A FRIEND OR NEIGHBOR TO COME OVER TO SEE IF THEY NOTICE A SMELL.”


  
    Eliminate any pet odors inside the home. I own a dog, so I understand that you might not always pick up on scents. Ask a friend or neighbor to come over to see if they notice a smell. If they do, we can install Glade plug-ins or have the carpets cleaned.
  
  
    Get rid of any potential pet hair. Our goal is to have multiple showings with multiple buyers, so you need to vacuum before every showing. This makes sure a buyer with allergies doesn’t get a bad impression of your home.
  


If you have any questions about this topic, or if you have any other real estate questions, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m always happy to help.

        <description>

If you’re a first-time homebuyer or a newlywed buying a home, these tips will help you:


  
    It’s all about the budget: Your house is more than just a mortgage payment. Over time, you’ll have to pay for maintenance and insurance. That’s why we recommend you pay between 25% and 35% of your household disposable income toward that mortgage payment.
  
  
    Location, location, location: Think about school districts even if you don’t have kids. When the time comes to sell in the future, it’ll be easier if you’re in a positive school district.
  


“THINK ABOUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS EVEN IF YOU DON’T HAVE KIDS.”


  Communicate about the top features of the home: During our free buyer consultation, we’ll get a list of features that you and anyone living in the home would like to have. Then, we compare the lists and merge them into one list of must-haves so we can find your dream home.


If you have any other questions about preparing to buy your first home, give us a call or send us an email. We’d be glad to help!

        <description>

The first important thing to note is that there was a lot of pent-up demand last year because of the storms we had and because of the election. **The first quarter of 2017 was absolutely amazing though with more people putting their home on the market than normal, more sales, and more people moving to Charleston. This is a testament to the market because the first quarter is typically one of the slowest quarters of the year. **

So what does it all mean for the second quarter?

“EVERYBODY WANTS TO MOVE DURING THE SUMMER WHEN THE KIDS ARE OUT OF SCHOOL AND THE DAYS ARE LONGER.”

Remember that even more people get their homes ready to go on the market at this time of year. They want to move during the summertime when the kids aren’t in school and they have more all-around flexibility, along with longer days. The real estate market typically has the highest turnover rate in the second and third quarters.

However, it’s important to remember that all the people planning to move to Charleston are planning their move during this period. That’s why if you’re considering selling your house, now might be the absolute best time. We can help you figure out exactly what you need to do to get your house ready for sale because now might be a perfect time.

If you’re thinking about selling your house or you have any other questions we can answer, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you out!

        <title>What 5 Statistics Define the Charleston Real Estate Market?</title>

        <description>

I just got a report with all the latest statistics from the Charleston real estate market and I wanted to share some of the most important numbers with you. These five statistics paint a promising picture of our market and show just how far we’ve come since the recession.


  
    New listings. Almost 23,000 new homes have come on the market in the last 12 months.
  
  
    Home sales. How many homes were sold during the same time frame? Some of you may be under the impression that every home that comes on the market is selling. However, that’s not what’s happening in reality. Out of those 23,000 listings, only 17,700 sold. That means there are between 5,000 and 6,000 properties that failed to sell. Regardless of what you think about the market, I encourage you to make sure that your Realtor has a strong marketing plan in place to sell your home. That’s really the only way to guarantee a sale in this market.
  


“IT IS TAKING AN AVERAGE OF 11 SHOWINGS TO SELL A HOME.”


  
    Median sale price. This is intriguing. During the recession, the median sale price was around $180,000. Today, it’s at $240,000. It’s increased by over $50,000 in the past five years, but there are people who still think their home won’t sell. If that’s the impression you’re under, I invite you to give us a call. If you tell us how much you owe and how much you’d like to sell for, we would be happy to give you our honest, professional opinion if that is doable.
  
  
    Market time. How long does it take a home to sell on average? Over the past 12 months, the answer is 58 days.
  
  
    Average showings. Finally, let’s look at the average number of showings it takes for a home to get an offer. Right now, homes are getting offers after an average of 11 showings.
  


If you’re interested in learning more and taking a better look at these statistics, you can view them in their entirety here.

If you have any other questions about Charleston real estate, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.

I’ve been working in real estate here in Charleston for 13 years, so I’ve seen the highs, the lows, and a lot of other things in between. During that time, I’ve developed one of Charleston’s first real estate teams, which has expanded into multiple locations.

“WE’RE LOOKING TO ADD TWO OR THREE SALESPEOPLE AT EACH OF OUR FOUR LOCATIONS.”

In the past 30 days, our team generated 3,813 leads of people who are either moving to the area or who live here already and are thinking about moving. About two-thirds of the leads we generated are from outside the area by people looking to move into Charleston. Did you know that 53 people move to Charleston every single day? We can get you in front of those people looking to buy a home here, and that’s a huge opportunity!

Within our team, we share these leads with our agents, and we literally are not able to get to all of them currently.  We need YOU!   We’re looking to add two or three great salespeople to each our four locations.

        <description>

Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Have you heard? Interest rates are on the rise. What does that mean for your home’s value? That is exactly what I wanted to discuss today.

The entity that sets interest rates, the Federal Reserve, meets on a quarterly basis. In 2016, they increased interest rates in two of their four meetings, including the one in December. They have predicted that this year they will raise rates in three out of the four meetings.

Let’s just say they go up 1% from 4.5% to 5.5%, which is what many experts are predicting. Logic says that is still an amazingly low rate, and based on 20- and 30-year trends, it is. However, here is what that increase means for you specifically if you’re trying to buy a home.

“THIS IS THE TIME TO BUY OR SELL BEFORE THEY GO UP.”

If you get approved today for up to $300,000 at 4.5%, just a 1% increase will greatly affect your buying power. With a 5.5% rate, you would only be able to afford a $270,000 home and your mortgage payment will end up about the same as it would have been with a $300,000 home at 4.5%.

If you’re trying to get the maximum amount of money possible out of your home sale, now might be a good time to consider putting your home on the market. There are a lot of buyers out there looking right now and the more potential eyeballs looking at your home, the better. On the flip side, if you plan on purchasing a new home in the near future, it is a good idea to take advantage of the money while it’s cheap and before rates go up.

If you have any questions for me or if you are looking to buy or sell a home in Charleston, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you and discuss your specific situation further.

There are so many options out there in the lending world. You have online banks, brick-and-mortar banks, and non-depository institutions like us. How do you know which one is right for you?

There are different factors to consider, such as rates, fees, and services. Without going from bank to bank to bank, how do you establish that? Let’s examine your options.

With an online bank, you’re a one-time client for them. After your business is completed, they’re not thinking about you ever again, so they don’t have the motivation to service you properly and make the process as easy as possible.

“MY TEAM CAN TAKE GREAT CARE OF YOU.”

With brick-and-mortar banks, their end goal is to make you a customer so they can sell you additional products like car loans, IRAs, bank accounts, etc.

With non-depository institutions like us, our goal is to create that continual referral source by providing outstanding customer service, great rates, low fees, and making the mortgage process as easy as possible.

If you have any questions or are in need of a great lender, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to helping you!

        <description>

A lot of people are downsizing and moving into tiny homes. Chris Gonzalez from Tabor Mortgage is here to answer the question, **“Can you finance a tiny home?” **

The answer is yes, but it may not be the traditional mortgage that you’re thinking of.

“THERE ARE ONLY TWO WAYS TO FINANCE A TINY HOUSE.”

First, you should know that there are a few different types of tiny homes out there:


  
    A trailer you can move.
  
  
    A tiny home on land you can own.
  
  
    A tiny home on land you rent from a development.
  


That said, there are only two ways to finance a tiny home. One option is to apply for a personal loan from a local bank. The other is to get an actual RV loan from your local bank.

If you have any other questions about financing a tiny home, you can reach Chris at (843) 840-4821 or &lt;a href=”mailto:Chris@TaborMortgage.com” target=”_blank&gt;Chris@TaborMortgage.com&lt;/a&gt;. As always, if you have any real estate questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would be happy to help you!

I wanted to stop by quickly today and just say merry Christmas. I want to thank everyone for your support this year and in years past.

There’s one thing I wanted to share with you today.

How you been outside lately and seen the stars and the amazing landscape, sunset, and the moon? If God was able to create all of this, and you still have a beating heart, you still have a purpose in life. Not only did God create all those amazing things, He breathed His very life into creating you.

“REMEMBER THE REASON FOR THE SEASON.”

This Christmas, reach out to those around you and love your neighbor. Be encouraged and cheerful, and remember the reason for the season!

I look forward to hearing from you soon! Merry Christmas!

        <title>How Can You Buy a Charleston Home With No Money Down?</title>

        <description>

Many times we see buyers who are ready to own a home but just don’t have the money for a down payment. Did you know you can buy a home with very little or even zero money down? Today I wanted to share the top four ways you can do this in the Charleston market.

Since interest rates are low, it’s still a fantastic time to buy a house. These are the ways you can take advantage with little or no money down:


  
    VA (veterans) loan: You can buy a home if you’re a veteran for 100% financing.
  
  
    State Housing: This is a grant for your down payment. Depending on your income and the county you’re buying in, it could be repaid or it could be completely forgivable.
  


“STATE HOUSING IS A DOWN PAYMENT GRANT THAT CAN BE TOTALLY FORGIVABLE.”


  
    USDA: This lets you buy a home in what’s considered a rural area. Many areas around Monk’s Quarter, Goose Creek, and Summerville are still considered rural because of lines that were drawn many, many years ago. This loan also lets you finance 100% of the price.
  
  
    A gift fund from a relative or family member: This lets you buy a home with a conventional down payment, but you utilize it as a gift from a family member or relative that’s applied directly to the home purchase.
At the end of the day, if you have about $1,200, we can get the seller of the home you want to buy to pay the majority of the closing costs. The $1,200 will allow you to get the property inspected and put down your earnest money so you can buy the home.
  


With a 620 or better credit score and gainful employment, we may be able to help you get into a home with little or no money down. If you have any questions about qualifying or you’re interested in buying a home in the Charleston area, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you out!

        <title>Why It's Better to Own a Home than Rent One</title>
        <link>http://jeffcooktv.com/why-its-better-to-own-home-than-rent-one.html</link>

        <guid>https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/Jeff+Cook/Charleston+Real+Estate+Agent-+5+Major+Reasons+to+Own+a+Home+Rather+Than+Rent.mp4</guid>
        <description>

The first reason is that you build equity with each mortgage payment. Say you take out a mortgage for $200,000. Every time you make a payment, that $200,000 balance continues to drop and your equity increases. The second reason is that you enjoy many tax benefits by being a homeowner. At the end of the year when it’s time to file your taxes, the interest and other things you’ve paid can be deducted to release your tax burden.

The third reason is that buying a home is actually cheaper than renting in the long term. Say that $200,000 mortgage we talked about has a $1,200 a month payment, and you have a friend who rents a $1,200 a month home. The following year, your mortgage payment will still be $1,200, but your friend’s rent is probably going to go up by $50 or $100 per month, and will continue to increase at that rate every single year. In 30 years, you’ll still be paying $1,200 a month, and your friend could be paying up to $4,000 in rent!

“BUYING A HOME IS ACTUALLY CHEAPER THAN RENTING.”

The fourth reason to own a home rather than rent one is that you will establish a solid credit history. Every single time you make a mortgage payment on time, your credit score continues to rise, which helps you in other aspects of life like getting better rates on insurance, cell phone payments, and anything else that requires credit.

Finally, homeownership is healthy for families and the community. Just think about what happens in a home – the word “homemaker” comes to mind. Family comes over for holidays, friends come over for a cookout, neighbors become closer, kids are raised in the home, and relationships get stronger. It’s truly a wonderful thing.

If you have any questions about homeownership or you’re interested in buying a home in the Charleston area, give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to hear from you and help you out.

        <description>

With all of the holiday noise and Black Friday messages flooding your inbox, I just wanted to take this opportunity to say Happy Thanksgiving from the Jeff Cook Real Estate Team.

I know that I personally am so grateful for my amazing family, my incredible wife, Sarah, my two children, Ava and Jason, and our dog, Johnny.

I’d also like to give you a challenge. It’s very easy to get caught up in everything going on during the hustle and bustle during this time of year, but I’d like you to pick one person you know and one person you don’t know and lift their spirits this Thanksgiving.

“WE ARE BETTER TOGETHER WHEN WE LOVE AND ENCOURAGE ONE ANOTHER.”

Not everybody is as fortunate as we are to have a great holiday season, so it’s important to make sure everybody knows that they’re appreciated.

At Jeff Cook Real Estate, this is our mission. This means that my job as the team leader is to empower my team so that we can empower the whole community. We are truly better together when we love one another and encourage each other.

Again, I just wanted to say Happy Thanksgiving to all of you. Enjoy your time with your friends and family and don’t eat too much turkey!

        <description>

We’ve got the latest numbers for the Charleston real estate market and we wanted to share them with you today. So far in 2016, 19,000 homes have been listed on the market and 14,000 of those have sold. A large percentage have sold, but there will always be homes that don’t sell for a variety of reasons. Whether it’s because they are priced too high, they’re unable to accommodate showings, or they simply go too long without an offer, not every home will sell.

This year, the median price in Charleston is $239,000, a 5.7% jump from last year’s median price. Our average sale price is also up by around 4.5% to $320,000.

Last year, we had about a five-month supply of inventory at this time. Right now, our supply is at 3.6 months. What we mean by this is that if no more new homes came on the market after now, it would take 3.6 months to sell all the homes on the market at the current rate homes are selling. Anything below five to six months is considered a seller’s market, so that’s what we are in right now in Charleston.

“BUYERS ARE MORE RELUCTANT TO PAY FULL PRICE.”

I do want to caution you that in this fourth quarter, we have seen a growing trend of buyers becoming a little reluctant to pay full price. However, a lot of people are taking their homes off the market right now before the holidays, so you have a window of opportunity to sell high now.

If your home is eligible to be shown during the holidays, I recommend you get it on the market right now. You can get ahead of the January rush that will come and get your home under contract while there is less competition and more serious buyers.

We are in a tremendous market for home sellers. If you have any questions for us or you’re thinking or buying or selling, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to come out to your home and give you a complimentary home valuation to show you what you could really sell for this holiday season. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

I just wanted to thank our Realtor community for everything that they’ve done this year to help us achieve our goals. With the help of the community, we were able to make all of our transactions a win-win for all parties involved.

With the new year approaching, I just wanted to ask you one question: based on what you’ve done this year, have you achieved all of the goals that you set for yourself? Were you able to meet or exceed the number of home sales that you set out to sell? Were you able to service the number of families that you wanted to? Did you bring in the income that you desired?

My team and I were able to service over 800 families this year, which is absolutely tremendous. We hope to push this number toward 1,000 or 1,100 this coming year.

“DID YOU ACHIEVE ALL OF YOUR GOALS FOR THIS YEAR?”

If you have any interest in chatting a little bit more about a potential new real estate career with our team, I’d love to talk with you.

With the support of the Realtor community this year, we were also able to open our Johnnie Dodds office this year, located at 311 Johnnie Dodds Blvd. in Mount Pleasant. This is in addition to our offices on 821 Orleans Rd. in West Ashley, in the Oakbrook/North Charleston area, and in downtown Summerville. We have three or four positions available at each of these offices, and the agents in our office are rewarded with leads, a steady stream of contacts, as well as a business plan that allows them to reach the income level that they desire.

If you have any interest in joining our team, simply give me a call or send me an email and I’ll keep your response 100% confidential. I would love to chat with you to see if we can get your real estate career to take off in the coming year. I look forward to hearing from you!

Today we’re in the city of North Charleston in a neighborhood called Park Hill. Hurricane Matthew just rolled through here a couple of days ago, and the majority of the houses along the street I’m currently standing at have flooded. We decided to come down here and lend a hand to the people in this community because that’s what we do in Charleston.

A lot of people have been asking me what all this storm’s impact means for the real estate market. Overall, this won’t hurt Charleston’s real estate prices. Just because this is a hurricane-prone area doesn’t mean that the market suffers after one hits.

“GET IN TOUCH WITH US IF YOU’RE INTERESTED IN ASSISTING THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED.”

If you’re interested in assisting us with rebuilding this neighborhood, you can get in touch with us on Twitter at @rebuildparkhill or visit our website we’ll soon be launching called rebuildparkhill.com. There you’ll also be able to see pictures of some of the houses that we’ve worked on to get a better idea of the devastation and how we’re rebuilding.

We’re still in business, so if you have any questions please give us a call or just reply to this email. We look forward to hearing from you!

        <title>How to Knock 8 Years off of Your Mortgage</title>

        <description>

There’s a really simple and effective trick for paying off your 30-year mortgage in just 22 years that I wanted to share with you. In fact, there are two ways.

Say it’s tax refund time or Christmas, and you’ve come across a little extra money. **Did you know that if you make a 13th mortgage payment each year, you’ll knock eight years off of the life of your 30-year mortgage? **

The second strategy is especially helpful for those who get paid on a bi-weekly basis. Instead of making a monthly mortgage payment, talk to your mortgage company about setting up bi-weekly payments on your mortgage. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, making half of your mortgage payment every two weeks rather than a full payment every month equates to making 26 half payments over the course of the year. Of course, that equates to 13 full payments a year instead of 12, which you would get by making one full payment per month.

“BOTH OPTIONS WILL SAVE YOU THOUSANDS IN INTEREST!”

Just like in the first scenario, you would knock eight years off of your 30-year mortgage. Think of the savings in interest!

        <description>

We’ve got some great news to share about our great city. Charleston has recently been ranked the number two most popular destination for movers in 2016. The three contributing factors to this are strong job growth, low vacancy rates, and high affordability.

For us in Charleston, this means a few things. For one, more people are moving to the area. That’s obvious. We have 43 newcomers each day on average. Jobs will also continue to grow, as the Charleston region is ranked in the top-10 in the U.S. for job seekers.

“OUR MEDIAN SALE PRICE HAS RISEN BY 11.4%!”

If you own a Charleston home, its value has likely risen. The median sales price is 11.4% higher right now than it was at the same time last year.

        <title>Why Now Is the Time to Sell Your Charleston Home</title>

        <description>

Are you sitting on the fence trying to figure out whether now is the time to sell your Charleston home? I have four compelling reasons why you should:


  
    Low inventory, high demand. Not only do we have the people living in Charleston looking to purchase a home, but 70% of the people inquiring on our websites right now are folks living outside the area intending to move here soon. A lot of people want to be a part of our long-kept secret!
  
  
    An influx of millennials purchasing. We refer to this as “pent-up demand.” These are people who are now old enough to purchase a home after living with their parents or renting for longer than they wanted due to the previous recession. Their collective need to buy homes has caused the market to continue to boom.
  


“A lot of people want to be a part of our long-kept secret!”


  
    Home values are up. Did you know that we’re in a 9% higher price point than we were a year ago? If you couldn’t previously sell your home, you may now be able to.
  
  
    Interest rates are at an all-time low. If interest rates go up 1%, that cuts a buyer’s purchasing power by 10%. This means that if you own a home that’s worth $300,000 and interest rates rise by 1%, a potential buyer for that house that could’ve gotten approved at $300,000 can now only get approved for $270,000.

        <description>

Should you have an open house or not? We are huge fans of open houses. The open house is an integral part of our marketing system in order to help you get top dollar for your home. Having an open house creates energy and gives buyers the opportunity to see your home.

Think about it: let’s say someone is shopping online for a three-bedroom, two-bath home with a two-car garage, but you only have a one-car garage. The online buyer wouldn’t see your home. Open houses only increase your chances for selling your home at top dollar. Three reasons:


  People may miss your home if it doesn’t have every detail you think you want. Again, if they’re thinking they want a two-car garage, they may change their mind when they see your house in person.


“Give buyers a chance to see your home in person.”


  
    Consider general foot traffic. Someone who walks into your open house is probably someone who didn’t know about your home previously.
  
  
    **More buyers coming in increases the overall interest in your home. **
  


If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

        <description>

Today I’m happy to be joined by Tommy Welch of 1st Class Painting &amp; Restoration to talk about the top three things you can do to get the most value for your home.

It’s a great question, Tommy said, and provided a contractor’s perspective. First and foremost, (and yes, Tommy says he’s a bit biased) you’ve got to make sure your paint is solid and neutral. He loves a good hot pink or your daughter’s bright blue bathroom, but not when you’re selling your home. It’s not just important to be neutral, it’s important that the quality of the work is good, so hire a professional.

Secondly, Tommy said, know that buyers go straight to kitchens and bathrooms when they view a house. You want the kitchen to be functional, clean, and open. If your flooring is up to date, you’re probably ahead of the curve. Take a few minutes and take a non-biased look at your kitchen and bathrooms to look for what stands out as needing to be fixed or updated.

“These are game-changers when it comes to listing your house.”

Lastly, don’t forget the outdoors. We live here in Charleston so we can spend 365 days a year outside, so spruce up your yard. Keep the lawn cut, get rid of overgrowth, and make sure fences and decks are properly sealed, clean, and safe. You want people viewing your home to walk outside and think “Wow! I can hang out here!”

All these things aren’t just cost-effective, they’re game-changers when it comes to listing your house and making a move. Tommy would love to come out and give you a totally free estimate on any of these things. You can call him at 843-324-6006 or you can email him at Tommy@1stClassCharleston.com.

        <description>

Today, I’m discussing the advantages and disadvantages of new construction and resale properties when buying in Charleston. Whenever we sit down with buyers for initial consultations, they often know whether they want an older or newer home.

If you’re interested in an older home, typically it’ll be in a mature neighborhood with developed trees and larger yard sizes on average. Oftentimes, you’ll notice smaller kitchens and bathrooms compared to new construction developments.

“You have the opportunity to choose your add-ons with new construction properties.”

New construction includes full warranties, but sometimes the yard sizes are smaller and the neighborhoods aren’t fully matured. The surrounding community might still be in construction mode, even though your home has already been built. You have the opportunity to personally choose your add-ons, such as flooring, colors, and other features. Additionally, you have built-in equity to a recently built home; the value increased during construction, even though you’re not making payments.

If you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in the surrounding area, reach out by phone or email. I’d be happy to help answer your questions and serve your local real estate needs!
