        <description>

If you haven’t bought a home in a long time or you’re about to buy your first home, there are a few things you should know.

First, remember that things are going to break. It happens. You have to have the reserves in place so that you can maintain your property properly. On the bright side, many large expenses can be avoided with proper maintenance.

For example, your air conditioner will last longer if you change your filters and have it regularly serviced. When you set up your budget, make sure that you have the money to invest in your home and make the necessary repairs.

Secondly, the property taxes that the seller is paying right now will probably be readjusted. This is especially important for you to keep in mind if you are new to Florida.

How do you know if your property taxes will be adjusted? It’s an easy formula. Take a look at what the property is assessed at, which is the amount the seller pays property taxes on, and compare it to the market value. If there is a huge difference between the two, then you need to set money aside so that you will be able to pay the adjusted property taxes.

“In Florida, your property taxes may be adjusted after you buy the home.”

Finally, there’s the home inspection. What does the home inspection cover, and what does it leave out?

The inspector will spend two to four hours at the home prior to closing. They are only going to be able to acknowledge any issues that they notice on that day, so the inspection is not a true guarantee. After all, an issue could arise the next week. However, it’s still very important that you have the inspection done. You need to look at the age of appliances and the mechanics in your home so that you can budget properly for the maintenance of your property.

Keep these three things in mind before you purchase your home. Whether you are buying your first home or buying your first home in a long time, we are here to make the process easier for you.

If you have any other questions, please don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

        <title>How the Fed’s Recent Rate Hike Impacts Our Market</title>

On June 14th, the Federal Reserve increased its federal funds interest rate by 0.25%. They’re also widely expected to raise rates once or twice more over the course of 2017. What does this mean for the real estate market?

While any action by the Fed always garners a lot of attention, I believe these increases will not have any significant impact on our market.

First of all, mortgage rates have actually trended lower in the wake of the Fed’s recent announcement. The 30-year mortgage rate recently hit 3.9%, the lowest level in 2017. In fact, it’s a common pattern for the mortgage rate and the Fed rate to move in opposite directions, and the same thing has happened the last two times the Fed raised rates.

Second, the economy continues to do well. The Fed decided to increase its rate because unemployment and inflation are low, household spending is picking up, and we’ve seen steady growth for the past nine years. This is good news for the real estate market. As expected, we continue to see strong demand and a corresponding increase in home prices.

“These increases will not have any significant impact on our market.”

Third, while the Fed’s rate increase is normally meant to cool off the economy, it might actually stimulate it in this case. Because interest rates were so low for such a long period of time, experts believe the recent increases might ease pressure on the financial system and encourage lending.

Case in point: since the Fed started raising its rate in December 2016, total mortgages are up 2.5% year over year.

In conclusion, while any move by the Fed is likely to lead to a lot of hand-wringing, I believe the real estate market will not be affected and will continue on its own healthy course. Nonetheless, it’s clear that right now is a uniquely good moment for everyone in the real estate market. Today’s low mortgage rates are good for homebuyers because they make homes more affordable.

If you have any questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, give me a call at (561) 352-3056 or send me an email at lisa@treugroup.com. I’d love to help.

Whether you’re a buyer or seller, I have important news to share with you.  

Interest rates, as we know, have been on the rise. Why does this matter?  

If you’re a buyer and rates go up just 1%, you’ll lose 10% of your buying power. This means you may have to settle for not living in the neighborhood you want or giving up that pool you wanted. That’s not what you want, right? I know that’s not what I want for you.

If you’re a seller, rising interest rates mean fewer buyers can afford your home. Fewer buyers mean fewer offers.

“TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY OUR MARKET IS GIVING YOU RIGHT NOW.”

There was a study published recently that no one’s talking about but I think you deserve to know about. The study showed that in South Florida, there’s less than a 10% chance that our real estate prices will decrease in the next two years.

As a buyer, you might have both higher interest rates and higher prices, and that’s not good for anybody.

We are here to help you capitalize on the opportunity in the current market, so if you have any questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling real estate, don’t hesitate to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you.

The real estate market can be a little bit confusing, especially if you’re getting your information from friends, family, or the news. So I wanted to give you some accurate information about the Palm Beach County market.

Last month, we had 5.1 months of inventory. That means we’re still in a seller’s market. If you’re looking to buy, you’re going to need to be prepared, and if you’re looking to sell, you’re going to be pretty happy.

35.7% of all transactions that closed last month were cash. There were no appraisal contingencies and no financing in these transactions. The median price was $327,000 and that number keeps rising. We still have room to grow, as the number when we were at the height of our market was around $375,000.

A question frequently asked is this: “Are you buying or selling in a buyer’s market or seller’s market?” It depends on two things: the area and the price range that you’re in. For example, if you’re buying or selling a single-family home in the $200,000 to $250,000 range, then you’re in a very strong seller’s market. There are only about two months inventory in this price range.

“THERE’S ALWAYS AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE MARKET.”

If you increase your budget and you’re buying or selling in the $300,000 to $400,000 range, then you’re still in a seller’s market and there’s only about three months of inventory. Sellers are receiving multiple offers for these homes and buyers are going to have a hard time beating out the competition.

If you move into the luxury market ($600,000 to $1 million range), you’ll see we’re in a buyer’s market. We have nine months of inventory in this market, so if you’re looking to buy then you’ll have plenty to choose from. The same goes for homes that are priced at $1 million or more. We have 16 months of inventory available in this market, making it a strong buyer’s market as well.

There’s always an opportunity in the market. The question is how do you capitalize on that? Here at True Group Real Estate, we’ve been helping buyers in the seller’s market get the home of their dreams. If you’re selling, we want to help you get the most money for your home.

If you’re in the luxury market and you’re frustrated because your home isn’t selling, we have the right formula to get a sold sign in the yard and you to the closing table. The formula is simple, but it isn’t easy; you need the right price, the right condition, and the right marketing. We can help.

If you have any other questions about real estate, or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, please give a call or shoot us an email. We’d love to help!

Sites like Zillow, Realtor.com, and Trulia can be a challenge for buyers and sellers. Why?

Let’s say that you are buying a home and looking for your dream home on these sites. If you call the listing agent, you will probably hear that the property has already sold. That’s because there is a delay between what you see on those websites and what professional agents see. As real estate agents, we actually get a head start of up to seven days on the best properties.

So, how can you find a listing online that hasn’t already gone under contract?

You can do one of two things. First, you can search on a site like ours, which pulls information directly from the MLS. That way, when a home hits the market, you will know right away. The other option is to allow us to do all of the hard work for you.

“OUR WEBSITE PULLS INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM THE MLS.”

The last few buyers we’ve worked with only viewed four homes until they found their dream home. That might not seem very impressive, but one of those buyers had been searching with another agent and on their own for two long years.

If you are selling your home, are those websites your friends? Not really. It’s important to understand how Zillow impacts your pool of buyers. If Zillow has a wrong Zestimate or other incorrect information, it can cost you thousands of dollars. It may even cost you the home sale.

It’s important to understand how these sites work and competitively list your home in the right place.

At Treu Group real estate, we understand how to help you buy, sell, and, most importantly, how to help you win. If you have any questions, we are here to help you. Just give us a call!

There are opportunities in every real estate market, and I want to share three of them with you today.

First of all, a recent study revealed that almost 50% of all millennials in south Florida live at home. If you want to build wealth in the United States, the first step in creating wealth is to own your own home.

While this may not be possible for all millennials right now, some millennials should definitely consider packing up and buying their first home. If you have a great job, a steady income, and you’ve saved some money or have access to gift money, then now is a great time to get into a new property.

Let me tell you a quick story: When I first purchased a home, I got a 13.5% adjustable mortgage rate. Compared to today’s low interest rate, you can see that homes are more affordable. You can ask your friends and your parents what their first home’s interest rates were, and I think you will agree that even a 4% interest rate is an absolute gift to the real estate market.

“OWNING A HOME IS THE FIRST STEP IN CREATING YOUR OWN WEALTH.”

Secondly, if you already own your first home, now is a great time to upgrade to your next home or maybe even your dream home. Why? If you sell your current home, you are probably selling in a seller’s market. Depending on what price range you are moving up to, you will likely be buying in a buyer’s market. So, the market currently allows you to sell in the best position possible and have more options when you go to buy.

Finally, if you are ready to retire and want top dollar for your home, you can definitely win in this market, especially if your home lines up with what millennials are interested in. Why? Right now, we have a shortage of great homes in certain price ranges. Anything under $500,000 often receives multiple offers, great prices, and great terms.

So, it is time to capitalize on these three great opportunities in our current market. If you have any questions about buying or selling a home, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

No matter what your goals are in real estate, the Treu Group can help. Here are three specific ways that our team can assist you in achieving your real estate dreams:


  
    When you’re looking to buy. Whether it’s your first home, your dream home, or an investment property, we are here to help. We serve the areas of Palm Beach County, Martin County, and even Broward County. If you want to buy something in another state, we can help you out there too with our network of referral partners.
  
  
    When you want to sell. Marketing is really important, and we understand the formula that will get your home sold for top dollar. It involves the right price, the right condition, and the right marketing. We expose your property locally, nationally, and internationally to maximize the number of potential buyers who will see it online.
  


“YOU DESERVE A TEAM LIKE OURS.”


  When you want to buy new construction. Many people are unaware that the builder will happily pay for you to have a buyer’s agent on your side, someone to help you make great decisions in the short and long term. We’ve been able to help our clients make great choices with selections, floor plans, and even upgrades. Builders won’t give you a discount if you walk in by yourself. In fact, they will probably take advantage of that fact.


You deserve to have a team like True Group Real Estate by your side whether buying, selling, investing, or building. If you have any questions for us or are thinking about making a move yourself, give us a call or send us an email today. We would love to hear from you.

It turns out that the FHA will no longer implement a reduction in fees. Because of this change, there are some things you should know about buying a home in 2017.

If the FHA fee reduction had gone through, it would have saved the average FHA buyer $500 to $600 a year. That means the loss of that reduction won’t impact your ability to buy a home.

Also, Realtor.com reported that in December 2016, the number of people looking at properties increased from 40% to 80% compared to December 2015.

Many buyers are trying to purchase a new property before interest rates rise, which is smart as increased interest rates would greatly impact buying power. That’s why if you’re looking to buy, you need to hire the right agent to ensure a quick and successful home purchase.

“YOU CAN STILL BUY A HOME WITHOUT THE REDUCTION IN FHA FEES.”

I’d also like to talk to you about how $20 can have a huge impact on our community. The Treu Group is doing a diaper drive to help assist the one out of every three families who are struggling to buy diapers. Many members of those low-income families would like to go back to work, but children are not allowed to go attend daycare without diapers.

Our diaper drive will be taking place in three different locations: Lighthouse Cove Adventure Golf in Jupiter, iHeart Media in West Palm Beach, and the Treu Group Real Estate office in Del Ray Beach.

If none of those are convenient, we can come pick up your donation or even buy the diapers for you if you prefer to make a monetary donation.

If you’re looking to buy or sell a home or if you would like more information on our diaper drive, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I would be more than happy to help.

A major life change can definitely impact your real estate transaction. When people face trying times, they tend to make mistakes during their real estate transaction. We’re only human after all. Today, I’ll go over a few common mistakes for you to avoid.

First of all, if you suddenly lose your job but can afford to keep your home, don’t put it on the market right away. See if you can get a new job in the same area before you sell. If you can’t make your mortgage payments without your job, call us right away.

Another stressful life event that can impact your transaction is a divorce. You need to deal with what makes sense. Should you offer a buyout? Should you agree to sell the home? Which option is the best one for you?

“”

When people get divorced, they are dealing with a loss of the future. They are thinking about all of the dreams that they planned as a couple and watching them disappear. People try to hold onto that future and make emotional decisions, such as paying too much to retain the home. Sometimes, it makes sense to sell the home and get a new start.

The third major life event that can be challenging is when you lose a loved one. The biggest mistake I see is that people either sell too quickly or hold on too long. I believe that there is a natural period where you need to have your time to grieve. Don’t do anything now.

My team and I are here to help you so that you can make the right decisions for your situation. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. We are here to help you come up with the right plan, so if you find yourself in a stressful situation, give us a call. We would be happy to help you!

Three groups will have big opportunities in the 2017 Palm Beach real estate market. Today I’ll explain how the groups stand to benefit from market conditions.

We believe there’s always a great opportunity to be had in the real estate market, and you just have to position yourself to take advantage of it. That’s why today, I wanted to talk a bit about some of the great opportunities that will be available in the Palm Beach market in 2017.

The first opportunity lies with people currently renting homes. As a renter, your rent payment goes up when your landlord’s costs go up. By buying a house in 2017, you can lock in two things: your interest rate and your property taxes. If you rent, it’s time to get off the fence and into your new home.

Move-up buyers also have big opportunities in 2017. Many homeowners have a home in a seller’s market price range, giving them the perfect chance to move up into their dream home. If you own a house under $400,000, it’s likely the best time for you to take advantage of the record-low rates and the cooling luxury market. You would be selling in a seller’s market and likely moving up to a buyer’s market.

“IF YOU RENT, IT’S TIME TO GET OFF THE FENCE AND INTO YOUR NEW HOME.”

Finally, the third big opportunity is for those of you looking to buy real estate as an investment to have tenants and positive cash flow.

If you have any questions about how you can take advantage of the market in 2017, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to help you.

Finally, if you take a look in the video above, you’ll see that I’m in an iconic part of Palm Beach. Do you know where I am? Send your guess and you might just win a prize! All you have to do is reply to this email with your guess.

I hope to hear from you soon!

        <description>

South Florida is a destination spot for many international homebuyers, but which two countries will affect the real estate market the most?

The biggest impact will come from our neighbors to the east, China. China is planning on investing $21 billion outside of their country over the next few years, and a decent amount of that will be poured into the South Florida market. Not only is South Florida attractive for its stability and opportunity, but our rental market is incredibly strong, making the area very attractive to Chinese buyers.

Canada will be the other country impacting our market trends. Over the past few years, Canadians have been a huge influence on the South Florida real estate market. However, we currently have a currency issue. Because the U.S. dollar is so strong right now, Canadians have to pay 25% more to make the same purchase they would have made a few years ago.

“”

It’s very important that South Florida home sellers are in the know when it comes to the international market. We make sure our clients’ properties are put right in front of international buyers by using our customized marketing approach. We know who the buyers are, where they are located, and how to get your property in front of them.

We are also introducing a new game called “Where’s Lisa?” I will be at different locations in South Florida in our videos, and the first person to guess where I am wins a prize. Simply reply to this email with your answer, or go to our Facebook or Twitter page with your answer followed by #TreuGroupContest. Here are your hints:


  Behind me is the Intercoastal waterway.
  From this location you can get onto something and go see beautiful homes with holiday lights.
  It’s perfect for people of all ages.


If you think you know where I am, don’t forget to reply to this email or go to our Facebook or Twitter page with your answer followed by #TreuGroupContest. In the meantime, if you have any other questions feel free to give us a call or send us an email!

The current Palm Beach real estate market has three amazing opportunities for buyers, sellers, and investors. I will go over each of them today.

There are opportunities all around us, and today, I want to share the three biggest opportunities available in the current Palm Beach real estate market.


  
    For the move-up buyers: If you have a home in the $300,000 to $400,000 price range, now is the time for you to move up into that dream home. You have the unique opportunity to sell your home at top dollar and then move up into a less competitive price range. Not only will you have more homes to choose from, you may also get a better deal!
  
  
    For the investors: I have a list of really great deals. Many of these happen to be foreclosure properties. These properties range from $200,000 all the way up to the luxury market, so there is truly a deal for everyone. To help make it easier for you, we are starting a VIP Investor Program that our clients can use free of charge. To sign up, click here.
  


“NOW IS A GREAT TIME TO SELL FOR TOP DOLLAR AND MOVE UP INTO A LESS COMPETITIVE MARKET.”


  For the sellers: If you have a home to sell and your home is priced at or below $500,000, you can get multiple offers on your home and sell for over asking price. We have also been negotiating great terms for sellers in this price range. You can get post-occupancy agreements and a lot of other perks that you couldn’t get under other market conditions.


No matter which opportunity you choose, we always want to help you get that competitive advantage in the real estate market. If you have any questions about buying, selling, or investing in a home, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

Since market values have gone up 9.5% on our taxes for homes
in the past year, you need to know how to budget for your tax amount.

Property taxes are an important part of our budgets when we’re buying a new property or looking at how a property cash flows. This past year, our market values went up 9.5% on our proposed taxes for our homes. What does that mean?

If your property was homesteaded, it likely means absolutely nothing. For example, for my primary home, the market value actually went up $125,000, and yet, my assessed value only went up $2,000. If you own an investment property or a commercial property, however, you don’t have that benefit. You may be a little shocked this year when you get your tax bill, but you can make that payment in November.

The other person who might be a little shocked this year is the one who purchased a home last year, especially if that home had the “save the home” benefit. You may have budgeted for a lower tax amount or had a lower tax amount in your escrow account, and now you’re having to make up for last year, plus your lender will adjust your escrow account for next year.

“IT’S NOT IMPORTANT WHAT THE TAXES ARE TODAY, BUT WHAT THEY’LL BE IN THE LONG TERM.”

We’re getting a lot of calls from buyers and sellers who are confused about taxes, especially those who’ve just made their purchase. If this includes you, here’s my advice:

If you already own a home and it’s not homesteaded, and it’s now a financial challenge for you, give us a call and let’s look through your options. Maybe that property that did create cash flow is no longer the right option.


  
    If you just purchased a new home, make sure you file for homestead exemption. That will save you thousands of dollars in the future, plus provide other benefits.
  
  
    If you’re in the home buying process, it’s not important what the taxes are today; focus on what they’ll be in the long term. What you need to do is look at the current owner’s market value versus the assessed value. If there is a differential, your taxes will likely go up in the future. That’s OK as long as you budget accordingly.
  


This is important to remember if you know your escrow account might be a little short. You can set that money aside and you won’t be as surprised next year when you receive a higher tax bill.

So, go ahead and file for the homestead if you can. If you sold a home in Florida and purchased another home in Florida this year, you have another benefit called “portability.” That means you take some of your benefits of that previous home—the tax savings—and bring it to your new home.

        <title>The 4 Valuable Lessons I Learned in Greece</title>
        <link>http://treugroupsouthflorida.com/the-4-valuable-lessons-i-learned-in.html</link>

Today I wanted to switch things up a bit and share with you the four lessons that I learned while on vacation in Greece. There are lessons all around us everywhere we go.

The first is to be open-minded. One thing I was really concerned about was the cuisine because I wasn’t sure if I’d like it. I didn’t like Greek yogurt, but what I discovered was that I just had never had great Greek yogurt. In Greece, we enjoyed fresh Greek yogurt every morning, and it was delicious! Imagine if I had been unwilling to try something new— I would have missed out on discovering one of my new favorite things.

The second thing I learned was to be willing to try something new. We also rented scooters and ATVs in Greece, which scared me a bit because we weren’t familiar with the area, and honestly, they drive a little bit crazy over there. We decided to try something new, though, and we got to see parts of Greece that we would never have gotten to see if we hadn’t been willing to just give it a try.

“ALWAYS BE WILLING TO TRY SOMETHING NEW.”

Another thing I learned was to treat everything like an adventure. Even something like getting lost can be fun. Look at life that way— what are you doing in the moment, and how can you make it fun and exciting instead of just looking at what’s wrong.

Finally, the fourth thing I learned was to set big goals and allow yourself to dream bigger. My husband and I were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary, and we thought back to our honeymoon. It was very different than this trip; it was a very short weekend trip, which we thought was wonderful at the time. Because we’ve allowed ourselves to think big and dream big, we were able to take this amazing trip.

I hope you’ll take these four lessons I’ve learned and give them a try to create something amazing for yourself. If you have any questions for me, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to keep this conversation going!

I’m proud to serve the Palm Beach County real estate market and call it home. I’m also very proud to be the only agent in Palm Beach County with the endorsement of Barbara Corcoran.

People ask me all the time what my favorite things to do are in and around Palm Beach County. There is so much to do that I don’t know if I’ll be able to get to it all, but I’ll try.

One place I love to go that’s great for the whole family is Lighthouse Cove Adventure Golf. They have two 18-hole courses, which are both beautifully maintained. They are North Palm Beach County’s premiere mini-golf courses. After you’ve played a round, you can go have a burger or ice cream sundae at their fast casual restaurant inside. They do corporate events as well as children’s parties.

South Florida has no shortage of great restaurants. One of our favorites is &lt;a href=”http://www.roccostacos.com/” target=”_blank&gt;Rocco’s Tacos.&lt;/a&gt; They even have multiple locations in the area, so you’re never too far from one. They make delicious tableside guacamole. &lt;a href=”http://www.utikibeach.com/” target=”_blank&gt;U-Tiki&lt;/a&gt; is a great place too. They are right on the water, so you can arrive by car or boat.

Another great restaurant is &lt;a href=”http://www.jupiterlighthouse.org/” target=”_blank&gt;Guanabanas.&lt;/a&gt; At this place, you’ll enjoy beautiful views, outdoor dining, and great entertainment. When you’re done eating, you can head on down to their dock and hop on a paddleboard or kayak, which you can rent right there.

If history is more of your thing, check out the &lt;a href=”http://harboursideplace.com/” target=”_blank&gt;Jupiter Inlet Museum.&lt;/a&gt; It’s an amazing place, and you can even take a tour of the lighthouse.

“MANY OF OUR BEACHES ARE WORLD-FAMOUS.”

One of my favorite parts about Palm Beach County is the abundance of shopping, restaurant, and entertainment options available. &lt;a href=”” target=”_blank&gt;Harbourside&lt;/a&gt; in Jupiter, Downtown West Palm Beach, and City Place in Clematis are all great hotspots. Downtown Delray Beach is a great place, too, and has some of the most beautiful beaches around.

&lt;a href=”https://www.lioncountrysafari.com/” target=”_blank&gt;Lion Country Safari&lt;/a&gt; is Florida’s only drive-thru safari where animals roam free and humans roam in cars. It’s really a special place.

Our tour wouldn’t be complete without a trip to the beach. Many of our beaches in the area are world-famous. There are quiet beaches, touristy beaches, or pet-friendly beaches. You’ll love it.

If you have any questions for us about any of the places we’ve talked about today, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

One of the common questions I get from my clients is how quickly can they enter back into the real estate market if they have suffered through a short sale, deed-in-lieu, foreclosure, Chapter 7 bankruptcy, or Chapter 13 bankruptcy.

You need to know a few things first. Depending on the type of loan product you used and which of the four procedures you went through, your time away from being allowed to purchase will vary.

However, most people can enter back into the market in two to seven years in order to get financing.

“NON-TRADITIONAL FINANCING MAY BE A VALID OPTION FOR YOU.”

One other option if you’re almost done with your waiting period is to use non-traditional financing. The interest rate for these loans will be a bit higher, but you can qualify one day after a foreclosure or a short sale. That way, you can get into a home, and then refinance after your waiting period is over.

Last but not least, don’t forget to check out one of our favorite restaurants in Palm Beach: Old Key Lime House. Come and enjoy the great views, amazing food, entertainment, and a nice cocktail if you’re in the mood!

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact us!

Today, I’ll show you a few strategies to update your home and maximize the resale value. If you’re thinking about selling your property, there are a few things you can do to get top dollar.

First, look at your kitchens and baths. Kitchens are what sell homes, and baths are what keep buyers in that home. Now, that doesn’t mean you have to start from scratch on the kitchen. Instead, find a great new granite or quartz countertop that will help you achieve that luxury feel. You can also do simple things like updating your lighting and your faucets.

What else do you need to do? Many people need to simplify and reduce clutter. Having a light, open home will definitely help you get top dollar.

Plus, you always want your flooring to be in great condition, so **consider updating or replacing that used carpet. **

I have a few other tips for you, so give me a call or send me an email if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you!

How do the latest real estate statistics impact your home value? Today, I’ll go over some interesting information from the Palm Beach County real estate market. 

First of all, I want to show you the hottest market in Palm Beach County. The number one zip code for home sales is 33411. The people in Royal Palm are pleased with that. Last month, they had 99 closed home sales.

The top five markets are all Western Communities. These include cities like Palm Beach Gardens, Wellington, Lake Worth, and Boynton Beach, zip code 33437. Boynton Beach is an ideal area for seasonal guests.
 

Statistics also reveal the number of days on market is down year over year. However, that number has increased in the last couple of months. If you’re thinking about selling, it may take you a little bit longer to get that contract, so we need to talk about when the ideal time would be to list your property.

Inventory is growing. We’re still in a seller’s market overall, and some areas are in a very hot seller’s market. However, inventory is going up. The luxury market in particular is definitely seeing more and more homes come on the market. 

That said, 24 zip codes in Palm Beach County did not have a single sale last month. Not one condo, single-family home, or villa sold. There are really two different markets here in Palm Beach County. 

Now more than ever, real estate is incredibly local. To find out if you’re in a hot market or a cool market, just give me a call. I’m here to help. I look forward to hearing from you!
