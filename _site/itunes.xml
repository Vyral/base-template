        <description>

My new weekly series is the learning opportunity you&rsquo;ve been waiting for.

Want to ask me anything? Well now is your chance! I’m launching a weekly series on Fridays at 12 p.m. CST where, for 30 minutes, we’ll dive deep into one specific topic and dissect the tactics and strategies involved so you can implement them into your business.

I’ve found that, when given the right opportunity and the right learning environment, people always bring up the best questions. Wouldn’t it be so cool for us to learn and grow together? For many installments of this series, I’ll bring on special guests, and we’ll also be providing this live in “Your Journey With Jennie,” our closed Facebook group.

Just head to the home page and click on the events tab to RSVP. By doing so, you’ll receive an event reminder as well as the Zoom link so you can participate with us and be fully engaged! You’ll also be able to see this week’s topic so you can better prepare and get the most out of the discussion!

I look forward to talking with you soon. Of course, feel free to share any questions, ideas, or topics that are on your heart or in your mind. We’ll see you soon!

        <description>

By planning a &ldquo;Call in to Win Day,&rdquo; you can get people to call you.

What is the “Call in to Win Day,” and how can you make this event work for you?

The “Call in to Win Day” is a day where people call you and provide their contact information to enter a giveaway drawing. To pull this off successfully, you first need a goal, a plan, and a big enough giveaway to inspire people to want to call you. That’s where the challenge lies.

You’ll use the same marketing plan you have for any of your events and have a two- to three-week period where you’ll promote save-the-date notifications so they don’t forget about it. You want to make sure they call on that day, and within a certain time frame, for a chance to win. Make sure you enlist sponsors and vendor partners because they can pitch in to cover the cost while you help promote them along the way via social media and emails.

“You first need a goal, a plan, and a big enough giveaway to inspire people to want to call you.”

Now is the time to focus on what will happen during the day of the event. Our team used Zoom as a forum and had Google Voice feed each call to different team members. We also had Google Forms pulled up so we could input new data and record any referrals. We had a blast that day, and I know you will, too!

You also need to plan for after the event. We announce our winner the next day on Facebook Live and send out an email to each participant in case they miss it. After that, we make sure all new contact information is entered into our database, and every new contact receives a welcome campaign. Of course, if any referrals or other new introductions were made, we reach out to them as soon as possible and let them know we can help with all of their real estate needs.

If you have questions about how to make your own “Call in to Win Day” or there’s anything else I can assist you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d also love to know some of the ideas you come up with for this fun event!

        <description>

Here&rsquo;s why including a buyer &lsquo;love letter&rsquo; can be a game changer.

How are you being creative with helping your clients win the deal? I don’t know if your market is like mine here in Tulsa, but our listing inventory is low and the market is hot. We love to think outside of the box for our clients, and one way we do that is to encourage our buyer clients to write a ‘love letter’ when submitting their offer.

Writing a letter lets your buyer client share their genuine enthusiasm about the prospect of living in that home. Not only does it show the seller the buyer’s sentimental link to their property, but it also gives you, the agent, more insight into why your client is so interested in it—you get to learn some cool information about people sometimes!

Another reason why buyer love letters are great is that they allow us to show up for our clients as professionals. When we think outside the box and offer our buyers these sorts of ideas, it exemplifies our commitment to getting them into a new home.

Most importantly, buyer love letters help buyers win! They can get the contract moving and bring your buyers one step closer to their ideal home. It also humanizes the whole experience thereafter; the buyer, seller, and seller’s agents will be more connected and have a more positive working relationship throughout the transaction when it’s understood that everyone is equally invested in making this deal work.

“When we think outside the box for our buyers, it exemplifies our commitment to getting them into a new home.”

Let me know if you’re using buyer love letters in your offer and how this strategy is working out for you! As always, reach out with any questions or concerns you may have; I’m here to help!

        <description>

With a team, you can pass the baton to win in a transaction.

Have you ever run track or seen a relay race? If so, then you know the necessity of passing the baton from one team member to another. A good track coach will tell you that a relay is won or lost in the transfer of the baton.

We at The Wolek Group believe in the importance of passing the baton in real estate too. If you don’t have a team, you have no one to pass the baton to and must do all the work yourself. We pass three different batons during our real estate transactions.

First, when working with a seller, we pass a baton from the listing agent to the listing manager. The second baton is passed from the buyer agent to the transaction coordinator during pending, or from the listing manager to the transaction coordinator when working with a seller. Third, between 24 and 48 hours before closing is when the baton is passed back to the real estate agent from the transaction coordinator. This arms the agent with all the information they need to know before closing.

“What truly matters is communication between team members.”

When passing all these batons, what truly matters is communication between team members. Every time a baton is passed, it’s followed by a debriefing, a conversation between team members to ensure we completely understand all the intricacies and needs of the client. Anytime the ball is dropped it goes back to a lack of communication. We do our best to not allow that to happen; it’s our goal to win the relay! We win by getting to closing with elated clients.

If you want to learn more about how we pass the batons, I’m sharing the information in my closed Facebook group Your Journey With Jennie. Join today! If you ever have any questions about real estate, reach out to us via phone or email. We would love to help you.

It&rsquo;s time to learn how to put our systems into action!

Thank you to all the amazing real estate agents who joined me in June to learn how to “Mirror My Business!” I provided you with lots of systems, tools, and tips on how to build a big business, with much of it coming from your database. Today I’m excited to share with you a follow-up series and a deeper dive to teach you how to “Implement My Business,” launching in July!

For six weeks starting on July 7, we’ll hold 90-minute sessions in which we’ll discuss accountability and connect with like-minded agents who look forward to building a big business. I’ll even throw in a extra systems and tools that I couldn’t fit into the “Mirror My Business” workshop.

“I’m excited to dive deeper and share with you how to Implement My Business!”

I encourage you to sign up today! If you already attended the “Mirror My Business” workshop, simply send me an email and I’ll share the discount code with you. If you didn’t, that’s okay, because you’ll receive all the same materials and documents as the other students as well as links to my Google Drive!

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I can’t wait to see you and share how to implement my business strategies!

        <title>My Experience of Being Hacked & Deleted From Facebook</title>

        <description>

Getting your Facebook hacked stinks, but here&rsquo;s what I learned from it.

Recently my Facebook account was hacked and deleted. Here’s what I learned:

1. When we are a “serf on someone else’s digital land,” as a friend of mine phrased it best, bad things can happen. Every day, we willingly give our thoughts, insights, and pictures to social media.

2. Facebook and Instagram are connected—if you lose one, you lose them both! Ouch… again, it was not fun.

3. We must own where we put our content, or at least back it up, so that way if it’s lost, it’s not lost forever. I acted fast and reached out to my business coach and marketing friend for help.

4. I had an addiction. I used it to fool myself into thinking that I was always connecting with people and working when I was on those apps. I noticed that, on the first day of not having these apps, I still naturally kept going to the icons on my phone and clicking them. I finally deleted them and that helped a bit.

“Frustratingly, there is no way to contact a real human at Facebook for help.”

5. My mindset is strong. Sometimes, there are things in life that I cannot control. It’s OK! Once I realized the likely fate of what happened, I accepted it and moved on quickly to find solutions for the future.

6. I’m still gun shy with social media. Maybe I’m still a bit mad, too. Frustratingly, there is no way to contact a real human at Facebook for help. After a few days, I was able to create a new account, and I’m very slowly working through accepting new friend requests.

7. We always need to find the silver lining. I no longer have 5,000 Facebook friends, through which I must scroll to find someone to remove whenever I add a new friend. Though no longer publicly displayed on Facebook, all of my memories last within me and with my friends and family. I’ve left the Facebook and Insta apps on the last page of my phone, and the addiction has slightly subsided. I have been more present and focused on my work and family over the last five days.

I hope you found this encouraging, whether you’ve suffered such an experience or not. As always, please feel free to reach out to the Wolek Group by phone or email if you have any questions about real estate. We’re here to help (and a live person will always be there to talk to you).

I&rsquo;m sharing my morning routine, hoping it helps you with yours.

I often get asked about my morning schedule, so today I’m sharing it with you. Years ago, I learned that the most successful people, at least in my business, all had one thing in common: they got up early. To me, early meant 5 a.m., so that’s when I started getting up every day. I quickly noticed that it was a great way to get ahead of my day. Since I enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning, I decided to wake up even earlier—around 4:45 a.m.—to have some coffee, think, and prepare for the day ahead.

After my morning coffee and daily goal-planning, I exercise by doing some yoga, using the treadmill, or even going outside for a walk or run—anything that allows me to feel good about myself, both mentally and physically.

Then, I take a shower and have a smoothie for breakfast. I’ve had the same smoothie almost every morning for at least five years. It’s packed with all kinds of good things: spinach, a frozen triple berry blend, protein powder, etc. At this point, my stomach is full, my mind is good, and my heart is strong.

Since I’m the type of person who wears makeup and takes care of their hair, I’ll do that next before listening to a podcast or reading a book. Over time, I’ve learned that’s a way to think bigger and generate new ideas throughout the day.

Additionally, I write a post in a closed Facebook group called Your Journey With Jenny every single morning. Members can always tell what I’m working on, thinking about, and reading. Click on the above link to get permission to join if you haven’t already!

“When you plan out your morning with a powerful, intentional schedule, the rest of your day falls into place.”

Once I’m through with all that, I’ll connect with my team at 8:15 a.m. to share what we’re grateful for as well as what our intentions and goals are for the day. Then from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., we work on lead generation.

I’ve found that when you plan out your morning with a powerful, intentional schedule, the rest of your day falls into place and you’ll be more positive and ready to connect with others.

Feel free to reach out to me to share your morning routine! If there’s anything I can do to help, don’t hesitate to ask. I’m here for you.

        <description>

Many agents come and go in the real estate business. The Golden Handoff ensures their clients are taken care of after they leave.

I have been in the real estate business for a very long time, and no matter what is happening in the market, many agents come and go constantly. What’s sad about this is that those Realtors have put time, energy, money, and often their love into developing and nurturing tons of relationships.

When agents leave the business for any reason, their clients are just left there, without a real estate agent to help them. I believe all real state agents should think like the businessperson they are and ensure that their clients are taken care of in the future. They should have a plan. That’s what the Golden Handoff is.

The Golden Handoff is entrusting a database to another agent and receiving a referral fee in return. That new real estate agent will have a plan and stay in touch with these clients. How smart and simple is that? This doesn’t cost the departing agent any time, energy, or money.

“The Golden Handoff is entrusting a database to another agent and receiving a referral fee in return.”

Please let me know if you’ve used the Golden Handoff in your business, I’d like to hear about your experience with it.

If you have any questions about the Golden Handoff or real estate in general, reach out to me via phone or email. I would love to help you.

        <description>

Implementing a flexible commission plan is a great way to compete against agents who adjust their commission in order to win listings.

The market has shifted since the COVID-19 pandemic, and some agents are adjusting their commission in order to win listings. Even if your value proposition is much stronger to would-be clients than theirs, adjusted commissions are a hard thing to compete against. That’s why today I’ll talk about the benefits of implementing a flexible commission plan into your business. This offers your would-be clients options instead of ultimatums.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please reach out. We look forward to speaking with you.

        <description>

Here are the three ways we at The Wolek Group stay connected:

1. We have a Google Hangout call every morning at 8:15 a.m. This allows us to state our gratitude and share our intentions for the day. 

2. We have a team meeting every Monday at 11 a.m. This is an official meeting with an agenda. It also acts as a training session in case there are topics we need to cover. It’s a great way to keep an open dialogue about everything that’s happening. 

3. We use a communication tool called Slack. This allows us to consolidate all of our communication into one place. We’ve found that information can get lost through text and emails. With Slack, every channel is a different category, and it’s a great place to store our team’s communication. 

To accommodate our team and our clients during these trying times we are doing Zoom team meetings and virtual appointments.

“We’re always striving for success and making sure we deliver an amazing client experience, and communication is key.”

Communication can separate the great companies from the not-so-great ones. We’re always striving for success and making sure we deliver an amazing client experience, and communication is key. Communicating as a team is very important. It’s also important that our clients see this. 

Communication with our people is just as important, and we ensure this by creating a GPS for each year. Our goals, priorities, and strategies are outlined inside our marketing plan. Our goals are also placed inside our calendar so we can review them and send our 411s to each other every Monday morning. 

There’s lots to do and lots to stay on top of, but when you think big and break everything down, you see what the life of a very productive real estate professional looks like. Just take care of your most important items each day if you want to achieve greatness. 

If you’d like to talk about how you can improve your team’s communication or have any questions about this topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help.

        <description>

Today we’re talking about failures. What a lovely topic, right? I actually used to do a “Fail Forward Friday” series where I would share my failures and I think it was a great way to share with other agents that failure is actually just feedback. I think I stopped doing it because I didn’t want to dwell on my failures. However, I just heard a quote that changed my mind: “Success is just failure with enthusiasm.”

What I have noticed is that even though I look like I’m good at using leverage, it is something I’m not great at doing. 

“I have a great team, but I don’t always leverage them properly.”

I will find myself spending lots of focused time getting into the details of activities, especially when it comes to our database and administrative tasks. I like those things and am good at those things, but I often find that doing them uses up a lot of quality time that could have been used more efficiently in talking with people and finding people to help. 

I have agents on my team, and I have administrative rockstars, but I don’t always properly leverage them. The good thing is that I have awareness about this problem, which is something that all successful people have. Those who are working and committing to self-mastery, like myself, know they must learn how to leverage through people.

That’s my failure and I’m sharing it with you here because the first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem. I want to hear about your failures, too, so that we can all grow together.

If you have any other questions for me, I’m always here to answer them. Just give me a call or send me an email today.

        <description>

Date night is a fun idea for a client event, and it's super easy to implement, too!

Just in time for Valentine’s Day, the Wolek Group is hosting a Date Night event on Thursday, February 13. We’re offering take-and-bake pizzas and either a six-pack of beer or a bottle of wine to all those who RSVP for the event.

I bring this up because date night is a fun and easy way to reach out to and connect with the people in your database. You can get all sorts of touches from this kind of event, like promotion through video, or partnership with a nonprofit to help promote their organization.

The whole week leading up to this year’s Date Night event, we’re also doing a reverse BOLD 100, where clients call in to register to win a giveaway. Bear in mind that these giveaways have to be big enough to entice people to call in.

“You can get all sorts of database touches from this kind of event.”   When those interested in the giveaway do call in, we take that time to confirm their contact information and ask them if they know of anyone interested in buying, selling, or investing in real estate that we can contact; that way, we get a double entry.

We ALWAYS provide an Eventbrite link for them to RSVP for the giveaway, which we cap in numbers. For example, on our upcoming Valentine’s Day Date Night event, we have 100 pizzas that clients need to RSVP for in advance. Set up a call day a couple of days before the event to confirm the client’s RSVP and ensure they’re going to stop by for pick-up—people often forget to do that, so calling them ahead of time will help you adjust your numbers to avoid having extras. Be sure to partner with a vendor who can help you offset some of the costs, too.

There are tons of ways to touch your database, but date night is simple and fun. If you want to implement this event idea yourself and have questions about doing so, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to hear how your event goes and/or advise you on setting one up properly.

        <description>

Today I’m sharing one way that we have set ourselves apart from other agencies by surprising and delighting our clients.

Today I wanted to share a fun idea we have implemented in our business: welcome home signs. Over the years, we have worked to improve our client experience. When you work with us, we’ll help you achieve your real estate goals, of course—but we want to go the extra mile. 

One thing we came up with is creating a wonderful, surprise experience for our buyer clients when they arrive in their new home after closing. We place corrugated plastic letters across the front yard that spell out “Welcome Home.” Unlike a home that is currently listed, there usually isn’t a sign in a yard that says who sold the home. So, we added a sign that says “Sold by The Wolek Group.” It’s very simple, you can have it made easily, and of course, we added our brand to it. 

“We want to go the extra mile.” 
This is a pleasant way to surprise buyers and say congratulations. We get so many excellent responses from clients saying thank you for this. Then, after a few days, we come back and collect the signs. 

Some tips that we have learned about this are to make sure your signs are made of corrugated plastic. At first, we used cardboard, but they can easily be ruined by sprinklers and rain. Also, make sure you tell them you will be back for the signs because some have thrown them away after a few days. They aren’t super cheap, so you want to make sure you get them back. 

Let me know what other ways you surprise and delight your clients, either during or after a transaction. If you have any questions please contact me by phone or email. I would love to speak with you.

        <description>

Today I sat down for a chat with Nate Araskog, an agent here at The Wolek Group. He’s here to share his experiences as an agent on our team.

Before coming to The Wolek Group, Nate Araskog had obtained his real estate license and worked with Daniel Sprik, a Realtor and good friend of his who had encouraged him to get into the industry in the first place. 

I helped him to sell a couple of his properties before, so one day Nate and I met for coffee. It was supposed to have been a short introduction, but it ended up becoming a two-and-half-hour meeting. During that conversation, Nate saw my experience and the opportunities that lay in the foundation of my team’s structure and he decided he wanted to be a part of it.

For my part, the conversation over coffee had originally been about real estate in general, but toward the end, something clicked within me. I asked him, “Are you asking me all these questions to join Keller Williams or to join my team?”

“It’s fun to be on the front end of change within the real estate industry at large” 

With a smile on his face, Nate responded, “I don’t know—maybe both.”

With that, I recommended that he and I set up another time to get back together. We did, and the rest is history.

We’ve grown so much since then, and his experience with our team and with Keller Williams has been fabulous overall. It’s fun to be on the front end of change within the real estate industry at large.

By the time Nate and I met for that fateful coffee meeting, he was already a go-getter who found success as a single agent. What was he missing that helped him see the value of joining a team?

For him, the biggest factor was the opportunity to learn from someone who had experience. He knew that our team would provide the ability to help people as a part of an organization, not just a single agent. He knew from the first time we met that the partnership we could create by being in business together was going to be hugely successful for all of us.

If you have any questions about starting career in real estate or would like to contact us about joining The Wolek Group yourself, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to hear from you and discuss why making the switch to Keller Williams and The Wolek Group would be a great decision for the trajectory of your career.

        <description>

You’ve probably heard the term “playbook” recently and you may not be sure what it means. Here’s what you need to know.

What in the world is a “playbook” in the real estate world and why is everyone talking about it all the time? I was recently at a Mastermind, and it was definitely the buzzword of the event, so I figured I’d quickly touch on the value and power of having a playbook for your business.

A playbook is just a fancy name for a plan. You are going to document all of the events and marketing that you’ll do in your business to make sure that you are getting in all the proper touches to your database. They include all of your digital touches, marketing pieces involved in events, and more.

“Our playbook is in an Excel spreadsheet.” 

Your playbook has three main purposes: It’s a plan, it allows you to budget, and it holds you accountable. You make your plan based on your goals, and in order to achieve those goals, you need accountability behind them. At the end of the day, you have to be able to afford the plan and it has to produce a return on your investment.

Many teams and agents have a playbook. We do too. It’s on an Excel spreadsheet, where we can always see what’s coming up on our timeline to stay ahead of the curve.

I’d be happy to share our playbook with you if you’re interested in seeing what one looks like. If you want to take a look or if you have any other questions, feel free to reach out as well. I’d love to hear from you.

        <description>

Having showing and open house partners is a great way to better leverage your time as an agent.

As busy as we agents can get, we sometimes need help showing to buyer clients and hosting open houses. 

That’s why my team and I came up with the idea of having showing and open house partners—so we can leverage our time better and help our clients at the highest level. 

How does it work? We work with agents who agree to our standards and expectations of working with people. Communication is key when working with these agents. We have a plan and agreement in place, and we make sure they communicate with us as soon as the open house or showing ends so we can update our clients and make sure they’re taken care of.

“Communication is key when working with these agents”

There are pros and cons to this system. One of the pros is that we’re able to help our clients faster. One of the cons is that we’re the ones who have to make sure that our clients’ expectations are met. This system is risk-free in terms of bringing people into your world and onto your team, but you don’t have 100% control over how they work in the field when dealing with clients. 

The bottom line is that, by doing this, our agents can serve more clients and our clients are better taken care of—that’s what matters to us. 

If you have any questions about showing and open house partners or if there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

        <description>

Setting expectations on your team is critical, and today I’ll discuss why.

In any business, setting expectations is key—and this is especially true when you’re part of a real estate team. After all, the mutual success of everyone on that team depends on clear communication about the goals and strategies everyone holds. That’s why, today, I’d like to share what I expect of the people who work with me.

Personally speaking, I’ve recently done a lot of reflection on how my teammates can win and lose with me, and have found that both of these things are closely tied to Keller Williams’ Six Personal Perspectives.

“There are occasionally things that fall outside of anyone’s control, but the point is to always own up to the things you can control.”

For instance, victim language always rubs me the wrong way. It’s a deep-rooted pet peeve of mine to hear people blaming external influences on their personal success. On the flip side, I’m always happy to work and grow with people who hold themselves accountable. It’s all a matter of mindset. 

Of course, there are occasionally things that fall outside of anyone’s control, but the point is to always own up to the things you can control. That’s how you win with me. 

If you focus on what matters, admit accountability, and do what it takes to move yourself forward, it will be much easier for us to communicate effectively. 

As always, if you have any questions or would like more information about setting expectations or effective communication, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <title>Tips for Hosting a Pie Day Event</title>

        <description>

As you can see, it’s getting a little chilly here in Tulsa, which gets us in the mood for planning our annual pie event. A lot goes into this event, so today I wanted to take you through it step by step to show you all the systems, checklists, and everything else we do for our Pie Day.

This is our third annual Pie Day. The first one was pretty small. We only invited the clients we had helped buy or sell a home to test it out. Last year, we gave out over 100 pies to our raving fans who share referrals and introductions with us regularly. This year, we’re opening it up to our entire database and we’re very excited.

To plan your own Pie Day, you’ll first need to pick a date. We’ve been having the best luck with the Sunday on the week before Thanksgiving. This year, that’s Sunday, November 24. On a Sunday afternoon, most people are free to swing by and pick up a free pie. Then you’re going to have a cute little sticker or some other kind of swag, which they’ll take to their Thanksgiving where you get to be the hero with the pie.

Next, make sure you pick a location. We’ve had ours at a local bakery and our local market center. This year, we’re actually doing it at a local caterer who happens to be my sister.

You’ll need to set up an Eventbrite link in order for people to RSVP. We usually just serve the pies on a first-come, first-serve basis instead of having them reserve a specific type of pie. We usually get our pies at Costco for a great price and a great pie.

“Make sure you’re posting about the event on social media, too!”

We love giving back to our community, so we attach a non-profit to our event. Maybe your local Food Bank, or another great organization relating to the holiday needs of others. You can incorporate creating a video with the non-profit and share about all the good they are doing in the community. 

This year we are also adding in a Reverse BOLD 100 with a Thanksgiving meal giveaway, as we launch the Pie Day event. We’re asking for people to call in on a certain day to provide their contact information and they will be entered to win the drawing and also get a free pie!

Another video or email you might send out would be an announcement about the event. We typically send a postcard as well to all the people in our MET database. Then we call to confirm with those people on one day and another call the day after the event.

Our Pie Day theme this year is Fall Festival, so we’ll have some hot cider, cookies, and more for people when they come pick up their pies. It’s a family affair! 

One final note is to make sure you have a cutoff day for RSVPs so you can get the final number for the pies. Make sure you’re posting about the event on social media along the way, too!

If you have any questions for me about our Pie Day or about how you should be planning your own, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

It’s the beginning of the fourth quarter, and 2020 is right around the corner. We’re going to keep focused for the rest of this year, stick with our lead generation, and stay optimistic. 

People often ask me what the agenda is for our goal planning event. First, you need to have a meeting in October or November to plan for the next year, but October is best. Whether you’re a single agent or a big team, everyone needs to get together and plan for the coming year. This may take an entire day.

Some of our agenda items are the same each year. You should run this like an official meeting; have lender partners or title company friends come, bring in lunch or breakfast, and build in some fun and community. The team needs to know this is a business meeting, cell phones should be turned off, and everyone should display full focus. Our own meeting always starts with breakfast and an ice breaker to have some fun with the team.

“Whether you’re a single agent or a big team, everyone needs to get together and plan for the coming year.”

It’s critical to reflect on the goals we set for this year. What were our goals, how did we do, where are we in relation to those goals, and what were our missteps? We will check our “GPS,” which stands for goals, priorities, and strategies. Where did we blunder, what can we get better at, what can we tweak? By setting these goals you can detect any gaps. Everyone should agree on what the team’s standards are. 

You should end the day with some kind of fun, maybe a happy hour out or a teambuilding activity. 

Let me know what you do to have an amazing planning day for next year. 

If you have any questions or would like to speak to me, please call or send me an email, I would love to help.

        <description>

Today I want to talk to you about an “aha moment” my team and I recently had concerning our database. 

As many of you might remember, a few years back I decided to spend some serious time on my team’s database—cleaning it up, properly tagging contacts, etc. The end product was a cleaned-up ‘Met’ database comprised of 1,200 of our past clients, friends, family, colleagues, and people we know in the community or have had a real estate-related conversation with. For our Met database, we use a higher-level touch system than we would for databases containing contacts we’ve received minimal information from.  

That aside, let’s talk about the aforementioned aha moment: At the start of football season every year, we send out a football-themed magnet to our clients. Football matters a lot to us Oklahomans. To give our clients a heads up that their magnet is on the way, we film a fun video that goes to Facebook and to our database. 

Then, once we know all the magnets are out, we’ll go a step further and call each of our contacts to check that theirs came and to ask which team they cheer for on Saturdays. We make sure to weave our call to action into the conversation as well by expressing our team’s goals and asking the client if they know of anyone who may need help buying, selling, or investing in real estate. 

“As I’ve learned from this experience, you should never stop learning new things and refining your skills in this business.”

We sent this year’s magnets out last year and, as you can tell, a lot of them came back as return to sender—40, in fact. I then blocked off some time to determine where those 40 people moved, why they moved, and why we weren’t able to help them move. Probing a little deeper provided much-needed clarity and gave us a chance to clean up our database even further. 

From that situation, we learned a valuable lesson: Although our touch system already included mailing various items to our clients year-round, we weren’t always springing for first-class mail. Getting 40 magnets returned to us was a wake-up call for us to start spending a little extra on our mailing method, so we can stay on top of our database. 

I also used this as an opportunity to send an email out to our entire database (Met database and all), letting them know we had some leftover magnets and that if they replied back with their home address, we’d gift one to them just in time for football season. A handful of clients have already replied back with their home address, which means we can now move them over to our ‘Met’ database! 

As I’ve learned from this experience, you should never stop learning new things and refining your skills in this business. What might seem like a waste of money at first can turn out to be a win if you get a little creative.  

If you have any questions or would like more tips for improving and tweaking your business, please reach out to me. I’d be happy to help!

        <description>

It’s finally time to explore the fifth and final “S” of the Five-S model of customer experience: Sustain. At this point, you’ve set expectations, kept your clients updated along the way, you’ve surprised and delighted throughout the transaction, and now it’s over. Once you’ve done all of this, now it’s time to sustain the relationship in order to create a client for life. 

You need to make them feel special, but it doesn’t require a ton of effort or planning. First off, make sure you call them a few days after closing to thank them for allowing you to help them. This is also a surprise and a nice thing to do. It’s not a call for a referral; it’s purely a gratitude phone call.

To properly sustain a relationship, you have to have a touch program in place. If it’s already built out on your calendar, you won’t forget to keep those who are most important to you in the loop. 

“You have to have a touch program in place.”

So many people think that real estate agents are just money hungry. When you don’t call someone after closing or maintain your relationship with them, you’re essentially proving their point. I know that’s not who you are, so that’s why you need to take steps now to make sure you stay in touch with all of your clients in the future.

Let me know some of the ways that you stay in touch with past clients. We use a lot of events and giveaways to increase engagement, but we’d love to hear about what you’re doing. 

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

In the latest installment of our video series on the Five-S Model of customer experience, we’ll talk about the fourth S: surpass.

I’ve found that the more I teach about customer experience, the more attuned to it I become as an observer—whether the experience was amazing or left much to be desired. In the real estate business, we should always be looking for ways that we can be better for our clients, and the “surpass” component of the Five-S Model is an opportunity for us to surprise and delight them. 

Besides giving clients updates, checking in with them, asking for feedback, and satisfying all the basics of an overall great experience, it’s important to look for ways that we can go the extra mile and surpass expectations. As I travel around and meet with other agents, I continue to learn new ideas for doing this. Here’s one: As soon as your buyer or seller goes under contract, surprise them with a gift. Perhaps you can deliver packing tape, champagne or wine, or some other small gesture that celebrates the occasion.

“The “surpass” component of the Five-S Model is an opportunity for us to surprise and delight our clients.”

On top of that, rather than advising them to do this or that, look for opportunities to do certain things for your client. For example, if the seller you’re representing is moving out of their home in the coming days, show them that you’re willing to go above and beyond by bringing in a professional carpet cleaner, mowing their lawn one last time, or helping to offset their costs if that’s part of your approach.   Finally, your extra efforts should have the element of surprise and need to be carried out in a systematic, organized fashion. The best way to do this is to set reminders so that no matter how busy you get in your life and career, you don’t forget this important part of bolstering your customers’ experience. Of course, just because you have a system, it doesn’t mean you can’t personalize your gifts as well. 

You don’t even have to reinvent the wheel. Whether it’s other real estate teams or leaders in entirely different industries like Nordstrom’s, Southwest, Disneyworld, or anyone you notice providing a world-class customer experience, there are other models out there that you can look to.  

If you have any questions or if you’d like to share with me the unique ways in which you surprise and delight your clients, please give me a call at 918-706-9845 or send me an email at Jennie@TheWolekGroup.com. I look forward to hearing from you!

Now, he’s going to explain how he did it.

        <description>

Welcome back to another episode of “Your Journey with Jennie.” Today we’re continuing our look at the Five-S model of customer experience with the third “S”: Survey.

After you have set up expectations with your clients and are in an agreement together, you’re going to survey with them along the way to figure out how you’re doing. This includes checking in with them and getting feedback. If you’re implementing “The Promise” into your business, this is going to be part of your plan.

If we don’t ask, we don’t know and we won’t be able to correct any communication problems or errors to get better as soon as possible.

“If we don’t ask, we don’t know.”

There are plenty of different ways to survey. One way is with a system to measure and survey your clients after closing. Another way is to use surveys and reviews online post-closing. This could be done through apps, websites, or you could create your own. 

Feedback is so important because you never want to assume how you did. You want others to tell you. If you do a great job and they leave a great review, that will attract even more business to you.

If you have any questions for me about surveying or want to tell me about how you check this box in your business, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

What does it mean to serve our clients?

It means that whatever we told them we were going to do, we must do. People conduct business with people they trust, and it’s our job to make sure we live up to the way we present ourselves in our listing consultations or buyer presentations. 

In other words, we must be the person we promised we would be. If we don’t do something we said we would do, people lose trust in us. 

There are standards when it comes to building and maintaining communication, and these standards apply to our teams as well as our clients. What are your communication standards in terms of how often you reach out to your clients? It has to at least be weekly, right?

We also have to communicate with our clients in other ways, and this will be leveraged through technology. This can include your CRM and other client management systems that allow you to touch base with them.

“If we don’t do something we said we would do, people lose trust in us.”

Additionally, you’ll leverage through people. Perhaps you have people on your team who’ll be in touch with your clients, so you want to make sure they’re properly set up and introduced to them. 

Lastly, you’ll leverage though your vendor partners. During the home buying or selling process, you’re working with other people who are actually a part of your team as well. 

With that being said, there are four tips you need to remember to facilitate great communication with your clients:


  Tell them what you’re going to do.
  Ask lots of questions and listen intently.
  Communicate with them weekly—I encourage this to be at least a phone call attempt. If they don’t answer, follow up with a text or email reiterating your message.
  Never put off bad news. No matter how bad it is, you have to get it over with, and if you have any part in this bad news, you have to own up to it and move forward. 


If you have any questions about this aspect of the Five-S  model of the customer experience, don’t hesitate to call or email me. In the meantime, stay tuned for future videos where I’ll spotlight the other S’s so that you can have a better understanding of how to boost the quality of your customer experience.

For any other questions or comments you may have, feel free to reach out to me and my team. We’d love to have a conversation with you.

        <title>What Special Services Do You Offer Clients?</title>

        <description>

As you may have heard, The Wolek Group has recently made a few additional services available to our seller clients. On top of this, we also occasionally run special offers—one of which being our offer to pay for a pre-listing inspection and appraisal. 

We’re already seeing awesome results from this, which is why I wanted to share this update with all of you today. Yesterday, for example, we helped a client close who had been on the market for seven months without any offers prior to meeting us. They were financially and emotionally stressed, so when we were able to offer to pay for a pre-listing inspection and appraisal before re-listing their property, they couldn’t have been happier.

“Open your mind to new ways you can serve your clients.”

When the appraisal came in, we discovered that their house had been overpriced by about $57,000 during their previous listing attempt. This might not be what the seller wanted to hear, but it was important in helping them succeed. This is exactly why pre-appraisals are so valuable. 

Hopefully, this message has helped open your mind to new ways you could potentially serve your clients. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

As a fellow KW agent hailing from Tacoma, Washington, Ruthy Taylor has plenty of advice to give to other agents seeking guidance in their careers, and I’m pleased to be able to sit down with her today and delve into the secrets to her success. 

Here are the timestamps of our conversation so you can jump ahead to any section(s) that interest you the most:

  2:33 - How she’s achieved success in her career
  6:21 - Her advice for other agents 
  8:08 - Why it’s important for new agents to find time to pursue the things they enjoy outside of real estate
  9:39 - Her advice for older agents who are feeling burnt out
  12:10 - What her original group looked like and what she would do differently with it this time around
  13:54 - Are the people in her group automatically entered into her MET database? Does she start marketing them as a real estate professional?
  15:48 - What she has in store for the future of her group
  20:11 - Other lead sources she maintains for her business


If you have any questions or referrals for Ruthy, you can give her a call at (206) 718-3933 or email her at ruthytaylor@kw.com. 

As always, if you have any questions for me, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you.

“Ruthy has been able to get a lot of business without actively pursuing it.”

        <description>

What kind of experience do you give your clients? Is it good? Could it be great? 

I don’t know about you, but every day I think about ways to provide a better customer experience for everyone that I meet out in the community or otherwise.

In the customer experience class that I’ve been teaching, I use the Five-S model, and today, I’ll demonstrate what the first of those five S’s means.

The first S stands for “set.” We know that in providing a great customer experience (and having an awesome business), we first need to know our own value proposition.

“Whenever you’re in the process of delivering a great customer experience, you first present your value proposition to your clients and set your expectations.”

Year after year, I sometimes find myself struggling to figure out what makes me unique. What helps us, as a team, stand out from other agents in town? In my class, we really dig deep into discovering your own personal value proposition, as well as one for your team.

Whenever you’re in the process of delivering a great customer experience, you first present your value proposition to your clients and set your expectations. To set expectations, listen to your client’s needs, understand what their expectations are, and then verify that you’re both on the same page. 

In future videos, I’ll walk you through the other four S’s so that you can have a better understanding of how to boost the quality of your customer experience.

If you’re interested in learning more about the customer experience, you can find my class on KWConnect. I also have developed a shortened version, so contact me if you’re interested in that coming to your city.

For any questions or comments you may have, feel free to reach out to me and my team. We’d love to have a conversation with you.

        <description>

Are you familiar with the quote, “You can be anywhere you want to be in five years?” Too often, we overestimate what we can do in one year and underestimate what we can do in five. 

As I reflect back on the past five years, in my life and my business, I see that I’ve grown by implementing the Six Personal Perspectives.  Our production has grown by almost 100% and we feel so honored and be able to help so many families. 

Since then, we’ve been able to help so many more. Last year, for example, we helped 135 families in their real estate endeavors, and we’re on track to surpass that in 2019.

“When you’re able to define where you want to be and why you do what you do, you can achieve any and every goal you’ve set for yourself.”

The secret to success is implementing the Six Personal Perspectives into your life and business. I did this very thing and, over the course of five years, I’ve been able to double my production. These are the Six Personal Perspectives: 


  Working daily on self-mastery 
  Focusing on what matters most, or following the 80/20 principle
  Move from “E” to “P”
  Being learning-based
  Removing your limiting beliefs
  Being accountable to achieving your goals by a coach 


The coalescence of these six points allowed me to go from E to P—entrepreneurial to purposeful. As you think about and reflect on your own life, dedicate some thought to your future. When you’re able to define where you want to be and why you do what you do, you can achieve any and every goal you’ve set for yourself.

If you have any questions or thoughts about the Six Personal Perspectives, feel free to let me know. They’ve changed my life and I know they’ll change yours as well. If you have any other questions related to real estate, you can reach out to me as well. I’d love to hear from you!

I recently had a friend who reached out to me and said this: “I’m noticing a great return on my met database. Now I need to know how to get more of them.”

As we know, the more mets we have in our database, the more business we’re going to get. When we’re properly applying a 36-touch program, that should produce a 12:2 return on our database. Here are the three things I told this friend to consider:

1. Host Housewarming parties. Many other teams and businesses have implemented this in order to build their database with mets. Once you help a buyer find a home and once they’re all moved in, tell them you’d love to throw a housewarming party for them. All you need is their invite list: names, email addresses, and home addresses of all of them. You’ll send invitations, reminders, and calls to all their friends at the party, and afterward, you have all their contact information. It’s an awesome way to build your database and have fun at the same time.

“All you need to throw a housewarming party is an invite list.”

2. Promote local business owners. A lot of us have these kinds of people in our database already. Promoting them not only adds value, but it also gets their name out there. You can also reach out to the non-business owners in your database and ask them who they know that has a great local business. Then, you can add them to your service provider list. 

3. Ask your attendees to invite a friend. That’s just another way you can broaden your circle and meet more people with a warm relationship that can also go in your database.

These are just a few ways that show you how building your met database, and having a referral- and relationship-type business is the way to go. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Today I just wanted to chime in real quick about getting out of production. I know that this is a dream for so many of us, where we get to say that we’re out of production. However, the truth is that you will never truly be out of production until you sell off your business and have nothing to do with it anymore. As long as you are the owner of the company, there’s always a chance that you’ll have to dip your toe back into production.

Everyone’s striving for these big production numbers, but sometimes their bank account suffers and their profit is dismal. When we plan our own business, run our own lives, and set our own goals, we need to remember that we must run our real estate business like a business. This means watching our P+L and our bottom line.

“We’re solely responsible for our businesses.”

We’re solely responsible for the business. If that means getting back “into” production after you’ve been out of it for a while, that’s OK. You’re not betraying your goals by doing that. You’re just taking ownership of the bottom line like you should be. Sometimes you might have to jump in every once in a while. That’s how you built your business, right?

Of course, our businesses are all unique and always changing, but the goal is to be profitable and do what you love. If you have any questions for me or need anything in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

For today’s real estate success story, I’ve got a treat for you: Matt Aitchison from Sacramento, California. Not only does he have so much energy and enthusiasm, but he’s also an all-around awesome guy.

Matt and I met years ago at the Keller Williams event, Recharge. The fun part of those events is that when you move to higher levels in terms of growth and the talent that surrounds you, you make so many new friends; Matt agrees that that has contributed in no small amount to his success.

Matt has had quite the journey in his career, and where he is today isn’t necessarily where he thought might have been years ago. And so today, I’d like to have a discussion with him about his journey and what he’s done to grow and develop his skills in the real estate industry.

For your convenience, I’ve provided timestamps below so that you can navigate the conversation in the video above at your leisure:

3:30—How Matt, jobless and full of debt, entered the real estate game8:20—Matt’s advice for real estate agents who aren’t sure about their direction14:40—Matt’s brand, social media presence, and process for making a name for himself19:30—The value of recording yourself and creating a training library for new agents 22:20—Matt’s wealth-building process: Becoming a millionaire through real estate

I was blown away by how much value Matt managed to pack into our short conversation, and I’m so glad I got to speak with him.

If you’d like to follow Matt’s social media, send referrals, or ask him questions, he can be reached on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter with the handle @OfficialMattyA. He also has all sorts of tools, resources, and paid content on his website, www.MattAitchison.com. Further still, you can listen to either of his podcasts, “6-Figure Flipper” and “Millionaire Mindcast,” for more information about him and his process.

If you have any questions for the Wolek Group, you are always encouraged to reach out to us. We’d love to speak with you soon.

        <title>Be a Fiduciary Agent—Not a Functionary One</title>

        <description>

Many years ago, when I first read “The Millionaire Real Estate Agent” by Gary Keller, I was introduced to these terms, but I skimmed right over them. Now I know that it’s important to know the difference between them, because that difference is vast. 

Functionary means you’re doing just enough to get your clients to the closing table and collect your commission check. Fiduciary, on the other hand, means putting all of your clients’ needs before your own. Being a fiduciary agent means you must care about your clients and make it your goal to help them achieve all of their real estate goals. That’s why we do what we do, and that’s what sets us apart from all the other real estate agents out there—we care about our clients.

“Our clients are trusting us with one of the biggest transactions of their lives, and our needs shouldn’t interfere with theirs.”

Have you ever witnessed a real estate transaction where the agent is pushing, pushing, pushing to get things to move faster than they need to move, and all the while they’re creating unnecessary stress? Or, has that ever been you?

I know I’ve been there before. There have been times in my career where I was desperate for a closing to happen. Either because I needed to pay bills or there were other debts I had to pay off, I needed a commission check, and that created a sense of urgency. Pushing through the process because of a sense of urgency is not a good place to come from. It’s not an ethical place to come from, either. Our clients are trusting us with one of the biggest transactions of their lives, and our needs shouldn’t interfere with theirs. 

So, what’s the best way to be a fiduciary agent? Generate leads. When you have a pipeline of future buyers and sellers you can look forward to helping, you won’t have to be anxious or stressed while doing business, and that stress won’t affect your clients. Lead generating enables you to step back and truly examine how you can help them through each transaction. You’ll also have happier, healthier relationships with other agents and vendors. 

If you’d like to talk more about how you can be a fiduciary agent instead of a functionary one or you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.

        <description>

While on my way to a listing appointment, I thought it would be a good idea to show you how the Wolek Group prepares, with a look at our listing bag. 

Whenever we have a listing appointment and it’s time for us to go, we pick up a “swag bag” which includes a lot of goodies inside.

The first thing in there is a black folder that contains our tiered service level agreement, comparables from the neighborhood, and tax records. Then, we have our listing presentation manual in there to show them how we’ll market their home. This all stays with the client.

“Let me know about the fun things that you do for your clients.”

There’s another black folder that contains things that need to go back to our office, such as our “Pass the baton” form, our VIP Questionnaire, and a paper listing agreement. There’s also an addressed envelope in there for us to send them a thank-you note after the appointment.

Some other fun things in the bag include a branded water bottle, a branded sticky note pad, a pen, and branded packing tape and a sharpie.

Let me know the fun things that you guys do for your clients and the different ways you get ready to win your listing appointments. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

As agents, we know that we need to reach out to our database many times throughout the year. No matter how many database touches you shoot for, they need to be consistent, persistent, and strategic. 

To give you an example, I’ll talk about some of the quarterly calls my team and I have done in the past to stay in touch with our database. Our goal behind this process is to reach out to everyone in our database (i.e., everyone we have a phone number for) four times a year. 

During the first quarter, we’ve picked a call that’s generic, informative, and provides value. In it, we’ll say something to the effect of, “Do you have any real estate plans this year? We’re just planning out our calendar, so we want to make sure we’re available and ready when you are.” It’s a simple, easy call inquiring for business in a nice way.

Another call we’ve used follows the “I’m in a contest” script from the BOLD class. This is an easy script that’s also a fun way to talk to people.

“No matter how many database touches you shoot for, they need to be consistent, persistent, and strategic.”

A call that we’ve used during the third quarter is our “concierge call.” For this, we just ask them if there’s anything we can do for them. We also share our HomeKeepr app with them in case they’d like to download it. 

Lastly, the easiest and most fun call to make is the “gratitude script,” which also comes from the BOLD class. Here, we simply tell them how grateful we are and thank them for helping us have a great year. 

Another thing we’ve done is combine these four calls with events we have already planned for the year that they’re invited to. Every single event is a way to give back to our database, and some examples include: 


  A pizza pie giveaway, happening March 14
  An upcoming Tulsa Drillers game
  A Thanksgiving pie giveaway, for which we’ll use the gratitude script


The goal for these is to invite people we haven’t officially met yet so they can work their way into our inner circle. 

If you’d like to talk more or share ideas about how to connect with your database, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d love to speak with you.

        <description>

We’ve implemented something new in our business that will help us grow relationships with other business owners, bolster our database, and, best of all, have a lot of fun! You can do this exact same thing with your business and create a powerful network for yourself, your colleagues, and other business owners.

We’ve created an event called BOSS—business owners sharing strategies. The goal for us is to become the local professionals who create and enhance relationships among members of our community, especially in regard to like-minded business people.

“A wonderful network united before us.”

We invited people we know—database members, vendors, partners, colleagues, and essentially all types of business owners—to a mastermind session. While attendees enjoyed food and drinks, we were able to go around the room and have everyone introduce themselves, say what they’re good at, and also share what they struggle with. 

Everyone worked together and shared brilliant ideas, and a wonderful network united before us. By implementing your own BOSS event, you’ll be able to add value, give back, meet people, and share and learn new ideas.

If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

If you’re with Keller Williams, you may have recently seen her on the big stage at our mastermind—she did an awesome job, and we’re all proud of her.

Today I want to show you the conversation I had with her about her history as an agent, and how she’s managed to come so far in her career.

  8:15—The importance of the ISA role in the real estate hiring process
  9:40—Setting the record straight about the experience required to be an ISA
  10:50—Finding an ISA who is committed to the role
  17:20—The top sources ISAs need to master in order to be successful // The importance of focus

  20:20—The advice Anna received from Gary Keller
  22:20—Anna’s recommendations for a great follow-up system
  24:15—Taking creative license with your follow-ups
  25:40—Trends that Anna has noticed regarding the evolution of the ISA role


Anna is doing an amazing job in her role and I’m so glad I could speak with her today. If you’d like to reach out to her to learn more from her expertise in the field, she can be reached via email at mapscoachanna@gmail.com, via Facebook in the group called ISAMastermindGroup, or also via the website www.isamapscoaching.com, where she has a number of recorded webinars available for viewing.

        <title>The Mindset That Makes Someone Coachable</title>

        <description>

What makes you coachable?

When someone asked me this question at a recent Q&amp;A session in Atlanta, I had to think about it deeply. I’d never been asked this before, but I believe I’ve found my answer.

When you’re investing in yourself by hiring a business coach, you should be completely committed to every second of your time together. I know that every moment I spend with a coach means money and value for myself in the future, so I choose to squeeze everything I can from these 30-minute sessions. There’s no time to complain or make excuses.

“You must be open-minded and allow new ways of doing things to come into your world.”

So when I asked my coach what it was that made someone coachable, he told me this:


  They always show up out of curiosity. 
  They’re always looking to grow their business and themselves.
  They’re willing to grow, learn, fail, and succeed at a high level.
  They have an insane desire to be better.


Sometimes, we go without defining what makes us who we are. I remember saying once, “I am open to receive.” This is the biggest point I’d like to make: You must be open-minded and allow new ways of doing things to come into your world. Then, you must put these things into action and hold yourself accountable to accomplishing them. This is the only way that a coach will truly be able to help you succeed.

What do you believe makes you coachable? If you don’t think you’re capable of being coached for the time being, what do you need to do to change that? Whether you’re already taking advantage of a great coaching service or would like to in the future, I’d love to hear from you and help in any way I can. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

        <description>

In the latest episode of Your Journey With Jennie, I sat down with Vanessa Pollock of Pollock Properties Group and Keller Williams Real Estate in Northern New Jersey to talk a little bit about her and her agents’ success secrets. I attended a great class of hers called “Care, Serve, Give” at Keller Williams Family Reunion and it blew my mind. I was so excited to sit down and pick her brain about real estate and all the wonderful things that come with it. Here’s an outline of our discussion, with timestamps so you can skip around to the topics that interest you the most:

1:15- An introduction to Vanessa, her business, her career development, and her business goals.

8:15- How a change in Vanessa’s mindset changed her outlook and changed the growth of her business.

11:15- A quick look at what Vanessa’s team looks like right now.

““Care, Serve, Give” was a huge eye-opener for me.”

14:50- How to see Vanessa’s listing package and buyer package online to model your own after.

16:00- Vanessa’s Unique Value Proposition and how it has driven her business toward success.

23:00- How Vanessa is sharing her “Care, Serve, Give” model with her community.

24:30- The third leg of Vanessa’s business model and how it’s been able to give her motivation.

27:30- Vanessa’s advice for those of you in a funk or unsure of where to go next in your journey.

31:50- How to contact Vanessa if you or someone you know has any real estate needs in her area.

Thanks again to Vanessa for joining me. If you have any questions for me in the meantime about anything we discussed here or anything else relating to your real estate career, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

I just wrapped up a Keller Williams Really Live Stream with Shaina Moats, an agent from Austin, Texas, who is also a Labs Unleashed instructor with Keller Williams. We talked about how we can best prepare ourselves for the upcoming launch of the new KW Command operating system, and I’d like to share some of our preparation tips with you.

It’s a good idea to clean up your database by updating contact information, such as emails, phone numbers, addresses, names, etc. Being sure you have the correct info will make all the difference before KW Command, and the benefits of doing so will be felt even more once KW Command arrives. While you’re making updates, why not take some time to touch base with your database? Call some numbers, send some emails, and so on. Connect however you can; this is a relationship business, after all. 

“Connect however you can; this is a relationship business, after all.”

If you’re a Keller Williams agent, another thing to do is open up your Kelle app. Say “add insights” in the app to update your location. From here, you can take pictures, add comments, and broadcast what you think of the area you’re in. When the consumer KW mobile app is updated in the near future, potential homebuyers will be able to see the information you’ve posted. As they’re scanning a neighborhood to get ideas, your comments and info will pop up. If they see that you’re the one adding all the information, they’ll think you really know the area and can serve their needs the best!

These are just a few things I recommend. If you’d like more information or have any questions, reach out to me. I look forward to helping you.

        <title>Why I’m Running a Marathon in 2019</title>

        <description>

If we’re connected on social media and you’ve seen any of my latest posts, you know that I’ve signed up to run the 2019 New York City Marathon. 

I used to scoff at the idea of running a marathon, but I realized recently that over the past couple of years, I’ve developed some good habits about getting up early and doing some form of exercise. However, this exercise was usually just walking on the treadmill. That’s why, as I was planning my 2019 goals, I felt like I needed to challenge myself from a health perspective. 

When you start having these thoughts, the right people tend to show up in your life. I was in California recently teaching a business class, and afterward I had lunch with one of the attendees. During our conversation, I realized that although I was supposed to be coaching him, I was going to learn a lot more from him than he was from me.

“If you’re not growing, you’re dying.”

You see, this person loves coaching people too, and he shared with me what his passion and purpose was in life: running. He loves to run, and he has run 37 marathons in his life. Before I left that day, he told me, “I see you running a marathon. I see you as a runner.”

Well, guess what? I have my own running coach now, and that’s exactly what I’m going to do! 

The point of this story is, whether it’s life or business, keep betting on yourself and keep pushing yourself. If you’re not growing, you’re dying. My 46th birthday is coming up soon, and I’m choosing to do something that’s outside of my comfort zone. I’d love it if you could help keep me accountable and motivated along the way. 

As always, if you have any questions for me or there’s anything I can help you with in your career, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to speak with you.

        <description>

Years ago, I felt super frustrated and was ready to burn out of the real estate business. I was working like crazy and neglecting what was most important in my life. 

Then, however, I tried a mission statement exercise at a class I’d been taking, and that’s when I discovered my personal passion. 

I learned that I loved training, teaching, and sharing everything I’ve learned over the years with other real estate agents. I feel it’s my duty to help as many agents as possible with their struggles and show them how to live a counterbalanced life so they can help other families buy and sell homes and spend quality time with their own family.

“I learned that I loved training, teaching, and sharing everything I’ve learned over the years with other real estate agents.”

By discovering my personal mission statement, I set myself on the path to becoming a Keller Williams University instructor. For a long time, I was held back from doing this by a fear of public speaking. I started teaching in my own market center, though, and I eventually created my own class that allowed me to practice speaking in front of others. That’s when I really got the confidence to achieve this goal. 

Becoming an instructor takes a lot of time, energy, and focus. You have to take two classes and teach until you have at least 75 good reviews from your former students. After that, you need to be regionally approved. Finally, you need the approval of three team leaders in their respective market centers.

It took me two years, but I’ve grown a lot by being on this journey, and it all started by discovering my passion. If becoming an instructor sounds like something you’d be interested in doing, I’d love to share more of my story with you. Also, remember that I’m certified to teach and train all over, so if you’d like me to visit your area, I’d be happy to oblige. 

As always, if you have any other questions or there’s anything else I can share with you, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking to you.

        <description>

Using vision boards is something I have personally been doing for many, many years, and I absolutely love it. It has had a huge impact on my life and career, and it can do the same for you. 

The technique of using vision boards has been so helpful for me that I’ve decided to share it with my team during our next meeting. I can’t wait to show my team members how to create their own vision boards, and this got me thinking—I’d like to share this technique with all of you, as well.

“It’s awesome to dream big, but it’s even more awesome to realize those dreams.”

You’ve got to dream big to see big results in your life and your career. Creating a vision board is as simple as compiling visual elements in a single place to encourage a goal. However, the secret behind a successful vision board is that you have to do it with intention. You can’t simply create a board and wait for results. You need to carry the intention to succeed in your heart as you move forward toward your goals. 

So when you consider your own goals, also think about what you’re doing to give them purpose and to make them happen. It’s awesome to dream big, but it’s even more awesome to realize those dreams. If you have a vision board of your own, or if you plan to make one, I’d love to hear about it. Reach out to me anytime. 

As always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

As a real estate agent, one of the worst feelings one can experience is letting a lead or referral “slip through the cracks” or neglecting to nurture the needs of an existing client just by unintentional forgetfulness. If this has happened to you, you’re certainly not alone.

Amidst the busyness of our day-to-day lives, it can be easy to completely forget to connect with those you should be serving. Of course, that’s business you’ve now lost and is a stumbling block for you in reaching your goals. But it isn’t just about what you’re missing out on—it’s also potentially one less family that could have been helped in a timely way.

“This all-too-common occurrence has motivated us to take up what my team and I call ‘No Lead Left Behind.’”

This all-too-common occurrence has motivated us to take up what my team and I call “No Lead Left Behind.” The principle behind this initiative is familiarizing ourselves with the needs of our clients and being responsive when those needs arise. 

My team and I have wasted no time in getting on the same page and making sure that we’re all working in a collaborative way to address all clients, referrals, and leads. This is, after all, how we can ensure that there’s No Lead Left Behind. 

And let us know if there are any tips or “hacks” you’ve put into practice that you think might be worth mentioning! 

Please don’t hesitate to connect with us. We’d love to hear your thoughts!

        <description>

How are you tracking your numbers and your accountability?

A lot of times in our business, we talk about a tool called the 4-1-1. If you’re like me, I’m always challenged to figure out what should be on my 4-1-1. With my team members, it’s always confusing and clarity is often needed.

The 4-1-1 is important in your weekly and daily accountability, but how do you even build a 4-1-1?

“You take your one-year goal, then break it down to a one-month plan, and within that month, you break it down to four weeks.”

A great reminder and tool is the book, “The One Thing,” by Gary Keller and Jay Papasan. It’s an amazing book to read to help you become super clear on your goals. There’s a section in the book called “The Seven Circles.” Unsurprisingly, it’s a diagram featuring seven circles which each person needs to fill out according to the following areas of their life:


  Spiritual life
  Physical health
  Key relationships
  Job
  Business
  Finance


The section lays out what is called “goal-setting to the now.” That means taking our dreams of the future and somehow chunking them down to one-year goals. The one-year goal is how 4-1-1 works: You take your one-year goal, then break it down to a one-month plan, and within that month, you break it down to four weeks.

With that, I challenge you to do this exercise. Take out seven pieces of paper and write out each of the categories at the top. For each, write down what that area would look like in your wildest dreams, if you could live your perfect life. I like to write out some phrases about what matters to me in each category. Highlight a couple from each, and then repeat the exercise: What would you have to do within five years to make those goals a reality? Then cut it down even more: What would it take to make it happen within the next year? Create measurable goals so you can track your own success throughout the process, and live your very best life.

If you have any questions or fun tips related to goal-setting to the now, your GPS, or your 4-1-1, please feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.

        <description>

One of the secrets to our team’s success is the fact that we send out pre-listing video emails to our potential seller clients. This not only helps them to put a face to our brand, but it also helps demonstrate that we have the tools they’ll need to succeed with their home sale. 

And to give them an even more thorough understanding of what we do, we also like to send out our listing manual. The reason we do this, along with asking clients to list the features they love about their home, is to help guide our clients through the smoothest possible listing process. For this same reason, we also ask that they fill out a listing disclosure at this point. That way, clients can be set on the right track before we ever meet for our listing appointment. 

In addition to these materials, we also send out links to our online reviews. People these days almost always do their research online before making a commitment to a given professional. So, why not direct clients straight to the information that’s out there about you and your team? This is sure to instill a high level of confidence in your service. 

“When your clients give you relevant information about their home right at the beginning of the process, you will both be in a better position to succeed.”

The last thing we ask in conjunction with what we’ve already touched on is that our clients complete some “homework.” When your clients give you relevant information about their home right at the beginning of the process, you will both be in a better position to succeed. Getting all of this out of the way before you meet up at the listing appointment allows you to spend more time on building rapport and asking key questions, instead of trying to convince them to work with you. 

Best of all, putting this plan into action yourself doesn’t have to cost you a thing. Making a pre-listing video to send out can be as simple as filming a video on your YouTube channel and attaching it to an email with the links and materials we mentioned earlier. 

You can see what our team sends as our pre-listing video on our private Facebook page “Your Journey with Jennie.” If you aren’t already a member of that group, go visit and ask to join. You will find a wealth of knowledge and resources there, so don’t miss the opportunity to see what this page has to offer. 

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

As I’ve worked to grow my team, I’ve also had to let go of team members. This is never, ever any fun at all. 

However, by utilizing the 30-60-90 system when bringing on new team members, we’re able to make sure agents have what it takes to be successful on our team by the time their 91st day rolls around—for their first 90 days,they have to crush their 20% tasks. I can attest to the beauty of this system.

This system has allowed my behavioral style, which would have traditionally kept team members on because I care about them and don’t want to let them down, to be able to let them go. In the past, I would have allowed team members to stay because of my own personal feelings.

“It’s my duty to protect our bottom line as a team owner.”

I had to let go of a great person today who was all-in on our team and culture. For the current role we need, though, they just weren’t a fit, which the 30-60-90 system showed me. 

It was about what the team needs. I feel that it’s my duty as a team owner to protect our bottom line. When we have the wrong person in a role, it really hurts the whole team. I had to remove my ego from the process in order to be the protector of the profit. If our team isn’t profitable, there’s really no point in doing this.

By following systems that are already created for us at Keller Williams, like the 30-60-90, we can move on faster when things aren’t working and continue forward, looking for the next great fit.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime or want to learn more about how our team works, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Are you on track with the big goals you set at the beginning of the year?

Now that we’re into the second half of 2018, it’s time to check in, reset, readjust, get real, and get right. 

Sometimes at the beginning of a year, we set a really big goal and aim high (as Gary Keller advises) so we have a better chance of hitting that goal. Did you aim so high that you need to adjust, come back to reality, and ensure you actually hit that goal, though?

“Make sure your actions and activities match your goal(s).”

If so, now’s the time to do it. Get with yourself, your coach, your team, or whoever’s holding you accountable and make sure your actions and activities match your goal(s). We’ve talked about the 15th protocol before, and if you’re off track with any of your goals, then you’re always in the 15th protocol. You don’t get to sit back and relax. If, for example, you’re off track with your “listing appointments taken” goal, then that’s all you should focus on right now. 

Everything I just said applies to my team as well. In fact, we just had a mid-year team meeting where we readjusted and reevaluated our GPS and our goals. Now it’s all hands on deck—we’re all focused on doing what we have to do to reach our goals. 

I’d love to know how you’re coming along with your goals, so if you have any questions or would like to talk more, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I look forward to speaking with you.

        <description>

Are you feeling the shift?

With the market slowdown taking place here in Tulsa, I knew it was time to dust off “SHIFT: How Top Real Estate Agents Tackle Tough Times” by Gary Keller. Regardless of how the market is doing, this book is a great resource. It’s always helped me re-adjust my mindset when necessary, and I know it can do the same for you.

The reason so many markets are experiencing this shift is because inventory is slowing down. Homes aren’t selling as quickly as they were in the past. Even those that agents expect to do well will tend to sit on the market.

Only time will tell whether current conditions are driven by our seasonal cycle or whether a bigger shift in our market is taking place. Either way, we still have control over how we think about our market, how we handle it, and how we talk with our clients about it.

Our clients need us now more than ever— especially in a market like ours here in Tulsa where the average sales price is $185,000. And sellers in the Tulsa area with a listing priced between $200,000 to $400,000 will find that much of the inventory in this range is growing stale. Many beautiful homes are simply sitting on the market.

“Only time will tell whether current conditions are driven by our seasonal cycle or whether a bigger shift in our market is taking place.”

Now more than ever, it’s essential that we guide sellers through seizing opportunities as they appear. To have the right mindset themselves, sellers must understand the mindset of buyers.

Pricing ahead of the market, which is the seventh tactic listed in “SHIFT: How Top Real Estate Agents Tackle Tough Times” by Gary Keller, is essential right now. It’s time to have a conversation with your clients about reframing their mindset for success in our market. 

If you and your clients don’t price correctly from the start, buyers will move on to the next home. Especially in a market like what we’re seeing now, we’ve got to set our sellers up for success. That’s our job.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

        <description>

I just got back from an awesome mastermind in beautiful San Diego, California where I got to spend time with Frank Klesitz, the CEO of Vyral Marketing, and a handful of other top agents across the country. Each of us has different things going on with our businesses, but there was a lot of commonality among us, and we’re all focused on being the best we can be when it comes to marketing our business. 

That being said, I’ve been a Vyral Marketing client for a long time now, and today I want to talk about the value of doing business with them and what that business entails. Before I was their client, I knew that I wanted to implement video in my business, but I’m no “techie,” and I was spending so much time spinning my wheels trying to edit videos. Once I found Vyral, it changed my life. 

People ask me all the time, “How do you measure your return on investment with Vyral Marketing?” Their service costs about $500 per month, and in return, I shoot two videos per month that get sent out to my database. The numbers and statistics of these videos are tracked, so I get a report afterward of who clicked on what. This gives me a rundown of who to call and what to say when I call them. They also provide coaching and accountability. I know I have to get those videos done on time or they’ll be asking me where they are. 

There are a couple other things included in the subscription that I didn’t even realize until recently.

“Once I found Vyral, it changed my life.”

First, we know our business is all about our database, and you’ll already have a database of your “mets.” These are your past clients, friends, family, or any buyer or seller leads you’ve had past conversations with. Categorize your “mets” and make a list of your centers of influence. Once you’ve categorized your “mets,” you’ll send them two videos a month. 

For our database videos, I like to mix them up. For example, first I’ll send a market report. Then, because I’ve noticed that my database really likes videos about their community, I’ll send a video where I spotlight a local business or nonprofit. I want to provide my audience with content I know they’ll care about, and I can tell how many people click and share these videos. 

They also send monthly postcards to your database which is a snapshot of you and a video you’ve made. You pay for the postage and the printing, but they’ll help create the postcard. 

If you’re like I once was and you’re perhaps struggling to figure out a way to increase the touches to your database, this is the answer. After you make a video, you can send them a postcard that shows the picture of the video and offers them a way to subscribe to your videos and your website. 

Lastly, you have to call your mets, and having a fun way to call them is especially important. Adding events to your business is the easiest way to do this. Make your phone calls ways of being a connector and adding value to them. They’re the ones who help our business grow, and referred business is the best kind of business. 

If you have any more questions about working with Vyral Marketing or you’d like to connect with them, give me a call. I’d be happy to help.

        <title>An Exciting New Addition to Our Team: the Peer Pay Program</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/an-exciting-new-addition-to-our-team-the-peer-pay-program.html</link>

        <description>

We recently implemented a new program called Peer Pay on our team, and I want to tell you all about how it works. 

The concept behind Peer Pay is that each team member gets a sum of money that they can reward other team members with throughout the year. In our case, each member of the Wolek Group received $500 of what I call “TWG Peer Pay Bucks” to give to their peers. By the end of the year, they must distribute all of their money to other team members.

“I think this program fits great with our team culture.”

Here’s the kicker: Each reward must be done in private. This is because we don’t want to hinder other team members from rewarding the same person. If they’re awesome enough, they should get all the money they deserve. 

I think this program fits great with our team culture, and I’m excited to share the results with you later on. If you have other ideas about how to build a sense of community within your team or business, I invite you to share them with me. 

In the meantime, if you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to call or email me anytime. I’d love to help you.

        <description>

Every one of us has a database. Whether it’s Facebook friends or the contacts on our phone, all of us have people we can reach out to.

We know the value of establishing a great foundation for your business based on your database, so we have a script you can use to introduce yourself to your database. This is the follow-up script my team uses to call people after we’ve done the Facebook exercise that I mentioned in a previous video: 

“Hey, it’s (name) with the Wolek Group! How are things going? I’m so excited—I started my new job and I’m just calling all my friends and family to let them know it’s official. I am now in real estate with the Wolek Group.”

Depending on who you’re talking to, there are three different ways you can continue with the script, but here’s how I’ll continue in this example:

“You know, I’ve been looking forward to this for awhile. I mean, the Wolek Group loves helping buyers and sellers and they helped over 100 families last year. I would love to mail you some of my business cards when they come in. I want to make sure you have them in case you hear of anyone who may be looking to buy, sell, or invest in real estate. My team covers all of Metro Tulsa, so no matter where they may be moving, I can help. I have your email address, but may I also have your home address?”

“There is a purpose behind this script, and it keeps you focused.”

Don’t be afraid to ask for a piece of contact information—they will always give it to you:“I just want to make sure I have the best contact info for you. Obviously I would love to be your new resource for all things real estate. Also, if you hear of someone moving out of the area, we have a huge database of agents all over the world, so I can help them get in touch with an excellent agent anywhere. Either way, please keep me in mind. Since real estate is referral-based business, I really appreciate your support. As soon as my cards come in, I’ll get you one. Thank you so much! Well, I’ll let you get back to work—I’m sure you are super busy. Great talking with you, and tell Mary (or whoever) I said hi.”

The point of this script is to follow it so you don’t get off track. It’s really easy to get distracted, so stay in line with the words. There is a purpose behind this script, and it keeps you focused. 

Also, you really need to share your enthusiasm. The people you’re calling already know, like, and trust you, and they want to support you. Be comfortable asking for contact information and don’t get sidetracked by wondering if you’re bugging them or not, or if they think you’re too pushy or sales-ey. 

Lastly, make sure you get the best possible contact information from them. You’re building a business, and that starts with building a foundation based on your database. We’re in a relationship-based business, and you need lots of relationships in order to have a big business. 

After you use this script, feel free to reach out to me and let me know how it’s working out for you. If you have any questions about it or there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to call or email me anytime. I’d be happy to help you.

        <description>

Are you looking to build up your database? I recently got a great idea of how to do just that from my friend, business coach, and trainer: Brian Eisenhower.

As a team, he taught us a fun trick and tool to build your database by simply using Facebook. More than likely, you’re already on there, so why not make it purposeful?

Get on your smartphone and go into your Facebook mobile app. From there, go to your profile page and you’ll find your friends list in ascending order. Eventually, you’ll create a private message to send out to your friends list, but remember Facebook’s regulations—you’ll get into trouble if you send a message to too many people. The way around this barrier is to send your message out to 20 people a day, just to avoid “Facebook jail.”

As far as what this message contains, make it generic since you’ll be copying and pasting it. Here’s the script that I use:

“Keep your message short and sweet.”

“Hey, it’s Jennie. How have you been? I’m updating my real estate database and I’d like to send real estate info from time to time. My real estate business was amazing last year.” Or, as an alternative to that line, “I’m new to real estate and I need to be better about staying in touch with people I know. Would you mind replying with your home address, phone number, and email to help me out?”

Keep your message short and sweet. It’s amazing; people actually respond, and these are your Facebook friends, so it’s likely that they know you and want to support you.

Use this tip to build your database. I’ve found that even though you might be an agent who’s been in business for a while, you might be missing out if you’re not utilizing Facebook to expand your reach.

If you have any questions or thoughts about this approach, please reach out to me. If you give it a try, I’d love to hear your results as well!

        <description>
Today I’m going to talk about three videos that you need to make for your real estate business right now.

A lot of times I am asked about where to get started. To be honest, video has really changed my business and my life. Simply by being a real person, people will trust you, like you, and use you to help them with their real estate needs.

The first video I ever made was a pre-listing video. I find value in sending a video in advance before I get to the property; this way, the clients recognize me when I get to the door and they know what to expect. In the video, I just tell them about how I look forward to meeting them, what our objectives will be for our time together, as well as some links for them to review.

“I find value in sending a video in advance before I get to the property; this way, the clients recognize me when I get to the door and they know what to expect.” Another video to make in advance is one geared towards buyers. Do the same thing as the first video I mentioned, only make this one like a buyer consultation. Let them know that you are excited about meeting with them and give them some links to materials to get started. Mention the importance of pre-approval, if they are obtaining a mortgage, downloading your apps, and anything else they can do before your in-person consultation.

Finally, the third video to make can be used for buyers, sellers, and the general public. Talk about your value proposition—are you on a team or are you a single agent? How will you best serve them in their real estate ventures?

You can make these videos cheaply, even on your phone, upload them to YouTube, and share them on social media. If you really want to get fancy, you can later enlist the services of companies to help you edit them, but do not let the editing and details bog you down.

I can share my videos with you so that you will have an idea of what to do. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I would love to help you.

If you keep track of relationship patterns, you’ll see that making one contact can lead to a windfall of transactions down the road.

If you look in the video above, you’ll see I’m holding a piece of paper I’m really proud of that I want to share with you. It’s a flowchart of a relationship pattern my team and me have been tracking.

What this shows me is that making one contact, making one relationship, and helping one family with their relationship needs can lead to over 30 other transactions.

If you take those 30 units and multiply them by our average commission of—let’s say—$5,000, that’s over $300,000 of gross commission income we can bring in as a team, all by being purposeful and having a database that applies systemized touches. And, it’s fun!

“GIVE THANKS TO THE PEOPLE WHO HELP YOU WITH YOUR BUSINESS.”

So, make sure you notice relationship patterns. The reason I was reminded to share this with you is that Nate, one of our sales associates, has been working with some new clients buy and sell homes, and we retraced those transactions to a friend I went to college with whom we helped buy and sell a home last year.

That sign in the yard led to another listing across the street, which led to an open house guest, which led to four other families we now get to help. Celebrate these kinds of patterns and don’t forget to reward the people who help you with your business.

As always, if you have any questions or there’s anything else I can assist you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

        <description>

Make sure that your family, friends, and clients all know the best way to refer you to a potential client. Here are a few tips to help them.

How can you make sure that when people refer you, they’re doing it correctly?

Have you ever had a past client, friend, or family member tell you that they’ve given so-and-so one of your business cards?

In those situations, I’m always very appreciative. However, there is an issue with that sort of referral. If the person who received the card is anything like me, they’ll eventually lose the card. I like to tell the friend or client who gave them my card to call, text, or email me. The last thing we would ever want is for that person to end up with a weak agent.

Sometimes, we just need to remind our friends and family how they should refer us to them. One script that I love is Mick Hick’s “The Promise.” It’s a great foundation and piece to add to your business.

“SOMETIMES, WE JUST NEED TO REMIND OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY HOW THEY SHOULD REFER US TO THEM.”

• “The idea is, during the process of us working together, you will likely hear of other people talking about buying and selling real estate. In that time—between now and when we get to closing—we sure would appreciate if you would give me a call when you hear of anybody that’s thinking about buying or selling.”

• “[…]What I’m asking for is for you to take the next step to make sure that I have the chance to help. In addition to giving my name out, please call, text, or email me their information, because then, I’ll know that there’s a 100% chance that I’ll get in touch with them. This could even be if they’re thinking about refinancing or if they have a general question about real estate. Let me be the real estate expert and reach out to them, because I love helping you and I sure love helping your friends, as well.”

Sharing referrals is a great way to build our business. It’s what we do—we help people and build relationships. Make sure to gather the information of the referring person; we’re not going to bug them. We’re just going to gently reach out and let them know that we heard they were looking for real estate help.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. I’m happy to give you advice on how to improve your practices.

Accountability is an essential quality for any successful real estate agent.
Take it from my friend, Ricky Cain.

Today I’m at the Keller Williams Realty Southwest market center with Ricky Cain of The Cain Team of Austin. Today, Ricky is going to talk with us about being accountable as an agent. Accountability is the most important thing you can do to ensure your success, Ricky says.

It starts by being accountable to a time-blocked schedule. That way, you can accomplish the things that you need to get done when you need to get them done. If it’s not in your schedule, it doesn’t exist. That’s a big BOLD principle.

In addition to being accountable to your schedule, you need to be accountable to your goals. Break them down to weekly and monthly goals, starting with a “1-3-5” or a “GPS” where you are breaking down the one thing that you absolutely have to accomplish this year that will make it the best year you ever had, then breaking it down to those three primary actions and five secondary actions within those primary actions that you intend on completing. Then, create a 4-1-1 plan that incorporates your 1-3-5.

“ACCOUNTABILITY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOL FOR YOUR SUCCESS.”

That all sounds easy and good, but who is going to hold you accountable to staying on track? For us, it’s our MAPS coaches, our family, and ourselves. You need all three to maximize your productivity. It’s better to stick to a plan and have your goals exceeded than try to fit everything else in on the side.

This information all comes from “The One Thing” by Gary Keller. If you haven’t read it yet, stop what you’re doing and read it now. They also have some great podcast and webinars.

Thanks to Rick for joining us today. If you need any help in Austin, send him an email to Ricky@TheCainTeam.com. If you need anything else, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <title>How Removing Limiting Beliefs Can Change Your Life</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/how-removing-limiting-beliefs-can-change-your-life.html</link>

        <description>
By removing limiting beliefs, just like I did, you can live your life more productively and more fiercely.

Every single day, we make choices about what we’ll allow into our brains, what we absorb, and how we’ll react to life. When it comes to these choices, it’s important that we remove limiting beliefs.

I remember that my mind first expanded and adopted this concept back in 2010 at a BOLD class when I started thinking about the possibilities of living a life by design instead of default. That’s when I started thinking about life in terms of “I can,” and “I am,” and I started having daily positive affirmations to feed myself positive vibes and thoughts that allowed me to currently live more productively and more fearlessly.

Before that, I had limiting beliefs about myself—either because I didn’t have the same experience as other agents, the same amount of money as them, or that certain “thing” that allowed them to be confident. I just didn’t feel the same thing inside me.

I remember thinking the same thought so many other agents have every single day: I don’t want to bug them. Shifting my mind from “I don’t want to bug them” to “I’m really great at helping people—how many people do I get to help today?” changed everything for me.

“DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO DO DAILY TO REMOVE YOUR LIMITING BELIEFS.”

At my first BOLD class, I remember that the thought of talking to 20 people in a single day physically made me want to vomit. That’s because I was living in fear of what they might think about me or how I might be intruding on their day. Then I realized that after I connected with them, they were happy to hear from me! If they weren’t, that was OK too. That’s none of my business, and they don’t know me.

When you switch your thinking to “I don’t want to bug them” to “I’m great at helping people,” I promise you’ll be able to remove your limiting beliefs, at least in regards to helping people. After all, we’re in the business of helping people—the relationship-building business. If you don’t have relationships, you don’t have a business.

Do whatever you have to do on a daily basis to remove your limiting beliefs, whether it’s positive affirmations, journaling the things you’re good at, etc. Have accountability around those things as well.

If you have any questions about limiting beliefs our you’d like to talk with me about any “drunk monkeys” that get in your way, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d love to hear from you.

        <description>

There’s always more to learn as a real estate agent. Here are just a few examples.

I’m excited to be joined today by my amazing friend, Jessica Starr, a Keller Williams agent out of Connecticut and Lower Massachusetts. I talked to her a little bit about why being learning-based is so important as an agent, as well as about some of the different trainings and learning opportunities that KW offers.

Jessica’s favorite course is probably BOLD, judging by the fact that she’s taken it a dozen times. There are so many different opportunities out there for KW agents, though, that Jessica says you should start building a plan for all the events you want to attend in December or January. Take a look at the training calendars in your office, then determine which ones you want to attend. Jessica advises booking KW Family Reunion and Mega Camp first. A few other courses that Jessica recommends are Quantum Leap and the Language of Sales.

“ALL SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE ARE LEARNING-BASED.”

You should also make it a point to attend a few masterminds. They can be a game changer. When you’re working with people who are doing things at a high level, the conversations and relationships you build are huge and can help you out for the rest of your career. Even though it’s a cost to attend, the referrals alone that you’ll get from other agents make it worth the price of admission.

The bottom line is that all successful people are learning-based. Jessica and I actually filmed the video above at a Mastermind event in Chicago. If you or someone you know needs real estate assistance in Connecticut or Massachusetts, give her a call at (860) 761-3765 or send her an email to StarrRealtyGroup@gmail.com.

If you have any other questions for me about your real estate career, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.

        <description>

Going from E to P changed Scott Klaas’ life for the better, and it can do the same for you.
Here’s how.

Here at my latest mastermind trip, we’ve been talking about Keller Williams’ six personal perspectives. One of those perspectives I want to share with you is going from E to P, and I’m happy to be joined by fellow agent Scott Klaas from Wisconsin and have him explain how this perspective had a positive impact on him and his business.

The E in this perspective means “entrepreneurial.” Your natural ability, energy level, and anything else you can naturally do has a ceiling of achievement, and the only way to bust through that ceiling of achievement is to go to P, which means “purposeful.”

Hearing that for the first time changed Scott’s life. Now everything he does has to have a system, a model, and it has to have leverage behind it.

“Those three things will break you through your ceiling of achievement,” he says. “And then that ceiling will become your new floor.

“WHEN YOU KEEP BUSTING YOUR HEAD AGAINST THE CEILING, YOU NEED MORE LEVERAGE AND BETTER SYSTEMS AND MODELS.”

From there, you can move toward your next level of achievement. When you keep busting your head against the ceiling, you need more leverage and better systems and models. From there, you can keep going up and up.

What are some ways to increase your ceiling?

For Scott, going from E to P is about having a better life. He was working nonstop 16- and 18-hour days with 10 to 20 deals always under contract. He was always dealing with something wrong, or some headache, or always putting out fires, and he was never present anywhere. When you get purposeful, you have other people take some of those responsibilities, and you time block extremely well. It frees up your nights and weekends and helps every area of your life.

If you’d like to get in touch with Scott or you’d like to send a referral his way, you can reach him on Facebook, call him at (414) 795-6675, or send him an email at sklaas@kw.com.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to speak with you.

        <guid>https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/Jennie+Wolek/Videos/January+2018/Tulsa+Real+Estate+Agent-+The+80-20+Principle+--+Use+This+Principle+to+Change+Your+Business.mp4</guid>
        <description>

Using the 80/20 principle, we can ensure that we’re prioritizing our time to be sure that our money-producing activities are handled before everything else, which sets us up for success.

Today I want to continue my discussion of the six personal perspectives by focusing on another of them: the 80/20 principle. It shows up time and time again in our lives and in our businesses, and I really believe that there’s so much truth behind it.

Pareto’s principle states that 20% of our activities will produce 80% of our results. Simply put, not everything we do is equally as important. Because others have gone before us and done the research, we know that we need to do our most dollar-productive activities in the morning to make sure those things get done because that will help determine our success in our business.

Real estate agents and salespeople of any kind all have the same job descriptions:
• Lead generation
• Lead follow-up
• Go on appointments and negotiate contracts
• Practice and roleplay

I usually reword these and put them in the order of how my day usually goes. So instead, I would say:

• 8:30 a.m.—Practice and roleplay
• 9:00 a.m. to 11 a.m.—Lead generate
• 11 a.m. to noon—Lead follow-up
• Afternoon—Go to appointments

“PARETO’S PRINCIPLE STATES THAT 20% OF OUR ACTIVITIES WILL PRODUCE 80% OF OUR RESULTS.”

It’s crazy how this works and when you set accountability around it, it starts showing up, and your perfect calendar does start to come true.

Back in 2015, I took BOLD four times in a row. I did that because I knew I had to get into action and get things back on track for my business and for my team. During that time, I had five different role play partners, with a different partner to work with at 8:30 a.m. every morning in a different city. That really helped increase my ability to talk better, know my scripts, be better at objection handlers, and it’s also a great way to connect with agents across the country.

After practice and roleplay, I would go into my 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. lead generation. Early on with the new coach that I had, he required that I send him a text every morning at 9 a.m. when I got into my database. By sending that text every morning, I was certain to open my database to see who I needed to call to get into action and get busy. That one little text I sent every morning has changed my business over the past couple years.

Think about what you are spending your time on all day long. If you’re still a single agent, that’s super great—just make sure you’re doing your most dollar-productive activities in the morning. Everything else like setting appointments, making flyers, and doing inspections can all be done in the afternoon, after you’ve ensured that your money-making activities have been taken care of.

Let me know how you focus on your 20%; I’d love to hear about it. For any other questions, feel free to contact me by phone or email. Have a great day!

        <description>

Are your schedule and general thought-process adding value to your life?
If not, switch things up so that they do.

Today I want to talk about self-mastery. It’s one of the Six Personal Perspectives that Gary Keller, Co-Founder &amp; Chairman of the Board for Keller Williams Realty, wrote about in his NY Times Best Seller, The Millionaire Real Estate Agent. He discovered that the most successful real estate agents have a similar mindset when it comes to success and boiled this mindset down to six fundamental perspectives that are at the core of Keller Williams Realty’s education for its agents.

Self Mastery is the mindset, process, and habits associated with making sound decisions for desired results &amp; self growth. It’s the self control that comes from having a clear vision &amp; the determination to see it physically manifest.

In other words, it’s “KAIZEN” a Japanese term and philosophy meaning “continuous improvement” or “change for better.” You’ve mastered “Self” when your thoughts, words, actions, and reactions all align with your goals/mission.

Self-mastery is to continue to work on, and ultimately master, you.

I’ve been thinking about scenarios from my own life and business that I could share with you to help you understand what I mean. One of the things I’ve done for myself is created a habit of getting up early and having “me time” while exercising on the treadmill.

I was using that 30 minutes of walking on the treadmill in the morning to watch Netflix and TV series from Amazon Video that I normally never watched. It was just guilty-pleasure time, and I think it’s important to have that. However, I was noticing that I was filling my brain with silly stuff—things that didn’t matter or add value to my life.

“SELF-MASTERY IS TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON, AND ULTIMATELY MASTER, YOU.”

So I switched that routine. Instead of mindless shows, I started listening to audiobooks about growth, mindset, and leadership, or else inspirational and motivational videos with John Maxwell or Tony Robbins—anything that could add value to my life.

I’m not saying that you shouldn’t take time for yourself and do some of those guilty-pleasure things, because those are fun and enjoyable as well. I just had found that I wasn’t growing. And by listening to these different thoughts on leadership, business, and life balance, I was able to trigger thoughts in my own mind that inspired me to think of new ways and ideas to better my family, business, friends, and community.

Do these little things that tweak your mind and your schedule to where you’re adding some value to yourself so that you can continue to improve.

Let me know how you work on your self-mastery, and I can in return share some more ways to grow through this practice. Life is a journey; we’re continuing to grow every single day.

If you have any questions about this or other topics, please feel free to reach out to us. Make it a great day!

        <description>

We’ve been able to do a much better job of handling our buyers
by adding one simple tool to our business.

Today I’d like to share something cool with you. It’s a system our team uses for buyer listings that was developed by my friend Brian Inskip. It’s called My Buyer Listing. Essentially, it’s a website where you can post your buyer listing information and have a system behind it and a plan for how to share the listing with your network and your neighborhood.

All of us post seller listings all the time and share them with our networks. Why not do the same thing with our buyer listings? I like to think of it as a dating game for houses. Maybe a homeowner isn’t thinking about selling until they see that there is a buyer on this site that is clearly looking for a home like theirs. Wouldn’t that be cool to match up with a buyer or seller in advance and not even have to list the home?

“IT’S LIKE A DATING GAME FOR HOUSES.”

I just wanted to share this tool with you to help you get in front of more buyers. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

Put it in your business plan for 2018 to give back to your community. We have some ideas about how you can do that.

Today I wanted to talk with you about giving—giving back to your community.

Giving is awesome, and it feels great. Make sure you have it in your budget and your business plan for 2018 to be able to give back to your community. The following are some ways that we like to give back.

In 2013, devastating tornadoes hit our neighbors in Moore, Oklahoma. They hit so close to home that at that point in May, we chose to, as a team, donate $100 of all the rest of our closings that year back to the relief efforts in that area, including the food bank, the Salvation Army, United Way, and so on.

That felt really good; we got to give back about $4,000, which really makes a difference. As a team, we chose to continue with that feeling of giving and charity. Since then, for every closing that we have, we call up our client after closing and thank them so much for allowing us to help them choose which organizations we can give to in their name.

“WHEN PEOPLE GIVE, IT MAKES THEM FEEL GOOD, AND THEN WE ALL FEEL GOOD.”

Honestly, those are the best conversations ever. When people give, it makes them feel good, and then we all feel good.

Another way we give as a team is on our green sheets. If you’re with Keller Williams Realty, we have distribution authorizations that pull donations out of our money at closing automatically. Our team gives to the Keller Williams Kids Can organization, as well as KW Cares.

Don’t forget that there are ways to give that are mindless and easy, and just feel great.

Let me know what ideas you come up with! I’d love to hear other ways that you’re giving. And guess what? If you already have this in your budget, when disaster strikes our country, you’ll be able to be first on call to give back.

I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

Recently, I’ve been feeling a little unfocused. Today I want to share a few tips on how you can overcome these same, common feelings in order to meet your goals.

Right now, I’m feeling a little “blah.”

This is something we all experience from time to time, but feeling tired, unenthusiastic, and generally unmotivated can put a huge roadblock on our work and life.

This is reality. Even after a weeklong vacation of re-focusing and rejuvenating with my daughter, I’m coming back into the swing of things with very little energy.

We all know how Monday mornings can be. However, looking at your goals can be a great way to re-focus yourself.

Since I’ve been feeling this way, that’s exactly what I did.

I looked at the numbers, like my 411 and business plan, because doing this can really help in getting back on track.

“OUR GOALS ARE BIGGER THAN ANY TEMPORARY LACK OF ENERGY.”

Life comes with a lot of high and low points, but wherever you are at: keep going. We all occasionally feel a lack of motivation, but the important thing is to not stop.

Our goals are bigger than any temporary lack of energy. It is always important to remember what you’re working toward and why it is important to you.

Whatever your goal is, all you have to do is keep working toward it. Set up a schedule, stay focused, and keep moving forward.

If you’re interested, I can share my 411 with you so that you, too, can build your own.

If you’d like me to provide you with that, have any other questions, or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

We use the DISC personality profile to help us in our business and personal lives.Here’s what DISC stands for.

Behavioral assessments can be used to better both business relationships and relationships in your personal life.

When you can observe behaviors in your friends, family, coworkers, clients, etc., you know better how to adapt and relate to who they are and understand how to help them.

We use the DISC personality profile to accomplish these things. What does DISC stand for, though?

The D stands for “driver,” “dominant,” or “doer.” These people are the CEOs and trial attorneys of the world. These people come in, get stuff done, and don’t allow anyone to waste their time.

The I stands for “influencer.” These people are motivated and typically work through other people. They’re sometimes referred to as “the life of the party” or “a social butterfly.” This isn’t always the case, but they’re definitely not shy in group settings.

The S stands for “steady,” “stable,” or “secure.” This personality represents the majority of the population. These people don’t like change. They’re the schoolteachers of the world. They’re all about love—when you walk into their home, you’ll see family pictures everywhere because that’s important to them. It should be important to all of us, but it’s especially evident in them.

Finally, the C stands for “compliant.” These people are the accountants and engineers of society. They love following the rules and checking off tasks. Sometimes, they’re hesitant to move forward until they have all the answers.

“YOU CAN TELL A LOT ABOUT PEOPLE BY HOW THEY ACT IN GROUPS AND HOW THEY WORK THROUGH CHALLENGES IN THEIR LIFE.”

All of us have each of these different behaviors inside of us—they just show up differently for each person. Some people are more slanted toward one behavior, while others are a blend of each. D and C personalities are task-motivated, while I and S personalities are more relationship oriented. You can tell a lot about people by how they act in groups and how they work through challenges in their life.

If you have any questions about DISC or how you can use behavioral assessments to better your life and the lives of those around you, feel free to get in touch with me. I’d be happy to talk with you.

        <description>

According to fellow agent Kelly Henderson, time-blocking and lead-generation are two great tips to achieving success in our industry.

I have some invaluable tips about how to achieve success in our industry from someone who’s been there, done that—fellow KW agent Kelly Henderson.

Kelly is the team leader for her market center, a MAPS coach, and a brand-new mom. Needless to say, days are kept pretty busy. In the morning, she spends her time coaching. From about 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., she’s got her team leader hat on. During her lunch break, she does one-on-one meetings with all of her team members. At the end of each day, she reviews what her team is doing.

How does she do it all?

Time-blocking. She knows exactly what points of the day she’ll be doing certain activities. From her experience of being a new mom, her favorite tip to share is that sometimes money can cover everything. Leveraging your time with money through systems and people is actually one of the points I discuss in my class, too—along with learning how to say “no” more often.

“WHATEVER TIME AND ENERGY YOU CAN CARVE OUT EACH DAY IS YOUR STEPPING STONE TO ACHIEVING SUCCESS.”

Looking back on her own career, Kelly’s advice for younger agents is to simply show up and work. That doesn’t just apply to younger agents—that applies to anyone getting their real estate license. It takes time and energy to make money in real estate, specifically through lead generation. Whatever time and energy you can carve out each day is your stepping stone to achieving success.

For example, if you’ve never lead-generated, talk to five people a day. If you’re already lead generating, you should be talking to 15 to 20 people a day. Set a manageable goal every day, and hit that goal. The compound effect of that will add up over time.

If you have any questions for Kelly or referrals for her team, you can email her at KellyHenderson@KW.com.

If you have any questions for me, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be glad to help you.

        <title>How the 1-3-5 Tool Can Help You Accomplish All Your Goals</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/tulsa-real-estate-agent-using-the-1-3-5-goal-setting-template.html</link>

        <description>

If you haven’t been using the 1-3-5 tool to get things accomplished in your business, I highly recommend you give it a try.

Are you using the 1-3-5 (or GPS) tool to accomplish your goals?

Just like the GPS system in your car, this system helps you determine where you’re going in your business career and gives you directions along the way. I’ve been using this tool for the past couple of years now, and you can also use it to accomplish goals in your personal life as well.

How does it work?

First, you start with one goal, which can be anything from completing a certain number of transactions in a year to taking on a certain type of project in your business. Then, you break that goal down into three priorities. Under each of those three priorities, there are five strategies.

We just did a mid-year review for our team so we could check in on the goals we set at the beginning of the year. By doing this, we can see if we’re on track to accomplish them and if there’s anything we could do to tweak them. One of our 1-3-5 goals was to help 150 families in the Tulsa area. Our three priorities for this goal were divided into buyers, sellers, and business partners. We had strategies for each priority, but we noticed during this mid-year review that we hadn’t checked many of them off and perhaps weren’t implementing the right ideas for these strategies.

“THE 1-3-5 TOOL HELPS YOU DETERMINE WHERE YOU’RE GOING AND HOW TO GET THERE.”

That’s when I heard about a great idea from BOLD coach J. Michael Manley about breaking down your annual 1-3-5 based on leads, listings, and leverage. That’s exactly what we did, and now that we’re halfway through 2017, we have two questions to ask ourselves: What are our biggest sources of business? Can we still plus those?

I think the answer is always “yes.” Our biggest source of business is our referrals from our database, meaning past clients, our sphere of influence, and other Realtors. Are there still areas in each of those categories that we still need to plus and tweak? Yes, and that’s our focus for the rest of the year.

I have a great 1-3-5 template document I’d like to share with you, so if you haven’t already, head on over to my Facebook blog page “Your Journey With Jennie”  and hit “like.” I’ll add the document there so you can borrow it from my Google drive.
If you have any questions about this tool or how it can help you in your own business, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to assist you.

        <title>How to Prequalify a Seller Before You Go to the Listing Appointment</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/tulsa-real-estate-agent-asking-the-right-qualifying-questions.html</link>

        <description>

Have you ever shown up for an appointment with a seller and they weren’t ready, willing, or able to sell their home?

I have, and I don’t want you to make the same mistakes that I did. I have a lead sheet that’s a checklist to remind myself to ask the right questions of my sellers over the phone that I want to go over with you. Following this lead sheet, collecting the right information, and asking the right questions as you’re on the phone with your sellers will save you both time and energy.

First, you must get all of their contact information. When I get off the phone with a seller and I set an appointment to meet them, I get their email address and confirm they’ll check their email before I get there because I also send them a pre-listing video. This is a great way to get them information in advance so that when you get there, they’ve already had the chance to do some research and get some work done.

Next, you can make the following inquiries
• What are their true motivations?
• Do they really need to sell?
• Have they already been working or talking with other agents?
• Are they relocating?
• Will they have relocation benefits?

These are important questions you must understand and know up front. Over the years, I’ve focused on making sure the people I work with are motivated to sell and have equity in their home to sell, and if they don’t, they have a way to make it work. The market will help determine what the seller’s home value is, and you don’t have to sell if you don’t get the right offer.

“ASKING THESE QUESTIONS WILL SAVE YOU BOTH TIME AND ENERGY.”

After that, ask them questions to describe their home. This will give you insight as to whether they’ve made updates or not. People will tell you the truth about their home. You can also ask if they have a mortgage left on their home. In the old days, I was insecure about asking this question because I felt it was too personal. Quite honestly, I don’t care what their mortgage is; I just want to help them get the most money in their pocket at closing. Back when the market was a little harder, they might not have had the equity to sell their home to be on the positive side. You want your sellers to be set up for success from the very beginning.

How did they find out about you? Were they referred to you by a friend? If so, you might want to thank that person who sent that referral. Rewarding referrals are important.

From there, set the appointment. Email them in advance or drop off a pre-listing packet—whichever is your preferred way of doing business. This will help you show up for the appointment on time and ready.

I also use a pre-qualifying script that features some final questions to ask before you meet. When using this script, you’ll first confirm the appointment and make sure everyone who’s selling the property is ready to meet. After that, you’ll ask the following questions:

• Do you plan on interviewing other agents?
• Where are you moving?
• How soon do you need to be there?
• What would you do if your house didn’t sell?

These are qualifying questions to help you help them and better manage your time. If you’re prepared in advance and they’ve done the homework you’ve asked them to do, you can walk into the home and say, “Besides price, is there anything we need to discuss today?” If they’ve shown that they’re ready to go and they’ve invited you into their home, they’re already at a yes, so go for it!

Don’t talk yourself out of the business, ask them questions and make them feel like you care about them—because you do. You care about helping them achieve their real estate goals and getting their home sold. I trust that these will help you have a better life and business because the purpose of qualifying is so that you can spend valuable time with your family.

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I look forward to speaking with you.

        <title>How Our Team Remembers the Right Qualifying Questions to Ask</title>

        <description>

In order to remember which questions to ask when qualifying a buyer, we use the LPMAMA system. Here’s how it works.

When qualifying a potential client, the phrase LPMAMA is a great way to remember all the right questions to ask.

L for location: Many buyers will call excited and not even know if a home they found is even in the location they truly want, so ask this to make sure it’s where they want to be.

P for price: Which price point have they been looking in?

M for motivation: Do they have a home currently? Do they need to sell it to buy the next home? Are they currently in a lease? If so, when is it up? You might need to guide them on special timelines, like a lease ending soon that requires a little more urgency. Conversely, if they have six months left on their lease, it might be too early to buy a home.

A for agent: Have they been working with one? If they’re calling signs, they’ve probably called other agents. Sometimes buyers just truly don’t understand how we work, so it’s our job to politely explain that to them. I also don’t want to step on another agent’s toes, so if they’ve been working with another agent, I’ll advise the buyer to call them.

“DON’T JUST ASSUME THEY NEED A MORTGAGE.”

M for mortgage: Are they financing the purchase? If so, have they spoken with a lender? You have to phrase this carefully because if you assume they have to qualify for a mortgage, what happens if they’re actually a cash buyer or their parents are buying the home for them? You could insult the buyer. I’ll always frame it by asking the buyer: “Will you use cash to buy this home or will you obtain financing? If so, have you talked with a local, professional lender?”

A for appointment: This comes after we’ve vetted them to be sure they’re a serious buyer and have talked to a lender. We want to set this appointment because we’ve found it to be crucial to sit down with buyers so they can see the whole process from the beginning. They can get a lot of preliminary info online, but our true value as an agent comes by taking them through the whole process with as few speed bumps as possible.

If you have any other questions about this topic or you’d just like to discuss your real estate career, you can always give me a call or send me an email. I’m here to help!

        <description>

Creating a fan club is one of the best things you can do for your business. I’ll explain why today.

I wanted to take a minute to talk to you about something that I’ve noticed and has been on my mind.

There are so many Facebook referral groups out there, and there is a lot of business to be had by having great relationships with agents across the country.

We see some negativity surrounding the term “fan club,” but at the end of the day, I chose to create my own fan club. That means I invested in and have relationships with agents across the country so when they think of Oklahoma real estate, they think of me.

I have systems in place and processes that allow me to ensure the relationship goes both ways and that we are able to deliver by keeping you, the referral agent, in the loop during the process. Referrals are so important to us. In fact, 16% of our business last year came from out-of-town Realtor friends like you.

“16% OF OUR BUSINESS LAST YEAR CAME FROM OUT-OF-TOWN REALTOR FRIENDS LIKE YOU.”

So, create your own fan club! Don’t give into the negativity or the hype. Also, when you send a referral to someone in another area, vet that referral. It’s your job to call and qualify those agents to make sure they are a good fit for your client.

Treat your Realtor friends like a database. It’s a contact sport, so get out there and make some contacts!

If you have any questions about creating a fan club, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m here to help.

        <description>

Deciding to start my day earlier than usual was a great decision. It has allowed me to take back my mornings and be more productive throughout the day.

Although it can be a difficult challenge, being able to master your morning will start to change your life. I know from experience. Years ago, I figured out that I needed to take control of my mornings back.

If you have children like I do, you know that they don’t move at the pace that we want them to in the morning a lot of times. They go at their own pace, and there’s nothing you can really do to change that. Yelling at my daughter to hustle up and get ready was turning me into a mean mom. I’ve found that strategy often backfires and leads to meltdowns, tears, and that it wasn’t the right solution.

Instead, I decided to take control of myself and my mornings by getting up earlier. By waking up early enough to be able to start my day on my own and then be able to get my daughter going on her day has made life so much better. Of course, she still moves a little slow, but getting up earlier allows me to have the time to better myself and not feel so rushed.

One of the common themes of successful people is that a lot of them get up really early in the morning. Setting my alarm for 5 a.m. every day was the key for me to getting my day started. Then once I get in the office, I can stay focused on lead generation.

“SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE WAKE UP EARLY.”

As you’ve probably heard if you’re a KW agent, Gary Keller preaches prospecting and says that you must set aside time each day to generate leads. Doing this for three to four hours per day can seem overwhelming, so just start small with 30 minutes of lead generation in the morning and work your way up. I personally time block two hours in the morning for lead generation, as well as an hour after lunch to follow up with leads and other emails.

If you’re able to get all of that accomplished in the morning, you can free your afternoons off for generating more business or simply taking an afternoon off. Enjoy your free time while you have it, because the reality in this business is that you might be working this weekend.

I hope these tips are helpful to you. I promise that if you implement them, you will have an awesome morning, a great day, a big business, and a wonderful life. If you have any questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

Deciding to start my day earlier than usual was a great decision. It has allowed me to take back my mornings and be more productive throughout the day.

When I moved into my office, I made sure it was a great place for me to shoot my videos. Here’s how I did that.

I’m taking you on a tour of my office today to show you what’s going on behind the scenes in my videos. I’m excited to show you guys what I’m working with. All of the items I talk about in this video will be linked at the bottom of this blog post.

I don’t have an expensive camera or fancy equipment, but I do have some great tools that help me make professional quality videos. I use my iPhone to record the videos and I have a few different tripods for it.

I can use one of them for videos in which I am standing up, and I can use the other one to sit right on my desk to record videos while seated. I got the big tripod from Vyral Marketing, a great marketing company that helps us produce our videos. They sent one along when I signed up for their services.

When I moved out to the market center, I made sure my office was set up to have great backgrounds for my videos. I even had one of my trusted home stagers come in to help me with the space.

In one corner, I have my lead generation station with a stand-up desk. On one wall, I have a beautiful painting that my husband and daughter made me. Another wall is filled with books and shelves. They each offer a different setting, which I love.

“INVESTING IN GOOD LIGHTING IS IMPORTANT.”

I also invested in lighting. It’s one of the keys to producing consistent high-quality videos. I also have a bluetooth-enabled clicker that allows me to stop and start recording without having to walk over to my phone. Another thing I invested in was a selfie stick for on-the-go shoots.

A good microphone is the last piece of the puzzle. I have a lapel mic that plugs right into my iPhone and gives me great sound quality. You can hear the difference in the video above when I take it off.

That about covers it for my tips on creating good videos. Make sure you’ve got a steady camera, good lighting, and a reliable microphone and you’ll be just fine.

If you have any questions for me at all about the real estate business, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email, I would love to hear from you and answer any questions.
