The two most critical skills to succeed at a high level in both business and in life are  communication and problem-solving.

One of my favorite quotes is: “The single greatest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.”

Think about the number of times you’ve been in a conversation where you felt that you really understood each other only to walk away realizing that you each left the table with a very different idea of what was said.

The best way to understand this is to realize that there’s more to communication than talking, alone.

To help walk you through the process of communication I’d like to begin by telling a story.

One Christmas Eve during my teen years, I remember lying awake at night too excited to sleep. Being a little mischievous, I decided to sneak down to my parents’ storage room where I found an old, tattered pair of cowboy boots. I took the boots back upstairs, wrapped them up, and wrote “To: Mason, From: Santa” on them. After that, I put them in my little brother’s pile of presents.

When Mason opened the present the next day he had an absolute look of bewilderment on his face. I thought it was hilarious, but I’m not sure my parents shared that opinion.

My point is that just like with wrapping a present, there is a process to communication starting with encoding, then wrapping, and then delivering.

“We need to deliver messages in a way that the person receiving them would find appealing.”

When we decide that something needs to be communicated, we encode that message in our minds. In other words, we develop a plan. The next step is deciding a form of delivery—or how to “wrap it up.”

After that, we deliver the message. This delivery can be in-person, over the phone, through email, written, or in many other ways as well.

The problem that comes from this process is that after we deliver the message, we feel as if we’re finished with the communication. But, that’s not the case.

The message still needs to be unwrapped and decoded.

You might remember the game “Telephone”—where you stand in a circle and pass along a whispered message. As you may recall, the message was almost never the same once it reached the end of the chain.

A successful communication occurs when the message that we encoded is the same one that ends up being decoded.

To achieve this, we have to realize that not everyone is wired the same way. We need to deliver the message and wrap it up in a way that the person receiving it would find appealing.

Try implementing this process over the next few days in your life and business. See how it can work to help you improve the way you communicate.

If you have any other questions or would like more information feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
