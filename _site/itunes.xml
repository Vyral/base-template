*Water leaks are one of the biggest pains we have in the home rental business. Here’s how you can avoid them before they even happen.* 
**[Find Out How Much Your Home Will Rent For in Today's Market](http://www.hipacificpm.com/Guaranteedrent) ****[Learn More About Guaranteed Rent](http://www.hipacificpm.com/faqs)** 
 
 Water leaks are probably the most menacing opponent we face in the home rental business. If you’re a homeowner/investor, I highly suggest getting additional rent loss coverage on your home for this specific purpose. 
If you end up having a big leak, you’ll have to bear the full brunt of it most of the time. If we have a flooded unit, we have a tenant who can’t reside there. We will then have to immediately dry the unit out. However, that process takes three to five days to complete. During that time, you won’t be collecting any rent. 
Half of our leaks result in insurance claims.About half of our leaks result in insurance claims. The sooner we can get to them, the better. If you end up having to lose rent for a month or two, it will be offset by the money you saved by having that extra insurance. 
If you have any questions for us or you’re thinking about investing in real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

*You can choose whether you want to allow pets in your rental property. Here’s what we recommend.* 
**[Find Out How Much Your Home Will Rent For in Today's Market](http://www.hipacificpm.com/Guaranteedrent) **[**Learn More About Guaranteed Rent** ](http://www.hipacificpm.com/faqs) 

One of the most common questions we get from homeowners is if they have to allow pets in their rental home. The answer is no. It’s totally up to you what kind of pets, if any, you will allow in your home. 

However, keep in mind that **eight out of 10 people in today’s market have pets.** Especially when rent is up a little higher and families are out there looking. Most families have one or two children and one or two pets. It just comes with the territory. 

If you do choose to allow pets in your home, our addendum helps protect you. We’ll go inspect the property every four months and look for pet damage, as well as any other damage. **We’ll send you pictures of any damage, as well as a picture of the pet in the home.** 
Our addendum protects you from pet damage.  We don’t take our pet policy lightly. We’re here to protect your home and put money in your account. If you don't want to allow pets, that’s fine, but just know that you'll be missing out on a huge part of the market and it might take us longer to find a tenant than normal. 

If you have any other questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out. We would love to hear from you soon.

*If a tenant leaves food out in the house and a rodent problem develops, who is responsible for pest control: the owner or the tenant?* 
 
&lt;/i&gt;**[Find Out How Much Your Home Will Rent For in Today's Market](http://www.hipacificpm.com/Guaranteedrent) **[**Learn More About Guaranteed Rent** ](http://www.hipacificpm.com/faqs) 

Pests can be a formidable adversary. Their job is to come into your house and find whatever food and water they can. 

That’s why pest control is an incredibly important subject for tenants and owners. 

## As an owner, it is totally optional to carry pest control through the lease period of the tenants. That said, our addendum states that pest control is covered by the tenant. 

Pest control includes rodent control. The owner has no control if tenants leave out food, which attracts pests—so they should not be held responsible. If rodent control is an ongoing problem mentioned in the owner’s interview, I would recommend that you continue to carry rodent control in your house. 
The owner is not the one who attracted the pests, so the owner does not incur the costs of pest control.  Rodents are brought in by food not being stored properly in the home. So, as I mentioned, since the tenant is the one who attracts the rodents, they are the ones responsible for the costs of rodent control. 

Although pest control is important, I would say that **90% of my homes do not have a rodent problem. ** 

If you have any other questions about pest control or would like to learn more about how we take care of your investment properties, just give me a call or send me an email. Feel free to check out **[our site](http://www.hipacificpm.com/)** as well. I would be happy to help you!

        <itunes:summary>If a tenant leaves food out in the house and a rodent problem develops, who is responsible for pest control: the owner or the tenant?Find Out How Much Your Home Will Rent For in Today's Market&nbsp;Learn More About Guaranteed Rent Pests can be a formidable adversary. Their job is to come into your house and find whatever food and water they can.That’s why pest control is an incredibly important subject for tenants and owners. As an owner, it is totally optional to carry pest control through the lease period of the tenants. That said, our addendum states that pest control is covered by the tenant. Pest control includes rodent control. The owner has no control if tenants leave out food, which attracts pests—so they should not be held responsible. If rodent control is an ongoing problem mentioned in the owner’s interview, I would recommend that you continue to carry rodent control in your house. The owner is not the one who attracted the pests, so the owner does not incur the costs of pest control.  Rodents are brought in by food not being stored properly in the home. So, as I mentioned, since the tenant is the one who attracts the rodents, they are the ones responsible for the costs of rodent control. Although pest control is important, I would say that 90% of my homes do not have a rodent problem. If you have any other questions about pest control or would like to learn more about how we take care of your investment properties, just give me a call or send me an email.

*Our move-out addendum ensures that your property is always in good condition. Here’s how it works.* 

**[Find Out How Much Your Home Will Rent For in Today's Market](http://www.hipacificpm.com/Guaranteedrent) **[**Learn More About Guaranteed Rent** ](http://www.hipacificpm.com/faqs) 
The Hawaii Landlord-Tenant Code is a 29-page document that spells out all the expectations for owners and renters. Here at Hawaii Pacific Property Management, we add an additional 14-page addendum to our rental contract called a “move-out addendum” that we wanted to talk to you about today. 

## This addendum states that the tenant will get professional services to clean the home and leave it in the same condition it was when they moved in. To ensure this, we require tenants to sign the agreement up front before they move in. We also require them to provide receipts for any carpet cleaning or maid services they use. This way, there are never any questions about the condition of the property. It will look the same each time a tenant moves out. 
We protect your home and put money in your account.  **We do two things very well:** We protect your home and put money in your account. If you need help with either of those things or have any questions about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

*As the owner of an investment property, how do you get paid? I’ll explain the process today.* 
**[Find Out How Much Your Home Will Rent For in Today's Market](http://www.hipacificpm.com/Guaranteedrent) **[**Learn More About Guaranteed Rent** ](http://www.hipacificpm.com/faqs) 

One of the most common questions we get is, “How do I get paid?” 

It’s pretty simple. **We collect rents on the first of every month.** Hawaii has a “no grace period” law for tenants, which means that rent is definitely due on the first. 

It takes a couple of days to process the payment but thanks to ACH and the magic of online banking, our owners will get paid on the fifth of the month. 

We do all of the behind-the-scenes work to manage your property. However, the only thing you need to know is that **we make the rent appear at no hassle to you. ** 
Rent is always collected on the first of each month.  When you work with me, you don’t have to pay any money up front. If your property needs repairs, the cost will be taken out of the rent. Don’t worry—we don’t do anything without your permission, and you will be communicated with about everything via text, email, or a phone call. 

If you have any other questions about your payment or would like to learn more about how we can help you, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

*Discerning the difference between normal wear and tear versus actual damage is a difficult but important part of property management. Here's how we handle it.* 
**[Find Out How Much Your Home Will Rent For in Today's Market](http://www.hipacificpm.com/Guaranteedrent) **[**Learn More About Guaranteed Rent** ](http://www.hipacificpm.com/faqs) 

How do you discern wear and tear versus damage in a rental property? Getting a property condition form filled out correctly is one of the biggest problems I face in my business. 

The standard property condition form is four pages and it's very extensive. We require tenants to fill out this form on their way in within the first 10 days of living in a unit. We then go back in on a 10-day walkthrough to remove your lock box and collect the property condition form. During that time, we walkthrough each item on the form that's listed as damaged or not working properly. 
Getting a properly filled out condition form is one of the toughest parts of property management.  If we commit to the repairs during the 10-day walkthrough, they'll be repaired at the owner's cost. 

## Wear and tear means things like scratches and scuff marks on the stairs, walls, and bathtub, dirty mirrors, and yellowing on the toilet. We have to determine whether it's wear and tear from living in the unit or damage from negligence by the tenant. Our job is to make that determination for our owners upon move out. 

We also do a six-month walkthrough to make sure the home is cared for, four months if the unit allows pets. We provide pictures of the walkthrough, guaranteed. 

If you have any questions about assessing wear and tear or damage in a unit or you're interested in our property management services, don't hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We'd be glad to speak with you further.

*What is a rent guarantee and why do we offer one? I’ll explain everything today.* 
**[Find Out How Much Your Home Will Rent For in Today's Market](http://www.hipacificpm.com/Guaranteedrent) **[**Learn More About Guaranteed Rent** ](http://www.hipacificpm.com/faqs) 

When you work with us, I guarantee that we’ll pay an agreed upon amount if we don’t rent your property in 30 days or less. 

How do we do that? 

First of all, very few property management companies guarantee their work. We will look at your property’s area, present you with a market rent, and** guarantee your rent at a certain amount.** For example, let’s say your house’s recommended rent is $3,000; we’ll guarantee your rent at $2,400 or $2,600. 

There are many factors that go into renting your home. Until we actually look at the property, we don’t know how renting will go. We don’t know if the people who lived there used to bully the neighborhood, what the parking situation is, or if the house has pets. 

When we arrive at the house, we will look at all of those factors to determine whether or not we can rent your home. If we can, then you sign a contract that states that we will do everything in our power to rent your home. **The contract also offers a rent guarantee, an eviction guarantee, and a communication guarantee. ** 

Many property management companies do not offer an eviction guarantee, even though they put the tenant in the property! If we have to go to eviction with a tenant, we will pay for that. We will also do a four and six-month walkthrough to make sure that your tenants are holding the line as far as your lease goes. 
We are here to make you money and protect your property. Our communication guarantee is extremely important. Many other property management companies can take a while to call you back if they call you back at all. We will give you an updated report each Monday to let you know how many people looked at the home, how many are interested in renting, and give you any feedback from the renters. You have three numbers to reach us: my number, your property manager’s number, and our 800 number that connects to all of our property managers. If you need to talk to us, someone will answer you, guaranteed. 

There are two reasons why I am here: to put money into your bank account and to protect your home. We promise and guarantee that we will do both of those things. If you have any questions for us, please don’t hesitate to give us a call. We are always happy to help you!

*We recommend that our owners carry certain types of insurance coverage so they can maximize their investment property’s value. * 
**[Find Out How Much Your Home Will Rent For in Today's Market](http://www.hipacificpm.com/Guaranteedrent) **** **[**Learn More About Guaranteed Rent**](http://www.hipacificpm.com/faqs)**[Free Insurance Quote](https://www.teamlally.com/blog/bradley-maruyama-of-allstate-insurance.html) ** 
One of the questions we get asked a lot by our owners is, “How much insurance should we carry on our home while we don’t live in it?” Today I want to delve into this topic to give you an idea of what owners and tenants can expect. 

The first thing you must do as an owner is notify your current insurance company that you’re not using the property as your primary residence. This is an important detail for insurance companies because that makes the property an investment property. 

After that’s done, we first recommend you **take out a renter’s insurance policy that covers at least $10,000 in personal property.** This is primarily to cover your appliances. This sum won’t be enough to cover a disaster like a wind storm blowing off your roof, but we’ve been fortunate enough in Hawaii to mostly avoid hurricanes and other storms capable of that kind of damage in the past 100 years. Your liability coverage will be $100,000, which is in place in case an accident happens on the property. 

The other thing we recommend for owners is to **get loss of rent coverage.** This is important because if there’s a leak or your home incurs some type of water damage, the tenants probably won’t be able to reside in it and pay rent. The loss of rent coverage makes sure you are compensated for the lost rent on your investment. 
As an owner, your liability coverage will be $100,000.  What do we ask on the tenant’s side?** We require all tenants to carry a renter’s policy**, which is a simple renter’s policy to cover a minimum of $10,000 on their property, $50,000 in liability, and more if they have a dangerous pet. If they happen to have what we consider a dangerous pet, we ask them to cover $100,000. We also ask them to have loss of rent coverage in their policy so that policy will kick in if something happens to them and prevents them from paying rent. 

If your house has wood floors and experiences a water leak and the tenants can still live there but aren’t happy about it, the tenant’s coverage will take care of what they can cover, and the owner’s coverage will take care of the rest. We often see this situation happen with condos and townhouses. 

Depending on the insurance company, this will cost an owner anywhere from $100 to $300 and a tenant anywhere from $100 to $200. It’s a minimal cost, and we require it of both our tenants before they move in and our owners before they have a tenant reside in their unit. 

If you have any questions about this topic, please feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you!

        <itunes:summary>We recommend that our owners carry certain types of insurance coverage so they can maximize their investment property’s value. Find Out How Much Your Home Will Rent For in Today's Market &nbsp;Learn More About Guaranteed RentFree Insurance Quote One of the questions we get asked a lot by our owners is, “How much insurance should we carry on our home while we don’t live in it?” Today I want to delve into this topic to give you an idea of what owners and tenants can expect. The first thing you must do as an owner is notify your current insurance company that you’re not using the property as your primary residence. This is an important detail for insurance companies because that makes the property an investment property. After that’s done, we first recommend you take out a renter’s insurance policy that covers at least $10,000 in personal property. This is primarily to cover your appliances. This sum won’t be enough to cover a disaster like a wind storm blowing off your roof, but we’ve been fortunate enough in Hawaii to mostly avoid hurricanes and other storms capable of that kind of damage in the past 100 years. Your liability coverage will be $100,000, which is in place in case an accident happens on the property. The other thing we recommend for owners is to get loss of rent coverage. This is important because if there’s a leak or your home incurs some type of water damage, the tenants probably won’t be able to reside in it and pay rent. The loss of rent coverage makes sure you are compensated for the lost rent on your investment.&nbsp;As an owner, your liability coverage will be $100,000.  What do we ask on the tenant’s side? We require all tenants to carry a renter’s policy, which is a simple renter’s policy to cover a minimum of $10,000 on their property, $50,000 in liability, and more if they have a dangerous pet. If they happen to have what we consider a dangerous pet, we ask them to cover $100,000. We also ask them to have loss of rent coverage in their policy so that policy will kick in if something happens to them and prevents them from paying rent. If your house has wood floors and experiences a water leak and the tenants can still live there but aren’t happy about it, the tenant’s coverage will take care of what they can cover, and the owner’s coverage will take care of the rest. We often see this situation happen with condos and townhouses. Depending on the insurance company, this will cost an owner anywhere from $100 to $300 and a tenant anywhere from $100 to $200. It’s a minimal cost, and we require it of both our tenants before they move in and our owners before they have a tenant reside in their unit.If you have any questions about this topic, please feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you!</itunes:summary>

*We do everything we can to protect our clients’ investment properties. One way we do this is by having renters sign an addendum when they move in.* 
**[Find Out How Much Your Home Will Rent For in Today's Market](http://www.hipacificpm.com/Guaranteedrent) **** ** 
[**Learn More About Guaranteed Rent** ](http://www.hipacificpm.com/faqs) 

I’m here today to talk a little bit about the tenant security deposit and how the tenant gets that returned to them when they move out. **We provide each tenant with a move-out addendum that they sign when they move in.** 

There are a number of things that the addendum covers. Before moving out, tenants will have to: 
1. Have all carpets cleaned professionally 
1. Agree to a 10-day walkthrough 
1. Fill and patch any holes created by hanging pictures 
1. Remove all yard debris and garbage 
1. Return the property to the condition it was on move-in day 
1. Have a special carpet treatment if pets had lived in the home 
 
We want to make sure your property is in the same condition when a tenant moves out as when they move in.** This is how we guarantee that your security deposit return will be 100%.** 
We’re here to put money in your account and protect your property.   Now, it is important to keep in mind that a house will have some normal wear and tear on it after a few years. Most of this stuff, like re-applying caulk around the bathtub, we require the tenant to do at their final walkthrough. 

This is how we protect your investment and it’s why we need to make sure your home is all clean before a tenant moves in or out. **There are only two reasons why I’m in business.** One is to put money in your account, and the other is to protect your property. 

If you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.

*How do we earn our fees as a property management company? Here are all the things we do for owners to help them protect their investments.* 
**[Find Out How Much Your Home Will Rent For in Today's Market](http://www.hipacificpm.com/Guaranteedrent) **[**Learn More About Guaranteed Rent** ](http://www.hipacificpm.com/faqs) 
This year has been great so far. Interest rates have gone up, so I commend those of you who have invested in property and chose us to help make your property more valuable. It was a smart move. 

A lot of people want to know about our owner fees and how we earn them when it comes to maintenance and finding tenants. **We put a lot of work into these areas so that our owners and their investments are protected.** 

Before we take over a property to manage, we first look at the appliances. If they need to be serviced, we take care of them. However, once the tenant gets in there, all bets on maintenance are off. People handle day-to-day living differently. Many times we’ll see a disposal overload or toilet backup. 
Doing the hard work up front allows us to find great tenants.  
Whenever something goes wrong, our property manager will contact the owner to see how they want to handle the situation. If they have a friend or family member that can take care of the maintenance, we will go to them. If not, we have our in-house vendors that we have approved and worked with in the past. **We won’t repair anything for you without your permission, however.** 

Another area of our business where we are really strong is our marketing. We make sure to take pictures and video of our properties each time a tenant moves in or out. We also push our properties to the major websites like apartments.com, Trulia, Zillow, Craigslist, and more. Some of those sites have been very strong for us in finding good tenants. 

## We do background checks, credit checks, and criminal checks on all potential tenants. We believe in doing the hard work up front because once it’s done, we can foresee and chase out all the bad prospects or tenants we may get. 

Once we have a tenant, we do a four- or six-month walkthrough to ensure proper maintenance in the home. If they have pets, it’s every four months. If they don’t, it’s every six. 

In a nutshell, that’s how we earn our fees. We think we are more than worth our price, and many of our owners can attest to that. If you have any questions for us or you’re looking to invest in property here in Hawaii, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.

*For every home we lease, we have the tenant sign a move out addendum. This ensures that the property is left in good condition for the next tenant**.* 

Today we wanted to talk about an important part of our leasing contract: The Move Out Addendum. You see, every tenant that signs with us signs a move out addendum. **This contract is an agreement that the tenant will leave the property in the same condition that they got it,** specifically with regard to ensuring that the carpet and the interior are professionally cleaned, because this is the service that we offer to them. This addendum also guarantees us in writing that if the tenant has a pet, they will get special pet treatment on their carpets and deodorize the entire home so that there is no residue.  
 
“ 
We work to protect your home and put money into your account. 
” 
**In addition, this addendum gives the tenant the option of allowing us to professionally clean the home if they don’t want to do it themselves.** That way, they don’t have to clean the house twice. If our tenant does choose to do their own professional cleaning and we get the receipt that things aren’t finished, however, we have the right to recall the service company, specify what they didn’t finish, and make sure the job gets done.  Remember, we only work with two goals in mind: 1) to protect your home; 2) to put money into your account.   If you have any questions about our move out addendum or anything else related to property management, please feel free to call us or shoot us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!

*&lt;/i&gt;* 
 
*As a property owner, complications can arise for you if one of your tenants can’t pay rent. As a property management company, we have a system in place to alleviate this concern.*  

Sometimes, life happens and there’s nothing you can do about it. 
 
As a property owner, your goal is to pick the best possible tenant by making sure that they have a great credit score, a good background check, minimal criminal history, and great references. Even if you pick the most qualified tenant for your property, though, things can go wrong. 
 
For example, let’s say your tenant is in the military and they either get injured, have a medical discharge, or get divorced. That would mean a likely income change. If one of the spouses moved out of that house, things would also likely change dramatically. Whether that means trying to find another tenant or working with the tenant you already have, problems can arise that can complicate the rent situation. 
 
“ 
The thing that we do better than anyone else is find tenants for your home. 
” 
This is where we come in. We’re a property management company. The thing that we do better than anybody else is finding qualified tenants for your home. How do we do this? 
 
We have a break lease agreement with the tenant that states they are responsible for the lease as long as the property goes vacant. As soon as we find another tenant, the Landlord-Tenant Code specifically states that we cannot charge rent to two different tenants for the same days. That’s against the law! 
 
In the event that one of your tenants can’t pay rent, we would quickly replace them to alleviate any negative rents or mortgages that you have to pay. We would get you your rent payments by the 7th of each month in your account, while collecting rent payments on the 1st. That’s our guarantee. 
 
If you have any further questions about property management, please don’t hesitate to contact us. Just give us a call or send us an email and we’d be happy to help in any way we can. Aloha!

        <title>How Our Eviction Guarantee Works </title>

&lt;/i&gt;** 
*We offer our homeowners an eviction guarantee.** How does that work exactly? I’ll take you through each step today.* 
We offer our homeowners an eviction guarantee. How does this work exactly?  
The Landlord-Tenant Code is very specific on the steps you are required to take when you’re going to evict someone from your property in civil court. 
 
As soon as we realize that the rents are going to be late, the first thing we do is post a five-daynotice to terminate the lease. We then take a picture of the five-day lease (which is usually posted on the front door) and submit that photo to civil court.  At the same time, we file for an eviction notice for the tenant to appear in court. That eviction notice to appear in court will normally take 14 to 21 days to get served.  
Once the eviction notice is served, we get a court date. As soon as the tenant is in court, the first question the judge will ask is, “Do you owe rent on this house and why have you not paid?” The tenants normally answer that question like this: “Judge, we do owe the money, but we have an explanation.”  
I will go to the court proceedings along with my property manager for the area. We will testify that the rents are not paid. In that case, we do not take any partial rents for you; if we did, then we couldn’t file for an eviction. 
 
Once the eviction is granted, the judge will ask how many days I will give them to vacate your unit. We will show up on the agreed-upon day with a police officer to accompany them off the property. Once we show up, they have 120 minutes to vacate your home. After they are out, we change the locks, go in with cleaners, and start the re-up process to get your home back on the market.   
“ 
We will choose your tenant and handle any evictions at no charge to you. 
” 

Remember now, every time we move a tenant in and out of your home, we take new pictures and videos of your property. All of those pictures and videos are date-stamped just in case we end up in court. 
 
That is the eviction process. If you elect to use our eviction guarantee, we will choose your tenant for you. We will find a tenant with a credit score of at least 620, and we guarantee to pay for the eviction process. If you choose to select your own tenant and ignore the eviction guarantee, you will have to pay for me to go to court and evict your tenant.  
Ultimately, I recommend that you let us choose your tenant. We will look at their credit, criminal, and eviction history, and then check their references from past landlords. If you have any questions about the eviction process or our eviction guarantee, please give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

We will testify that the rents are not paid. In that case, we do not take any partial rents for you; if we did, then we couldn’t file for an eviction. Once the eviction is granted, the judge will ask how many days I will give them to vacate your unit. We will show up on the agreed-upon day with a police officer to accompany them off the property. Once we show up, they have 120 minutes to vacate your home. After they are out, we change the locks, go in with cleaners, and start the re-up process to get your home back on the market.  “We will choose your tenant and handle any evictions at no charge to you.       ”Remember now, every time we move a tenant in and out of your home, we take new pictures and videos of your property. All of those pictures and videos are date-stamped just in case we end up in court. That is the eviction process. If you elect to use our eviction guarantee, we will choose your tenant for you. We will find a tenant with a credit score of at least 620, and we guarantee to pay for the eviction process. If you choose to select your own tenant and ignore the eviction guarantee, you will have to pay for me to go to court and evict your tenant. Ultimately, I recommend that you let us choose your tenant. We will look at their credit, criminal, and eviction history, and then check their references from past landlords. If you have any questions about the eviction process or our eviction guarantee, please give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!</itunes:summary>

        <title>When Should You Expect to Get Your Security Deposit Back? </title>

When do we return the security deposit? There are a few things you need to know. 
 
First of all, the Hawaii Statute for the Landlord-Tenant Code requires the security deposit to be returned within 14 days. I must also notify you within 14 days about quotes for repairs or cleaning that may not have been done when you moved out. 
 
To move this process along, you can make sure that you get the home professionally cleaned, the carpet professionally cleaned, and keep the receipts. You should only clean the carpet after all items have been removed from the home. 
 
Those two things alone will save you a lot of time. If I have to find a professional cleaning service for you, it would be at a competitive rate and I would quote you ahead of time. Still, that could delay things.  
“ 
Professionally cleaning the home and carpet will save you a lot of time. 
” 
We will do a final walkthrough. Remember, the day you turn your keys over to me is the last day you are charged for rent. If you go over your time, you will be charged for that rent. For example, if you say you will be out by the 30th and don’t leave until the 2nd, you will be assessed two prorated days out of the deposit if you go over the lease date. 
 
Since there is too much gray area for us to judge “professionally clean,” starting in 2016, all of our leases require a tenant to have renters insurance and have the unit professionally cleaned when they leave. 
 
If you have any other questions about your security deposit, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

We require more of our tenants than your average property management company. We feel that what we do gives us a huge advantage over other companies. If you own an investment property and are looking for a property management company to assist you, here’s what makes us the best choice for you. 
 
1. We require renter’s insurance. A rental insurance policy is required for all of our tenants. 
 
2. We always get the pet’s picture. If a tenant is moving in with a pet, we make sure we have a photo of the pet for our four- and six-month walkthroughs. 
 
3. We only require one tenant per lease. This really helps us out in the unfortunate situations of a couple breaking up or getting divorced. The only person that is required to be on the lease is the person who fills out the original application. Everyone else will be a legal occupant. 
 
4. All of our rents are due on the 1st. In Hawaii, we don’t have grace period laws like many mainland states do. The rent is due on the first, a late fee is assessed on the 2nd, and the eviction process begins on the 3rd. 
 
“ 
We require more of our tenants. 
”There are two reasons we are in business. The first is to put money in your pocket, and the second is to protect your home. With the help of the measures above, we make sure that it happens. If you have any questions for us, feel free to reach out by phone or email. We would love to hear from you.

If you’re a homeowner potentially looking to do business with Hawaii Pacific Property Management, or are interested in learning more about us, this blog is for you. Today I’m going to answer some questions regarding how we operate that you would be able to ask your current tenant so you can get an idea of how we stack up. 
 
“ 
We don’t get paid unless we have your house occupied. 
”What are your fees and costs? We only have one 10% fee, and zero added cost. Other property management companies will not only charge fees, but also have added cost on top of that. &lt;/li&gt;Do you require a maintenance buffer? No. Our competitors will ask you to deposit a payment ($300-400) into an escrow account for maintenance purposes. I do not require this. &lt;/li&gt;What is your re-renting fee? We don’t have one! When your unit is vacated, other companies will re-rent your unit and charge you a marketing fee. We don’t do that. When your unit goes vacant, we stop getting paid. The only time HPPM gets paid is when your unit is rented.&lt;/li&gt;How do you handle pets?  At HPPM, we take a picture of the pet in question to show you and ask your permission before letting it into your home. We normally do a six-month walkthrough, but with pets this changes to four months.&lt;/li&gt;Walkthroughs? We do walkthroughs twice a year, either every six months, or four months if pets are involved. &lt;/li&gt; 
We don’t get paid unless we have your house occupied. That’s the only time HPPM will take a fee. We look forward to your questions. Give us a call or see us on our website. Our lines are always open. Aloha!

Today we are excited to talk about our brand-new maintenance specific hotline here at Hawaii Pacific. We’re sending this out to all of our tenants so you are aware of the latest improvement we’ve made in our business. Instead of having to call multiple people and keep track of all different kinds of information, getting work done is now as easy as a phone call or email. We recommend that you both email and call our maintenance line. The number for the line is (808)275-8088. 
From that point on, Fely Rose will be talking to our vendors and will get in touch with you to make sure we can get things fixed as soon as possible at a time that’s convenient for you. Fely will also alert the property manager at the same time, letting them know there is a problem.

        <title>How to Handle Security Deposits</title>

        <description>  

If you have an investment property, it’s always a good idea to demand a security deposit from renters before they move in. The purpose of the deposit is so that you have some funds available if damages exceed the repair amounts on the property.  
When the tenants move out, we only have 14 days to look at the property and make repairs or refund them the security deposit. If repairs are necessary, we have to give them a written note designating the costs of the repair.

If you have any further questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Today we are talking about pets. As the owner of the house, you have the freedom to choose whether you want to allow pets or not in your property. However, here are four reasons we love pet-friendly homes. 
 
It takes less time to find a renter.&lt;/li&gt;Tenants typically stay longer.&lt;/li&gt;Tenants are usually more responsible.&lt;/li&gt;Families with higher incomes have pets.&lt;/li&gt; 
Remember, you are allowed to discriminate on the types of pets you allow, and you can require up to 1 month’s rent for a pet deposit.  
If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out. We are here to help with all of your property management needs!&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Today's tip of the month is aimed at all the owners out there. 
 
**If you're a property owner who signs on to use our services, we offer to evaluate your home value each year we renew a client.** Once we renew a client, we look at the value of your property and determine whether it's gone up. If your home's value has risen, we raise the rents! **This helps to cover your costs, our costs, and all additional costs that come up in the process.** 
 
 
If you have any questions about how this evaluation process works, or if you would like to learn more about Hawaii Pacific Property Management and the services we offer, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to give you a hand!&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

At HI Pacific, we want to make sure your rental home is protected. Many owners ask, "How do we handle pets?" Today, Duke Kimhan from HI Pacific Property Management joins us to discuss pet deposits. 
 
First of all, **we do walk throughs on all the properties we manage.** If you have pets, we conduct a four month walk through. 
**We also require an additional deposit of either $400, $500, $600, or $1,000, depending on the size of the animal.** This deposit is required before we finalize the lease. Background checks, credit checks, and work verification are also required before the lease is finalized. For military tenants, we verify their contract with the HR department. 
 
Most people these days have some kind of pet. Families that rent for a longer period of time tend to have pets. HI Pacific Property Management is here to protect your home. If you have any questions, call (808) 445-9223, or visit [**www.hipacificpm.com**](http://www.hipacificpm.com/). We look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;Today, we want to briefly discuss our agent referral program. 
 
If you are an agent and you refer a homeowner to us who ends up hiring us to manage their rental property, we will pay back the first month's management fees straight to you! **Additionally, we offer a 100% client return to agent guarantee.** This means that when a seller decides to sell their home one day, they come back to you! 
 
We don't conduct sales or buy real estate, so give us a call if you want to work with a team that is solely focused on property management. We would love to hear from you!&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
