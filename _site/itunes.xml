        <description>

If you are a buyer, there are four things that you should never say during a showing or to the seller:

1. Never say that this is your dream home. It doesn’t matter how gorgeous the house is or how ugly the house is; you never want to say that you love the home, especially if the seller or seller’s agent is present. You might think that making this kind of comment would make the seller want you to get the home. However, once they know you are in love with the home, they will want to mark up the price. They will use your love for the home as leverage and maybe even make you overpay for the property, so make sure that you leave your feedback and comments with your Realtor.

2. Never tell a seller that you can afford their home. Once they know you can afford it, they will try to make you go higher. Now, there’s no room for negotiation for your buyer’s agent. The negotiation process will be more challenging, and you may end up paying more for the home.

“Don’t tell the seller how much you love the home unless you want to pay extra for it.”

3. Don’t ask the seller why they are selling. When you ask this question, sellers immediately put their guards up. They don’t have to share this information with you, and they could be moving for very personal reasons. Maybe somebody passed away, or they have to relocate because of a job situation. Don’t get really personal when it comes to buying your home, especially if the seller is right there in front of you.

4. Never submit a lowball offer, especially in a seller’s market where inventory is low and demand for houses is high. A lowball offer could be offensive to the seller. They know their home is worth a certain amount, and submitting an offer way below market value would definitely offend them. They would put their guard up and they may not entertain your offer. You will most likely lose out on a chance to get a home that you really like if you make a lowball offer. The seller will want nothing to do with you. When deciding what price to offer, talk to your professional real estate agent to come up with a fair value that will work for you.

Remember, do not attempt to say any of the four things we mentioned today at your next home showing.

If you have any questions in the meantime, just give us a call or send us an email. I would be happy to help you!

Today, I have four tips for sellers who are looking to list their homes in today’s market. These tips will help you sell your home quickly, smoothly, and for more money.

“A real estate professional will take care of the costs of marketing your home.”


  Don’t list your home inaccurately.This will affect how long it will take for your home to sell, how long you’ll end up staying on the market, and how much money you’ll be leaving on the table. Hire a local professional to help you determine the right price for your home.
  Hire an agent. If you plan on listing by yourself, how will you handle negotiations and determine which offer is best for you and your family? The knowledge and expertise that Realtors have will help you negotiate terms and understand the contract, and they’ll help you eliminate stress from the process.
  A real estate professional can help reduce marketing expenses. By yourself, you could advertise your home on free websites, but you’d actually be missing out on the true potential of buyers on the market. A real estate professional will take care of the costs of marketing your home and will have access to even more avenues through which your home can be exposed to potential buyers.
  A professional will lend you time and freedom. Imagine if you listed your home on your own and you tried to go on a family vacation. Your phone would blow up because everyone would want to see your home and ask questions about it. Hiring an agent would take the stress off your shoulders by managing the listing, answering calls, and making sure that you don’t miss out on opportunities.


If you are looking to buy or sell a home in today’s market, feel free to reach out to us. We’d love to be your real estate professionals.

If you want to get pre-approved to buy a home quickly, here are four tips which can help:

1. Have at least two years’ worth of work history. This doesn’t mean you have to have been at the same job for two years—it just means you have to have been working for at least the last two years.

2. Have credit. Make sure you’ve been building up your credit so you can qualify for the best interest rates. If you haven’t started building your credit, apply for some credit cards from your local bank and use them wisely.

“These four tips will help you get pre-approved for a loan quickly.”

3. Save money. Nowadays, there are a lot of down payment assistance programs out there that could help you, but you’ll still have to pay for things like closing costs once you purchase your home. That money will have to come out of your pocket.

4. Have all your documents in place. This means your pay stubs, bank statements, W-2s, and all forms of identification are in place and ready to go when your lender asks for them.

If you have any questions about how to get pre-approved quickly or you have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to call us or send us an email. We’d love to help you.

        <description>

There are a lot of commercial advertisements for different home insurance companies out there, and these advertisements can get repetitive to the point where you might assume that when they promise you “peace of mind,” they mean they will cover everything. Is that true?

These are just advertisements, so not everything they say is true. The best way to know for sure is to dive into your policy. One of the reasons I wanted to address this topic today is because of the recent wildfires Southern California’s been experiencing. So many insurance claims have been racked up due to these wildfires, and they can get expensive, especially with recent supply and demand and home values increasing.

“If your policy doesn’t cover certain natural disasters, it may be time to switch companies.”

This is why you need to make sure your policy is up to date. A couple years ago, your home may have been covered up to a certain dollar amount, but that may have changed without you even knowing about it. Make sure any damage that can be caused to your home is covered. If your neighbor’s home burned down but yours didn’t, your home can still be affected by the ash blowing onto your property. Is that cleanup covered? If you don’t understand your policy, odds are that it isn’t.

When an insurance company promises peace of mind, you need to make sure you understand the ins and outs of your policy. If it doesn’t cover certain natural disasters that can happen in your area, it may be time to switch companies. Sit down with your agent and double-check if everything is up to date.

If you have any questions about this topic or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in the near future, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help you.

        <description>

If you plan on selling your home, follow these four tips to make the whole process quicker and easier.

1. Take photos of your home early. Don’t wait until the grass turns yellow and the leaves are off the trees. Prepare in advance by taking pictures of the inside and outside of your home while the landscaping still looks really good and green.

2. Have floor mats ready. It’s wintertime in California, which means the weather will be rainy. Have floor mats going in and out of your home so that people don’t track water onto your wood or laminate flooring. The last thing you want is for buyers to come in and leave a mess all over your home.

“Make sure that everything works properly.”

3. Make sure everything is working properly. You don’t want a buyer to come to your home and find that two out of three lights aren’t working. Make sure the HVAC system works as well. Buyers always test everything to make sure it works.

4. Listen to your Realtor when it comes to home pricing. You don’t want your home to be on the market longer than it should. Pricing too high will cause your home to linger on the market, which causes buyers to wonder what’s wrong with it. Make sure that you work with your Realtor to make sure that your home is priced correctly for the market.

These four tips will help make the selling process faster and less stressful. If you have any other questions about selling your home, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

        <description>

What are closing costs? How do you know what you’ll have to pay for them?

Closing costs consist of escrow fees, title fees, lender fees, taxes, and the first mortgage on the home that needs to be paid off. Taking all that into consideration, the majority of buyers end up surprised by what they have to pay.

We always like to educate our buyers about what to expect in a home sale, and that usually means giving them an estimate on what they will have to pay for closing costs up front.

“Closing costs are usually 2% to 5% of the home’s purchase price.”

The most accurate way to estimate what you’ll have to pay in closing costs before actually closing on the house is to speak with a local Realtor or lender so they can review the numbers with you. If you’re submitting an offer for a home, they can let you know how much you’ll need for a down payment and all your closing costs so you’re not surprised or caught unprepared at the last minute.

As a rule of thumb, closing costs are usually 2% to 5% of the home’s purchase price. Again, though, always consult with a professional to find out for sure.

If you have any questions about closing costs or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in the Sacramento area, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.

        <description>

If you’ve been looking to buy or sell in today’s real estate market, there is some important information you’ll need to know before moving forward. Today, I’m bringing you a market update.

Right now, sales have dropped dramatically. This isn’t because people aren’t buying—it’s because, currently, the supply is far too low for the high demand in our area.

There simply isn’t enough for people to choose from.

However, this is a great opportunity for sellers. Competition is low from a selling perspective.

So, listing your home right now could mean getting more bang for your buck. This is a strong seller’s market, so you should absolutely take advantage if you’ve been thinking of doing so.

“Today’s market has a lot to offer for buyers and sellers alike.”

However, there’s still some great news for buyers in today’s market.

Interest rates are very low—they’ve been hovering around 4% since the beginning of 2017.

Despite this being a seller’s market, buyers have a lot of opportunities to take advantage of in our market today, as well.

If you have been thinking of buying or selling, now is a great time to do so. Today’s market has a lot to offer for buyers and sellers alike.

However, do consider your personal situation before making any move. Questions about your individual circumstances should all be taken care of with the help of your local real estate professionals.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

1. Why do you need to buy? Are expecting a new addition to the family? Have you just outgrown the place that you’re currently at? Is rent too high? Does buying make sense?

2. What are home prices currently like, and where is the price headed? Are they going up? If you look at home prices this year compared to last year, they’ve increased between 5% to 10%. The prices are projected to increase for another year, so if you’re waiting until next year to start looking a few home, the property you’ve had your eye on might be more expensive.

“Home prices have increased 5% to 10% since this time last year.”

3. How are the mortgage rates right now?These rates are projected to continue to rise, and if you wait until next year to lock in that rate, you might find you have less buying power than if you started looking now.

If you’re indecisive and you’re still sitting on the fence about whether to buy or wait, hopefully considering these questions will help you made a better decision for you and your family.

If you have any additional questions or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, please give us a call. We’d be happy to help.

        <description>

With home prices continuing to rise and new developments popping up, are we approaching another bubble in the Sacramento market like we saw in 2007?

Looking back 10 years ago, mortgage lending standards were very lenient. With so many unqualified buyers coming into the market, the market tanked and many of them lost their homes. Fast forward 10 years and we see that lenders have learned from that mistake. To get a home loan now, you have to verify your job and income, and your credit score and debt have to meet certain standards.

So what about all those new homes and developments? What happens when the supply explodes and nobody is able to buy them?

“New lending standards keep unqualified homebuyers from entering the market like 2007.”

If you spoke with a lender or builder today, you’d see that all of these new homes have actually already been bought and simply need to be completed. In fact, if you went to an office of a new developer to buy a home, you’d most likely have to go on a waiting list. You might have to wait a number of months for a new home, or to even get a chance to buy a lot and then start the building process.

Builders have even been held back  by a limited number of permits given for things like building roads for homes to go by. Everything is being watched and managed carefully so we don’t end up in another bubble like 2007.

I hope that gives you a better perspective about how the market today differs from what it looked like during the bubble 10 years ago. If you want to learn more or you’re interested in buying or building a home, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email soon. I’d love to help you!

        <description>

When it comes to buying and selling properties, there are three main benefits of working with an agent who’s a part of a team instead of a solo agent.

The No. 1 benefit is if you’re the type of client who has a busy schedule and you’re prone to making last-minute changes, they can accommodate you. For example, let’s say you schedule a showing with your Realtor at 2 p.m. but work kept you late and you can’t get to the house until 3 p.m. If your Realtor works with a team and they have another appointment at 3 p.m., they can simply send one of their teammates to meet you. A solo agent usually isn’t that flexible, and you would probably have to reschedule for another day.

“Your needs are always the top priority when you work with a team.”

The second benefit is that agent’s team will hold them accountable. The last thing you want to do as a client is forget to schedule an inspection and then schedule one on the day it’s due. A team will keep your agent accountable to prevent that situation from happening.

The third benefit is the team will be able to help that agent answer all of your questions and concerns. A team is full of experts in various fields within our industry, whereas a solo agent is a one-stop shop who might not have all the answers.

If you have any questions about working with a team or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to assist you.

        <description>

When you work with a buyer’s agent, do you have to pay them commission?

Believe it or not, the answer is no. The buyer’s agent’s commission has already been figured out and agreed upon by the seller.

A lot of first-time homebuyers may worry that their Realtor’s commission will cut into their savings for the down payment. Some homebuyers even skip hiring a buyer’s agent for that reason. However, that’s the beauty of hiring a buyer’s agent: when it’s all said and done, the seller pays for your agent’s commission.

“The seller pays the commission for the buyer’s agent.”

If you’re not already working with a professional to help you find homes, we recommend hiring a Realtor at no cost to you to find the best home.

If you have any questions about beginning your home search or if you would like to learn more about real estate in general, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

        <description>

As an agent, I get asked about VA loans all the time. Today I’m going to talk about what they are, what their benefits are, and how you can apply for one.

First off, it’s important to note that in order to qualify for a VA loan, you will need to be active-duty military or an active-duty veteran. The biggest benefit to VA loans is that there is no down payment required. That’s an awesome benefit considering you’d need around $10,000 to get into a $300,000 home at 3.5% down with a conventional loan, not including closing costs.

If you want to apply for a VA loan, the first thing you should do is find a good lender. You want to find someone you can trust. They’ll be able to make sure you are eligible for a VA loan and can help out if there are any hiccups.

“Hire a good lender to see if you qualify.”

After you find a good lender, find a good real estate agent who is also familiar with VA loans. They will be able to avoid the pitfalls that other people come across when looking for a house. Since a VA loan is federally backed, they have much higher standards for homes they’re willing to approve. If there are any problems, it won’t qualify for the VA loan and the seller would have to either make all the necessary repairs or find another buyer instead.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We are always happy to answer them.

        <title>Buyer Advice From Lending Expert Nick Street</title>

        <description>

Today we’re back with Nick Street, the branch manager at Mountain West Financial, to go over some important advice for homebuyers. You can check out the first part of our conversation here.

There is a large percentage of first-time buyers in our current market. Nick says that there are many loan programs available for first-time buyers, but some are shrinking and some are changing. What’s available today might not be available tomorrow.

The best thing you can do is meet with a loan officer to go over your specific situation so that you can find the program that is best for you. You still need to have good credit, a job, and verifiable income. Some programs even give you a low down payment option, but keep in mind that it’s always best to have access to some funds when buying a home, as there are definitely costs that come with the transaction.

It’s incredibly important that you find a lender you are comfortable with before you start looking at homes. You need to know what your options are and what your buying power is. Some people start looking at homes in a certain price range only to discover that they cannot afford to buy those homes. That can make the home search process frustrating, as you are constantly comparing the homes you can afford to the homes you want in that other, higher price bracket. Knowing your buying power helps you set realistic expectations for your home search.

“Make sure you talk to a lender before you start looking at homes.”

On the other hand, some buyers may get approved at that higher number but they don’t want to buy in that price range. If you look at your own budget and set a more comfortable number, that is perfectly fine. No one understands your financing better than you do, so it’s really important that you talk to your lender and develop a plan that is based on your wants, needs, and goals.

If you have any other lending questions for Nick, you can reach him at 916-262-7631 or email him at Nick.Street@MWFInc.com. As always, if you have any real estate questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would be happy to help you!

        <description>

I recently sat down with Nick Street, a branch manager with Mountain West Financial. We had a great conversation about mortgages, interest rates, and more. For part one of our conversation, we talked about the current state of interest rates and what the future holds for them.

Nick has been in the mortgage industry since 2004, so he has a wealth of knowledge to share. One of the things he has taken notice of in the last few years is that many people aren’t aware that interest rates are affected by how our economy is doing. When the economy is suffering, rates are going to be pushed down. When our economy is doing well, like it is right now, you will start to see rates increase.

Interest rates greatly affect buying power in this market. If you’re approved for a $300,000 home right now with current interest rates, you would only be able to afford a $270,000 home if rates went up by just 1%.

“Interest rates have a big impact on buying power.”

Right now is actually a great time to buy for a number of reasons. For one, interest rates remain historically low. While it’s true they aren’t as low as they were last summer, when you look at historical data it’s clear that rates are still just about as low as they ever have been. Our market specifically gives buyers a lot of advantages that renters don’t have. Sacramento is a fairly affordable market as well.

In part two, we’ll talk more with Nick about all things mortgage. If you have any questions for Nick, you can reach him at 916.262.7631 or at Nick.Street@MWFInc.com. If you have any questions for us in the meantime, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

Why do you need to hire an agent when buying a home? There are actually a few reasons you’ll want representation when making that big of a purchase.

First, the agent won’t cost you anything. Your agent’s commission actually comes from the seller as payment for bringing the buyer to the property. The bottom line is that you don’t pay a dime to have a buyer’s agent on your side.

“An agent will show you all the homes you want to see.”

Next, a buyer’s agent knows exactly how to negotiate the transaction. Things might come up that need to be negotiated such as repairs you want to be done before closing or complications with the appraisal. You’ll want someone on your side who you are confident can handle those situations for you.

An agent can also show you all the homes you want to see. This means you won’t have to rely on open houses and drive-bys.

Lastly, you want the transaction to be smooth, exciting, and fun. An agent will do all the heavy lifting for you so you can enjoy the process of buying your first home!

If you have any other questions or if you are looking to buy or sell a home, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!

        <description>

“Do your due diligence.”If you’re thinking about buying a home, you should know the transaction will be a little bit more complicated than your average purchase. Today I’ll give you the steps of buying a home so you can be better prepared to jump into the market:


  Consult a real estate agent. Make sure the agent you hire knows your wants, needs, and time frame.
  Apply for a loan. By doing this, you’ll see how much you can get approved for and what sort of rate you’ll get. You want to make sure the monthly payment will be comfortable for your family.
  Look at the available homes that match your criteria. This step is when you’ll determine exactly what sort of home and neighborhood you want to be in.
  Submit an offer. Once you have found your dream home, your agent will submit an offer and negotiate your terms.
  Do your due diligence. Once your offer is accepted, you’ll need to do a variety of home inspections. An appraiser will also come out during this step to make sure the home is selling at fair market value.
  Send your loan package into the underwriters to get approved for your loan.
  Do a final walkthrough. You’ll want to make sure all the repairs have been done that the seller agreed to do. It’s your last chance to verify the condition of the property.
  Sign the documents.
  Pay the down payment and closing costs.
  Get the keys!


If you have any other questions about buying a home, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!

        <description>
Why is a pre-approval so important? What all goes into the pre-approval process?

First off, you need to get pre-approved so you know what kind of home you are able to buy. Your pre-approval number is generally referred to as your purchasing power.

How does your lender calculate this amount? By going through your credit, looking at your income, and determining your debt-to-income ratio, your lender will help you determine what mortgage payment you’re comfortable making.

The interest rate you qualify for is a big factor in determining your purchasing power. For example, if you qualified for an interest rate of 3.25%, your mortgage payment for a $250,000 home would be roughly $1,088 per month. If you don’t qualify for that 3.25% rate and instead qualify for a rate as high as 4.75%, your mortgage payment for that same $250,000 home would increase to $1,300 per month.

“The interest rate you qualify for plays a big role in your purchasing power.”

See why it’s so important to know what interest rate you’re able to qualify for and lock in? That extra $212 could mean a lot. By saying yes to that increased payment, you’re saying no to eating out more often with your family. A higher mortgage rate means more sacrifices.

Many times, I have to explain this process to my clients in more detail, so if you want to dive further into this subject matter, don’t hesitate to ask your own loan officer. They’ll be able to give you the answers you need before buying your first home.

If you have any questions or are looking to buy or sell a home, feel free to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help!

        <title>How the MLS and Lockboxes Help You Buy and Sell a Home</title>

        <description>
Lately, I’ve had a lot of buyers wondering how I’m able to show them homes that I don’t personally have listed. If my picture isn’t on the ‘for sale’ sign, how can I show the home?

When a homeowner decides to sell their home with the help of an agent, they’re working with a listing agent. The listing agent puts the home on a service called the MLS (multiple listing service), which basically advertises that home to every agent who has access to the MLS. Why would you want your home advertised to these agents, though? When a home is put on the market, there’s a certain commission that’s agreed upon by the seller to pay the listing agent and the agent who brings them a willing buyer. The agent who brings a buyer is known as a buyer’s agent.

“Lockboxes let any agent show a home to their buyer, no matter who the listing agent is.”

The Realtor who shows the home represents the buyer’s side of the transaction, whereas the listing agent represents the seller’s side of the transaction. Every agent who has access to the MLS also has access to a lockbox, which they can log into for access to the keys to the home. Every time a buyer’s agent logs into a lockbox, their ID and license verification get sent to the seller to notify them who is looking at their home and how much traffic is coming in.

This will give sellers an idea of whether their home is priced right and attractive to buyers. So that’s how we’re able to show homes to our clients that aren’t our listings.

I hope this helps you understand the MLS and how showings work, no matter who the listing agent is. If you have any other questions or you’re looking to buy or sell a Sacramento home, give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to help you!

Owning a home doesn’t just provide you and your family with a place to live; it’s also a great investment. Today, I wanted to share three reasons why:


  A mortgage is fixed, but rent is not. It depends on the landlord as to how much, but your rent will go up over time. A mortgage payment will stay the same throughout the lifetime of your loan.
  A mortgage acts as a forced savings account. Down the road, as you pay your mortgage and reduce the balance on your loan, you also increase your equity in the mortgage. If an emergency occurs or you want to make upgrades to your home, you can pull equity out of your mortgage because it acts like a savings account from the beginning.
  You can rent out your home if you need to move, and they can pay down your mortgage. You can even potentially earn income from that renter.


“A mortgage acts as a forced savings account.”

These are just three reasons why owning a home is beneficial to your finances. If you’re looking for more reasons or you’re ready to buy or sell a house, give me a call or send me an email soon. I’d love to help you out!

Today, I have good news and bad news that I want to share with you.

The bad news? Since the election, interest rates have gone up. Sadly, they’re no longer hovering around their all-time low average of 3%. The good news? It’s still a good time to buy. Why?

To answer that, let’s turn back the clock a little bit. In the 1970s, interest rates were averaging around 8%. In the 80s, that average rose to 12%. Then, in the 90s, it shrunk back down to 8%. In the 2000s, it shrunk down a little further to 6%.

“You can still lock in an ultra-low rate by buying now.”

Now that we’re almost into 2017, our interest rates are averaging 4%. So, as you see, even as they’ve risen, they’re still incredibly low from a historical perspective. You may have missed out on the apex, but we can’t go back in time. Compared to previous decades, our rates are still historically low, so if you wanted to buy a home, you’d still be locking in a better rate than your parents ever could have.

If you’re looking to buy or sell a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email. I hope to hear from you soon!

One of my clients recently ask me, “Should I buy now and own a home, or should I keep renting and save for a bigger down payment?”

This is an important question. Everybody’s situation is a little bit different, but if you find that you’re asking yourself the same question, I can tell you that there are three reasons you should stop renting and go ahead and buy.

The first reason is that when you write rent checks to a landlord, you’re paying them—not you. You’re not building any equity for yourself—you’re building equity for your landlord. If you’re renting to try and save for a bigger down payment and prevent PMI being added onto your mortgage, you’re not doing yourself any favors. In all that time, you could’ve been lowering your mortgage and building equity for yourself.

The second reason is that when you own a home, you can do whatever you want to it. When you rent, if you want to change anything substantial about the property, you need permission from the landlord. Even if the landlord does give you permission, you’re only upgrading their property—not yours.

“Owning a home means building long-tern equity.”

The third reason is if you do buy a home and the experience is too overwhelming, after five years, you have the option of turning the property into a rental home and becoming a landlord, yourself.

Do you want to be able to do whatever you want to the house you’re living in? Do you want to be able to pay yourself first and build equity in the long run? Do you want the freedom to be able to become a landlord in the future? If you answer “yes” to any of these questions, you probably have your answer.

If you have any questions about this topic, please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you!

        <title>The Most Important Parts of the Home Inspection</title>

        <description>
Today I wanted to discuss three important aspects of home inspections.

The first thing to remember is that you as a buyer will have to pay for the home inspection. You don’t want the seller to pay for the inspection because if they do, they will choose the inspector. As a result, the inspector will look out for the seller’s best interests instead of yours. You want the inspector to be working for you so that he or she can give you an unbiased opinion of the home.

Secondly, you will get some recommendations for inspectors from the agent that is helping you buy the home, but you’re not obligated to choose any of them. Feel free to do your own research on a home inspector that fits your needs.

“You want to be able to choose your own inspector.”

Finally, don’t expect the home inspection report to be very detailed; it will only cover the basics. An inspector is not going to break down walls and look at plumbing or wires. They will only cover the cosmetics of the home to make sure it looks decent, that the water is turned on, the gas works, the power outlets work, and whether the roof looks good. We still recommend having a roofing professional come out to do a detailed roof inspection to find out whether it’s certifiable.

Hopefully, this gives you a better idea of what to expect when it comes to home inspections. Remember that you can be present during the inspection. That way, the inspector can address any specific concerns you have.

If you have any more questions about home inspections or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in the Sacramento area, give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you out!

        <description>
There are three reasons to get pre-approved for a mortgage before you shop for a home:


  You’ll know what you can afford. People will come to me wanting to look at homes in a certain price range and then proceed to get pre-approved. Many times, these buyers end up qualifying for more than they thought and have more options for buying a home. You won’t have to cap yourself because you’ll know what you can afford.
  You won’t know what interest rates will be until you lock them in. If you look for a home first and then get pre-approved, you won’t have a good idea of what your payment is. You might find out that payments are more than you can afford on a monthly basis, and we have to reduce the purchase price. Interest affects more than just the price, so you want to lock in your rate before shopping.“Getting pre-approved tells toy exactly what you can afford.”
  You can provide the seller with the pre-approval letter. This is huge if you find yourself up against other offers. If you don’t have a pre-approval letter and the offer you’re competing against does, the seller will most likely go with the offer with the pre-approval. Why? All the lender information is there to verify that the buyer has the necessary funds. Sometimes sellers who go under contract with buyers who aren’t pre-approved will cancel the deal within a week when they find out about their pre-approval status.


Don’t underestimate any of these three points about getting pre-approved for a loan before you look at homes. If you have any questions about the pre-approval process or you’re thinking about buying a home in Sacramento, give us a call or send us an email. We’d be happy to help!

        <description>
There are three strategies that you as a buyer can utilize to win a multiple offer situation.

The first is shortening the contingency period in your offer. A contingency period in a normal offer is anywhere from 17 to 21 days. Your offer may look stronger if you shorten up your contingency period to perhaps 15 or 10 days.

This makes you appear to be more serious about your offer. The seller might be willing to take your offer over other offers that are higher just because your contingency period and your terms make more sense for them.

“Shorten the contingency period in your offer.”

The second strategy you can use is writing a personal letter to the seller letting them know why they should choose your offer over everyone else’s. That letter could mean the world to them because it makes your offer more personal.

The third strategy is to include your lender’s information in your offer. This includes their cell number, email, and the name of their company. In this case, if the seller is looking to do their due diligence on the offer to make sure that you’re approved or have the amount ready for the down payment, they have all the information they need in order to do so.

If you’re looking to buy our sell a home, don’t hesitate to get in contact with us. Just give us a call or send us an email, and we’d be happy to help you.

        <title>Why Do You Need a Listing Appointment to Help Sell Your Sacramento Home?</title>

        <description>
What happens on a listing appointment? Typically, sellers who contact us have a general idea of what the house is worth. Thanks to different sites like Zillow and Redfin, you can get a good approximation of what the home is worth. So why have us walk through the house?

First, we give our professional opinion. We let you know exactly what to do to net the most money for your home and sell it the fastest.

We also tell you what not to do. We have saved sellers thousands of dollars by letting them know what mistakes to avoid. Not long ago, a seller contacted us and we went on a listing appointment. He talked about renovating his entire kitchen and redoing a bathroom. We advised him to hold off on those major repairs and recommended some smaller fixes instead. Not only did he not have to invest all that time and money on renovating his kitchen, he also got $20,000 more than he expected thanks to our advice.

“We’ll tell you how to net the most money from your home sale.”

After the walk through, we send you a listing agreement. From there, we take professional photographs of your home. We have a great, unique marketing system that allows us to get multiple offers for our sellers.

At our listing appointments, we cover everything from A to Z. We have contractors and vendors available to help with the necessary repairs that will sell your home for top dollar.

If you have any other questions, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you.

        <description>
Recently, I had a buyer consultation with a client, and she asked, “How is the real estate market doing?”

Right now, Sacramento has about 1.3 months of housing inventory available. To put that in perspective, a balanced market has four to six months of inventory. Anything below that is considered a seller’s market.

With only a little over a month of inventory available, houses that are priced correctly are flying off the market in as little as 10 days. Demand is incredibly high right now, and if a buyer finds the right home, they are moving quickly to make sure they get it.

Part of the reason why demand is so high is because interest rates are at an all-time low. The buyer I spoke with was able to get a 30-year fixed rate of 3.6% by working with our preferred lender. If you’re like me and you have a 5% interest rate on your home, now is a good time to look into refinancing your mortgage. Even though it’s a strong seller’s market, it’s a strong borrower’s market as well.

“Sacramento is in a strong seller’s and borrower’s market.”

The second quarter of 2016 is even better than the first. Since this is such a strong seller’s market, a lot of our properties are getting multiple offers. Recently, we listed a property at $429,000. The property got eight offers and closed at $452,000. The appraiser warned us that the property wouldn’t appraise, but it did!

In April, we closed 27 transactions, which is almost a deal a day. As you can see, the Sacramento market is booming. If you have any questions, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

What’s the best way to find your dream home online in Sacramento? You’ve probably visited at least one of the three real estate giants online in Zillow, Trulia or Redfin, which make up almost 80% of online real estate market. The problem is, the listings are often outdated.

Have you or anyone you know found a home you really loved online, only to find that it sold weeks or even months ago?

For this very reason, we have a website called www.HeidiPhongHomes.com where you find not only the most relevant info for your house, you’ll do it for free.

“Everything is fresh and current.”

Us Realtors have access to what’s called the MLS, which is where all new business goes. Agents use it to find houses for their clients - and while you won’t have access to the MLS, our website pulls data from the MLS nearly in real time. Everything is fresh and current, which means no outdated listings like you run into with Zillow, Trulia and Redfin.

If you’re looking for homes in the near future or even just shopping around, you want to visit this website. And as always, if you or anyone you know is looking to buy or sell, think of us. We’d love to work with you!

Is it better to own a home or to rent? As a real estate advisor, there really isn’t a straight answer. In fact, to find out what the right answer is for a particular client’s situation,I ask the following questions:


  What are your plans for the next 2-5 years? You need to think about your relationships and your job before you make the leap into homeownership. If you may be relocating in coming years, locking in a mortgage may not be the best option.
  How much are you paying in rent? If rent is, say, $1,600 a month, you have options out there where you would be paying the same amount of money in monthly mortgage and principal payments.
  What are the benefits of homeownership? If you own your home, you can write off some of your expenses when tax season comes around and, historically, home prices increase over time, so owning a home becomes a type of forced savings. With rates at historic lows, owning a home is more affordable than it usually is!
  What are the disadvantages of homeownership? When you become a homeowner, you are responsible when things break. If you’re not someone who is willing or able to fix things or find someone who will, homeownership may not be for you.


“Whether you should buy or rent really depends on how you react to these questions.”

Whether you should buy or rent really depends on how you react to these questions. Buying is not for everyone, but I know there are many people out there unaware that it’s even an option.

If you want our help determining what might be best for you, or if you need real estate assistance of any kind, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to hear from you!

        <description>
Have you ever wondered why some homes fail to sell? Typically, there are four reasons for this:


  Poor marketing. Gone are the days when an agent simply puts up a yard sign, enters your home on the MLS, and waits for a buyer to come along. These days, savvy buyers are cruising the web for homes. In fact, according to the NAR, over 90% of buyers find homes online before they go out looking. We invest over six figures to get our listings  seen by the highest number of buyers!
  Bad photos. You can’t take photos of your home with an iPhone and expect it to sell. The first showing is online, and if you don’t have professional photographs, buyers won’t even waste their time clicking on the listing. We send out a professional photographer to all of our listings and create a virtual tour for them as well.
  Incompetent agent. Homes often fail to sell based solely on the agent. There are great agents, in-between ones, and horrible ones. A bad agent will price the home incorrectly and fail to return phone calls. You need an agent who is going to be with you every step of the way!
  Pricing. Many sellers think they can price their home high and just negotiate down if necessary. However, putting the right price on the home from the start is crucial if you want to sell quickly and for top dollar. It’s not an exact science, but our team has mastered the pricing process!


“There are a handful of things that will prevent your home from selling, the key is avoiding them!”

If your home failed to sell for one of these reasons, or if you want to avoid the same fate as other buyers, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to hear from you!

Whether you’re buying or selling a home, before you hire a Realtor you need to ask them a few questions. We’ll be discussing two very important questions today.1. Is your Realtor full time or part time? You want a full-time Realtor if you’re buying or selling. Why would you let a part-time worker help you make such an important investment? You want someone that is dedicated to you and your needs.1. How many homes did they sell last year? If they sold less than 20 or 30 homes, you may want to find someone with more experience. This industry isn’t easy, and you need someone that can help guide you through it, especially in the tough Sacramento market.

“You need an experienced, full-time real estate agent.”

If you want to hear more questions you should ask your Realtor, please don’t hesitate to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you!

        <description>
There really is only one reason to buy or sell a home right now. That has to do with supply and demand. We have an extremely low supply of homes and a major demand for them.

We only have about a 40-day supply of homes here in Sacramento, which is uncharacteristically low. A healthy market would have 4 months of supply, so we need homes on the market! Homes are selling within 25 days and if your home is priced well and in good condition, it could sell even faster.

“Right now is a great time to enter the real estate market.”

So, what’s driving all the demand? Rising interest rates are to blame. People are buying homes now because they know that interest rates will only climb higher. By purchasing a home now, you can save thousands of dollars in interest over the lifetime of your loan.

If you’re interested in buying a home, I suggest that you do so now. The same goes for home sellers. It’s just a great time to be in the real estate market right now.

I look forward to hearing from you!

With the selling season in full swing, I wanted to share four inexpensive ways to add some value to your home. These things can be done right before a sale, and they can put some extra cash in your pocket at closing.


  AppliancesMany of our homes have older appliances within them, and you might be surprised at how inexpensive it is to get new appliances. A company I know of called ABT is able to swap out all of your appliances to get you the stainless steel that buyers love to see these days.
  PaintingThis may be one of the easiest ways to add value to your property. Fresh paint is an extremely cost-effective way to add value to your home, and can go a long way to make buyers believe that your home is brand new. Just make sure that colors throughout your home are uniform, and buyers typically prefer lighter earth tones.
  StagingWe provide a free home stager when you work with us, and he or she will come out to arrange your home in an enticing way. Homes that are dolled up and staged often sell for more money than homes that have not been altered prior to selling. This is a fantastic way to put some extra cash in your pocket at closing.
  Depersonalize / declutterBuyers don’t like to see messy homes, and they also need to imagine themselves living within the space of your home. Cleaning up and organizing your home can go a long way towards making potential buyers feel more comfortable within your home. Remove any collections of photos, art, or other personal items. You don’t need your home to be empty, but don’t let your particular lifestyle be readily apparent to everyone who walks inside your home.


“Fresh paint is an extremely cost-effective way to add value to your home.”

As you prepare to sell your home, I hope that these tips will be able to put more money in your pocket. The repairs that you think might net you more money are not always the ones that you need to be making. Be sure to speak with us before your home sale so you don’t waste your money on unnecessary repairs.

Please don’t hesitate to contact me with any questions you might have about real estate in Sacramento!

        <title>Four Reasons Why You Need a Realtor</title>

Today I wanted to speak about four reasons why you should hire an agent to sell your home in Sacramento. A real estate agent can represent you and your best interests, so here are four reasons why you should hire one to sell your home.


  Agents outsell FSBO’s: A FSBO is a for sale by owner property. A Realtor can get you up to 6% more for your home, and that can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars in a sale. Studies show that homes priced correctly will sell faster and for more money.
  You have a negotiator on your side: There are a lot of different people to negotiate with throughout the process of selling a home, and it pays dividends to know how to speak with these people and get their attention. Realtors already have relationships with these people, and you’ll find it much easier for them to negotiate than doing so on your own.
  Realtors have professional marketing experience: Real estate agents have the ability to display your home on hundreds of different websites and this is important because over 90% of buyers look online when they begin a home search.
  More guidelines in the lending world: With all the rules and regulations in place in the lending world, it’s increasingly difficult to sell your own home. We have partner lenders that simplify this entire process quite immensely.


If you have any further questions about how we can help you, please don’t hesitate to ask. We can sell your home for more money, and in less time.

We hope to hear from you soon!

Today I’d like to provide you with a brief market update for the Elk Grove and Sacramento areas. I usually like to reserve these market analyses for individual cases, but today I’ll give you a generalized look at what’s happening in our area.


  Low interest rates have kept the market strong because it’s an incentive for buyers to purchase, and it’s also making sellers want to list their homes because of increased demand.
  We’re currently seeing about 3 months of inventory in Elk Grove. With our marketing strategies we can probably cut that number down to one month (contact us if you want to sell quickly and for more money).
  For the most part, buyers want to come out and purchase homes right now because of high affordability. New loan products from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with only a 3% down payment requirement should also bolster buying power, which should cause an extra surge of activity in Elk Grove.“Buyers want to come out and purchase homes right now because of high affordability.”


This is a generalized report on our market, but please feel free to contact me if you would like to sit down and discuss your particular situation. As always, please don’t hesitate to contact my team with any questions!
