A career in the real estate business is also a career in the marketing business. Here’s why.

We’re almost into 2020, but before we get there, I have a message for you. Everybody wants to get into the real estate business, but if you’re getting into the real estate business right now, you’re actually getting into the marketing business as well.

Right now, when you’re thinking about a career in real estate, you’re entering one of the most competitive businesses out there. This means that you don’t want to look like everyone else. 

You want to stand out from the crowd. The best way to stand out is through your marketing. Whether it’s through radio, TV, advertising, social media, you have got to look different than every other agent and you’ve got to make an impression.

“You want to stand out from the crowd in this business.”

Here at Carbutti and Co., we’re committed to having a social media manager, along with different marketing strategies and value propositions. If you’re thinking about a career in real estate and you don’t want to go it alone, give us a call or send us an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Jessica Durbin has known our team for years and has even referred family to us. Here’s why.

Jessica Durbin has worked for Connoisseur Media for a little over three years and has been in the radio business for over two decades. As someone who used to have a license, she appreciated the business that we have built even more after getting to know us for the past eight years. We put tons of marketing and support into our agents to help them succeed, and that’s just one of the reasons that Jessica has referred us to her family and friends over the years. “If I were looking to buy or sell my home, I would absolutely refer Jonathan Carbutti and Carbutti and Company Realtors,” Jessica said.

If you ever have any questions about real estate, please feel free to reach out to us by phone or email. We would love the chance to help you.

Summer is winding down, but our market isn’t. Let’s discuss what’s happening now.

We’re in the dog days of summer, but don’t think because the weather is set to cool down soon that our market is, as well. Homes are still selling, and many are getting multiple offers. We’re still in desperate need of inventory, so if you’re thinking of listing, don’t delay. Whether you’ve got plans to buy or sell, it’s a great time to make a move. And our team here at Carbutti Real Estate would be happy to help you make the most of your goals. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

To all potential homebuyers: If you are curious about taking a look at some properties that interest you, or if you’re wondering whether or not you qualify for a mortgage, I want you to reach out to me.

When you meet with me or one of our team’s real estate professionals, we’ll:


  Walk you through the whole home buying process
  Answer all of your questions
  Show you all the mortgage products available to you, including no-money-down loans, VA loans (for veterans), and FHA 203k rehab loans
  Get you pre-approved for a mortgage


There are so many different options for buyers in today’s marketplace. In fact, I’d even argue that there’s never been a better time to buy a home—so many different conditions in the market are working in your favor.

“So many different conditions in the market are working in your favor.”

If you’ve never bought a home before, or haven’t in a few years, I encourage you to reach out to me. Let’s set up a buyer consultation where we can discuss your options and help to get you into the home of your dreams.

        <description>

If you’re a seller who has been thinking about putting your home on the spring market, now is the time to get a move on and actually do it.

In our market, we can’t keep these properties long enough. There is so much pent-up demand from buyers who have been in the marketplace for three to six months and haven’t yet seen anything they like. They’re just waiting for something new to come on the market.

“Now is the time to put your home on the market and take advantage of all this demand from buyers in the marketplace.”

A couple weeks ago, we were in a situation where we put a nice 3-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom, colonial starter home with a one-car garage on the market at 9 a.m. on a Friday morning. We had seven requests for showings in just the first 24 hours! In the first 48 hours, we had six offers on the property. We ended up listing it for $329,000, and we ultimately put the property under contract for $350,000. We were able to create a multiple-offer situation that only benefited our seller.

The pent-up demand stems from a number of different factors, but one of the main reasons for it is that there’s been a real shortage of good inventory on the market. With interest rates holding as low as they have been, there are a lot of buyers who are looking to purchase homes right now.

So again, now is the time to put your home on the market and take advantage of all this demand from buyers in the marketplace.

So, if you’re thinking of selling your home and would like to get top dollar for it, reach out to me. Let’s set up an appointment for us to come down to your house so we can give you an honest, realistic estimate of what your home would sell for, and so we can generate a marketing plan and a time-frame that works for you. I hope to hear from you soon!

Today we’re over at a 4-bedroom, 3-bathroom colonial in the Fairlawn Farms section of Wallingford. We’re getting the house ready for the market, having professional photography done, and doing a bit of professional home staging to enhance the buyer experience. There’s a surprising misconception in the marketplace that home sales are slower in the fall market, but it’s just not true. In fact, there’s a real shortage of homes like this one and there are a lot of buyers out there that are just waiting for something like this. If you have any doubts about putting your home on the market or any questions about what it might be like, I want you to reach out and give me a call or send me an email today. To learn more about the fall market, watch this short video.

To get a visual understanding of all of what Branford, Connecticut, has to offer you, follow along in the video above.Branford is a vibrant shoreline community with about 20 miles of coastline and a dynamic downtown green. Downtown Brandford and the green is really a hub for people who want to hang out at coffee shops, try local foods, purchase flowers, and give patronage to the local businesses. Here, they can walk at the leisure to purchase a cup of coffee and relax on the town green.

All that is located on just one side of the green. On the other side, you can find historic buildings like churches, the town hall, and the courthouse. In the summer, the green hosts jazz concerts and other activities. There’s just a really cool energy down here.

Melanie, a visitor to Branford, says that she and her kids love to come to the town green where it’s safe to play, sit, and relax.

Local resident and business owner Nicole says, “It’s really great! I always knew I wanted to open a business, and I knew I wanted it to be on the green because of the foot traffic. If you’re here in the summer, I’d say you absolutely should visit the beaches, which are great for the kids.

“If you’re looking for something a bit more educational, the Blackstone Library is phenomenal—my kids love it. The schools are great, and the Recreation Department has so many different programs to offer.”

“Even though Branford is considered a beach community, it’s surprisinglyaffordable for first-time homebuyers.”

With just a short walk from the town green, you can reach Indian Neck, which has some great private residences and second homes within walking distance to a private beach.

Branford is home to the Owenego Inn Beach &amp; Tennis Club, which was once a popular resort in the early 1900s and is now a popular beach destination for weddings and other events.

Just around the corner is Lenny’s restaurant. Overlooking a beautiful marsh setting, it’s very popular with the locals, and people drive from all over to try the steamers and other fresh seafood. You can sit out on the back deck and enjoy both the scenery and their jazz nights, which take place every Thursday.

Branford has also jumped on the brewery scene. The Stoney Creek Brewery is right around the corner from the town green; they have a beautiful indoor tasting area, and the brewery is right on an ocean setting. You could sit outside and have a couple of beers while enjoying the view, or even host an office party.

Even though Branford is considered a beach community, it’s surprisinglyaffordable for first-time homebuyers. There are many options for condos and single-family homes under $300,000, depending on where you’re looking and the size of the homes. Upgrade buyers looking for a 4-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom with a master bedroom suite will also find an affordable array of choices. Additionally, Branford is in one of the lowest tax brackets compared to the surrounding communities. This fantastic bedroom community is about 10 or 15 minutes from downtown New Haven, and has an accessible train line that leads into Metro North and New York City.

If you have any questions about Branford’s real estate market or other general questions, please reach out to me. I would be happy to speak with you and provide even more reasons to look into this gorgeous community.

        <guid>Join me on a tour of my hometown, Wallingford, Connecticut, to see what this hidden treasure has to offer.</guid>
        <description>

Welcome to my town of Wallingford, Connecticut.

Since I grew up here, Wallingford is very special to me. I’m raising a family here, my business is here, and I also think that it’s one of the best-kept secrets in all of Connecticut.

I have never been in a community that comes together more than Wallingford does. We’re probably the largest non-metropolitan chamber in the state, and that’s because of the businesses and people who live here.

It’s an aesthetically beautiful town. With the historic architecture here, walking around the center of Wallingford is like walking in the park. I believe we have better restaurants in such a close proximity than any other surrounding town.

We have a surprising amount of open and rural space available. Yes, we have many thriving shops and restaurants in the downtown area, but when you go to the outskirts of Wallingford, we have so many things: vineyards, open country, hiking trails, and trout fishing stocked by the state of Connecticut.

The public school system of Wallingford is fabulous; we have a great superintendent, and they’re constantly coming up with fresh ideas and bringing the latest, cutting-edge classes to our town.

“Welcome to my town of Wallingford, Connecticut.”

A little-known fact about Wallingford: We have one of the most prestigious private high schools in whole country, called Choate Rosemary Hall. It’s larger than most college campuses, and a lot of famous public figures, actors, and past presidents have attended this school.

Another draw to our town is our 69,000 square foot public library. You haven’t seen a public library and the resources they offer until you’ve stepped foot in the Wallingford Public Library.

We’re also drawing in a lot of new businesses, down to mom-and-pop sandwich shops like The Eatery; independent bakeries like Allyssa’s Cakery; and we even have brew houses like Front Porch Brewery, Cliffside Brewing, and the New England Cider Company.

Wallingford has not one, but two vineyards: the rolling, 120-acre Gouveia Vineyards, and the smaller Paradise Hills vineyard. They’re both unique in their own right, and they’re even within walking distance of each other.

Wallingford is conveniently located  between New Haven and Hartford. If you’re a professional whose job takes you all over the place, you can get anywhere in the state from our town within 20 minutes, thanks to our brand-new train station with a high-speed line to Hartford, Springfield, and Boston.

There’s a wide variety of housing for everybody here, from antique homes built in 1776 to large mansions up on Turnberry Road that overlook the vineyard. We have excellent affordability, even for first-time homebuyers, upgrade buyers, and new construction buyers. People are constantly surprised by how much home they can get for their money, compared with surrounding towns.

Thank you for taking the time to tour our town. If you have any questions about Wallingford, please reach out to me. I’d love to discuss what my hometown has to offer.

        <description>

For today’s community spotlight, we’ll be highlighting a great non-medical in-home care company: Comfort Keepers of Wallingford. According to office manager Randi Gaetano, the company’s goal is to keep seniors happy, healthy, and safe in their homes for as long as possible.

The space out of which they operate is centrally located, easy to find, and great for hosting caregiver training sessions. “The support staff here at our office is second to none,” says Randi.

“Comfort Keepers’ goal is to keep seniors happy, healthy, and safe in their homes for as long as possible.”

Comfort Keepers is unique in that clients are specifically matched to caregivers. This works incredibly well, as different clients will have different needs. Whether it’s making sure breakfast is done, helping clients get out of bed, or reminding clients to take their medication, there are so many services in-home caregivers provide.

As someone who grew up in Wallingford herself, Randi says she loves the community. And with a couple of her family members having owned businesses in town as well, Randi has been able to establish her name as a fixture in the town. This means people know, recognize, and trust her.

You can learn more about Comfort Keepers by visiting their website.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Bill Kosche gives his testimonial today about Carbutti Real Estate. As a repeat customer, he chose our company to sell his home of 35 years, and also to purchase his new home.

“When I first got ready to put the house on the market, I had somebody come look at it and he offered me much less than my asking price. After I redid the floors and did the painting, not only did I get my money back, I made some.”

“It was a good feeling to have a reward for the work that he put into preparing the home for sale.”

There were about 30 showings on his home in the first day and there were five offers. Bill’s home ended up selling for $15,000 over his asking price. He says it was a good feeling to have a reward for the work that he put into preparing the home for sale.

His advice for any first-time home seller is to go with a team that can get the job done. And, since houses sell quickly in the area, make sure that you have someone that can handle the local area and help you prepare so you can get a better result.

If you are interested in speaking with me to help you have a success story like Bill’s, please feel free to call or email me any time. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

It’s an exciting time to be selling your home, especially if you have waited it out for the last few years because your equity was down.

“Increased competition will drive up prices this spring.”

The real estate industry experts are predicting one of the busiest spring markets in years. Here are just a few of the most recent projections we’ve seen for the market in 2018:


  Home prices are projected to hit their highest levels in 11 years.
  New housing starts are projected to hit their highest levels in 8 years.
  Purchase volume is expected to increase by $80 billion.
  First-time homebuyers are projected to make up 40% of the market.


With so many first-time homebuyers entering the market, it can only mean increased competition, which is going to drive some prices up this spring.

It’s an exciting time for you to capitalize on this market. If you’re thinking about selling your home at any point in the near future, so don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you soon.

        <description>

If you’ve never heard of or haven’t read the book “The Resilience Roadmap” by Danny Morel, I highly recommend that you read it. 

I don’t think there’s another real estate agent or broker in the business who’s gone through more trials and tribulations than Danny to get where he is today. I also think there’s not another person who’s more involved on a daily basis in his agents’ success. 

“Your success is based on your routine.”

“The Resilience Roadmap” challenges you look at your mindset and your daily activity and make a routine for success. What he argues (and I agree with) is your success is based on your routine. If you don’t have a daily routine of doing the exact same things every day, practicing your skill sets, and getting better every day, you won’t reach the level of success you’re looking for. 

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this book, so feel free to text me or send me an email about it. If you have any other questions, I invite you to reach out to me as well. I look forward to hearing from you.

Today I want to discuss how the market is doing as a whole. I’ve been hearing a lot of talk that the market is slowing down or houses aren’t selling.

Actually, the opposite is true.This is one of the best starts we’ve had to a real estate season in years. My team alone has listed 27 brand-new properties since January 3, with 17 pending sales in that same timeframe.

In New Haven County as a whole, 698 new homes came on the market in the last 30 days. There were also 586 sales in the last 30 days. If that’s any indication of how the spring market will be, it’s going to be a beast.

“If you’re on the fence about selling your home, I’ve got some advice for you today.”

If you’re on the fence about selling, you shouldn’t be. Houses are moving as long as they are positioned properly and priced correctly. It’s not just about the price though, you have to have good marketing as well.

If you’re paying a lot for rent and you’re sick of it, you should be talking to a lender to see what you can afford. If you can afford that monthly rent, you can certainly afford that mortgage payment that comes with equity and tax deductions.

If you’re interested in buying or selling a home anytime soon, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

Welcome back to our consumer real estate blog! We’re bringing you relevant information to make informed decisions in the marketplace. Today, we’ll be talking about putting your home on the market to sell in 2018.

When it comes to selling, marketing matters, and so does the real estate team that you choose. Now more than ever, how you market your home online, on social media, and everywhere in between is crucial to your success.

There may not necessarily be just one way to market your home, but there is a wrong way. Unfortunately, we see about 90% of home sellers marketing the wrong way.

“Now more than ever, how you market your home online, on social media, and everywhere in between is crucial to your success.”

To see an example of good marketing, visit www.36cookeroad.com. There, you can see a storyboard we created for a property here in Wallingford, Connecticut. You can see aerial views, floor plans, and you can take a real-time, 3-D walkthrough of the home on your laptop or phone. This was actually a property that was listed with another agency. We re-marketed the property and came up with an effective marketing strategy.

Not every home will be marketed the same way. You need to take a unique approach depending on what your objective is and what type of property you have. That’s where experience and reference points matter.

If you’re thinking about putting your home on the market within the next 12 months, you should be talking to a real estate expert now. If you’d like help with your listing or have any other questions, feel free to reach out to me. We can come out to the property and get you started on the process.

Today I’m here to introduce you to a great Wallingford business. We may have shot the video three years ago, but we’re excited as ever to talk about Dino’s Modern Barbershop.What sets Dino’s apart is their customer service.Dino is a good friend of mine and I know how committed he is to giving his clients the full package. Not just a great haircut or a shave, but a conversation, a cup of coffee, and a smile as well.Dino grew up in Wallingford and after working with his father for 20 years cutting hair in North Haven, he decided it was time for him to strike out on his own.“Dino is committed to providing the full package.”Although Dino’s has a great modern, simplistic look, they do have one special relic from the past. The chairs have been in their family since 1971 and add a nice touch of class to the space.To learn more about Dino’s Modern Barbershop, including their prices and hours of operation, visit their Facebook page here.If you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Today I want to talk to all the current and potential real estate investors out there. If you’ve been thinking about buying a multi-family or other income-producing property, now is the time to get a great deal in the marketplace.

Recently, we had a client pick up a two-family home in Wallingford right down by the YMCA for under $150,000. It needed a bit of work, but it will be well worth the effort in the end.

You can get a lot of value for your money right now. Not only because of what you’re purchasing, but for what you can rent the property out for. The rental rates here in Wallingford and the surrounding areas are through the roof and renters are paying a premium.

“The rental rates here in Wallingford are through the roof.”

If you or someone you know is interested in buying a multi-family home to use as an investment or to fix and flip, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to sit down with you and explain how other people are using this opportunity to make great money. Just give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

If you’re thinking of putting your home on the market, there’s one thing you must know: marketing matters.

In order to list your home successfully, you need to have access to a higher level of service across the board. You need quality video and photography services, and you need a quality agent or team to help guide you through the process.  

These days, video and photography services are especially important in marketing your home because they will help create a strong online presence.

Sometimes, strong marketing will require a unique approach to a certain home. For example, today my team and I are using a drone to capture aerial photos of a particularly interesting property.

“You need to work with a team that has cutting-edge resources to help you market your home.”

Being able to highlight and display a property and its features online is incredibly important in our modern world. If you’ve been thinking of listing your home, or have already done so but feel dissatisfied with your results, you need to work with a team that has cutting-edge resources to help you market your home.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are thinking of listing your home, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Have you ever imagined only having to put 1% down on the purchase of your first home? Well, this can be a reality.

Right now, the fall market is in full swing. A ton of inventory has come onto the market since Labor Day. Some of it has moved off, but some is still available.

“If you’re a first-time homebuyer, now is the time to act.”

If you’re a first-time homebuyer, now is the time to act. Right now, we’ve got some excellent mortgage products where you can get into a home with as little as 1% down if you qualify.

Also, we’ve got some great new properties under $200,000 coming onto the market right now. Some of these properties may need a little bit of work, but we’ve got the funds to make that happen through some of our loan products.

If you’re renting right now, you’re paying someone else’s mortgage. Now is the time to get into your own home.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want to know how we can help you purchase your first home, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

If you’re a first-time homebuyer, it’s imperative that you to meet with a seasoned buyer’s agent and do a buyer’s consultation before doing anything else.

I know I sound like a broken record because I’ve discussed this topic so many times in the past, but I still feel like buyers don’t quite understand the importance of doing this.

In the state of Connecticut, we real estate agents either represent the interests of the seller or the buyer, and we have something called “buyer brokerage,” where a real estate agency and/or a Realtor can represent you exclusively as a buyer.

“It’s absolutely to your benefit to sit down with a team like us and talk about the home buying process.”

I see way too many buyers in the marketplace trying to go it alone. They try to find the perfect house, negotiate on their own behalf with seasoned real estate agents, get everything they want in the contract, and sometimes even try to get their contract accepted in a multiple offer situation without any representation.

We’ve been through this process many times—I’ve worked with hundreds of first-time homebuyers. It’s absolutely to your benefit to sit down with a team like us and talk about the home buying process. We can walk you through the whole process from A to Z, and we also offer a first-time homebuyer’s guide that can show you every step of buying a home.

If you have any questions or you’d like to have a buyer consultation with us, don’t hesitate to call or email us anytime. We’d love to help you.

Have you been to Alyssa’s Cakery yet? If not, you’ll be pleasantly surprised to hear that this isn’t just another gourmet cupcake shop, it’s a full-blown bakery. Alyssa is with us today to talk about what they have to offer your sweet tooth. 

Of course, they have a wide variety of delicious baked goods, from mini cupcakes to scones, muffins, and iced coffee. They’ve also got mugs, candles, cards, and other items from local businesses for sale as well.

“They offer a variety of baked goods, not just cakes.”

They design custom wedding, anniversary, and birthday cakes for all different kinds of people. The more creative, the better, says Alyssa.

Their delicious food is just one of the things they offer. Every Tuesday through Friday, there’s a Ladies Night Out, where a group comes in with a bottle of wine to decorate their own cake! They do the same kind of thing for kids birthday parties as well (without the wine of course). The kids’ parties even have a pinata at the end.

Alyssa was born and raised in Wallingford, so she loves the fact that her shop is located right on Center St in the heart of the community. She takes pride in being part of the community and brings that attitude to her business each day. If you haven’t been to Alyssa’s Cakery yet, you need to go soon.

If you or someone you know has a business that wants to be featured on one of our videos, let us know by reaching out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

Today I wanted to give you an update on how the market is doing, and what that means for you as a seller.

Today I wanted to talk about how the market is doing, especially here in New Haven and around Wallingford.

The median list price in the Wallingford is around $299,900. The demand is actually increasing and the days on the market for properties are trending downward, so we’re actually seeing a lot more multiple offer situations on a lot of these properties, which is great for sellers. The market action index for Wallingford is around 36.2, which is incredible because about six months ago, it was under 30.

“WE’RE SEEING A LOT MORE MULTIPLE-OFFER SITUATIONS, WHICH IS GREAT FOR SELLERS.”

The market action index tells us how the market is doing by measuring what’s for sale versus what’s actually selling. Any market action index below a 30 implies a buyer’s advantage. Any index of a 30 or above implies a seller’s advantage.

So today’s value of 36.2 means a seller’s advantage, and it’s actually trending upward. What that means is if you’re thinking about selling your home, now is the time to put it on the market. There is high demand in Wallingford, New Haven, and Fairfield counties. In most of Connecticut, there is a high demand for homes. Yes, there is a lot of inventory, but there aren’t a lot of good homes for sale. Good homes tend to sell a lot quicker.

If you’re thinking about selling your home, give us a call and let us come down to take a look at your home. We’ll give you an honest, real estimate of what your home is worth. We’d also love to show you some of the innovative marketing that we’re doing to help get homes sold, like professional photography and videography.

If you have any questions about this topic or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, give me a call. I look forward to working with you!

        <description>

Homes are getting left behind in today’s market because they’re not marketed properly online. There’s a way you can ensure your home doesn’t suffer the same fate.

If you’re a home seller, marketing and positioning your property online in today’s marketplace is critical.

Nobody knows better what buyers are looking for than the buyers themselves. They usually know whether a home is right for them within the first few minutes or even the first 30 to 60 seconds after walking in the front door. The problem is getting them excited enough to actually come see your property in person. If you can’t get them to commit to physically seeing your property, they’ll never have a chance fall in love with it.

One of the problems we’ve been experiencing in the marketplace is gorgeous properties being marketed and positioned all wrong. There are buyers in the marketplace whom these properties are perfect for, but these buyers overlook these properties because of the quality of their photos or videos or they lack professional photography and/or videos altogether.

“THERE’S NEVER BEEN A BETTER TIME TO MARKET YOUR HOME ONLINE.”

There has never been a better time to market your home online, and we can help you do it the right way. Our team offers professional photography, professional video services, professional floor plans, and 360-degree matterport videos that people can view from the comfort of their own home.

If you’re looking at selling your home and you’re looking to work with a professional real estate marketing company and not just a real estate agent, give us a call. We’d love to help you sell your house for top dollar.

        <description>

We appreciate all the kind words we receive from our past clients. Here’s one of them, WEBE 108’s Danny Lyons.

We were recently fortunate enough to talk to Danny Lyons from WEBE 108 right in the Lyon’s Den. Danny has worked with us in the past and has a lot of nice things to say about his experience, such as:

“Jonathan’s a family man. That’s really important to me. He’s also loyal like I am. I’ve been loyal to my listeners for over 30 years and I know that if you were to hire Jonathan to be your agent, he would be loyal to you and commit himself completely to getting the job done.”

“WE’RE PROUD TO HAVE DANNY IN OUR CORNER.”

A lot of real estate companies have their phone lines set up to go to a switchboard or a team of ISAs who may or may not be able to connect you with the person you’re looking for, even if you just had a quick question. That’s not what we do, as Danny points out.

“When you call that number, I think it’s Jonathan’s cell phone. The first time I called it, he answered the phone. To me, that means a lot. To be able to get right through to the guy who has his name on the company? That’s customer service.”

Thanks to Danny for the kind words. We appreciate having him in our corner. If you have any questions for us or want to know what we can do specifically to help you with your real estate goals, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you soon.

        <description>

HUD homes are a great option for buyers. Here’s why.

I know, I sound like a broken record talking about HUD homes. You’re probably sick of me talking about them, but listen. The reason I’m continuing to discuss these homes is because I want to get some of you off the fence by seeing the incredible value here.

Just this morning, a three bedroom, one bathroom home came on the market in Wallingford. It’s a 3-bedroom, one-bathroom, and a one-car garage home on a half-acre lot. This home is currently listed for sale at $149,000. It’s available to owner-occupants first, meaning that if you plan on living in the property, you get the first shot at it.

Here’s the other great news about this HUD home in particular. It’s marked as insurable. That means is that HUD will sell this property to someone who is going for an FHA mortgage and insure it for only a 3.5% down payment.

If you’re a first-time buyer, you would have to be crazy not to consider jumping on these homes. Yes, they might need a paint job or new flooring, but the bones are all there. If an HUD home is marked as insurable, that means the electric, plumbing, and furnace all work, so you don’t have to worry about replacing them, unless you find something different at your inspection.

“AN INSURED HUD HOME IS IDEAL.”

Another great thing about HUD homes is that you can inspect them. A lot of people think they can’t, but they’re wrong. It’s true that you do have to buy these properties as-is, but an inspection can be a very useful tool in deciding whether you’re making the right decision. If you have an inspection done and find something wrong with the home you didn’t know about before, you have two options. You can either make the decision to go through with the purchase or you can back out of the deal, get your deposit back, and go buy something else.

I’m oversimplifying the process, but the truth is that it is simple for me because I’ve sold and purchased so many of them. I’ve sold and bid on hundreds of HUD homes. If you have any questions about them whatsoever or would like more details about what the process is like, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. We look forward to hearing from you!

How is the market doing in Wallingford and New Haven County? This January has been the busiest start to a new year that we’ve seen in awhile, and it looks like the spring market will be extremely busy, too.

Here is your market update for Wallingford and New Haven County:

The median list price is at $299,900. That is the median list price, not the median sales price. Inventory has been tightening and days on market are decreasing, which is great news for sellers.

Personally, I’ve noticed that January of 2017 has been the busiest start to a new year that we’ve seen in three years. If that’s any indication of how the spring market is going to be, things are looking good.

“IT LOOKS LIKE THE SPRING MARKET WILL BE AN EXTREMELY BUSY ONE!”

If you are looking to upgrade from your first home, now is one of the best times to do so. You will get the most house for your money because of these low interest rates. Rates are expected to rise as the year goes on, so the sooner you can buy, the better. Remember, as interest rates go up, your buying power goes down.

One of the other things I want to point out is the market action index. The market action index tells us how the market is doing by measuring what’s for sale versus what’s actually selling. Anything 30 or below means that the buyer has an advantage in the market, while anything over 30 means that sellers have the advantage. Right now, the market action index is at 29.1, so the market is fairly balanced. However, that number is heading upwards, which is good news for sellers.

If you have any other questions about the marketplace or about selling your home, give us a call or send us an email. My team and I would be happy to help you!

Home renovation loans are great for homeowners and investors alike. You can make your home look just the way you want it with any of these products.

There is a lot of confusion surrounding renovation loans. Can you really borrow money to fix up your home and make it exactly the way you want it to be?

The answer is yes. There are some really great renovation loan products in the marketplace right now. For example, the FHA 203k renovation loan is a federally insured mortgage that allows you to use just 3.5% of your own money. You can also build in the cost of the rehab right into the loan.

“THERE ARE SOME GREAT RENOVATION LOAN PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETPLACE RIGHT NOW.”

Another renovation loan you might not have heard of is the Fannie Mae HomeStyle Renovation Mortgage. This program is for owner-occupants who want to fix up the home and live there.

If you are an investor, there is also a great product out there for you. You can use just 15% of your own money for the whole renovation, flip the house, and then resell for a profit.

We use a great company called Prospect Mortgage, one of the largest renovation loan providers in the country. We would be happy to refer you to them.

In fact, Carbutti &amp; Co. Realtors will be teaming up with Prospect Mortgage to provide an informative seminar for people looking to buy a home. This seminar will help potential home buyers understand some of the in’s and out’s of the home buying process that you might not be aware of if you have never gone through this complex process. Click here to register for that seminar on Tuesday, December 6th from 6:00pm-9:00pm.

If you want to find out more about these renovation loans, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you out!

We recently took a vacant home and had it professionally staged before it hit the market. Today, I wanted to introduce you to Jennifer Napolitano with Design House Interiors, the company that staged the property.

Jennifer is a certified home stager. She knows that selling a home can sometimes be very daunting. When people come into your home, they might not know where to put their furniture or how it’s going to look, which makes things very stressful for the buyers as well. Certain layouts and rooms can be difficult to stage, but home stagers are here to help you figure it out.

For example, keep in mind that scale is very important. You need the right-sized pieces in each room so that the rooms appear bigger and functional. Having the right furniture in each space also shows buyers the traffic patterns in the home.

When you work with Design House Interiors, you also get the benefit of working with professional interior designers. Jennifer and her team can help you make your home look great by choosing fresh, trendy pieces to make your home pop. Your home will be showroom-ready when it hits the real estate market.

This particular house had an island in the kitchen, and it is a nice-looking piece of furniture that stands out. When you are working with the bedrooms, it can be difficult to figure out where to put the bed because the bed is the focal point of the room. It needs to make a statement and look beautiful.

For this house, Jennifer and her team decided to put the bed a little off-center on the wall. It’s a great focal point and the buyer can still see that there is plenty of room to add a dresser and still walk around the space.

They also created an easy flow in the dining room by using a circular dining room table. As you can see in the video above, home staging is an absolute must to help buyers figure out how they can best utilize the space for their family.

“YOUR HOME WILL BE SHOWROOM-READY WHEN IT HITS THE MARKET.”

This home sold three days after it hit the market, so I want to say a huge thank you to Design House Interiors. If you need to stage your home or if you have any questions about interior design, visit their website at designhousect.com or visit their showroom at 6 North Main Street in Wallingford.

As always, if you have any real estate questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would be happy to help you!
