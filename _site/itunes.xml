It’s that time of year, folks — winter is coming. It’s going to get cold. Now is the time to harvest what is left of your garden, winterize your sprinklers, and cozy up at home with your friends and family.

That said, there are three huge mistakes that can cost homeowners thousands of dollars. Luckily, you can easily avoid these mistakes by properly winterizing your home.

First of all, make sure that you buy a $2 protector for your outdoor faucet. It’s amazing how much damage a little bit of ice can do. Ice can cause pipes to explode or leak into your basement. Just an inch of water in your basement can cost up to $15,000 to pump out and dry. All you have to do to prevent this disaster is buy one of those protectors and take your hoses off of your faucets.

Now, I know everyone loves Instagramming icicles, but don’t just take your pictures and leave the icicles on your roof. If there are icicles hanging off your roof, then you probably have ice damming issues. Basically, when the ice melts, the water has nowhere else to go. Ice damming can cause serious damage to your roof, which costs thousands of dollars to repair. Not only that, icicles are also safety hazards; it can be very dangerous to walk beneath some of those huge icicles we get here in Salt Lake County.
“A little ice can cause a lot of big, costly problems for your home.”
If you notice that you have ice damming, you can pay a few hundred dollars to have someone come out and steam the ice away. You can even rent one of those steamers yourself. I also recommend installing a little extra insulation around the eaves of your house, which is typically where ice damming occurs. Heat tape can also help you avoid ice damming and water damage, which will save you thousands of dollars.

Finally, don’t let cold air sneak into your home. If you add up all of the cracks in the average home, it’s like having a 3x3 foot window open at all times. Not only will that make for a cold winter, it will also cost you a lot of extra money in energy bills. Fortunately, you can head to a Lowe’s or Home Depot and buy some caulk. Caulk comes in all kinds of different colors, so find the one that matches your home and fill up those exterior cracks. That way, you won’t have all of that cold air coming in through your windows, stucco, or doorframes.

A couple of weeks ago, I did a market update for our local radio station KNRS. As I was preparing the data for the show, I realized that we had a tale of two markets on our hands.

You see, if we look at the availability of all the housing types across the entire Wasatch Front under $300,000, we have about a three-month supply of homes available. In a real estate market, it’s considered a level market when you have between a four-to-six-month supply of homes available. When there are fewer than four months, it’s considered a seller’s market. When there are more than six months, it’s considered a buyer’s market.
“I want you to be able to win no matter what market you’re completing in.”
In any price point less than $300,000, then, it’s absolutely a seller’s market. Here are three quick strategies you can use to help you compete if you’re a buyer in that market:


  Be the first to know. Your agent should be able to match your specific home buying criteria so you can be the first to know about homes as they become available. This will allow you to weed out the competition and avoid multiple offer scenarios that may cause the price of the home to increase.
  Get a full approval letter.  This will take you through parts of the underwriting process, and that’s exactly what the seller wants to see. This will turn you into a cash buyer in the eyes of the seller and help you stand out from the competition.
  Try using an escalation clause on the offer you write. For example, you could state that you’re willing to offer X amount of dollars higher than the highest net offer the seller receives, provided the cost doesn’t exceed a certain price.


As I said, we’re experiencing a tale of two markets. The other market I’m referring to is all the housing types above $500,000, in which there is a 10-month supply of homes. This, obviously, is a buyer’s market. Here are three tips you can use if you’re a seller to ensure your home priced more than $500,000 sells fast and for the most amount of money:


  Boost your curb appeal. It’s a fact of life—everyone judges a book by its cover. Make sure the front door’s got a fresh coat of paint on it and the landscaping looks good. Take photos now if you’re planning on listing over the winter.
  Stage the home. Clear off all the flat surfaces in the property of everything other than decorative items. Clean lines show the property, and it’s the property you’re selling, not the stuff. Flat surfaces run vertically as well as horizontally, so make sure both surfaces are cleared of all clutter.
  Price the home right. Be sure to use accurate comparables within your micro-market and view those comparables through the eyes of the buyer.


Regardless of what tale our market is telling, I want you to win. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!

We recently sold a property for more than list price in less than two weeks. Prior to working with us, these clients had their home on the market for over six months before the listing expired.

During that time, the property had six showings and no offers, so the sellers were understandably frustrated. When they were referred to us, I told them exactly what they needed to do to get the property sold.

The first thing you need to understand is curb appeal. If you look at the video above, you will see before and after pictures of the property. I had the clients paint the exterior of this beautiful log home because the photos from the original listing showed that the home had deferred maintenance. Everybody on the Internet judges a book by its cover, so your home needs to look good.

Imagine going to an expensive restaurant and paying $50 for a plate of food. That plate of food will come out looking good, and because it looks good, it’s going to taste better. The same principle applies to buying a home.

If you look at the video above, you will see a couple of interior photos as well. Before, the property had not been staged. I found that the clients were more than happy to stage the home but their prior agent didn’t give them any direction on what to do or how to do it. We went room by room and staged the property correctly. For instance, we referred them to our countertop guy so they could finish updating the kitchen. It cost $1,500 to replace the countertops and they look great.
“Always look at comparable properties to see if the property is fairly priced.”
When you look at a listing online, after the exterior photos, the buyer should see a picture of the kitchen, the master bedroom, and the master bathroom in exactly that order. Those three rooms are the most important to buyers and most buyers will only look at your listing for a little bit, so you need to post photos of those rooms up front in order to grab their attention.

We are incredibly grateful to these clients. They did everything that we asked them to do. We launched the property using our grand opening technique and, as a result, we sold this property in fewer than two weeks.

If you have any questions about the home selling process or if you’re having trouble selling your property, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

        <title>Do You Want to Buy a Fixer-Upper? </title>
        <link>localhost:5000/do-you-want-to-buy-fixer-upper-46.html</link>

        <description>

Today I have a few tips for buying a home that needs work. There are different types of fixer-uppers out there and some need more work than others. The way you pursue a purchase offer on the home most likely depends on which fixer-upper category it is in.

Most sellers realize that a home needs work when they put it up on the market and have already accounted for that when they priced the home. I have yet to find a seller who is willing to subsidize a buyer’s home improvement dreams, yet that doesn’t stop buyers from trying to get a discount on an already discounted price. It is very important to look at comparable properties in order to determine whether a fixer-upper has been priced correctly.

Now, let’s talk about the different types of fixer-upper homes.

First, you have your basic fixer-upper. Fixer-upper homes are generally priced for sale as-is. These homes often have deferred maintenance items or other minor repairs that the sellers either aren’t willing to fix or cannot afford to fix. When you make an offer on these properties, have your buyer’s agent pull comparables for other fixer-upper properties to see how the price stacks up. That way, you are comparing apples to apples.

On the other hand, you may be interested in a mint condition vintage house. Although these properties are not modernized, they can be very desirable. Mid-century modern houses have made a real comeback recently; other vintage houses include Victorians or Craftsman bungalows. Generally, the seller will add a premium price pad due to the area and architectural uniqueness of the property.

Usually, the interior of a vintage property will be in incredible condition. However, they can look very outdated. When you write an offer on this kind of property, be aware that there may be a premium price to pay for the uniqueness of the property. Make sure that you look at other similar homes and compare the listing price to those that have already sold.

Another kind of fixer-upper is the newer home that may be outdated. Lots of subdivisions have homes that were built in 1995; these sellers know there are newer homes out there, but still price their homes as if they are brand new. That is unfortunate because a lot of the trends from the 90s — like hunter green carpeting — are not popular today. Some of these sellers may be priced above where they should be, so again, make sure to look at comparable properties. When you send your offer in, send along the list of work it would take to modernize the home and include how much it would cost to do all of that work. That way, the seller can see things from your perspective.
“Always look at comparable properties to see if the property is fairly priced.”
A lot of buyers think they will get a good deal when it comes to buying a foreclosure property, but that’s not always the case. Banks will usually not lower the purchase price on a foreclosure property within the first 30 days. Foreclosures normally come with other rules beyond that. For example, after 30 days, the bank may lower the price by 3%. If 60 days go by without an offer, they may lower the price again by another 3%.

You should also make sure to do a title check on foreclosed properties because the banks have not occupied these properties. The bank should have cleared any hidden liens on the property, but it is still a good idea for you to work with a good title company and pull a complete title report.

If you are interested in a short sale, you need to know that there is nothing short about them. Short sale transactions can take a lot of time to close. Since the seller cannot afford to make the payments on the home, they also cannot afford to do any work on the property, so short sale homes are often sold as-is.

You should also be aware that the price an agent sets for a short sale property is not always accepted by the bank. The bank will do an independent appraisal on a short sale property to ensure that it will be sold at market value. Don’t be lured in by the price on the MLS system unless it says that the price has been previously approved by a third party. More often than not, that’s the price the bank is willing to accept.

Finally, you may want to buy a “packrat” house. If you have ever watched Hoarders, you know that these houses have stuff stacked up to the ceiling and aisles to get from room to room. The challenge with these properties is not that there is a lot of stuff in the house (which makes it hard to visualize what you’re going to do with the property, though), but that there is a monstrous amount of deferred maintenance that needs to be addressed.

Again, it helps to look at other distressed properties to see if the packrat house is priced correctly. It is especially important in this case because you won’t know how much work the property really needs until you get a home inspector in there. Keep in mind that if all of that stuff in the home is still in the way, the home inspector won’t be able to do their job thoroughly. Consider extending your due diligence period and require the seller to allow access to all visible parts of the interior of the property before the home inspection.

The number one thing to keep in mind when purchasing a house that needs some work is to look at comparable sales. You can then deduct the price of the work that’s needed based on estimates from licensed contractors. If that adjusted price lines up with the listing price, you might need to pay the listing price to purchase that fixer-upper.

If you have any questions about fixer-upper properties or need to get in touch with a licensed contractor to fix up your property, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

        <title>Using Football to Explain Your Home’s Closing</title>

How does football relate to the closing of your property? The analogy we’ve come up with makes a lot of sense, and we hope it will help shine some new light on the process for you if you’ve been thinking about selling.

For this analogy, let’s say we are starting with the ball right on our own one-yard line. There are 99 yards between you and the goal line. Once an offer is accepted, you’ve made it to midfield.

An offer will be contingent on a few things, including due diligence. Due diligence is basically any type of inspection a buyer wants to do. We know that 24% of contracts fail and 80% of those are due to due diligence. The buyer could decide they don’t want to buy at this point for pretty much any reason.

The good news is that once we’ve made it past due diligence, we are in the red zone. Good offense so far, but you’re not quite there yet. Now the offer is contingent upon the financing going through.

Your buyer should already be pre-approved by a lender; however, that still doesn’t mean they will get the loan. The “defense” in this situation is underwriting. It’s a secret weapon that is going to look for every reason not to lend the buyer money, so certain things can come up.
“”

A good agent will be in contact with the lender who issued the pre-approval to ask certain questions to see if they will be able to pay. You want to find out as much as you can up front about their financing.

After the financing hurdle has been cleared, you are on the 10-yard line. The offer is now contingent upon the appraisal. In the last couple of years we’ve had more and more issues with appraisals because the market is improving. Homes still have to appraise for buyers to be able to purchase. If you get a bad appraisal, you do have options to remedy it without throwing the deal away.

After you’re through the appraisal, you are at the five-yard line. The final hurdle is the settlement table. This is where we sign all the documents with the title company to be able to transfer the deed into the buyer’s name. It usually happens a week or two after the appraisal.

Bad things can happen, like a medical emergency or the buyer losing their job, but it’s not likely. Now you are at the one-yard line, and the property must fund in order for the seller to receive the money and the buyer to get the deed. Once that has happened, you are in the end zone! Time for a touchdown dance!

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

When updating or renovating your home, you may be under the impression that making major renovations to your property will net you more money on the appraisal. This may not always be the case. In fact, some improvements may not increase your home’s value at all, leaving you with a sunk cost. In an effort to help you avoid this situation, I’d like to share with you seven home improvements that will not add to the value of your home.


  
    Extensive professional landscaping. You may not recoup the cost of that koi pond and waterfall in your backyard. Realize that major outdoor features like these are personal aesthetic choices, and that a future buyer may not share your same vision or want to pay for the maintenance of those choices.
  
  
    Upgraded electrical or plumbing. Odds are, your neighbors have already upgraded to copper plumbing and have probably already updated their electrical systems as well. These improvements are only considered to be ones that bring a property up to modern standards, so they’re not likely to increase the value of your home.
  
  
    New roof, gutters, sprinklers or HVAC. These are all major systems of a property since they can last for over 10 years. The reality is that it is unlikely that the appraiser is going to add any value to your property, since these are the kinds of systems that the buyer is going to expect are already in great working order at the time of purchase.
  
  Swimming pool. Here in Utah, swimming pools and other water features like hot tubs are not all that common, and some buyers may have a problem with that. This is called functional obsolescence—something about the property that you will not get back from a value standpoint.
“Painting your home is not likely to add value in an appraisal.”
  
    Making dated improvements. Upgrading to white appliances or white ceramic countertops might seem like a great idea because they are newer to you, but these decisions may deter some potential younger buyers, since they’ll see those as “dated updates.” If you have questions on which improvements to make or not make, ask me!
  
  
    Painting your home. While painting your home can actually freshen up the property and strengthen its appeal, it is not likely to add value in an appraisal; it may, however, increase the probability of it selling.
  
  Solar panels. Regardless of the Kool-aid that the solar panel salespeople are selling you in regard to resale value, realize that an appraiser is not adding value for solar panels. Worse yet, if you’ve financed solar panels, you’ll probably have to pay them off at the time of sale, which is something that probably was not disclosed to you when you purchased them.


If you have any questions about what to do or what not to do in order to get your home sold for the most amount of money possible, please give me a call or shoot me an email and I’d be happy to answer.

When updating or renovating your home, you may be under the impression that making major renovations to your property will net you more money on the appraisal. This may not always be the case. In fact, some improvements may not increase your home’s value at all, leaving you with a sunk cost. In an effort to help you avoid this situation, I’d like to share with you seven home improvements that will not add to the value of your home.

What are the signs of a strong housing market? We’re here to tell you.

It all starts with the economy. Right now, there’s really only one portion of our economy that’s firing on all cylinders, and that’s the housing market.

New home sales are currently at their highest level since 2008 and home prices are at or above their all-time highest levels in almost all areas on the Wasatch Front.

The economy will eventually see a big boost from strong housing sales. We think it’s a little premature to start worrying about whether a recent housing market rebound could lead to another real estate bubble. Appreciation in the first quarter of 2016 was only up 5.7% from last year. That’s not too bloated a number.
“Now is the time to get involved in buyer or selling real estate.”
The recession that happened in 2008 was largely a byproduct of the tech bubble. Normal recessions are caused by excess somewhere, but that level of excess doesn’t seem to exist anywhere right now.

Here’s a final thought: If interest rates go up by 1%, the cost of owning a home will go up by 10%. Which is going to happen first - home prices falling by 10% or interest rates going up by 1%?

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’re always here to help.

The question of when you should respond to an offer as a seller is one we get quite frequently, especially in a market like this. Most agents are advising their clients to hold off on responding to offers until after the first weekend they’ve listed, in which an open house will often be held.

This benefits buyers because many can only go out to look at homes on weekends when they don’t have to work. It gives everyone equal footing to get into the property and enough time to prepare financing. The seller benefits as well because they don’t have to show the property as much and can get all the offers around the same time.

When you’re responding to an offer as a seller, you do have four different options:


  Accept the offer.
  Make a counter-offer.
  Reject the offer.
  No response to the offer.


“You want to be gracious, not forceful.”
 That being said, a seller really isn’t going to ignore an offer unless it’s blatantly ridiculous. The real key to getting your offer accepted is understanding timing. Maybe the seller is waiting for other offers to come in before deciding because they just listed. However, if the home has been on the market for a month or more, the seller is probably very anxious to get an offer.

I recommend that you call the seller’s agent and ask them what would be enough time for a response. This is a gracious way to make it clear to them that you still want the home.

If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us an email anytime. We look forward to hearing from you!

The law of supply and demand in real estate is irrefutable. It’s important to understand. Generally, if there’s a low supply and a high demand, price will be high, of course. In contrast, the higher the supply and the lower the demand, the lower the price.

So let’s define inventory and absorption rate in real estate. If you take the amount of available homes and you divide that by the amount of homes sold in the past 30 days, you’re left with what’s called a month’s supply of housing. It’s considered a level market when you have a four to six month supply of homes.

If there’s less than four months of supply, it’s a seller’s market. Likewise, a more than six month of supply of homes gives us a buyer’s market. 
“You need a strong Realtor to help you navigate this market.”
So let’s take a look at the Wasatch Front’s supply of single-family homes (excluding townhomes and condos). Right now we have a 4.4 month supply of homes available. Seems like we’d be in a level market, right? Not so fast.

If we look at homes by price range, we only have a 3.4 month supply of homes on the market under $350,000. If we look at homes under $250,000, we have just 2.75 months of supply. This poses a real challenge for first-time homebuyers, as they’re finding they are competing with multiple offers for almost all of the well-priced homes under $350,000.

For that reason, we’re seeing condos and townhomes really take off as affordable housing for first-time homebuyers. In this market, we only have a 3.78 month supply of such homes along the Wasatch Front. As a result, we’re seeing buyers try to tie up homes to lock out the competition - sometimes without even seeing the inside of the home before writing an offer! This allows people to lock up a property even though they sometimes cancel the offer down the road after finding a better option. We’re seeing a lot of this right now.

If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!

There are eight things that we feel you can do to compete to get the home you want in the Wasatch market.


  Be informed. If there’s a specific neighborhood, community, or builder you’re interested in, start researching and following them on social media and set up Google alerts. The first line of defense is to know what’s going on so you can act fast.
  Register your name on the internet list. Most of the communities and builders will reach out to those who have interest on their internet lists. You’ll receive news about model homes, property releases, and other updates. If you want to be the first to know, make sure the community or builder knows about you.
  Work with a Realtor. We have the inside track and in many cases will be able to alert you to important news before the public is aware of it.
  Make a friend. It doesn’t hurt to make friends with a sales agent in a community because they’re great resources for details that other people might not be aware of.
  Get pre-approved for a loan. If you’re not pre-approved and you go to buy, you could lose out to someone who is pre-approved.
  Check for financing options through the builder. Sometimes builders will provide incentives for using their lender, like assistance with closing costs or money towards upgrades at the design center.
  Talk to your Realtor about options and upgrades. Model homes will likely be very upgraded and full of options that raise the price beyond the base price of the property. Having an idea of the options and upgrades that you want will be important for you to know upfront to make sure you can qualify for that loan and still be within the payment you’re comfortable with.
  Familiarize yourself with the community and the properties. Intense community interest can cloud judgement and create a frenzy. You never know which line you’ll be in for a home. It could be the home you’re dreaming of, and it’s gone by the time you get to the front of the line! Knowing the community well will help you make an informed choice when the time comes.


“Realtors have the inside track on many new homes.”

Today, we are going to talk about inspecting your sewer line before you buy your home, especially if you are buying an older property.

The last thing you want to do is spend an additional $2,500 to $10,000 after you’ve moved into your new house to accommodate a sewer line problem. I recommend having a small operation inspect the sewer line with their cameras. Large franchise operations tend to recommend replacing the entire sewer line, which is just more money in their pockets.

One problem you might encounter is tree roots growing into sewer lines. Roots crawl into tiny openings and expand in the sewer line, latching onto other debris that typically cause backups, such as grease or eggshell waste. Sometimes chemicals can kill the tree roots. However, if the roots reappear, the pipe may be damaged and require excavation to fix the problem. Another option is to have the lines snaked once or twice a year to avoid backup.

Another common problem is a belly in the sewer line. A belly is a low area or sag in the sewer line that has lost its positive slope for drainage. This can be caused by a number of factors.  It should only be corrected if the belly is truly causing an actual problem, not just lacking perfection for a short distance. A low area holding a half-inch or so of water for 3 or 4 feet is likely not going to cause a major problem. Consult a licensed plumber after having the sewer line scoped to determine how much of an issue the belly really is.
“You need to get your sewer lines inspected.”
If you’re buying an older home, those sewer lines were often installed in sections or segments. When a connected section does not line up perfectly with the other it is considered “off-set”. Not all instances of “off-setting” are a problem. Avoid evaluations from large franchise companies and look to a reputable licensed plumber to determine the extent of the issue.

Older homes also tend to have sewer lines made of clay or cast iron, which erodes from the inside. Not all older sewer systems will need replacement anytime soon, and not all systems will need a full replacement. You can get away with partial replacement.

Again, because the cost of sewer line replacement is high, we recommend you have your sewer line examined by a professional via camera as part of your home inspection process. Then have a good professional plumber take a look at it.

If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

If you make an offer on a home on The Wasatch Front, there’s always a chance it will get rejected. To decrease the chances of getting your offer rejected, we are going to give you four different reasons why your offer could get rejected.


  
    Your offer price was too low.
Sellers can easily feel insulted if a buyer offers too little for their home. They may believe the buyer isn’t serious and may even reject the offer outright. If the house just came on the market, it’s much too early for sellers to look at lowball offers or even offers that are more than 5% below asking price.
  
  
    The buyer’s agent is a jerk.
They may scream or raise their voice on the phone, make demands and ultimatums, or insult the listing agent by printing out comparables and inferring that they don’t know what they are doing. Whenever a buyer’s agent fails to show professionalism, that’s bad.
  
  
    The listing agent represents a competing buyer.
A little known agent practice among consumers is the variable or dual-rate commission. This is something that the listing agent has up-front with their sellers. During discussions, the listing agent might say that if they are representing a buyer that ends up purchasing the home, they will take less on their commission. If you’re competing for a home, and the listing agent wrote an offer for another buyer, you’re at a disadvantage. On our MLS in Utah, you can look to see if there is a variable-rate commission on the home. You can always call them and ask as well.
  
  
    The buyer didn’t meet the seller’s specific needs.
The buyer’s agent should always call the listing agent to find out what’s important to the seller. It’s not always about the price. If the seller needs a longer escrow period or settlement time, write it in the offer. If they want more earnest money, give them more earnest money. Do whatever you can to stand out in the seller’s mind. It will help you get the home.
  


Thanks for joining us today. If you have any questions, or are looking to buy or sell a home on The Wasatch Front, give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to hear from you!

Today, we’re going to talk about closing costs. What are they, and who pays them?

Closing costs are fees that are associated with the closing of the transaction. That’s when the title of the property is transferred from the seller to the buyer. Closing costs are incurred by either the buyer or the seller or, sometimes, both.

Typically, home buyers will pay between 2% and 5% of the purchase price of the home in closing fees. These fees include wiring fees, hazard insurance, and priming your escrow account for property taxes, title insurance, appraisal, underwriting, and processing fees.
“In today’s market, sellers aren’t paying closing costs.”
The Wasatch Front market is hot right now, and buyers who try to make the seller pay for closing costs are losing out. There are a lot of multiple offer situations, and buyers are offering to cover closing costs in order to get the home.

One way to position yourself to win in a multiple offer situation is to get a premium priced loan. The lender bumps up the interest rate by 0.25% or 0.50%. Then, the lender pays the closing costs, so you don’t have to pay money out of your own pocket; your offer then appears stronger to the seller.

If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

Today, we’re going to talk about what not to do when selling in the surrounding Salt Lake County area.

First of all, don’t set an unrealistic price. The market is hot right now, so it can be tempting to set an extremely high price for your home. However, buyers are well-educated and know the difference between an accurately priced property and an overpriced one.

Overpriced properties sit on the market for a long time. Buyers start to wonder what’s wrong with those properties. The longer a home sits on the market, the less money you will get. Accurately priced homes actually draw in multiple offers and create a bidding war situation, which drives the price up.
“Overpricing your home costs you time and money.”
Another mistake people make is selling without an agent. The National Association of Realtors reports on average, For Sale By Owner properties sell for 12% less compared to homes sold with an agent. That’s a lot of money, and it’s less expensive than paying a commission for an agent to sell your home. You will also save time by hiring an agent because selling a home is a full-time job.

Not marketing your home is not a good idea. Quicker access to more buyers means your home sells for more money in less time. Your listing agent has a sophisticated marketing plan that will cast the biggest net possible for buyers.

Finally, don’t skip repairs. According to NAR, 24% of all offers accepted between buyers and sellers fail, and 80% of those fail due to the inspection contingency. If you have deferred maintenance, fix it. The buyer will choose their own preferred vendors, which could cost you more money than it would to hire some people and take care of things on your own.

When selling, there are many reasons why you should hire a buyer specialist and a showing agent team to go to work for you in 2016. Today, we share the five best ones:


  First to the property. Because of low inventory in our area, you have to be the first to know about the homes that match your specific home buying criteria. When you work with a full-time buyer’s agent, there will never be a reason you can’t get to the property.
  Experience. All of our buyer’s agents are highly trained and college educated. Most real estate agents have the problem of being all things all the time, but there really isn’t a way to be great in every aspect of real estate. We specialize on our team so that our buyer’s only agents are incredibly good at what they do.
  Negotiations. Our buyer’s agents negotiate on behalf of buyers every single day. They are intuitive and understand how to get buyers the best home, with the best possible terms as well!
  Pricing. Our buyer’s agents will help you understand today’s real estate values when making an offer to purchase, they provide a comprehensive valuation to help you make a good decision, and they also help you weed out the competition and make sure that you’re the first one in with a finely crafted offer!
  Understanding of the process. Buying a new home isn’t as simple as getting out into the market, finding a home, and submitting an offer so you can begin negotiations. It’s also about sitting down for 30-45 minutes so that your needs are understood, getting set up with our VIP program, and having the whole five-step home buying process explained before getting started!

When you’re choosing what home improvements to invest in, it’s important to know what types of improvement will bring you the highest value. Here are the five safest bets when it comes to making worthwhile improvements.


  Kitchen. This is the center of attention in any house and is the most looked at online. It’s the one room that will largely determine if online buyers will come take a look at your home. To make sure your kitchen looks great, make sure you have matching appliances and fixtures. Also make sure the cabinets are in great shape.
  Bathroom. Look at the small things first. Buy a brand new toilet seat and ensure that the sink looks great. Bathrooms also need storage space, so consider adding cabinets if you can!
  Exterior. This is always the first thing people look at when deciding whether to buy a home. Remember, the front door is the first impression a buyer has of your home, so you should repaint or restain it if necessary.
  Roof. Make sure that the roof is leak-free and in great shape. If you wait for the buyer’s inspector to find a problem with your roof, it could cost you a whole lot of money!
  Landscaping. Make sure your grass and landscaping is in good condition and well-maintained. If you can, add some plants and trees to your yard to make it even more appealing to buyers.


These five tips should help you add value to your home! If you would like additional advice, feel free to reach out to us at any time. We’re always available to assist you!

Selling your home is one of the most important steps in your financial life. Today, we’ll go over the seven deadly mistakes most home sellers make. Knowing these mistakes will help you maximize your profits, maintain control, reduce stress, and help you make good decisions with your moving goals.

Failing to analyze why you are selling. We encourage you to have a very clear motivation when it comes to the decision to sell your home. Many home sellers simply aren’t clear on why they are selling their homes, and try to sell for the wrong reasons.


  Not preparing your home for the buyer’s eyes. You have one chance to make a good first impression. Nearly all buyers begin their home search online, so pictures are incredibly important. Work closely with your agent to stage the property, and consider hiring a professional photographer to take photos of your home.
  Pricing your home incorrectly. Everyone wants to get the most amount of money for their home as possible. Unfortunately, many buyers are unrealistic about their home’s value. If a home is priced too high, it tends to sit on the market for a long time, causing buyers to wonder what’s wrong with it. By the time you decide to adjust the price, it is often too late to get a quality buyer. Pricing your home correctly right out of the gate saves you time, money, and reduces time on the market.
  Selling too hard during showings. Nothing is more awkward for buyers than having a personalized tour of the home by the seller. Buyers make decisions based on their emotions first, and then justify the decision with logic. A buyer is unable to emotionally attach to a home when a seller gives them the grand tour. Step back and let your agent handle the showings.
  Signing a long-term listing agreement without a written performance guarantee. Unfortunately, some agents have a tendency to over-promise and under-deliver. If you sign with that agent, the only time you’ll hear from them is when they want to reduce the sales price. You should never get stuck in an agreement without a written guarantee of performance or a cancellation contract that allows you to get out of the contract if you are unhappy with the agent’s performance.
  Making it difficult for the buyers to get information on their homes. Buyers are three times more likely to inquire about a home when there’s no risk of feeling obligated. This means they don’t want to have to call you or your agent to get information on the home. Make it easy to get information on your property instantly and free of charge.
  Failing to obtain a pre-approved mortgage buyer. You don’t want to get stuck with a buyer who’s unable to get a loan. The first 5 weeks you are on the market are the most important, so you don’t want to be under contract for 45 days and find out that the buyer is unable to get financing. Do your due diligence. Make sure the buyer has a full approval letter, and check in with the lender to make sure they have verified all of the buyer’s information.

        <title>What Do Interest Rates Mean to You as a Buyer in Salt Lake County?</title>
        <link>localhost:5000/salt-lake-county-rising-interest-32.html</link>

Today, we’ll talk about what rising interest rates mean for you as a buyer in the Wasatch Front.

We know that the Federal reserve Chairman, Janet Yellen, has increased the Federal Reserve rate. What we also learned at that time was the chairman mentioned her plans to continue to gradually increase rates each quarter. The first rate increase was anticipated, so the market was able to absorb most of that increase without seeing much of a change to long term loans like 15 or 30 year mortgages. The next 3 increases will see a bigger impact on the 15-30 year mortgages.

For our millennial home buyers, this is a bit of a challenge, as most of their young adult lives they have had rates at or just below the 4% mark. First thing to know is that the 42 year average for interest rates is 8.39%.  If we hit the reset button at 1990 the average interest rate is 6.6%.  All of my blog viewers over 40 are chuckling because they remember buying their first home at rates in the 8% to 15% range.

We likely will see interest rates exceed 5% by the end of 2016.  Let’s suppose this is a 1% increase. This is how the 1% increase affects you as a home buyer on an averaged priced home along the Wasatch Front, which is about $275,000. Assuming the loan amount is the purchase price, the principal and interest payment for a 30 year loan at 4% is $1,312.89 if the interest rate goes up to 5% the principal and interest payment  goes to $1,476.26 or $163.37 more than the 4% rate which is about 11% more per month.

Over the course of 30 years, a 4% loan with the original principal balance would be $197,642.  On a 30 year loan with a 5% interest rate the total amount paid in interest is $256,453 almost $59,000 more you’d pay in interest if interest rates go up by 1%.

The thing to know is that interest rates will go up because they have to go up. When interest rates go up by 1% the cost of your home goes up by 10% or more. Another way of looking at this is that the home at $275,000 becomes the same cost as buying a home at $302,500.

I hope this makes sense and helps you digest the affordability of housing now versus the affordability of housing in a historically average market.

There are 4 common strategies that most sellers use to price their homes. It is unwise to assume that a higher asking price will net you a higher selling price. In fact, this equation works in reverse if you’re not paying attention to what the market is telling you. Bear this research in mind when you set your asking price.


  
    Clearly Overpriced – Every seller wants to get the most amount of money they can for their home, and real estate agents know this. If more than one agent is competing for your listing, an easy way to win the battle is to overinflate the value of your home. I can see this in our own market, which has been VERY good for sellers this year by looking at the fact that over 8,500 homes expired. That’s 27% of all home sellers who intended to sell and couldn’t because of overpricing.
  
  
    Somewhat Overpriced – About ¾ of the homes on the market are 5-10% overpriced. These homes will sit on the market longer than you want. There is usually one of two factors at play here: either you believe in your heart that your home is really worth this much, despite what the market has indicated, OR you’ve left some room for negotiation. Either way, this strategy will cost you both time on the market and, ultimately, the price that you receive from a buyer.
  
  
    Priced Correctly at Market Value – Some sellers understand that real estate is part of the capitalistic system of supply and demand. These people carefully price their homes based on a thorough analysis of other homes on the market. These competitively priced homes usually sell within a reasonable time-frame and very close to the asking price.
  
  
    Priced Below the Fair Market Value – Some sellers are motivated by a quick sale. These homes attract multiple offers and sell fast – usually in a few days – at, or above, the asking price. Be cautious that the agent suggesting this method is doing so with your best interests in mind. If you have any further questions about selling real estate in Salt Lake, please don’t hesitate to contact my team. We would be happy to run a comparative market analysis and pinpoint a hot selling price for your home.
  


We look forward to hearing from you!

A lot of people think that the real estate market freezes up through the winter and during the Holiday season. However, people are always buying and selling homes. The market never just disappears.

Today I have seven great reasons why you should consider buying or selling this Holiday season.


  
    People who look for a home during the Holidays are more serious buyers!
  
  
    Serious buyers have fewer properties to choose from during the Holidays. Less competition means more money for you!
  
  Since the supply of listings will dramatically increase in January, there will be less demand for your particular home! Less demand means less money for you!
  
    Houses show better when decorated for the Holidays! Your home is already feeling warm and cozy if you’ve decorated for the Holidays. Buyers will feel right at home.
  
  
    Buyers have more time to look for a home during the Holidays than they do during a working week.
  
  
    You can still be on the market, but you have the option to restrict showings during the six or seven days during the Holidays!
  
  You can sell now for more money and we will provide for a delayed closing or extended occupancy until early next year!


As you can see, there are many good reasons to purchase a home this winter in Salt Lake City. If you need help buying or selling, please don’t hesitate to contact us. We look forward to speaking with you.

When the real estate market gets tough and you’ve found a home that you absolutely love, then it might be time to take some drastic actions in order to secure it. I have three things that you can do to improve your chances of buying your dream home.


  
    Make your offer ‘sharp’: In Utah, putting down 1% or more in earnest money will make your offer more sincere, especially in a competitive environment. A seller needs to know that you’re serious about buying, and this is how you prove it to them.
  
  
    Find out what seller’s moving time frame. Sometimes a quick close seems like an obvious plus to a buyer, but what if the seller needs more time to move out? Consider writing an offer that allows a seller a short interim occupancy agreement that allows the seller to stay an extra week after settlement to help them get moved and eliminate the short term moving stress.
  
  
    Don’t get pre-qualified, get pre-approved: A pre-approval is what you need to stand out as a buyer, and with new TRID rules it’s actually the only designation you can have as a buyer. If you’re pre-approved, you’re on par with a cash buyer.
  
  
    Keep short time frames on contingencies: Make the inspection and due diligence periods the acceptable length. It usually takes 14 days to complete the inspections and 21 days for the financial paperwork to be completed.
  
  
    Write a personal letter to the seller: Explain to them why you should be their #1 choice. Tell them about your family and how much you admire the home. Pull on their heart strings a little bit and you could become their #1 choice. Then, have your agent make an offer in person to the seller and their listing agent. This is a powerful move, and it puts more gravity on your offer. It’s an old school tactic, but sometimes it does the trick.
  
  
    Ask your agent to present the offer in person. Going along with the emotional connections a seller has with a buyer, it’s much easier to represent you as a buyer when your agent is willing to meet the listing agent and the sellers on their turf. A little communication from your agent directly to the sellers can go a very long way in making a win-win relationship happen.
  


I have found these techniques to be very useful when the situation calls for it. If you have any further questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me.

I would love the opportunity to find you your dream home!

Many people are getting ready to put their home on the market this holiday season, so today we wanted to talk about the most common mistakes when selling a home. We want you to avoid these when it comes time for you to sell, no matter what time of year it is. Here’s what you need to avoid as a seller:


  
    The home isn’t ready
Nothing kills a transaction like a home that’s unprepared for the market. Here’s what you need to do to ensure your home is:

    
      Declutter-  Decluttering is a big deal, but you already know that.
      Flat surfaces- Make sure you clean off all flat surfaces, which include fridges, countertops, bookshelves, and more. Make sure they only have decorative items on them.
      Curb appeal- Make sure to repaint your front door and remove any debris in your yard to help buyers feel more relaxed and comfortable when they walk into your home.
      Pay special attention to the kitchen, master bedroom, and master bathroom.
      There is nothing worse for your price than showing or photographing a home that’s not ready.
    
  
  Too many improvements
    
      Most improvements that you make on your home should be for yourself and your family, because you enjoy them. Many don’t generate a positive return. Even putting granite countertops in will only get you seventy cents back for every dollar you spend. Improvements also make things that are unimproved stand out like a sore thumb, which isn’t good.
    
  
  Not hiring the right people
    
      This is one of the most common mistakes I see as a listing agent. After you sign a contract with an agent, it’s hard to get out of because you have to honor the contract. With our contracts, they are day-to-day, up-front, and in writing.
    
  


Don’t make these mistakes! If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!

Today, we’ll talk about the TRID Mortgage Disclosure Form, which affects both buyers and sellers. This new integrated disclosure rule is the Federal Government’s attempt to clean up and simplify the mortgage closing process. It helps make things easier to understand for buyers. The rule has a good basis, but it also has some unintended consequences for both parties.

TRID has now gone into effect. Let’s talk about the good stuff first. Buyers will get the payment on the document signed at closing. We love the new look of this document, because buyers are always concerned with payment. It makes sense. Additionally, you will receive the closing documents directly from the lender, instead of the title company.

However, there are some unintended consequences. For instance, changes in concession amounts by the buyer will require a mandatory three-day redisclosure by the lender. This means you can’t change this just before the settlement deadline, before you purchase your new home. You have to do all of that in advance.

Terms now are changing, which can cause confusion here in Utah. Previously, settlement was defined as closing in the Utah real estate purchase contract. Instead of settlement referring to the title company, it now refers to when everything is recorded. This could also be confusing because the Utah real estate purchase contract has not changed its verbiage and I believe the Federal Government will likely override the state’s verbiage. Furthermore, we will use consummation now instead of settlement. Consummation refers to what happens when we submit documents to the title company.

A change in loan will require a new six-day redisclosure. This is a big deal. Lenders will no longer send documents to the title company, but instead, prepare the documents for themselves. Many lenders are not prepared for this. An average escrow period will shift closer to 45 days, making thirty-day closings a thing of the past. Please note we do not advise accepting or writing an offer with a thirty-day settlement, unless the lender confidently fulfills the new rules. Our preferred vendor has assured us that they’re able to stick within this thirty-day time frame.

Thanks again for taking the time to watch our blog! If you have any questions, feel free to call me or email me directly.

        <title>How Will Rising Interest Rates Affect Wasatch Front Home Values? </title>

Do rising interest rates affect home values on the Wasatch Front? The answer might surprise you.

Many people are wondering whether they should sell now or wait until the spring season arrives. Here’s something to think about if you are asking yourself that question: when interest rates increase, the purchasing power of buyers decreases. In fact, if interest rates increase by 1%, the market loses the bottom 18% of first-time home buyers.

In addition to those changes, a 1% rise in interest rates makes your home 10% more expensive to the next buyer. Just recently, the Fed has decided to keep rates where they are, but Janet Yellen has made it clear that rates will slowly start creeping up soon. As it is, low interest rates are keeping buyers in the market, and sellers often sell their homes for more money and in less time.

If you’re looking for certainty in the marketplace and want your best chance at getting top dollar for your home, now is the time to make your move. If you have any questions about how to take advantage of current market conditions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to help you make the most of this market!

Today we are going to talk about real estate investing, crowdfunding style. This morning, when I woke up, I went online and researched crowdfunding in real estate. What I began to notice is that there are dozens of platforms for individuals to begin investing in real estate.

Crowdfunding has a distinct advantage in the real estate investment world. Instead of having to invest $50,000-$100,000 of your own money, you can invest as little as $5,000 into an existing investment platform and begin to see returns.

However, there are some downsides to this method. You don’t get to choose your own properties, and you don’t get to see them in person either. It’s an elusive investment, like the stock market. It’s something you can’t physically see or touch, but it’s there.

There’s another way to crowdfund in real estate. With local crowdfunding, I’ve had many real estate investors who have created an LLC involving multiple business partners looking to invest in real estate. Local crowdfunding offers some additional benefits that national crowdfunding doesn’t.

First, you get to choose your own partners. Secondly, you get to choose your own real estate agent. Third, you get to choose the property you buy, and it will be closer to home so you can go see it in person. Finally, you also get to choose the tenants, rental rate, and rental terms. You and your partners are in control of this transaction, and don’t have to trust that someone else will make the right decision.

If you’re thinking about crowdfunding on a local or national level and you’d like to talk about these options, I would love to talk. Just give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to speaking with you!

        <title>Why Should You Get a Home Inspection?</title>

I find most folks are willing to take a used car to a mechanic to look it over before they purchase the car. They probably spend about $150 to do this, and the car may cost between $5,000 and $10,000. So, why wouldn’t you consider having your home inspected by a house “mechanic” before spending $200,000 to $300,000?

A professional home inspection can be done at a cost between $350 and $500. Your Realtor can write your contract up to be subject to these inspections. Here are some of the common items I see in inspections, and the costs associated with repairing or replacing any problems the home inspector finds:


  Double tapping in the break panel. This usually means you have too many wires feeding into one circuit in your break box, which makes it a fire hazard. Resolving double tapping can cost between $75 and $150, but if the break panel is out of room, you would also need to add a distribution panel at a cost of $1,000.
  Heating and Air Conditioning. I find most sellers aren’t in the habit of servicing their HVAC systems yearly. This could be a hidden cost passed along to you, the buyer. Servicing the HVAC costs around $75 to $150. If the HVAC hasn’t been serviced, you could end up with AC condenser issues ($3,000 to repair) or issues with the furnace’s heat exchanger ($3,500 to repair). As you can see, servicing your HVAC systems avoids some costly problems down the road.
  Attic and Crawl Space issues. This is where we find hidden problems never seen by the homeowner that can explode into large cost problems for you, the buyer, to fix.
  Water seepage along the vent flues. Sometimes the rubber boots that go along the flues become cracked, and when it rains or snows, you get water in through those vents. That costs $50 to $100. Ice damming causes water damages along the eves of the property, which could cost $250 to $350 to fix. If water gets in and mold grows or the wood rots, then your repair costs would be thousands of dollars.


These are just a few of the common issues we see during home inspections here in Utah. As you can see, an inspection pays for itself. Don’t forget, always inspect!

A good home inspector can save you lots of money and give you peace of mind. Feel free to email me. We’ll be happy to put you in touch with our own NASHI and ASHI certified home inspector.

Today we’ve got a special guest joining us, Mandi Henriod of Veritas Funding who is going to talk to us about some guideline changes that are coming for FHA loans that you should be aware of. There are two things you really need to know about, and here they are:

Student Loans

If you’ve had them in the past while applying for or receiving a mortgage, the FHA has allowed lenders to not count deferred payments against you. However, starting September 14, that’s all about to change. Lenders will now be required to count the full payment, or 2% of the balance, against you. This is important for a lot of people doing income-based repayment. This is going to change your buying power substantially.

Installment Loans

These are things like car loans or anything that has a specific time for repayment. In the past, FHA has allowed lenders to not count these against you either if it was less than 10 months to repayment, but that is changing now too. Lenders will not count those payments against you unless that payment is less than 5% of your gross income.

Both of these changes are going to significantly affect your qualification. Now is a great time to find a property if you’ve been thinking of looking, and you may still be able to avoid these changes. If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to working with you!

Today, I want to talk briefly about why you should be concerned about KSL classifieds for home buying.

As we speak, there are over 11,900 homes listed for sale on my very accurate MLS system. At the same time, KSL.com shows only 8,269 homes, which means over 3,600 homes that are listed for sale aren’t showing up on KSL.com. That’s roughly 30% of agent-listed homes!

Have you ever tried to do a detail specific search on KSL? If so, you’ve probably realized it’s not possible. Instead, you were probably met with pages and pages of misinformation! Additionally, if you’re looking there for homes For Sale By Owner, you’re going to find a lot of inaccurate information.

On the Stern Team, we will actually search for properties for you, ensuring you have access to every available property. We have a VIP system that makes it easy for our clients to get set up and receive access to all properties from all brokerages that match their specific home buying criteria. In addition, you’ll get access to bank-owned properties, short sales, and HUD homes. In short, you’ll be able to look at every single available home that fits your criteria!

Give us a call or shoot us an email if you would like our assistance with anything real estate related. We’re always here to help!

Today, we’ll talk about keeping score. We’re a little over halfway through 2015, and it’s been a record sales year for housing across the Wasatch Front.

In Salt Lake County, home sales are up 18% from 2014, and the median sales price for single-family homes has risen by 7%. In Davis County, home sales are up 17%, and the median sales price is up by 3%. In Utah County, sales have risen by a whopping 23.6%, with the median sales price up 6.5%. Tooele County has also seen home sales rise, in this case by 22.3%, and the median price is up by 15%.

Overall, the average sales price in Utah has risen by 6%. We have low inventory right now, which is good news for sellers. Right now, we have 3.3 months of inventory, and anything under 4 months is considered a seller’s market.

Buyer demand is high, however, and the average time on market for a single-family home is 49 days. For the Stern Team, the average time on market is 3 weeks.

The strangest phenomenon in our market right now is that the affordability index remains near record lows. Interest rates and Utah’s strong economy have played important roles in keeping homes affordable for the average buyer.

If you have any questions about today’s video, please give us a call or send us an email. We’d be happy to help you!

So, tax notices are coming out in the middle to the end of July.  If you think the tax assessed value has come in too high, you have a few options to consider that will assist you with the dispute.

Here’s the 3-step process you need to look into:


  Contact your favorite local real estate agent. (We recommend us, but we’re biased.) Why? Because with MLS access, we can get you comparables. In order to say that your home is worth less than the county says it is, you’ll need a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 comparable homes which sold in your area during 2011. Real estate agents have access to the true price that those homes sold for.
  Next, you’ll need to complete an appeal form. We can help you do that.
  Then, submit both the comparables and the appeal form to the Salt Lake County Board of Equalization, either by mail or in person. This is located at 2001 State St, Salt Lake City, UT 84190.


If you purchased your home during 2014, and your purchase price itself was less than the county’s assessed value, than the process is also simple: attach a copy of your HUD-1 settlement statement (closing statement) and the appraisal of your home, along with the appeal form. Submit it to the above address, again either by mail or in person.

If you refinanced in 2014, you can do the same thing if you have an actual appraisal. Make a copy of the appraisal, fill out the appeal form, and submit it to the above address.

There is a deadline, though: the appeal form and any other paperwork must be into the Board of Equalization by September 15th.

The good news is that in this process, you’re not alone. That’s because The Stern Team is here to help. This is a service we provide FREE to our clients along the Wasatch Front, and we’re happy to help. If you have any questions about the process, feel free to contact us directly: email us at &#106;&#111;&#115;&#104;&#064;&#115;&#101;&#114;&#118;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#115;&#097;&#108;&#116;&#108;&#097;&#107;&#101;&#046;&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;, or use the chat interface at the bottom right of your screen.

Moving is absolutely one of the most stressful parts of the buying and selling process. In order to reduce stress, you should start preparing at least 60 days in advance.

The first thing you should do is get quotes from three different movers. After that you should begin to pack up all of the little things around your home that you don’t necessarily need in your daily life. If you’re selling your home as part of the move, the decluttering process is important.

If you don’t know what to do with all the things you’ve accumulated, you can take them to the Goodwill or donate them to charity.

Also, keep in mind that moving-related expenses are tax-deductible, so keep a file of all of your expenses during the entire moving process.

About two weeks before the move you’ll need to complete a change of address form to ensure that all bills and important documents will make it to your doorstep and not someone else’s.

Don’t forget to call all of your utility providers to let them know when you’ll be leaving your current home and when you’ll be moving into your new one.

Moving can often be a nightmare, but if you plan and coordinate the process carefully, it doesn’t have to be so traumatic. It’s actually quite easy when you do calm down and take it one step at a time.

If you need any assistance coordinating this process, please don’t hesitate to contact me. I can even recommend some good movers here in Salt Lake City!

Moving is absolutely one of the most stressful parts of the buying and selling process. In order to reduce stress, you should start preparing at least 60 days in advance.

Today I’d like to speak about how you can get multiple offers on your home and get top dollar when you sell in Salt Lake.

You first have to realize that selling your home begins online, because over 90% of buyers begin their home search on the Internet. Online marketing involves using photo and video, so you want to make sure that your home looks good. This means you’ll want to plant as many flowers as possible, and make your home appear as good as it possibly can.

After working on the outside, you’ll need to impress the buyers with the inside of your home. This means clearing every flat surface of every object except for decorative items. This includes bookshelves, end tables, and more. You should also make sure that your home is painted uniformly throughout, with no red or neon rooms that would stick out.

New paint can actually bring a big return on your investment, and it can go a long way towards attracting buyers to your home.

Once you have multiple offers on your home it’s important to evaluate the different offers that you have on your home and decide which one would benefit you the most. Is there a pre-approval or a pre-qualification letter? Are they asking for closing costs? Do they have contingencies?

Overall, you have to pick the offer that best suits your needs, and sometimes the highest-priced offer is not the best.

Thanks for watching again, and if you need any help buying or selling real estate in Salt Lake City, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would love to help you.

Today I want to speak about some common mistakes that I see Millennial home buyers making when they set out to buy homes. This is going to be brief, because we’re in the busy summer market here in Salt Lake City, but here is what you need to avoid:


  Overestimating how much you can buy: You want to be able to comfortably afford a home when you buy it. A lot of people fail to calculate the monthly expenses of owning a home such as maintenance and repair, as well as insurance. I recommend visiting a qualified lender before committing to buying a home, because he or she can tell you what kinds of properties you can afford, and this will make your home search much easier.
  Don’t let your emotions get the best of you: I want you to make a top 10 list of the most important things that you need in a house. When you finally buy a home, there will probably only be 5 or 6 things from that list in your home, but you then need to decide which of those things are the most important to you.
  Buy with the end in mind: Most people live in a home for around 3-5 years, and when you sell it back, you need to be able to make a profit off of it. Whatever you buy needs to have a broad appeal for the next buyer.


Hopefully these tips can help you out when you’re looking to buy a home, but if you need any more help when you’re buying or selling in Salt Lake City, please don’t hesitate to contact me.

Hey guys, thanks for coming back. If you are a buyer, you’ve likely noticed that the market is hot. We have very little inventory, but there are several things you can do to help you and your offer stand out in this market.

The first thing you want to do is make sure you secure a strong pre-approval letter. Have your lender run you through a desktop underwriting system and share it with the agent when you submit your offer. Another thing you can do is write a letter to the seller, letting them know everything you love about the property. Be passionate, sometimes sellers will surprise you with how they respond to heartfelt communication.

Asking the listing agent what is important to the seller is a good idea. Maybe they don’t care as much about price as they do a closing date or shortened inspection period.

Watch out for closing costs. When buyers ask sellers to pay closing costs in this market, it’s going to be problematic. Chat with your lender about how much you need, and make sure you don’t take a cent more.

Finally, you can submit an escalation clause, which is a way you can get the seller to accept an offer that is above all other offers by a specified amount. Presenting the offer in person is a good idea as well.

If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us a quick email. Talk to you soon!

Welcome back, and thanks for joining us again. Today, I’m going to be talking about how sellers can benefit from multiple offers.

As a seller, there are a few important tips you need to remember if you want to maximize what you get for your property and decrease your time on the market. We want to create a multiple offer environment with your home, to create an auction-like environment that will draw high listing prices and favorable terms.

First things first, you want to take the time necessary to stage your home properly. All buyers will have received information from your home already online, so don’t skimp on the staging. It’s the one thing you can control that will generate a very positive rate of return.

Secondly, you’ve got to make sure all marketing information about your property gets to the most people in the shortest amount of time. We typically like to let the neighbors know about the open house with a “Grand Opening” invitation. This way you can have all the buyers interested in your property in the same room at the same time.

If you have any questions for us, make sure to give us a call or send us an email. We can’t wait to hear from you!

Hey everyone, we are back on the Wasatch Front with a special guest today, Chris Van Leeuwen, who has access to a mortgage product that covers 100% financing, with a forgiving grant. We have invited Chris in to tell you about this grant today.

The national home buyer grants offered by First Option Mortgage come with either a 3% or 5% grant for FHA financing, and a 3% grant for conventional financing. The thing we really love about this product is that you don’t have to be a first-time home buyer to have access to it.

If you’ve owned in the past but don’t currently own a property, you can be eligible for this grant. You do have to meet some credit score and income requirements, but you can now get an FHA loan with a 640 score.

The really great news about this grant? YOU DON’T HAVE TO PAY IT BACK! It’s a true grant, that is forgiven on the day you move into the house.

For those of you who want to see if you can qualify for this grant, give Chris a call today at (801)-809-0213.

If you have any questions for us, we are always here to take you call or email! Talk to you soon!

Today I want to talk to you about the affordability of buying a home in today’s market. As we take a look at the Wasatch Front through the history books, let’s first examine the affordability of a home in 1989.

In 1989, the average price of a home was $94,000. The average mortgage interest rate was 10%, making the average monthly payment around $825, with median incomes hovering around the $30,000 mark.

Fast forward to 2015, and things have changed for the better. Although the average price of homes is up to $208,000, mortgage interest rates are down near 4%, making the average monthly payment of $995 much more affordable to the average person, whose income has risen to $52,250.
“In 2014, an average person would only have to spend 15% of their income to purchase a home, the 3rd lowest figure on record.”
In 2014, an average person would only have to spend 15% of their income to purchase a home, the 3rd lowest figure on record. From this data, you can see that homes have very rarely been as affordable as they are right now.

One thing we want to make sure you know is that interest rates are going to rise this year. We don’t know when, but we do know that they are low right now. If you want to find out if now is a good time for you to consider making a jump in the market or at least testing the waters, take a look at some homes, and give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you!

Today I’m going to take some time to answer your questions about the Salt Lake City and Wasatch Front real estate markets. I’ve been getting questions from a lot of different people regarding some different subjects, so if you don’t see your question answered here, please don’t hesitate to contact me and I’d be glad to assist you.


  Will we see more Millennials buying in 2015?
    
      Statistically speaking, we are seeing more millennial buyers turning to buying instead of renting, but they’ve been delayed by a stagnant economy. However, we are seeing a huge increase in first-time home buyers, and this is expected to have a ripple effect in the market, which is going to generate a lot of activity in 2015.
    
  
  What do we expect to see this spring?
    
      I expect to see a lot more home buyers this spring with interest rates so low and great loan products available for first-time buyers. Unemployment is at 3.2%, and with the highest amount of inward migration in the nation, I expect this spring to be particularly busy.
    
  
  Credit Requirement Loosens:
    
      Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have come out with new loan products that require only a 3% down payment on a home. On top of this, private mortgage insurance premiums for FHA loans have fallen by half of a percent, which could save you $85 per month on a $200,000 home.
    
  


Hopefully these topics have been helpful to you. If you need any assistance buying or selling homes in Salt Lake City or the Wasatch Front, please don’t hesitate to contact me. I’m always willing to help you!

        <title>What is the Starbucks Effect?</title>
        <link>localhost:5000/salt-lake-county-real-estate-home-value-starbucks-11.html</link>

        <description>

I recently came across an interesting article on Zillow that was talking about the strange effect that Starbucks was having on home values across the country.

The article basically stated that if you lived within a quarter mile of Starbucks that your home value would’ve appreciated by 96% from 1997 to 2014. This is compared to a 65% appreciation rate if your home wasn’t located near a Starbucks. My only idea of why this could be happening is because often times there is development happening around Starbucks, and that could increase the value of your home.

While I still don’t know exactly what’s happening with Starbucks, I do know that supply is low and demand is high in Salt Lake City, which means that it’s a perfect time to put your home on the market. If it’s priced correctly and marketed to the right audience, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t be getting top dollar.

If you’re interested in buying or selling real estate in Salt Lake City this spring, please feel free to contact me. I’d love to help you out!

Hey everyone, welcome back to our blog. Today we want to discuss a few things you can do to prepare your home for sale in the market this spring on the Wasatch Front.

The first thing you have to do is change your mindset. Don’t think of your home as a home anymore, think of it as a house, a building that you need to sell. If you treat your home sale more like a business transaction, it will make everything a lot easier.

The next thing you want to do is make sure you have an accurate picture of your home’s value. The first step to doing that is clicking the link below, which will give you a good estimate of your home’s value. The next step is giving us a call to come out and visit your home. This way we can get the most accurate value for your home, within 1% of what it’s market value is.

Now comes pricing the home. Pricing your home with the market will make sure that more buyers see it, and it will sell quicker and for more money.

Finally, we want to see how mortgage rates can affect you as a home seller. For instance, if rates were to go up by 1%, we would lose the bottom 18% of first time home buyers, who are the people actually driving the market. Without them in the market, nobody else can move up, and the market becomes stalled.

We are currently at about 50% of the historical average for interest rates. Every time rates increase by just 1%, the cost of owning a home rises by 10%.

If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call or send us an email anytime. We’d love to set up a time to meet with you and discuss your real estate goals.

We have been having a great 2015 so far, and wanted to let you know today what to expect in the coming year, because a lot of our clients have been asking us.

First, let’s talk about interest rates. They have been historically low for quite some time now, but as the saying goes, “All good things must come to an end.” Most experts are predicting that interest rates are going to increase significantly, by as much as 1% this summer.

Because of this, we should see a little increase in days on market, and a little decrease in the list-to-sale ratio. However, we are torching industry averages in both of these areas, and should see little to no movement as the Wasatch Front market continues to level out.

We will check up on these predictions soon and throughout the year, but if you have any questions for us, be sure to reach out. Pick up the phone and give us a call, we would love to help you out.

Thanks for joining us once again, as we continue to give you the most up-to-date information about real esate on the Wasatch Front. This time of year, all of our clients have been asking us what to expect in 2015 from a real estate perspective. So let’s take a look at what we believe is in store for the housing market in 2015.

First of all, we are starting out at a much stronger pace than we did at this time last year. With the government shutdown, a lot of the nation experienced a slow down in real estate last year. Overall, oursales volume is down about 4.5% on the Wasatch Front, however the median home price is up 3% which is a good thing.

What we are looking for in 2015 is simple: a stable supply of homes. Anywhere from a 4-6 month supply of homes is considered a balanced market , and that’s what we would like to see. We firmly believe inventory will stabilize in 2015 and we will see a moderate amount of housing appreciation.

Thanks again for taking a moment to check out our predictions for 2015. If you have any questions for us at all, don’t be shy. Give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help out!

Today, we’re going to address a problem we’re seeing here on the Wasatch Front. Many empty nesters - couples whose kids have moved from the house and are looking to make a move - have been hesitant to sell their homes in the last 6 months. The reasoning behind this is they are waiting for the market to rebound so they can get top dollar for their home. However, many of these empty nesters don’t realize that the market has changed and their property values have likely gone up.

If you’re an empty nester who’s ready to sell, now is a great time to start searching for a new home. There is a wide selection of inventory and homes are continuing to come onto the market. There are many homes to choose from to meet your downsizing needs.
“If you’re an empty nester who’s ready to sell, now is a great time to start searching for a new home.”
Recently, many sellers we’ve worked with have made the mistake of spending the last year renovating their home. While improving your home is almost always a good idea, there are some projects that simply won’t add any value to your home. If you want to know which improvements you can make to raise the final sales prices, give us a call. We’ll assist you in determining which renovations will get your home sold.

Now is a great time to downgrade if you are an empty nester. If you would like some top-rate assistance with the process, give us a call or shoot us an email. We’d love to make your life a bit easier!

With summer coming to an end, many buyers who wanted to find a home before school starts have left the market. Because of this, sellers have a tendency to leave the market as well - they feel it’s better to wait until the spring selling season.

However, we’ve found that in the late summer and early fall months there are more serious buyers in the market. These buyers typically have either recently sold their home and are looking to find a new one quickly, or are moving from an area outside the Wasatch Front. These folks are very determined to purchase property - in fact, we often need fewer showings to sell a home.

The early fall months see a decrease in competition among sellers and an increase in serious buyers, which makes now a great time to put your home on the market.

If you have any questions about this interesting selling season, don’t hesitate to give us a call. We would love to chat about conditions in your particular area.

        <title>An Expert Described the Market as a "Crapshoot" - We Disagree</title>

We came across a CNN Money article the other day in which an expert described the real estate market as a “crapshoot.” He explained that there is no guarantee that home prices will continue to rise, so investing in real estate is essentially a gamble. In a sense, he’s right - market conditions are ultimately unpredictable. But the fact that there are no guarantees in real estate doesn’t mean you can’t make a safe bet.

There are a lot of variables when investing in real estate. For instance, if you are looking for a new construction property and only plan on living there for a few years, your’e going to want to get a great price on it so you can get a good return on your investment. On the other hand, if you are interested in a new construction property where you plan to live for 10-15 years, you don’t have to worry as much about what you’re paying to get the property. Your particular circumstances play a role in how market conditions will affect you.

Another thing to remember is that real estate is local - conditions vary depending on the particular area. If we look at the East Bench area of the Wasatch Front, we have a 4 or 5 month supply of homes. Once we focus on a particular price range things begin to change; under the $300,000 price range we have a less than 4 month supply, whereas for homes over $500,000 we’ve got close to a 5 month supply. The larger the supply of homes, the lower the pressure on pricing - which means it takes longer for appreciation to occur.

So, the article can be seen as overstating something that is pretty much common sense - home appreciation relies heavily on inventory, and available inventory is always changing. But, as we’ve seen, inventory levels vary depending on locale, so a national report tells us little about conditions on the Wasatch front.

Investing in real estate isn’t a gamble. It’s a matter of finding the right agent to help you negotiate and leverage to find an ideal price. Depending on what your goals are for you next move, an agent can help you make sure you find a property that is the right fit so that, when you plan on selling, you have equity to sell.

We hope to be your number one source for real estate information in Salt Lake County. Give us a call or email us any questions you might have about market conditions in your area.

Today, we’re going to talk about bigger homes and why now might be the time to make your move on the Wasatch Front. The other day, we saw a report on CNN that talked about average home size. It said the average home is now 2,600 square feet, which is 500 square feet larger than it was only 20 years ago. Have you always wanted a great room, or a few extra bedrooms? How about a home office? It’s likely your family’s need have changed since you moved into your current home, so now might be the time to get an evaluation done on your property, so you can get that newer, larger home before school starts.

The key is figuring out how much your home is worth so you know how much you have available for a down payment on your next home. We can help you determine what you can afford, and what upgrades might be better than others for your particular situation. We’re always available to chat about your options, so give us a call or shoot us an email with your real estate needs. We’d love to help you out.

Today our blog is all about home sellers. If you are thinking of selling your home, you might have already noticed a lot of mixed signals in this shifting market. Interest rates have gone up in some areas, while they have remained still in others. Here in Salt Lake County,  FHA loan rates are staying steady at 4.25%, while conventional mortgage interest rates remain at around 4.5%.

Selling your home without losing money on it is important, so how exactly do you do that? Here are 3 simple rules to follow to make sure you don’t lose any money on your sale.


  Look at every home as an investment
    
      Your home is not just your home, but a product you are buying, using, and reselling at a profit, and you need to treat it accordingly.
    
  
  Only make improvements that pay for themselves
    
      Check out this article to see the best improvements you can make on your home that will bring the best return.
    
  
  Sell during the best local conditions
    
      You can monitor these conditions yourself, or have a professional real estate agent like myself do the hard work for you. Either way, it’s important to understand where our Salt Lake County real estate market is heading before listing your home for sale.
    
  


If you want to sell your home and need to get into your new property by the beginning of the school year (like most of our clients do) now is the time to make your move. Contact us for your free home value report, the first step in getting your home ready for the market!

In our latest video, we’re sharing some recent developments in the Wasatch Front housing market, and what they mean for you. Our local market is on par with the nation as a whole, with pending home sales rising only one half of a percent since last month. While that’s less than expected, here on the Wasatch Front we’ve seen a surge in home sales in the last 45 days. In fact, homes priced under $300,000 have less than a four month supply.

What does this mean for you?

For homeowners looking to sell, the next 60 days are crucial. Now is the perfect time to put your home on the market, as there’s not enough inventory for all the people looking to buy,

For buyers, you have more of a selection than earlier this year, but there are a lot of buyers out there you’ll have to compete with. This means you have to take a few extra steps to set yourself apart from the competition. Here’s what you need to do:


  Work with an agent who knows how to win a multiple offer situation.
  Get pre-approved.
  Know the difference between must-haves and nice-to-haves.


The current surge in the market makes now an ideal time to consider buying or selling a home. Give us a call or shoot us an email and we’ll help you take the right steps to make your move this summer.

Today we’re talking about homeowners who are underwater- they owe more on their home than it’s worth.

Zillow recently released a report on the low levels of homes on the market. One of the reasons we have such low inventory is homeowners who feel they are underwater are not putting their homes on the market.

The good news is that low inventory means more demand for homes, so prices have actually increased over the last couple years.

In other words, your home may be worth more than you think. In some areas we’re even seeing home prices regain the levels seen at the peak of the housing market in 2007.

If you’ve been underwater on your mortgage, now is the time to double-check your home value. Rates are still historically low, so if your home value has recovered, it’s a perfect time to move out or move up and lock in a great low rate.

Thanks for watching and as always, if you’re looking to buy or sell a home in Salt Lake County or the Wasatch Front, we’d love to hear from you!
