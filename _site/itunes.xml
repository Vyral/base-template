I’m coming to you today from Toyland in Bentonville, Arkansas to discuss a few reasons why selling your home during the holiday season can be a great idea.

In the spirit of the season, I also want to bring you a list of some great things to do around this time of year here in Northwest Arkansas. But first, let’s talk real estate.

So, what are the top reasons to sell your home during the holidays?


  Reduced inventory. There is a common misconception that the fall and winter markets aren’t a good time to list. As a result, there is significantly less inventory on the market during the holiday season. This translates to less competition for you.
  Buyers are more serious. During this time of year, the buyers who are still looking on the market are truly committed to finding a home. So, the holidays are a great opportunity to capture serious buyers.
  Financial incentives.Some buyers may be looking to purchase a home by the end of the fiscal year because of certain financial opportunities. This will drive further interest to your property.


These aren’t the only reasons to sell this season, though. There are actually about seven more that my team and I would love to share with you. To find out what they are, email us at info@limbirdteam.com.

“Some may think you shouldn’t list during the holidays, but this simply isn’t true.”

For now, I’d like to jump back into the holiday fun I mentioned earlier. There are a lot of great events coming up in our area this holiday season, so you won’t want to miss out.

Here is a list of everything that’s going on. You can click on the links to find out more about each event.


  November 9: Eureka Springs Food and Wine Weekend
  November 17: Fayetteville Lights of the Ozarks
  November 18: Siloam Springs 5K Turkey Trot
  November 18: Bentonville Lighting of the Square
  November 23: Don Gammie Turkey Trot
  December 1: Rogers Christmas Parade
  December 1: Eureka Springs Chamber of Commerce Parade of Lights
  December 2: “Red, White, and Who” Siloam Springs Christmas Parade
  December 9: Bentonville Christmas Parade
  December 9: Night of 1,000 Santas


Last but not least, don’t forget to meet and take a photo with Santa himself at Pinnacle Hills Promenade. You can find dates and information for that here.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

I would like to invite you the Limbird Real Estate Group’s kickoff party.

But the party isn’t for Limbird Real Estate Group, though—it’s for Kiss A Pig.The Kiss A Pig Gala is the biggest charity event in Arkansas and helps the American Diabetes Association.

I’m going to be a candidate helping to raise money and awareness for diabetes from now until March 10th.

“Diabetes affects almost 30 million people in our country, so we need your help and your support.”

Diabetes affects almost 30 million people in our country, so we need your help and your support.

The Team Tara fundraising kickoff party will be held Thursday, October 19th, from 5 to 7 p.m. at Landers Toyota in Rogers, Arkansas.

I have never done anything like this before, and I’m so out of my element, but I really need your support.

Bring a friend with you and show us some love and support. We really appreciate it.

We’ll have drinks, hors d’oeuvres, and door prizes. It’s sure to be a lot of fun!

Hope to see you October 19th!

        <title>The 5 Things You Need Before Purchasing a Home</title>

        <description>

Before you purchase a home, there are five key things you’ll need.

First of all, obtaining a pre-approval letter will be essential to your success as a homebuyer. Meeting with a loan officer who will ask you basic questions about your income, credit, and eligibility is the first step in getting a pre-approval letter.

A pre-approval letter is a fantastic thing to attach to any offer. Additionally, a loan officer will be able to help you with other things throughout the home buying process, as well.

Next, while some have moved away from suggesting this tip, I like to recommend putting down earnest money. Earnest money is money put down in good faith to show the seller that you are serious about the purchase. It can also give you a big advantage in multiple offer situations.

The main concern people tend to raise about earnest money is the fear of not getting it back. However, if for some reason the financing falls through or the inspection isn’t satisfactory, you do get this money back. Earnest money can be written into an agreement or contract in a way that ensures it will be refundable.

The third thing you’ll need is to sort out your down payment. In many cases, the more you put down, the better your interest rate will be. Also, in cases where you’re able to put down 20%, you then don’t need to pay for mortgage insurance.

“A pre-approval letter is a fantastic thing to attach to any offer.”

However, paying 20% isn’t necessary. There are many loan programs out there, so it will be important that you find one that works best for your needs.

This is especially important because your down payment isn’t the only money required in the transaction. You will also need money for your closing costs. These closing costs include several different fees associated with buying a home, but the good news is that you can negotiate.

However, this will depend on circumstance. If you are in a multiple offer situation, the seller will feel less of an obligation to negotiate in your favor. Ultimately, your loan officer and agent will be able to help you determine the right way to navigate this situation.

Finally, the fifth thing you’ll need to buy a home is money for the home inspector. This cost will depend on the size of the home and be taken out of pocket.

Keep in mind that if you are dissatisfied with the results of the inspection or with the home itself, you won’t get a refund. However, the hundreds of dollars you will pay for an inspection will be a worthwhile investment to make sure everything is sound with the home before you spend thousands on a purchase.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

The real estate market is crazy right now, especially in certain areas and price points. It can be difficult to find a home in our area that meets your criteria, and once you do, you’ll probably notice that many other buyers are looking for the same thing.

If you end up in a multiple offer situation, there are a few things you should take into consideration in order to make sure your offer stands out.

Of course, the first thing everyone thinks about is the price. Price is important, but it’s not the only factor to pay attention to. If you are at a price point with a lot of buyers, go in with your highest and best offer.

This can be tough because everyone wants to negotiate and try to get the best deal. Think about it this way, though: How upset would you be if you lost out on this home? Some people may have another home in mind and may not panic if they lose out on this home. If it’s the only house on the market that you like, though, I’d hate for you to get beat out by $500. So, you may wind up paying more than you plan, but at least you’ll get the house you wanted.

Speaking of overpaying, remember that if you use financing to purchase your home, then your lender will order an appraisal. If the home doesn’t appraise, you can always negotiate with the seller or walk away from the deal.

However, if you can pay out of pocket over the list price, you can make your offer not contingent on the appraisal. That way, the seller doesn’t have to worry about the home failing to appraise and going back on the market—and your offer looks more appealing to the seller.

“Keep your offer as clean as possible.”

Also, if you have enough money for your share of the closing costs—that’s great. It is okay to ask the seller to cover closing costs, but keep in mind that the seller will look at the price and the concessions you ask for before deciding which offer to work with. Some concessions may include things like the refrigerator, patio furniture, rugs, and bar stools. The cleaner you keep the offer, the better.  

Usually, you would ask the seller to cover the home warranty. Home warranties run about $500 to $700, so if you can, go ahead and pay for it instead of asking the seller to. The seller will look at how your offer affects their bottom line versus competing offers.

Finally, consider the closing date. Be as flexible as you can. If you absolutely have to close on a specific date, then maybe your price has to be more competitive. If the seller is building a home, be flexible with the closing date or when the seller has to move out. Maybe you agree to close in 30 days but give the seller an additional month or two to move out of the property. That way the seller doesn’t have to move twice, which could put your offer over the edge.

Hopefully, these tips will help you win the home of your dreams. Our team also has some unique ideas that have helped our clients in multiple offer situations, so if you have any other questions, give us a call. We would be happy to help you!

When you first list your home something magical happens. Like a new kid at a high school dance, all eyes are going to be upon your listing. Buyers and agents alike are going to make some rapid judgments about your home: is it over priced, is the condition of your home in good shape, and is the location an ideal location for the buyer.

The first impression of your home in the first few weeks of it being listed is going to determine whether or not people come to see it. If you’re not getting very many showings or no showings at all, you’ve got a problem. It means that the market as a whole is rejecting your value proposition.

“The sooner you lower the price, the better.”

At that point, the only thing that can typically be done is to lower the price and the sooner, the better. You may be thinking, “Why in such a short time? Why not keep the price as it is for a few more weeks?”

Think of the real estate market as an audience in a movie theater. When the movie first hits the screen, the audience members are going to make a determination about whether they like the movie or not. More time isn’t going to change their minds. At that point, you’re just waiting for new audience members to trickle in and against all odds, they love it.

More than likely, the best decision when you aren’t getting showings is to edit the price and get it back up on the MLS.

If you have any questions about this topic or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, give me a call. I’d be happy to help you!

There’s a lot going on in the Northwest Arkansas market this year.

The market is booming and there are a lot of great things happening. According to the Northwest Arkansas Council, there are 31 people moving in every day and research from the University of Arkansas shows that the average age of residents here is 33.

As for market activity, I wanted to look at things in terms of Benton County and Washington County.

There are currently about 1,500 homes for sale in Benton County and roughly a quarter are new builds. In Washington County, there are 738 homes for sale with 149 being new builds. Through the first five months of the year in Benton County, 2,375 homes have sold compared to 2,279 during the same period last year. In Washington County, 1,406 homes sold in the first five months of 2017. That number last year was 1,341.

“Prices are definitely up.”

Interestingly, prices are definitely up. In Benton County, price per square foot rose about $8. The number of days it takes to sell a home on average has held steady in Benton County, but in Washington County, homes are selling in an average of about 30 days faster than last year. Prices in Washington County are also up by about $7 per square foot.

New construction home sales are up by about 80 this year in Benton County and up by about 60 in Washington County. Prices are also up about $8 a square foot for such homes. If you thought about buying a home last year but waited until this year, it will cost you about $20,000 more on average.

Interest rates are still low for homes, making it still a great time to buy. March marked the 31st consecutive quarter of incline in the economy, tying for third-longest in the history of the U.S. economy.

If you’re interested in buying a home or you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’re here to help.

        <title>What Are The Core Values that Define Our Company?</title>
        <link>http://limbirdteamblog.com/what-are-the-core-values-that-define-our-company.html</link>

        <guid>https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/Tara+Limbird/Videos/2017/June/Limbird+Real+Estate+Group-+What+Are+the+Core+Values+that+Define+Our+Company%253F.mp4</guid>
        <description>

Our core values are what define us as a team, and they’re very important to us. These six values represent who we are and what we stand for:

1. A positive outlook: Nobody ever walks into a company and wants to hang around negative people. This business is somewhat of a roller coaster and there are a lot of emotions involved in buying and/or selling a home, so we try to keep a positive outlook and be solution-oriented with no excuses.

2. Being your best: We believe in taking pride in your position and doing everything to the best of your ability. To me, anything worth doing is worth doing right. There are a lot of things that happen in a real estate transaction, and putting our best foot forward and being the best we can be for both our clients and each other is extremely important.

3. Appreciation: We take the time to appreciate our clients and our team. We like to have client appreciation parties a few times a year. We get busy with the day-to-day hustle and grind, and sometimes we forget to thank our clients and northwest Arkansas for choosing us as your real estate team.

“We take the time to appreciate our clients and our team.”

4. Being silly: This is a very stressful business, so we take the time to be silly and happy. You have to take time out of the day to laugh. As the expression goes, “If you don’t laugh, you’ll cry,” and sometimes we feel like that.

5. Abundance:When living in a world of abundance, you have to give in order to get. One of the things I’m most proud of with our team is the fact that we’re a giving team. We like to give back to our community, and we help sponsor several different organizations across Arkansas. We also have our Compassion Campaign, where every time we sell a home we put money into an account that helps with urgent needs within our community.

6. Being coachable: I’ve been in this business since 2004, and I still learn something new every day. We’re never going to know it all, and that’s what I love about real estate. It’s always changing, and there’s something new to learn each and every day. We can all learn something new, and if I ever felt like I knew it all, it wouldn’t be as much fun to be in this business.

If you have any questions about our core values or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, feel free to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help.

At the Limbird Real Estate Group, we are proud to always be on the cutting edge of technology. This is why we are thrilled to announce our adoption of 3-D home tours. Buying a home can be a taxing process, especially for out-of-town buyers. Typically, Realtors use still photos and some use video to market their homes to buyers. This is only a 2-D experience, however.

We are investing in a three-dimensional experience for our buyers and sellers. Open houses are usually only held for a few hours each week. With our easy-to-navigate 3-D tours, however, your home can be open 24/7, 365 days a year.

“With these tours, you have a 360-degree view of each room.”

We take you beyond the real world with a complete digital scan that gives buyers an unprecedented insight into your home like never before. With the use of lasers and high-tech cameras, potential buyers can select any room to view and instantly place themselves inside that space with the ability to maneuver inside the room and view it in 360 degrees. Buyers will be able to virtually walk through your home, get a feel for its layout, and notice details and features that they typically wouldn’t with still images.

When you combine the fact that the majority of homebuyers start their search online with the power of photos being shared on social media, this is an amazing tool for a seller like yourself to take advantage of. Our team currently advertises on more than 100 websites and we’re ready to put our state-of-the-art technology to work for you.

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.

This time of year, we get a lot of people telling us they are going to wait to sell until spring or summer because there will be more buyers. While it’s true that there are a larger number of buyers in spring and summer, there is also a lot more inventory for buyers to choose from.

In our market, we have a large relocation of clients that move in and out of the area each year. These people usually make their moves toward the end or beginning of the year. We also have a situation where sellers who took their homes off the market during the holidays are mostly waiting until spring to list.

“You have a window of opportunity right now.”

This gives you a window of opportunity now in which there isn’t a lot of inventory, but you also have a ton of buyers looking and a time of year where people are getting their tax refunds or bonus checks. When buyers have extra money burning a hole in their pocket, they are ready to spend.

There aren’t a whole lot of homes for them to look at right now. The chances of selling your home more quickly and for a higher price are very good right now. It all depends on your situation, but things look good overall. Interest rates are also expected to go up three separate times this next year. That will further affect the number of buyers that look at your house.

If you have any questions for us or want to sell your home, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to help you out and give you the straight answer. We look forward to hearing from you!

It’s that time of year—the time for our Valentine Love Fest for our clients (past and present), our friends, and our family! This year marks the third annual appreciation party for members of our loyalty club.

As you might remember, we’ll give you a big box of chocolates that you can keep for yourself or give to your sweetheart as an early Valentine’s Day gift.

“We’ll have chocolate, cocktails, and champagne”

The party is coming up on Tuesday, February 7th from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Other than your big box of chocolates, we’ll also have drinks, champagne, and chocolate-covered strawberries. It’ll be a great time to come by after work and unwind with some chocolate and champagne.

All we ask is  that you fill out this form so we can be sure we have enough candy for everyone!

This year, we will have two locations to make it even more convenient for you to pick up your gift! You can either come to our Benton County pickup location at 5247 W. Metro Park Crossing, Rogers, AR 72758 or our Washington County pick up location at 3291 S. Thompson Street Suite D104 in Springdale.

We look forward to seeing you there!

Today I have not one, but two fun videos that I wanted to share.

As you may remember back in November, we gave away pies to our loyalty club members for Thanksgiving and gave you a chance to vote on which of our team members deserved a pie in the face.

“Check out the fun things that’ve happened with our team.”

Well, yours truly was lucky enough to be one of them. You can see me get pied in the face here.

We also gave away a trip to one lucky client, and you can see their video here.

We had a lot of fun in the last few weeks and we’re really looking forward to a great 2017. If there’s anything you have questions about in real estate or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to help you!

If you’re selling your home, there are four things that you can do to sell your home faster than anybody else in your neighborhood.


  
    Update the landscaping. Curb appeal is huge. If buyers don’t like what they see on the outside, they may never come in and see the inside. Trim your shrubs, pick your weeds, and put a layer of fresh mulch down to make your landscape look new again.
  
  
    Paint. Nothing will make a home feel brand new like new paint on the walls. In the grand scheme of things, paint is relatively inexpensive but can pay huge dividends when it’s time for buyers to make an offer.
  
  
    Move out of the house. Make it appear as though you’ve moved out. If you’re still living in your home, get rid of as much as you can. Like we always say, “Clutter eats equity.” Clutter can make buyers think that the house is smaller than it is or has less storage than it does. The more you can get rid of, the easier it will be to get the home ready for showings, and homes that show well tend to get more offers.
  
  
    Price your home correctly the first time. We analyze price changes and days on market for homes that have sold recently, and most of the time we’ve found that the homes that were priced right the first time sold quicker and for more money than the homes that reduced their price. Even if you’re not in a hurry to sell your home, a home that is priced correctly will net you more money on the bottom line in the end, so it’s important to get out onto the market with the right price the first time.
  


“Homes that sell faster sell for more money.”

Follow these four tips, and you’ll sell your home faster than anybody else on your block. If you have any other questions about buying or selling a home in the Northwest Arkansas market, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help you!

How can technology attract high-end buyers to your home? HGTV actually said that 46% of consumers think technology is very important for their current or future residencies. In fact, Digital Interior said that 94% of buyers surveyed would sacrifice 1,000 square feet of living space for new technology in their new home.

Obviously, technology is important to home buyers. One of the latest trends in home technology that will draw high-end buyers is the smart thermostat. Smart thermostats allow you to control the temperature in your home from your smartphone. You can change the temperature from your couch or your car while going to work.

Home surveillance technology is also very important. Cameras can be mounted discreetly on the walls and ceilings. Buyers will appreciate that they can check in on their home even if they are at work or on vacation. Not only that, you will feel more secure knowing that you can see what is going on in your home.

“About 94% of buyers would sacrifice 1,000 sq ft of living space for new technology.”

You should also pay attention to technological developments in the kitchen. There are touchless water faucets that come on with just a hand motion, and there are also smart refrigerators. Smart refrigerators will alert you when you’re running low on groceries so that you know when it’s time to head to the store. You can also get a Bluetooth thermostat so that your meals will be perfectly cooked all the time.

Finally, luxury entertainment is always a big draw for home buyers. Flat screen TVs and home theaters are fantastic. Not only that, you can control your entertainment system, your security system, and your thermostat from one remote control by Savant!

If you have any questions about the latest trends in home technology or want to know more ways to prepare your home for the market, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

As you may have heard, the real estate market is incredibly busy. A lot of our buyers are running into multiple offer situations. How do you win?

First, make sure you are pre-approved and that you have a letter in hand. If a seller receives two offers and only one has a pre-approval letter, they will obviously go with the pre-approved buyer.

Let’s say you have two offers and both have been pre-approved. One buyer got pre-approved through a local bank, and the other worked with an out-of-town bank. Any Realtor will tell you that working with a local lender is incredibly important.

Our team works with several lenders on a daily basis, and we definitely trust them. It is much easier to get things done when you work with someone local. Local lenders close loans faster, and there aren’t as many headaches during the closing process. Why complicate the biggest purchase you will ever make by working with someone from out of town?

“Make sure you are pre-approved”

Another tip for buyers in multiple offer situations is to be flexible. Sellers don’t necessarily go for the offer with the best price. Other factors often come into play. Some sellers might not want to move until school is out, so if you can be flexible with your closing date, you will have the advantage over other buyers.

The main thing you can do to win in a multiple offer situation is work with a professional real estate agent. There are a lot of new agents in the market and selling real estate can be a complicated process. Last year, our team sold over 500 homes, so we have lots of experience negotiating the right deal and helping buyers get the keys to their brand new home.

If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

I know that people always wonder about our guaranteed sale program and how it works. It’s a big promise to make, and I’d like to explain how we manage to keep this promise for our clients who qualify for this program.

Most sellers are often uneasy about the selling price of their home and if a buyer will be found for it. However, with our Guaranteed Sale Program, we agree on a price and a time frame immediately. In the last two years, we have only had to buy one property from our clients using this program.

We have used this program with many of our clients, and it’s worked very well for almost all of them. As you can see, these two people that we helped in the past also thought that the Guaranteed Sold Program was too good to be true. However, their home did sell and they walked away very happy and willing to recommend us to their friends.

Keep in mind that the Guaranteed Sale Program is only available in Benton and Washington Counties, but that covers a majority of Northwest Arkansas.

If you’re selling your home, you owe it to yourself to come down and meet us. We would love the opportunity to help you buy or sell a home!

Choosing to buy a home is an important decision, and one you shouldn’t make without doing proper research. Today, we’ve got some tips for you on the types of questions you should be asking the homeowner or your Realtor about a potential home purchase. Proper preparation is the key to getting what you want in a home. Here’s where you should narrow your focus:

The Neighborhood

The location of your home is very important. How close are you to different stores, gas stations, or other amenities? Would you rather be in a bustling area or a quieter part of town? Is there any new construction going on in your neighborhood? If so, how will this affect your home’s value? These are all different questions you should be asking when determining where you want to live.

Schools

Another equally important topic to learn about is your potential home’s proximity to different schools. Find out what district your home is in. Even if you don’t have any kids, being in a good school district increases your home’s value when it comes time to sell.

The Little things

There are a ton of different, little things you need to check up on when researching potential homes. Ask about the little things like electric and utility bills, the age of the roof, hot water heater, and other appliances. If you have a lot of maintenance to do on a home, that will impact the kind of offer you make on it.

These are just a few of the questions you should be asking when researching homes. If you have any questions for us, or want to learn some more of the questions you should be asking when looking for a home, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to help!

Living in a For Sale home is often a very stressful experience, but it doesn’t have to be. I have a few tips to help make the selling process go as smoothly as possible in this situation:


  
    Start packing now. The nice thing about starting the packing process soon than later is it gets rid of the clutter. One thing to remember is that clutter eats equity, so this is a crucial thing to do when selling.
  
  
    Clean up your home. Make sure everything from your baseboards to your ceiling fans are clean. If clutter eats equity, clean means green, which means more money in your pocket when you sell.
  
  
    Store valuables in a safe place. We’ve never had anything go missing from one of our listings, but it does happen! Make sure your valuables are in a safe place, away from anywhere a buyer might be looking.
  
  
    Get your kids involved. Getting your kids involved in the selling process will take a lot of the stress off. Have the kids help you get the home ready for showtime!
  


If you’re living in your home while it’s on the market, these things should make a huge difference! If you need real estate assistance, or if you have any questions for us, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to hear from you!
