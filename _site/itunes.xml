        <description>

Once you define your different sales opportunities, it’s important to understand how each role within the sales organization fits within those sales opportunities. It’s important to have your sales team divided up into four core parts:

1. Inbound lead qualification2. Outbound prospector3. Closers. Generally called account executives or outside sales agents in real estate.4. Fulfillment. These include your account managers and customer service reps.

“Closers are generally terrible prospectors.”

The reasons why you want to have these roles divided are:

1. It takes different personality types to master these roles.2. Your productivity will be exponentially greater.3. You will have more predictable revenue and happier salespeople.4. It gives teams the ability to create raving fans.

What we want to focus on here is the outbound strategy. The outbound prospector is the person who is looking at a highly targeted list and reaching out on an outbound basis to convert those people into potential clients. 

Once they are identified as a potential client, they become part of the inbound team. That team would then qualify the lead to make sure it’s a quality lead and can be passed on to the outbound sales person who can close the lead. 

People who are closers are generally terrible prospectors and great prospectors aren’t always the greatest closers.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

After you define the market, message, and medium you’ll use to deliver your messages, it’s important to understand the different kinds of leads these messages will generate. The book “Predictable Revenue” by Aaron Ross and Marylou Tyler places leads in three categories: seeds, nets, and spears. Seeds are leads you receive by word of mouth, nets are those you’ve received through inbound marketing, and spears are those you’ve gotten via outbound marketing. When you implement a strong outbound strategy, many of your leads will fall into this last category, and your revenue will become more predictable as a result. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

The first thing that you need to understand in order to develop a good outbound marketing plan is the marketing triangle. It contains the three most important factors to your marketing success: your market, your message, and the media you use to deliver the message to your market.

The first thing you need to define is your market. Who are you going to be targeting with your outbound marketing plan? What types of sellers are you looking for? Are you an investor looking for distressed sellers or an agent looking for listings? This is the first place you need to start.

“We use the telephone to deliver our clients’ messages to their prospects.”

Once you’ve defined your market, it’s time to craft your message. What message do you want to deliver to your potential clients? You want to address their fears, their concerns, and how you can solve their problems. Being very clear on who your market is and what message you want to deliver to them is incredibly important. One can not function without the other.

Finally, let’s talk about your media. There are lots of different ways to deliver your message out there. Here at 1000 Calls A Day, we focus on using the telephone to deliver your message out to prospects.

If you have any questions for us about the marketing triangle or about how we can work together to get your message out to as many people in your market as possible, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

The majority of successful investors have a certain set of habits in common. Today, we’ll share five of the most important:

1. Consistency. In order to succeed as an investor, you need to frequently contact your list of leads—or have someone do so for you. Making follow-up calls and otherwise reaching out to motivated sellers on a daily basis is key.

2. Constant learning. Another component of being a successful investor is to approach your business with an education-oriented mindset. There’s always room to learn and grow your skill set, so seek out learning opportunities whenever possible.

“When you market yourself effectively, you’ll be the first person that sellers in your area call when they’re ready to make a deal.”

3. Always making offers. You’ve got to cast a wide net to grow your investment portfolio, so making offers frequently is important.

4. Knowing the market. Every market is different, so understanding the trends that influence yours can help guide the way you approach investing. Having a target market allows you the opportunity to identify deals as they come along, rather than trusting the opinion of an out-of-state contact.

5. Mastering your marketing. Whether it’s by using direct mail, outbound calling, or social media marketing, you need to leverage a diverse array of marketing techniques in order to effectively grow your brand and build your business. When you market yourself effectively, you’ll be the first person that sellers in your area call when they’re ready to make a deal.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

People often ask us about where they can find more off-market opportunities, so we’d like to tackle this question today.

Actually, we at 1000 Calls A Day are more than happy to do the legwork for you in this regard. Our team finds motivated sellers by cold calling the lists you send us. All you need to do is find a data provider that can give very detailed information about the listed sellers’ motivations, as well as information like the sellers’ age, the length of time they’ve lived in the home, and the amount of equity they have.

“The quality of the data will impact the quality of your results.”

Then, you can easily extract these sellers’ contact information by skip-tracing the data. From there, our team can go through and call all the motivated sellers. We’re equipped to handle up to 5,000 records per caller each month, so if you’re looking to cover a large area, we’ve got you covered.

The most important thing to understand is that the quality of the data will impact the quality of your results. If the data you’ve purchased lacks necessary information, we’re going to have a lower contact rate and, therefore, a lower conversion rate. 

To recap: The best way to find off-market deals is to have clean data, to have a target audience, and to consistently call those leads. We would love to take that last step off your plate.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

At 1000 Calls A Day, we can make many different kinds of calls on your behalf.

If you’re a Realtor, we make traditional real estate calls on your behalf, including calling “For Sale By Owners,” calling expired or withdrawn listings, as well as doing circle prospecting and open house calls.

We can also do re-engagement calls with past prospects or clients. Let’s say you’re a Realtor and you have a list of 10,000 old Zillow leads. Those leads never did anything; they said they were interested in at the time, but maybe you didn’t follow up with them well enough, or maybe they just went dark on you. Regardless, we can enact a re-engagement calling plan to reconnect with all those people, see where they are currently, follow up with them, maybe offer them a free gift, touch base, and/or confirm that we have their correct contact information.

Additionally, we can do some non-traditional real estate calls. For instance, if you purchase a data list of people who are most likely to sell their homes in the next 12 to 24 months, we could help you connect with them. These are people who are statistically identified through different indicators that they would be most likely to see.

This data list could consist of mortgage data, life events, how much equity they have, and so on. Whatever the case, lists like these provide great opportunities for you to bring people into your world who have never been there—before your competition does. However, you’ll need to keep in touch with, drip on, and nurture these leads for anywhere from 12 to 24 months; these are for longer-term sales, but it’s always good to increase your sphere.

“We would love to schedule a consultation call with you to learn more about your business and discuss how we can help you scale your outbound calling and help you grow.”

This next type of call we do very commonly is for investors: If an investor is putting together a list of leads they want to go after—distressed properties, motivated sellers, people in financial troubles, etc.—we can absolutely help them pursue those types of calls. Our most common campaign is calling motivated sellers for investors. Now, investors would provide that data to us, or else we could help you connect with one of our data providers to purchase a list like that.

The final type of call we can do for you is specific to recruiting. If, for example, you’re a Realtor who is growing your real estate team, we could help make calls to recruit new members for you. We could also do outbound messaging, where you have a set script of messages that they’re sending out to people through social media, email, and text, on top of the other tools we have available to distribute outbound messages. By doing this, we can see who is interested, and follow up with those people, pre-qualify them, and then pass them on to you.

Mind you, if your business isn’t in real estate, there’s still a good chance that we can help and work with you. These are simply some of the most common types of calls and campaigns that we run here at 1000 Calls A Day.

If you have any questions or are interested in working with us, reach out to us by phone, or else visit our website at www.1000callsaday.com and opt-in for a free consultation call. We would love to schedule a consultation call with you to learn more about your business and discuss how we can help you scale your outbound calling and help you grow. We hope to hear from you soon!

        <description>

The list of prospects we call on your behalf is a form of data, and data can be purchased. Though you may already have lists of past clients, prospects, and leads from various forms of marketing, you can always purchase more to add to your list.

If you work in the real estate industry, we can determine your past leads, re-engage clients, and even go after FSBOs, expired listings, withdrawn listings—you name it. Any sort of in-house calls you’re making are calls we can make for you. Many of our clients choose to buy new lists of leads or subscribe to other services that will get new prospects.

For investors, we can go after distressed and vacant properties, but this type of data is typically found from a data company.

We also deal with propensity data, which is a longer-term nurturing opportunity. It finds leads in people who are likely to sell within the next 12 to 24 months. This is purchased from a data company, and we handle all the calls for you.

“We simply help you purchase great data and follow up on it by creating custom campaigns for calling and taking advantage of those lists.”

We’ve included a PDF of the top data suppliers and companies we’ve used. We test all this data so we know what sources get good leads for our clients.

Regardless of which industry you’re in, you own the data involved. We simply help you purchase great data and follow up on it by creating custom campaigns for calling and taking advantage of those lists. Visit 1000CallsADay.com and get a free consultation today. In the meantime, we look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

The secret to getting to outbound prospecting and securing the best ROI possible is acquiring great data. So where does it come from? Well, there’s no single data gold mine, and finding the best data heavily depends on the industry you’re in.

To better define what data is, think of it as a list; in essence, it’s a list comprised of people that are the ideal client you’ve set your sights on.

In order to obtain the best data, we recommend you purchase propensity-based data with predictive analytics. The company you purchase from will likely be a cut above more industry-specific options, and your list should be fairly large, containing approximately 25,000 contacts. If you’re in the real estate industry, a list of this size should keep the caller busy for anywhere from four to six months.

Those in real estate may have to look to data sources beyond the propensity-based variety, though, due to the disparate types of lists you may need. Real estate-specific data often comes from places like Cole Realty, Vulcan 7, RedX, etc., so it’s important to look into what source will help you pinpoint your ideal client and market to them.

“In order to obtain the best data, we recommend you purchase propensity-based data with predictive analytics.”

We’d love to get on a call with you to discuss some of the best practices for purchasing data and get to know you and your business to see if working together is a fit for you. Visit our website at 1000CallsADay.com to sign up for a free call today!

        <description>

There are three primary ways you can get leads: through your sphere, through inbound prospecting, and through outbound prospecting.

Of course, the sphere tends to be the strongest source for clients. The problem is that spheres aren’t scalable.

So what about inbound? As you know, this involves running ads using Facebook, Google Pay-Per-Click, or Boomtown (if you’re in real estate). This is all well and good, but it’s also expensive. Also, internet leads aren’t always the highest quality. And, on top of that, a single change in a website’s algorithm can completely stifle your growth by hindering the number of leads you’re getting for the amount you’re used to spending.

“When you work with us, you control the data, the money you spend, the number of dials, and everything else.”

In short: There are some issues with inbound prospecting. Even though it is fairly scalable and can be a good supplement to your overall plan for lead generation, it won’t be enough on its own.

That’s why we at 1000 Calls A Day focus on outbound prospecting. We know how difficult it can be to sit on the phone for hours on end, so we’ve made it so that you don’t have to. We have made outbound prospecting completely scalable. When you work with us, you control the data, the money you spend, the number of dials, and everything else. 

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are interested in scheduling a free consultation, then feel free to give us a call, send us an email, or visit our website: www.1000callsaday.com. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

People always ask us whether we set appointments for our clients. The truth is that this task isn’t part of what we do.

Our goal as a business is to go after cold traffic so that we can dig up and pre-qualify leads for you. We generate warm leads and then pass them on to you, but not before making sure that they’re a good prospect. This allows your inside sales staff to get right to work on setting appointments and scaling your business.  

There are a couple of reasons why we don’t set appointments. The biggest reason is that we want you and your staff to be able to pre-qualify each lead for yourself before going on a meeting with them.

Also, because we’re calling cold traffic, certain leads may be interested but not ready to commit in the near future. It would, therefore, be better for you to put these leads into your CRM and then nurture them until they’re ready.

“We aren’t appointment setters—we are outbound prospectors who find warm leads and pass them back to you.”

Your time is valuable, and we know you’re busy. We don’t want you to go on appointments with leads who aren’t entirely qualified or ready to move forward. In short, we aren’t appointment setters—we are outbound prospectors who find warm leads and pass them back to you.

If you’re interested in scaling up your outbound prospecting, visit our website www.1000callsaday.com to learn more.

And, as always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

A lot of people want to know what kind of conversion rate they can expect when working with us. Here’s the thing: We don’t have the ability to track all of our clients’ results. We’re required to report back to you, so we report our numbers and our analytics. However, our clients don’t always report their numbers back to us regarding their sales and profits. We try to help people track their numbers, but we can’t require clients to send them to us. 

For the purposes of this article, I’m going to discuss conversion rates with real estate clients. We have hundreds of campaigns in this arena so we know pretty well what these numbers should be.

On average, we’re making between 450 and 750 calls per day. Of those calls, a good contact rate is about 5%. That equates to about 25 to 40 people per day. On an average day, we know the conversion rate depending on the list or type of data you’re using. Here are the best kinds to use.

The first and best is propensity data that you buy from a data company—specifically, the kind of data where you can get very specific with these numbers and even have the data company add a “most likely to sell” filter. If we have a list like this, there’s a good chance that 10% of those people are going to become leads.

“A good contact rate is around 5%.”

The second-best is the low-hanging fruit in the real estate world, including for sale by owners, expireds, canceleds, and withdrawns. Of the people we talk to on this kind of list, we’re able to convert about 8% of them to leads.

Next on the list is other propensity-type data that you don’t have the ability to add your criteria in to. The likelihood of converting those people to leads is about 6%.

Finally, we have straight neighborhood data. There are no filters or other indicators on it. This cold traffic only leads to about a 1% to 2% conversion rate.

If you go through these numbers and calculate them out, you see that the best data source, by far, is that propensity data with additional filters to your exact criteria.

I hope this was helpful. If you’re interested in talking with us about how we can help you scale your outbound prospecting and grow your business, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Here at 1000 Calls A Day, we can pretty much run any type of outbound prospecting campaign that you’d like us to. A campaign is simply a fancy name for a script and a list. If you have a script and a list that go together, that’s a campaign.

Most of the clients that hire us have anywhere from three to five outbound prospecting campaigns going on at once. We can track the numbers and analytics of each one of these campaigns so that you know where you’re getting your leads, see which campaigns are working, and are advised on where you should be spending your time.

In the real estate world, there are a lot of different options when it comes to campaigns. We can run campaigns for FSBO, expired/withdrawn, just listed/just sold, open houses, database reengagement, and more. If you’re an investor, we can go after different types of distressed properties, foreclosures, tax liens, and anything else you can get a list and a script for.

“Most of the time, you don’t even need a script because we already have one ready.”

The beauty of it is that you really don’t need to put a script together most of the time. We have hundreds of scripts that our clients are using around the country and we can borrow the best-performing ones and use them for you.

We can also call your database. This includes old customers, clients and prospects who you haven’t talked to in a while. We can re-engage with them, get updated contact information, and announce something to them that you want them to know or an offer.

As you can see, the possibilities are pretty much endless when it comes to running campaigns and scaling your outbound prospecting. If you have any questions for us in the meantime or you’re interested in working with us, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email today. We’d love to hear from you soon.

        <title>The Reason Why We Don’t Give Exclusive Calling Rights</title>

        <description>

Today I’m answering a question we often hear from prospective clients: “Do I get exclusive calling rights in my area?”

This is a common question because Realtors and other business owners want to know if they have a competitor that has already hired us in their city.

We don’t give exclusive rights to any one area and here’s the reason why: We’re calling based on your data, not theirs. We’ll certainly tell you if we’re working with someone in your industry or in your city, but you don’t need exclusive rights to your area if you’re working with us because you’re providing the data to us to do the calling.

“Since you own your data and your competitors don’t, exclusive rights don’t really matter.”

If you are the first person who is scaling up outbound prospecting in your area and you hire us, it’s definitely a competitive advantage. However, we do have multiple clients in the same market and exclusive calling rights have never been an issue.

If you have any questions or you’re interested in scaling up your outbound calling, give us a call or send us an email today to see if we could be a fit together. We would love to hear from you.

        <title>How to Know Which CRM Is Right for You</title>

        <description>

People ask me all the time which CRM they should use, and to answer this question, I say that the best CRM is the one you will actually know how to use and use regularly. 

A lot of CRMs do many amazing things, but if you don’t know how to use them or you’re not comfortable with them and you can’t take advantage of all of their features, they’re worthless. If you want to grow your business, just find one that has automation attached to it and has functions that you’ll actually use to grow your business. 

In case you’re wondering, there are many CRMs out there, but we’re not married to any single one. A lot of people also usually want to know if we work through your CRM and put leads into it, and the answer depends on your CRM. Certain CRMs do have integration. The calling software we use on a daily basis is called Five9, and there are certain CRMs that will integrate directly with that so all the leads go automatically into your CRM

There’s another method that’s more common, though, and it’s one that most of our clients use. They’ll attach an email address to the CRM, and any email that gets sent to that address is then pulled into your CRM and classified as a certain type of lead. 

“There are many CRMs out there, but we’re not married to any single one.”

Additionally, we make sure to send all of our leads through a web form. As soon as the VA fills in all the information, gets the lead, and pre-qualifies it, you get an email alert that tells you about that lead and gives you all its information. That information either goes directly into your CRM or gets pulled into it. 

Some people don’t want this, though. Some would rather make their inside sales team take that lead, call them, and then manually put them into the CRM. 

We use Infusionsoft as our CRM but, again, it doesn’t matter which one you use. You just need to find one that’s affordable and has features you’ll consistently use on a daily basis. 

If you’re interested in working with us, head on over to our website and sign up for a free coaching call so we can talk about your business and see if it’s a fit for us to help you scale up your outbound prospecting and make more money. 

If you have any more questions about this topic or there’s anything else we can help you with, feel free to call or email us anytime. We’d love to help you.

        <guid>https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/Jessica+Sanders+1000CallsADay/2018/1000+Calls+A+Day-+How+to+Turn+a+No+into+a+Yes.mp4</guid>
        <description>

If you have a big team with designated lead follow-up, here’s a strategy to help you turn a “No” into a “Yes.”

Every day, our outbound callers are hard at work prospecting, typically making between 450 to 750 calls. On average, depending on the campaign, we get about 5% of those people on the phone. Most of them will say they’re not interested, but another 5% or so will say that they are interested. Those are the people we pre-qualify and send to you to follow up with, set appointments, and make sales.

“This is an advanced strategy and it’s not for everyone, but it just might work for you.”

What about the other 20, 30, or 40 people we talk to on a daily basis who say they aren’t interested, though? We can send you these recorded calls so someone on your team can listen to them and see if any of them might be on the fence or if there was anything the VA missed. VAs are great outbound prospectors, but they don’t know the real estate market like you and your team do. It’s possible that one or two of these people was a prospect but the VA simply didn’t know the additional advanced questions to ask. 

This is an advanced strategy and it’s not for everyone, but it just might work for you. 

If you’d like to talk more about this strategy or you’re interested in working with us, don’t hesitate to call us or visit our website. We’d love to help you.

        <title>What ROI Can You Expect for an Outbound Calling Campaign?</title>

        <description>

When you put an outbound calling campaign in place, what is a realistic return on investment (ROI) that you can expect? 

Before we can talk about that, you’ll first need to understand your business’ numbers so that you have an idea of what could be considered realistic. Conservatively, it’s very realistic for us to create 400 leads for you in a year; we have a lot of people in the industry for whom we’re getting 40 to 60 leads per month.

When you hire us, it can take about four to six weeks to get the caller started, but let’s say that you’ve hired us today and we get you 400 leads over the next 12 months. These leads are pre-qualified, and are coming from people who say they want to speak to a Realtor to help sell their home. These leads will be better than your traditional internet leads; these people actually want to talk to you.

Of those 400 leads, your ROI will hinge on your closing rate. Suppose that you can lose one out of 20 of those leads over the next year; now we’d have to know what your average commission is per deal. Let’s pretend your average is $5,000 per deal.

“In general, if you want to figure out what you could expect, just run an assumptive scenario in which we get you 400 qualified leads in one year.”

If you close 20 deals in a year with a $5,000 gross commission, that amounts to $100,000. Now let’s factor in our fee, which is about $1,850 per month, along with some additional fees: sometimes, experienced callers get a slight raise, you might also have to purchase data, and there may be other minimal fees included.

Let’s just say, conservatively, that you’ll spend $30,000 a year on your entire outbound calling campaign. Subtracting that from the $100,000 commission you made, you have $70,000. That’s over a 200% return—for every dollar you put into your outbound calling campaign, you’re roughly making $2.50.

We can’t give you the exact ROI for your outbound calling without your numbers—it varies based on how good you are at closing deals, how good the data is, and other variables. In general, if you want to figure out what you could expect, just run an assumptive scenario in which we get you 400 qualified leads in one year. We can reverse engineer the scenario and help you figure out what you could expect for an ROI.

If you have any questions or would like help with your estimation, I would love to set up a time to speak with you. We can work together to see if we would be a good fit to help you set up an outbound calling campaign in your business, helping you get more leads and grow your business.

        <description>

What do our VAs actually sound like on the phone? That’s one of the most common questions that we hear from prospective clients. They want to know if our callers sound professional, if they have a thick accent, etc. 

As you’ll see, our callers speak English very well. Anybody we hire has to have at least three to five years of experience in an English call center. We hire all of our callers out of the Philippines, the No. 1 market in the world for English-speaking call centers outside of the U.S.

“I hope you enjoyed this sneak peek into what our VAs actually sound like.”

Starting at 0:56 in the video above, you can see for yourself just how fantastic and professional our Virtual Assistants sound on the phone. I hope you enjoy this sneak peek into the outbound calls that we are making on a daily basis. 

If you like what you see and you’re interested in working with us, fill out this form so we can set up some time to talk with you about our services, including how we can help you scale your outbound prospecting and grow your business. We hope to hear from you soon.

        <description>

Today we are going to talk about why we prefer using Five9 as a professional dialer over Mojo and other products. Mojo is great and a lot of our clients use it, as do many people who are successful in real estate, but we use Five9 instead. Here are a few reasons why.

Five9 ensures that we are fully compliant for our clients. It is illegal to call cell phones through a three-line dialer, like Mojo, which can be a problem when a lot of our leads are cell phone numbers. Five9 allows us to switch to a single-line setting so that we are compliant when calling cell phone numbers.

“Five9 helps us track our callers better and get better results for our clients.”

Additionally, Five9 has a lot more tracking features. When managing hundreds of callers on a monthly basis, we want to have data that shows that our callers are getting our clients the results that they deserve. We can track how much they are on a call, how long they are taking notes between calls, and more. This helps us get the most out of our callers, which will allow us to get the best results for you.

There are a ton of great calling softwares out there, but we are sticking with Five9. It has allowed us to see much better results for our clients and has helped us monitor and manage our callers much better.

If you are interested in scaling up your outbound calling, we would love to hear from you. If you have any questions for us in the meantime, please feel free to give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

We are very insistent that our clients have a solid follow-up nurture campaign for the leads we give to them. It is one of the ingredients for getting the best ROI by hiring us. Today I want to share four pieces to that campaign that are essential:

1. Automation. It is great to have a CRM, but you need to have automation, too. It does not have to be anything terribly sophisticated, but you need to have some email sequences that automatically go out to your nurture clients.

2. Multiple contact points. There needs to be variety in the way you reach out in the form of emails, text messages, phone calls, and more. Direct mail may be a little more expensive, but it is great to consider doing at least a few times per year.

3. Add value. You need to give prospects something that tells them you are the authority they should work with. You do not want to be nagging them, but you want to give them content that educates and nurtures them. No matter the avenue you choose, make sure you’re giving them your best stuff.

“There needs to be variety in the ways you reach out.”

4. A CRM that triggers tasks. Automation is fantastic and super important, but your sales team should be following up with prospects via phone call and text message as well.

These things sound simple enough, but I talk with successful team leaders who do not have these things in place. If they did, they would be even more successful. A great nurture is going to drastically increase your ROI from working with us.

If you have any questions for us or want to sign up for a free consultation to see if we could be a fit together, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

At 1000 Calls A Day, we have an entire team of people who can help you with your outbound calls. We have experience running outbound campaigns and looking at the numbers to help you understand how to get better results.

There is so much more than just making calls that goes into a successful outbound calling campaign. We recruit, test, train, and hire outbound callers for you.  We do all of the work! However, we also handle all of the daily execution and tracking of of your outbound calling campaigns.  We have a team of experts who track all of the analytics very carefully. We use this data to constantly make adjustments and improve the performance of your campaigns. 

We can monitor the quality of the data that you purchase, the performance of the person making the calls, the calling scripts, and all other potential variables. This requires advanced technology and a team of people. We handle all of this for you, and it would be nearly impossible for you to do this on your own. In this video we walk you through some of the detailed analytics that we track for you on a daily basis. 

Many people do not understand how this works, though, so I thought that I would show you with the help of my colleague, Amber. I have included timestamps to make it easier for you to jump around to the parts of the  you are most curious about.

        <description>

One of the questions I get all the time is, “What is your definition of a lead?” Obviously, we spend several hours per day calling cold traffic, but we don’t want to give our clients cold leads. We want to give them warm leads, so here’s what defines a good lead for us:

1. They have to say that they want to talk to you.

2. They have to talk about the value of their home. Whether they’re curious about what it is or they think they know what it is.

3. They have to talk about the condition of their home. We want to know what kind of condition the property is in.

4. They need to specify their time frame. What’s their motivation? When do they want to move? 

“They must provide their best contact information and confirm their address.”

5. They must provide their best contact information. If they aren’t ready to do business right away, we can still drop them into a nurture campaign if we have their contact information.

6. They must confirm their address. We want to make sure that they are who they say they are and that they are the decision maker in the home.

7. They must expect to be contacted. We will confirm the best times to call them and pass that lead on to our client.

In doing these things, we feel that we’re passing better leads to our clients than most other sources are. These people aren’t making up contact information or just trying to get us off the phone, they’re telling us that they want to speak with us and that they are interested in buying or selling a home. 

That’s how we define a lead and this has been working well for many of our clients. If you have any questions for us or you’re interested in talking to us about helping you scale your outbound prospecting, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email anytime. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <title>Want to Maximize Your ROI With Us? You Must Have These 5 Things</title>

        <pubDate>2018-05-31 13:53:11 -0500</pubDate>
        <guid>https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/Jessica+Sanders+1000CallsADay/2018/1000+Calls+A+Day-+5+Things+You+Must+Have.mp4</guid>
        <description>

There are five things you must have in place before you hire 1000 Calls A Day in order to maximize your return on interest (or ROI). So, without further ado, let’s take a look at these important prerequisites. 

1. You must have a team of people. It will be very difficult for a single agent, a single salesperson, or a small business owner to achieve a high level of ROI with us. This is because we are going to bombard you with leads. The average Realtor we work with gets about 40 to 50 pre-qualified leads per month. On top of all the other things you are responsible for as a professional, handling these leads would be very difficult to do alone. If you do not have a strong team of people to help you handle the resources we provide you with, you may become overwhelmed by the high volume of leads. 

2. You must have a designated lead follow-up person. Allocating someone within your team to this role can make the process of dealing with leads much more efficient. It is important to task someone with handling leads as they come in, correctly placing them into your CRM, setting appointments on behalf of you and your team members, and putting leads within the appropriate nurture sequence if they aren’t ready to do business right away.

“Those willing to invest in us long-term will see amazing results as time goes on.”

3. You must have a CRM. Tracking the leads we send you will be critical. You must be able to organize them in a system that will tell you when to follow up, where the lead is in the sales cycle, and more. 

4. You must have automation. CRMs are great, but to maximize your ROI when working with us you will also need to be sending out automated forms of contact. Things like automated email and automated texts present an opportunity to share something of value with your leads. This helps you connect with your leads. Additionally, it shows them that you are knowledgeable and worth working with. Mailers are another method of automated lead follow-up you may employ. Though, not everyone pursues this option these days and should be done less frequently than other forms of contact.

5. You must have (at least) a 12-month marketing budget. We have clients who are fortunate enough to make great deals in their first couple months of working with us that result in sufficient funds to pay outbound prospecting expenses for the rest of the year. Most people, however, should expect to break even for the first six to 12 months. It is important to realize, though, that those willing to invest in us long-term will see amazing results as time goes on. 

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are interested in working with us, feel free to give us a call, send us an email, or visit our website: www.1000CallsADay.com. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

What gives our clients the best results? Here are a few of the common denominators.

Today we’re going to talk about the two best ways to get better results from your outbound prospecting.

The first thing you need to understand is that the prospect list that you’re putting into the system matters. Not all data is created equally. Certain data is more valuable, and it will absolutely play a role in the results that you get. When you work with us, we use a company called Exact Data, who has done a great job with predictive analytics to help our clients purchase data (prospect lists and contacts). Predictive analytics can actually give us an idea of if a person is right for you. After we go through hundreds of different data points to come up with your perfect client, they can further classify that list with predictive analytics.

“Having great data makes this process easier and more profitable.”

Having great data makes this process better and, in turn, makes you more money and gets you more leads.

The second thing you need to know is that a nurture campaign is essential. Once we start bringing you these strong leads, we’re passing them on to you. However, maybe they aren’t ready to do business quite yet. That’s why there needs to be a nurture campaign in place. It could be with a CRM, a text message campaign, or follow-up phone calls. The bottom line is that you need to have something in place. Once you bring a prospect into your funnel, it’s important to stay in touch with them so that you are top of mind when it comes time for them to hire someone. Having a solid campaign will help you close business and your ROI will go through the roof in year two. If you’re nurturing your leads properly, your ROI should increase every year.

If you’re curious about what a great nurture campaign looks like, we have one that we can send on over to you. If you want a copy or if you have any other questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <title>What Does Our Startup Process Look Like?</title>

        <description>

Our startup and hiring processes are detailed for a few reasons. Here they are.

Today we wanted to answer a few questions we hear all the time: “What is your startup fee?” “What does the process of hiring a VA look like?” and “How long does it take to get started?”

As a business owner, it can be extremely frustrating and time-consuming to hire somebody. If you’re hiring a regular employee, there is way more money and responsibility involved. That’s why it’s our goal to have you hand this VA work off to us and we’ll handle it completely from start to finish.

We have a staff of recruiters that are out there right now recruiting the top talent in the Philippines. We search for talent here because they generally speak great English, and there are a large number of prospects to choose from.

We see hundreds of resumes each day and sift through them ourselves. You probably don’t have the systems and processes in place to be able to do this yourself. That’s where we come in.

Once we find a candidate that meets our strict criteria, we bring them in for basic testing. If they pass that, we then bring them into an intense, two-week training program. Once they go through this, they have to test out of the program in order to show that they’re fully qualified for this job.

“They will know your business, your team, and your market inside and out.”

Finally, we put them on the phones for a week or two to see how they do on the job. We closely monitor their performance throughout. If they pass all of our training and tests, we invite them to come on board and we hire them for one of our clients.

If you were trying to replicate this process on your own, it would be nearly impossible. With our help, we can put candidates through this process, pick out three or four of the best-suited candidates for you, and share their video resumes with you. Then you can determine if any of them would be a good fit for your business.

The recruiting, resume sifting, candidate interviews, and testing are all included in our startup fee. We will also specifically train each VA for your company. They will know your business, your team, and your market inside and out. Additionally, we will get your technology set up.

The reason our process is so detail-oriented is that we want to hire the right talent every time. The startup process can take up to four to six weeks as a result. In the long run, following this process can save you a ton of time and money and ensure we get you the best VA caller who can get you the best leads.

If you have any questions for us or want to learn a little more about what we do, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

All of the advantages you get from hiring us instead of a VA caller add up to you having more time to call leads and grow your business.

Why use 1000 Calls a Day instead of hiring a VA caller directly? Your decision ultimately depends on your situation and your budget, but there are certain advantages that come with hiring us and letting us handle the process from start to finish.

While we’re certainly not the cheapest, if you go to a site like Upwork.com or another virtual assistant site and hire a caller for $5 to $8 an hour, you’ll have to train that person, put all the technology in place, manage the campaigns, handle all of the troubleshooting, etc. It’s a vigorous, frustrating process, and it can take you away from your core competency and your most important revenue-producing activities. It’s our job to take that off your plate and help you generate leads.

The first advantage is we can go out and get better talent for you. We have full-time recruiters out there looking at 200 to 400 resumes a day. We test our VAs to make sure they’re legitimate, and we bring them up to speed with our testing processes. You don’t have to do any training either. We take care of all the scripts and campaigns ourselves.

Second, we take the risk of losing an employee off your plate. Oftentimes, you can hire an employee, train them, spend a ton of time with them, only to have them leave in a couple months and make you start all over again. We, on the other hand, can replace the VA should they decide to leave.

“We take other tasks and processes off your plate so you can focus on calling leads.”

Additionally, we manage that VA for you. We have one supervisor for every 10 callers we manage, so our supervision of the caller involves helping them with the analytics and making sure they’re doing the right things. Our supervisors are also listening in on calls and giving the callers feedback and coaching on how to improve.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, you get a whole team of people. In addition to the caller and the supervisor, you get access to our executive staff who have a lot of experience managing outbound calling campaigns. It’s important to be able to put the data and/or prospects into the system and write or tweak the scripts, but what happens if the campaigns aren’t performing? We have over 100 callers we’re currently managing, so we can look at the exact same campaigns with other people around the country and compare your results. If your results aren’t meeting our expectations, we know that something needs to change, and we have the expertise to do that.

Our goal is to get you 40 to 50 pre-qualified leads on a monthly basis so you can convert those leads into more business and make more money.

If you have any further questions about how we can put an outbound prospecting campaign in place an help you grow your business, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to speak with you.

A common question clients ask me is: Where do we get our list to call? There are actually two options I want to talk about.

A common question clients ask me is: Where do we get our list to call?

There are actually two options I want to talk about. Most people are familiar with purchasing access to expired, canceled, or withdrawn listings. But there’s also a way you can purchase premium lists to get better results.

That being said, you are going to pay a premium rate for those lists. Depending on the type of list and the amount you’re purchasing, these can run anywhere from seven cents to 30 cents per record.

Premium lists will help you weed through to find people who are the most likely to sell their home in the next 12 months.

If you give us access to your expired service, we’ll pull from that list every two weeks. That way, your virtual assistant can give them a call.

However, we don’t want to contact any brand-new expired listings. Those homeowners are getting anywhere from 60 to 70 phone calls a day in some markets. We don’t want to compete with that.

We want to pick up calling where other agents have stopped. After that point we’re persistent, but aren’t going to be calling the same neighborhood multiple times per day or week.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Here at 1000 Calls A Day, how do we keep our remote employees accountable?

Since most of our employees work remotely, I want to explain how we keep our virtual assistants accountable and help them with their time management.

First of all, we have a workforce monitor. We just hired our second workforce monitor, and she is amazing. She is in charge of all tech support for our auto dialer and sending performance audits to our clients every month.

All of our clients and VAs also have a Google chat thread running. The VA uses the chat to clock in for the day, and we keep track of their breaks from there, depending on which auto dialer we use. If you use some of the professional call center software, then the VA has to insert a reason code if they want to pause the auto dialer for any reason. For example, they can enter codes in for a huddle session, coaching session, or restroom break.

Unfortunately, there are times when a virtual assistant goes MIA. When that happens for the first time, we issue a verbal warning. If it happens a second time, the VA will be removed. We do not tolerate employees that aren’t accountable virtually. It’s a very fine line that you have to run.

The management staff has their own chat thread where they keep in touch with one another, team leaders, and the operations staff. They let us know if someone has texted or called in because they are going to be late.

“In the event of a hurricane or typhoon, I will let you know why your VA isn’t available.”

Sometimes, a large-scale event like a typhoon or earthquake can make VAs unavailable. If that happens, I will personally go on our Facebook page and email all of our clients to let you know that some of their VAs might be affected by this event.

That’s how we keep everyone accountable at 1000 Calls A Day. If you have any other questions or would like to learn more about 1000 Calls A Day, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

What is the best way to build predictable revenue? According to one of my favorite books, it all boils down to systematizing your sales process.

“Predictable Revenue” is a fantastic book by Aaron Ross and Marylou Tyler. I recommend it to all of my clients. One of the main lessons I’ve learned from this book is how to systematize your sales process.

If you want to grow your business exponentially, you need to delegate certain duties and replace yourself in certain roles.

For example, if you don’t like prospecting, hire someone to do that for you. Not into lead follow-up? Find someone to take care of that for you. That way, you can dedicate all of your time to meeting with clients and closing deals.

Your lead follow-up system should be systematized to the point where it reads like a recipe.

A lot of clients have trouble letting go of managing every part of the sales process. However, it’s important that you trust your team members and hire people who will do the things you don’t like to really well. Look for a detail-oriented person who complements you.

If you don’t like cold calling and finding new opportunities, or you don’t enjoy following up with leads, find someone who is really good at following instructions and systematizing their day.

Again, it can be difficult for you to delegate at the beginning. However, once you see your calendar stacked with appointments and your business starts doubling—or even tripling—it will get easier.

“We’ll handle outbound prospecting so you can focus on growing your business.”

When you work with 1000 Calls A day, we handle the outbound prospecting for you. We call thousands of numbers a week to get those verbal opt-ins to add to your sales pipeline. I always recommend that you hire one person inside your office to take care of the lead follow-up. They will be more focused and able to convert leads at a higher level than you could on your own.

Ultimately, systematizing your sales process will give you more time to do what you do best.

If you have any questions or would like to learn more about 1000 Calls A Day, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

What’s the difference between a VA and an ISA? Can’t one person handle both duties?

What is the difference between a virtual assistant, also known as your dedicated outbound prospector, and an inside sales agent?

I speak with a number of business owners who think that it’s best to combine the ISA and the VA role. However, there are a few reasons why that’s not the best idea.

It’s very common for people to get VAs and ISAs mixed up, but they are actually two very different roles.

Some business owners want to do their own lead follow up while producing, and others want the VA to handle lead follow up for them.

The problem is, neither of those options are sustainable if you want to systematize your sales process and create predictable revenue.

“Your VA will identify opportunities to keep your ISA busy.”

When you do lead follow up on your own or have your VA handle it, there is usually a point of diminished returns about three to six months later. Why? Your prospector isn’t prospecting because they do lead follow up 90% of the time, or you’re not doing your lead follow up because you would rather be out in front of consumers to grow your business.

In order to truly systematize your sales process, you need these two separate roles. VAs will identify the opportunity, add it to your sales pipeline, find the motivating fact, get them to verbally opt-in to be contact by an agent, and market-qualify the lead.

Your ISA is the person who spends the bulk of their time on the phone with your leads, teeing them up so that you can sign a contract with them.

The ISA’s job is to build rapport. They spend more time with your leads than anyone else in the sales process. I always recommend that our clients have an ISA in the office responsible for nurturing, educating, and converting leads. At 1000 Calls A Day, we take care of adding new opportunities to your pipeline and keeping your ISA busy.

If you have any other questions or would like to learn more about 1000 Calls A Day, just give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!

        <description>

We put our virtual assistants through rigorous screening to ensure that we only provide the best help to our clients. Out of every 60 applicants, only about five will pass our test.

How do we at 1000 Calls A Day find the best virtual assistants for our clients?

First of all, we hold our applicants to a very high standard of quality. Out of the 60 applications we receive every day, only about five typically make it past this initial screening.

From there, we show the remaining applicants what to expect out of a typical day-in-the-life of one of our virtual assistants. By showing them what to expect, giving them basic scripts and roleplay assessments, as well as having them shadow our tenured virtual assistants, we do all we can to ensure that they are fully equipped to do the most for our clients.

“We truly only take the best applicants to work for our clients.”

Once applicants have made it this far, we like to make sure that they have updated software and computer systems as well as a stable Internet connection.

They then move on to a more difficult segment of our roleplay assessment. After they pass that, they become one of our virtual assistants.

We truly only take the best applicants to work for our clients.

To learn more about how to grow your business, or if you have any questions, feel free to give us a call or email. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

How do we measure success at 1000 Calls A Day?

First of all, we want each one of our virtual assistants to pass over 40 to 60 nurturing opportunities a month to their clients. Our goal is to build you a balanced sales pipeline so that you have a ladder portfolio filled with opportunities to create predictable income. To achieve that, we are consistently adding short-term, mid-term, and long-term nurtures to your pipeline.

If you need to add more short-term or long-term nurtures to your sales pipeline, just reach out to us. We are in constant communication with our clients so that we can consistently add the leads you need to keep your income predictable. For example, if you need more short-term nurtures, then we will call more expireds.

“Our goal is to build you a balanced sales pipeline.”

One of the surest ways our clients can see ROI is to add additional VAs to your team to maximize that effort.

We also make sure we keep our VAs extremely happy, but we’ll go into more detail on that later. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

What happens when your virtual assistant identifies an opportunity or a lead for your sales pipeline?

First of all, your VA will send you an email. Depending on the dialing system you choose to work with, that email is either sent out automatically or your VA will pause their dialer and manually send you an email. Either way, you get an immediate, real-time notification that a lead has been identified.

We also share a Google Sheet with you to keep track of every lead that you get once you start the program. These sheets start out basic but as the system and the program mature, they can get pretty complicated. You can integrate the Google Sheet with your ISA or inbound lead follow up person, who can then provide feedback to your VA within the spreadsheet.

What happens if you don’t have a CRM? You can use the tracker we provide as a rudimentary way to utilize and work the leads like you would in a CRM. However, we definitely recommend that you get a CRM as soon as possible to streamline your follow up process.

We definitely recommend getting a CRM as soon as possible.

Our VAs also send you a daily report explaining what they did for you that day and list your leads at the bottom of the email.

So, after your VA identifies a lead, you will get an immediate notification, the VA will add the lead to your Google Sheet, and your VA will make a list of all of the leads they identified in their daily report.

If you have any other questions about this process or if you would like to learn more about 1000 Calls A Day, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would be happy to help you!

Are you investing in quality data? I cannot encourage you to do this enough.

I have a great partner, Cole Resource Realty, that provides lists for circle prospecting. These lists of landlines are only about $400 for the year. You can use these lists for your circle prospecting, just listed or just sold calls, or any of your basic prospecting campaigns that you need to run in order to build long-term nurtures for your sales pipeline.

Keep in mind that those are long-term nurtures, most of which will take six to 18 months before they come to fruition.

Think of circle prospecting as your post-workout shake or protein bar: it’s good, but it’s not dinner. If you want to build more immediate business, then you need to invest in quality data.

“You need to invest in quality data.”

I have great relationships with a company that provides predictive analytics, which tells you who is most likely to sell their home in the next 12 months.

On the call, you would still use your script for circle prospecting. The difference is that we have mathematical proof that these prospects are more likely to sell their home than the people you call in random neighborhoods.

You do have to buy these numbers in blocks of 25,000 to get the best price. These lists run about $2,000 to $2,500, depending on the type of list your are building. Still, this is a great way to add short-term leads to your sales pipeline.

Ultimately, circle prospecting and cold calling are great techniques to build your business. However, if you want to fast-track your ROI, you need to invest in quality data.

If you have any questions about where to get quality data, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>Friends and clients,

What does time management look like at 1000 Calls A Day? How do we keep our employees accountable?

Since most of our employees work remotely, we have a workforce monitor on our team. Wanie uploads and scrubs lists into autodialers, pulls recordings, and assists our VAs if they have technical issues with their dialers. She also pulls productivity reports to make sure that our VAs are online when they are supposed to be.

We also use daily huddles, coaching calls, and weekly client check-ins to keep track of our VAs. Not only that, our VAs are in constant communication via a chat thread. Each team and each client has their own chat thread in Google Hangouts.

There is a management chat thread that keeps track of whether or not people have logged in. For example, one of our VAs recently changed shifts; if he forgets and logs in according to his previous shift, his manager will let the other managers know in the chat thread. If VAs need to log out of their dialer, there are certain codes they can enter so the managers know why the VA is offline.

Of course, sometimes VAs are simply MIA. If we cannot get ahold of them once, they get a verbal warning; if it happens again, they are fired. Time management is especially important when you have remote employees, and we have honed our system to keep our VAs accountable.

If you have any questions or would like to learn more about 1000CAD, register here or reach out to me with any questions you may have. I look forward to hearing from you!
