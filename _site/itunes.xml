Take a look around our historic city with the amazing Tours of Tulsa.

Tulsa looks awesome on Tours of Tulsa! I’m excited to talk with Kelly and learn all about the amazing things they do down here, and I mean down here, in an underground tunnel. Recently, our team did a little tour, and we had the best time in downtown Tulsa. We wanted to talk to Kelly so that she could share what they do here.

How’d you start this business? Tell us all about it.

My name is Kelly Gibson, and I’ve been touring in town now for 15 years. I have not always had the pleasure of owning my business, but it was in 2013 that I was fortunate enough to buy the tour company. Then I hired and trained six tour guides that work for me. We’re doing all types of tours on a daily basis.

This city is so rich in history; we have beautiful history in Tulsa. We also have history that’s not beautiful, but it’s our responsibility to tell all of it because our history is who we are in Tulsa.

What are some of the most popular, or your favorite, buildings or things to feature on the tours?

Our most popular, most requested tour happens to be a walking historical art deco tunnel tour. A lot of people think we’re just going to be walking through the bowels of downtown Tulsa, but that tour is rich with history and many stories. We love that tour, and it lasts for an hour. However, if you’d like an hour and a half or even two hours, we can walk for that long.

&#8220;Our history is who we are in Tulsa.&#8221;

I sure hope that so many other people can experience your tours. What’s the best way that people can find out more?

You can email us at kelly.gibson@toursoftulsa.com, give us a call at (918) 625-4909, and we have a website as well. All of our tours are private, so you can choose your best day and time and let us know how long you’d like to go.

Typically, the way that we charge for our tours is $80 per hour, but that’s not per person. That rate is good for one to 10 people on walking tours. If you have more than 10 people, we have additional guides so we can have multiple groups going at the same time. Everyone can start and end at the same time, just in smaller groups.

I love it so much; I know we’ll be looking to set up another tour here soon. Thanks to Kelly for sharing her stories! It’s so fun to learn. Their biggest goal at the end of each tour is that people will have a brand-new appreciation of the city of Tulsa.

Don’t forget to book your tours, and let us know if you need anything. Just call or email us. We’d be happy to help!

Here is how Revitalize T-Town helps low-income Tulsa homeowners. 

Today we’re talking with Jennifer Barcus-Schafer, the CEO of Revitalize T-Town. She’s done a ton to help this community, and they have an upcoming event on April 28 that sounds like a ton of fun. This organization is truly something special, so let’s get right into our conversation. 

Can you tell us a little bit about what you guys do here in Tulsa and how you give back to your community? 

Revitalize T-Town is a local nonprofit, and our goal is to make homes safe and healthy for low-income homeowners in Tulsa. We serve those in need of roofs, energy efficiency, repairs, and anything that can make their homes a healthier place to live long term. We want people to age in place and raise their families in our community. 

We know you do so much good for our families here in Tulsa, so what is the greatest need you see? Where do people need the most help? 

I would say roofs since they’re the biggest expense for a home. If you’ve never had to replace a roof, you don’t know how much of a financial burden it is. At that point, you’re hoping for a hail storm so that insurance covers the costs! Without a solid roof, everything else in the home is jeopardized, and with our severe weather, it’s especially important. 

As an organization, I know you guys work hard to garner donations and help, so is that the best way people can support you? How many families do you help, and how much does that cost? 

&#8220;Our goal is simply to keep people in their homes. &#8221;

Last year, we served 120 families in Tulsa, which equaled about 226 people. For every house we work on, the average cost is around $9,900. Some are more; some are less. It sounds crass, but our biggest need is money because that’s what ultimately gets the repairs done. With inflation and supply chain issues, we can have as many willing folks as possible, but without money, we can’t do much. 

Our business is helping people with their homeownership, and your purpose is the same; you just go about it in a different way. What is your ultimate goal? 

Our goal is simply to keep people in their homes. Just like with most people, these families’ biggest assets are their houses. Many of them inherited their places, so they might not know everything that goes into maintaining their property. If we can help them get started and educate them, we can keep them in their homes and improve their neighborhoods. 

So if people want to help you help our community, where can they find you and donate? 

We have a website with a donate button at www.revitalizettown.org, and you can also visit our Facebook page. We have an event called Raise the Roof coming up on April 28, at The Vista at 21. There will be music, food, drinks, and a beautiful view of downtown Tulsa. Also, if you or someone you know needs help, our website is a great resource to get in contact with us. 

We’d like to thank Jennifer for speaking with us once again. As always, if you have questions about anything real estate-related, please call or email us. We’re always willing to help!

1907 is a fun shop in Broken Arrow that has a little bit of everything.

Tulsa looks so good on 1907! Located at 115 E. Fort Worth St. Broken Arrow, we’re excited to be with Bree at 1907. Bree was kind enough to answer a few questions about her business for us below:

What is 1907, and what makes it unique?

“1907 is a celebration of Oklahoma, and our store is called that because 1907 is the year we became a state. Everything in the store is made locally, and we make a lot of it. We have a little bit of everything including super-soft shirts, tumblers, koozies, earrings, soaps, salsas, jams, and more.”

It looks like there’s something for everyone in all different sizes and shapes. What are some of the most popular items?

“It depends on if you’re an Okie or a transplant. We have Okie girl stuff, but you have to identify as one to want those items.”

People can also make custom items here. Besides that, what are some special features of 1907? 

“We’ve been here since 2013, which feels like forever ago. We started out with a little store and just made jewelry and bought everything else. I’ve always loved doodling, and in art school, everything I drew looked like doodles, and that’s turned into a business. 

One time I drew the Osage shield with a dreamcatcher in the background, and taking that to get printed was the coolest feeling; I took an idea, turned it into something, then turned it into items people can buy. I’m not selling expensive paintings—it’s everyday art all people can appreciate. Then I just did another and another, and my favorite part of this business is making something people can take home. If you like a design, you can get it on a t-shirt, cuff, or coaster. I love seeing the way people light up when they see something they like.”

How can people find you?

“Come by the store; we have way more here than you’ll see on our website because the in-person stuff is our specialty. However, our website is great, and you can also find us on our Instagram and Facebook page. We’re located at 115 E. Fort Worth St. Broken Arrow, OK 74012; we’re a big red barn, you can’t miss it. Bigfoot is outside, so you can take a selfie!”

We appreciate Bree sharing all of her passion and her very cute store with us. If you ever have any real estate questions, call or visit The Wolek Group website. We would love to help you.

I spoke with Nicole from Salt and Soul about her wonderful business!

Today, I’m speaking with Nicole from Salt and Soul in Coweta, Oklahoma. We had a fantastic conversation, so let’s get right into it!

I love how your business is all Oklahoma. As a native Tulsan, you know I’m all about that. So why don’t you just share who you are and what you have going on?

Yeah! Thanks for having me. We are a local boutique, and we started in May of 2020. We started solely online as a way to help businesses make the online transition. We were essentially a support group for them. We would support them on social media and create a platform where they could sell directly to consumers. We just opened our boutique in Coweta last October.

I love it so much! So it sounds like you’ve made it easier for the local consumer or visitor to find Oklahoma products. Was that your goal when you created your business?

Definitely! In the beginning, everyone was moving online, and part of our goal was to help businesses make that transition. Beyond that, we wanted to create a place where people could go buy directly from local businesses. We’ve grown from there, and we’ve really enjoyed the community that came out of it. We’ve built this great local store where you can buy nearly anything. You can get local meats, foods, shirts, gifts, and more. It’s really fun!

&#8220;Starting this journey was fun, difficult, and pretty much anything else you could think of.&#8221;

**That’s awesome! So back in October, you got your brick-and-mortar store all set up. What were some of the new challenges of being a new business owner? **

It was fun, difficult, and pretty much anything else you could think of. It’s just me coordinating everything, but I work with about 45 or 50 different companies. They’re all amazing people who have offered to help, so it’s been great. There were a lot of people I met for the first time that I’ve been working with for over a year, so that was exciting! I love it; I’m not the most creative person, so seeing the fantastic things people make and getting to put them in my store is an incredible experience.

I love it! This just warms my heart, especially since, in the last couple of years, we’ve all had to learn a new way of doing business. It seems like you were bridging this gap between local businesses and supporting them so that they could still thrive through these new and interesting times. I know they are all near and dear to your heart, but what would you say are some of your more popular items that you sell?

It changes, but the Charley Jean candles are consistently one of our more popular items. I’m not sure if you’ve ever smelled them, but they’re incredible. She uses real ingredients in her products, so the Morning Brew candle actually has coffee in it. They also don’t include any unhealthy or processed ingredients. We have a lot of bath and body products, which are really nice this time of year.

The local meats are super good as well. We have shortages in the stores sometimes, but that’s given people the opportunity to understand where their food is coming from. We have two different meat providers offering both pork and chicken, and it’s been really neat. At the end of the day, I can’t pick my favorite. Our selection is always changing, so something new will always be there.

Thanks for sitting down and talking with me; this was fantastic! How can people best find you?

You can find us on social media at Salt and Soul Market, or you can visit our website at https://saltandsoulmarket.com/. You can also visit us in person at 322 N Broadway, Coweta, Oklahoma, 74429.

I’d like to thank Nicole once again for speaking with me. As always, you can call or email me with any questions. The Wolek Group is always happy to help!

Here is the latest Tulsa market report and what it means for you.

Hey there! I just wanted to share with you all of the great things that are happening in the Tulsa real estate market. We want to be your local real estate economist of choice; we are here, we are knowledgeable, and we are in the market every day. Today I have a market report that’s fresh off the presses from our local multiple listing service. As a team, we are always monitoring and checking this report to see what is happening in the Tulsa market.

This is an amazingly detailed report, and you can find the whole document on this site. We typically like to focus on the year-over-year stats. They are going to be a snapshot of how 2021 compared to 2020. We saw huge increases in a lot of areas and huge decreases in some other areas. 

Real estate is always about supply and demand. When we have a low supply of homes for sale, the demand goes up, which also means the values go up. That is definitely what we have seen here over the last year. 

The top categories are the number of closed sales, pending sales, and new listings on the market. We had an increase in sales and pendings, but the active new listings are down over the whole year. 

A seller can price their home for whatever they like; it just may not sell for that, so we want to see what the reality is of you getting what you priced your home for. The number that tracks that is the average percent of listing price to selling price. It is now at 99.26%, so you can see that people who priced their homes at market value got that price. 

The average sales price over these last two years has continued to increase. From 2020 to 2021, there was a 15.9% increase, so while you were sitting in your property, it has appreciated almost 16% by doing nothing. Isn’t that pretty cool?

&#8220;There is a huge need for active properties!&#8221;

The other determining factor we like to look at is how long it takes to sell a home. With low supply and high demand, you can imagine that homes not only sell for more money but in a shorter amount of time. In the past, the average was at 33 days on the market, and now it is at 23 days. That is down 27%!

The months’ supply of inventory, or absorption rate, is also really important to note. This compares how long a new home would take to sell with a snapshot of everything available right now. That number is at 1.63 months, so in almost two months, everything that is currently active would sell. That again tells us that there is a huge need for active properties.

With that being said, we’re in a crunch; we need help selling homes to our buyers! We have active buyers looking for properties, but we’ve scoured the market, and all of them are either sold or not on the market yet. Maybe you have a home that you’re thinking about selling, or you might just be curious about your home’s value. We want to be here for you when you have these questions, thoughts, or even an inkling of curiosity. That’s what we’re here for!

Another cool thing about being in contact with us is that we have many agents working with buyers and sellers every day. I shared with you that active inventory is low, but we’ve already met with future sellers who are finishing up some painting or repairs and getting their homes ready for the market. We have an active pipeline of properties coming up, so if you’re interested in getting a report whenever those properties hit the market, we’d be happy to send you those. Just email or message us to get on our hot properties alert list.

Call or email us if you have questions, concerns, ideas, or any real estate needs. We’d love to speak with you!

        <description>

The Demand Project’s vitally important work of fighting human trafficking. 

What the Demand Project does for the Tulsa area community is just so amazing. We recently sat down with Kristin so that she could share what the organization is all about and why her work is so invaluable.

The Demand Project was founded due to a story Kristin heard in 2004 of a horrible incident that was recorded and shared online for others to watch. It was so awful that Kristin felt that she had to do something about it.

The organization was formed to cover the gaps in the system, help prevent sexual exploitation from happening, protect those who need it, and help victims recover when awful things do happen.

The Demand Project can hold presentations just about anywhere to help people better understand the extent and nature of the problem of human trafficking. They host an Aware Workshop that works with parents and teaches them how to keep kids safe online and out on the streets. There, you can learn how to identify and fight sexual exploitation—if you see something, then having the resources and knowledge to say something can make all the difference.

Kristin also recommends that anyone who is serious about learning how to combat these issues check out other, similar organizations like Shared Hope, the Polaris Project, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

&#8220;Having the resources and knowledge to say something can make all the difference.&#8221;

If you’d like to get involved, the Demand Project could use the extra time, money, and resources to keep up the good fight. They’re always looking for house guardians for their campus, respite care, office assistance, and much more. Visit www.TheDemandProject.org to learn more about who they are, what they do, and all the ways that you can lend a hand to keep our children safe.

And if you have any questions or would like to hear more about how you can become more active in the community to help keep the Tulsa area wonderful, don’t hesitate to give us a call at the Wolek Group. We’d love to have a conversation with you!

Here’s what Keri from SALT Yoga had to say about her fantastic business. 

Today we’re chatting with Keri from SALT Yoga about her awesome business. We’re huge fans of SALT, so we hope you enjoy this interview as much as we did!

What would you say to someone who hasn’t started their yoga journey yet? What are some of the benefits?

To just start! There are a lot of questions and mysteries around what yoga is, but my main piece of advice is don’t be intimidated. The benefits are truly endless, so there’s no reason too big or too small to walk through the doors of SALT Yoga. 

If I had to break down the main goal of yoga, it’s to reconnect with yourself. We get so caught up in our busy lives, so we want people to leave their stress behind when they come into our studio so that they can get quiet and get in touch with their bodies no matter what shape they’re in. 

One thing we really enjoy about SALT, besides the stretching and exercises, is the breathing. It’s so important for us in this busy world to do that, especially given the last couple of years. What are some things that you love about SALT specifically that other yoga studios might not do?

Since we’re a hot studio, we provide a detox experience for our clients that typical studios can’t provide. We want people to feel strong, clean, and open when they’re done, and sweating helps us accomplish this. Also, while we have restorative meditation classes for beginners, our courses can be pretty challenging. Everyone leads busy lives, so we try to get as much as we can out of the hour you have with us.

&#8220;The main goal of yoga is to reconnect with yourself. &#8221;

In our experience, all are welcome at SALT as well. It’s not intimidating or scary at all! 

Exactly; one of our biggest priorities at SALT is to cultivate a welcoming environment. I remember the first time I walked into a yoga studio I thought, “What is this mysterious place? Who are these people?” We know it can be intimidating, but we don’t want that here. 

I’d like to thank you once again for talking with us, Keri. Does SALT have anything going on that people should know about?

Yes! We always have our 10 for 10 deal for new clients. If you live in Oklahoma and you’ve never done yoga before, you can do 10 consecutive days of unlimited classes. You can get a feel for the instructors, check out meditation, and get a feel for if yoga is right for you. 

If you are interested in SALT Yoga, shoot them an email at hello@saltyogatulsa.com or visit their website at www.saltyogatulsa.com. You can also stop by 1708 Utica Square, Tulsa, OK 74114, and see what they have to offer. Finally, don’t forget you can always ask us questions about real estate, local businesses, or any other topic by calling 918-706-9845. We look forward to hearing from you!

At Board &amp; Brush, you can create the wooden masterpiece of your dreams.

Tulsa looks good on you, and it looks great on Stacy with Board &amp; Brush Creative Studio. I’m feeling the energy and excitement here, and I’m so delighted to talk to her about all the fun things about her business today!

Board &amp; Brush is a DIY paint-sip studio. They serve wine, beer, and other beverages to go along with their unique wooden art projects. Nobody has to do the same project at their workshop, unlike other sip and paint studios. Everybody gets to decide on what they want to make. 

&#8220; The possibilities are endless.&#8221;

Not only is it a fantastic place for holiday and team events, they also offer public workshops as well as private events for anniversaries, birthdays, showers, and more! When you walk into the studio, you feel inspired by all the amazing pieces lining the walls. 

At Board &amp; Brush, you can customize exactly what you want to make on your board. You’ll choose a design ahead of time, then start with raw wood. Then their instructors will walk you through how to sand, stain, stencil, paint, and finish the project. There are different stains, techniques, and over 80 colors to choose from; the possibilities are endless. 

Even if you aren’t the most artistic person, there’s something for everyone here at Board &amp; Brush. If your creation doesn’t turn out how you like, they will help you fix it or fix it for you to your liking. To learn more about Board &amp; Brush, you can head on over to their Facebook page, give them a call at (918) 615-0722, or visit their website.

If you have any other questions for me or suggestions for a future video, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Here’s why Tulsa looks great on The Succulent Shop in Broken Arrow.

Tulsa looks good on you, and it also looks good on The Succulent Shop in the Rose District of downtown Broken Arrow. I can’t wait to take you on a tour of this amazing shop today.

I’m so excited to be joined by Andrew Meredith to talk about his amazing space and how it came to be. He has a landscaping background, but it was Andrew’s wife Cassidy who actually came up with the idea after returning from her bachelorette party. You can read the full storyhere.

Their vision resulted in The Succulent Shop. It’s a fun, unique space where people can learn more about plants, how to care for them, and create customized treasures by building their own succulent masterpieces. Andrew is excited to be a tool for them. They teach new plant owners how to take care of their plants and bring in fantastic options for experienced plant people as well.

&#8220;Whatever your preference, The Succulent Shop has it.&#8221;

They’re all about DIY and cultivating a family atmosphere. There is a bar, but there are no TVs. They want families to spend time together away from the screens, come in, get their hands dirty, learn, and have a good time while doing it.

In my short period of time here, I can attest to how wonderful this place is. There are plants of all shapes and sizes. Whatever your preference, The Succulent Shop has it.

Their greatest joy so far has been bringing something brand-new to the community and seeing people respond to it. The people of Broken Arrow and surrounding areas have been fantastic, and they’re so excited to serve them.

To learn more about The Succulent Shop, visit them on Facebook, Instagram, their website, or head on down to 319 S Main St. in Broken Arrow to have a drink and find your perfect plant.

If you have any real estate questions for me, don’t forget that I’m always here to answer them. Just reach out via phone or email today.

Teresa Brockwell of Farmers Insurance talks insurance and helping her clients.

Today, we’re excited to share our conversation with a fantastic local business leader: Teresa Brockwell from Farmers Insurance! She offers so much value to her clients, but her biggest strength is maintaining strong relationships. She’ll share what she does, how she helps her clients, and much more. So we think you’ll really love this conversation if you’re interested in how insurance works. 

Teresa has been an insurance agent for over 23 years and she is a valued partner of the Wolek Group. According to her, one of the biggest trends in the industry right now is the amount of options people have with their policies. Back when she started, you only had one or two options, and if you didn’t like something, that was it. Now, there are upwards of 10 policies to choose from. This is great for consumers, but it can also lead to issues. If you don’t talk to a professional like Teresa, you could rush into a policy with some unforeseen gaps. 

If you rushed into a policy, or if you haven’t reviewed your coverage in a while, Teresa’s team will do an audit of your insurance policies free of charge. Of course, if you want a quote, she’ll give you one, and her rates are pretty great right now. There’s a good chance she can save you money, so we encourage you to reach out and see what she can do for you.

Our certified pre-owned home program helps and protects our sellers.

Imagine that you’ve made the big decision to sell your home. After some cleaning and organizing, you get your home on the market. Immediately you have many showings scheduled, which means that you must keep the house picked up and get out of your home at various times of day for potential buyers to view it. Maybe then you get multiple offers to choose between (a great problem to have), and then finally… a pending contract! Whew, that was a rush and all very exciting!

As you may have noticed, our Tulsa area real estate market still has very low inventory. This means that there is a high demand for properties. You’d think this would detract buyers from hopping into the market, however interest rates are still historically low, so it is a great time to buy as well.

With the low supply and high demand, there is a strain on the whole process of buying or selling. Quite simply, sellers may be able to get more money than they could even a year ago (in many areas 30% more), and when buyers are paying higher prices, they want homes that are in excellent condition. As you can imagine, if you were a buyer paying full asking price, likely without any concessions given by the seller, and possibly having to make a quick decision to write an offer, due to the stress of other competition for the same house, you may have some buyer’s remorse. That’s where we come in to help.

From our years of experience, we know that even though there is a contract between a buyer and seller, the deal is not done until the closing date. There are many points inside of the legally binding agreement that allow a buyer to cancel the contract or at least renegotiate terms. The Wolek Group offers an option to help protect our sellers, to ensure defects and potential issues are discovered before we put your home on the market. This eliminates the majority of the reasons that buyers cancel contracts and allows them to feel confident and comfortable with making a strong offer and then moving forward to closing.

Welcome to our Certified Pre-Owned Home Program. When you list your home with us, we will cover the cost of upfront inspections, staging, and professional photography to ensure you get to the closing table with the first contract you receive. When a contract busts due to inspections, you’d need to address any defects or at least disclose them, so why not do it in advance?

Along with covering the cost of upfront inspections, when you list with us, we also provide a free tool to help you get your home market-ready. This is a unique staging program that allows you to start pre-packing and staging your home like a professional designer. It’s easy to implement and lots of fun!

&#8220;When you list your home with us, we will cover the cost of upfront inspections, staging, and professional photography.&#8221;

Once the inspections are performed and the property is ready for professional pictures, we’ll send our photographer to document your space and show it in its best light. Then we’ll launch our strategic coming soon plan to ensure we build up lots of buyer and agent excitement while maximizing initial interest and showings. Our proven plan has helped hundreds of families move to the Tulsa area for over 20 years. We know that our professional team can help yours too!

Listing your home with The Wolek Group checklist:


  Listing consultation to establish price and marketing plan
  Certified pre-owned home inspections are performed
  Repairs or replacements are handled
  In-person or virtual staging consultation occurs
  Staging recommendations are completed
  Professional pictures and videography are taken
  Coming-soon campaign is launched
  Sign in yard with coming-soon rider is placed
  Social media posts on Instagram &amp; Facebook
  Just-listed calls to neighbors
  Postcards sent to neighborhood


Connect with us today via phone or email to learn more about how we can help get your home listed and sold! Also, reach out if you have further questions about our Certified Pre-Owned Home Program or any other real estate matter. We would love to help you.

Pastor Tim talks about the amazing work they do at the Tulsa Dream Center.

Tulsa looks good on you, and Tulsa also looks so good on Pastor Tim. I am so excited to speak with him today. He just gave us an amazing tour of his facility and talked about all of the great stuff he does for our community, so I wanted him to share with everyone who he is and what he does here:

“It’s so great to be here and be a part of this. I’m Pastor Tim, and I’m the executive director of the Tulsa Dream Center. The Tulsa Dream Center is really simple; we’re about giving hope and changing lives. We do it through five things: food, clothing, medical, education and recreation, and character development. We’re right out here on 46th and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, and our goal is to be able to serve our community all over the city, not just North Tulsa but all of Tulsa. I’d love to invite you to come out and be a part of it. We have Super Saturday every second and fourth Saturday from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. We rally at 9:15 a.m. Come out and serve our community! Whether we’re going out and doing adopt-a-block where we clean up in the neighborhood, making food boxes in the back, folding clothes, or whatever task we may have at the Tulsa Dream Center, we need your help.”

It’s been so fun getting to know Pastor Tim and this amazing organization. We talk to a lot of local nonprofits. I love our community that loves to give back. Pastor Tim helps not just our youth but also all the people in the community.

He mentioned that they serve meals, and there’s basketball, other sports, and so much engagement in classrooms. I feel his energy and love; what is the stuff that fires him up and gets him pumped every day?

&#8220;Our goal is to be able to serve our community all over the city, not just North Tulsa but all of Tulsa.&#8221;

“The people are what gets me going, but honestly, it’s what we’re able to do with our young people. With our after-school programs, we serve over 400 boys and girls every single day in three locations, whether it’s here at the Dream Center or in our remote locations.

We’re also doing something new; when I was a kid, my baseball coach was an LAPD police officer, and he made a great impact on my life. We’ve started this new program called Badges where we bring our boys and girls and the police force together in a mentorship relationship. Kind of like Big Brother Big Sister but police edition—police Dream Center edition. So it’s exciting to be able to facilitate the coming together of those two communities, especially when as those kids get older, historically there has been a wedge drawn between them and the police. So if we can bring them together by creating great relationships now, when they get older, that won’t be able to be severed.”

“We’d love for you to come on over to 200 West 46th Street N. You can also reach out to us on our website, TulsaDreamCenter.org. We’re also on social media; follow us on Instagram. We always post videos on Instagram and Facebook, and you can see all of the different things going on at the Tulsa Dream Center.”

We appreciate all they’re doing for our community. Let me know if you have questions about the Tulsa Dream Center or anything else related to real estate. I’d love to hear from you.

Chris Padley from Gateway Mortgage is here to talk all about mortgages.

I’m so excited to be here today with my friend Chris Padley with Gateway Mortgage. I wanted to feature Chris and share all the great things he does to help our clients get to the closing table with less stress and a happier experience. Chris has been in the Tulsa mortgage business for almost 20 years, so I wanted to chat about what’s going on in the mortgage world.

Feel free to watch the full message above, or use these timestamps that will direct you to various points in the video:

0:05 — Introduction to today’s topic

1:00 — Chris uses his years of experience to ensure everyone knows what’s going on throughout the process

2:35 — We’re more likely to see an interest rate increase than a home price reduction

5:35 — The best time to take advantage of the market is when it slows down

6:20 — Interest rates vary depending on the type of loan you’re getting, but they’re all great

7:10 — It’s always a good time to invest in real estate

7:50 — Wrapping up today’s topic

If you have any questions about mortgages or want to start the process, visit Chris&rsquo;s website to contact him. If you have any real estate questions or needs, call or email us at The Wolek Group. We would love to be your real estate resource.

My conversation with Morgan, the owner of Modern Cottage.

Today I want to bring you the inspiring story of a local entrepreneur. Morgan, the owner of Modern College on Cherry Street, has a surprising backstory, so I’m glad I have the opportunity to share it with you:


  “I come from a great family of business owners. My great, great grandfather opened a hardware store in Collinsville back in 1887. In those days, hardware stores had a much wider range of products and services, so he had his hands full. He was even elected mayor of Collinsville! Then the hardware store was passed down throughout the generations.

  Eventually, the hardware store was passed down to my grandparents. However, when Walmart came to town in the 80s, they were driven out of business. The hardware store had been open for 95 years, and my mother had grown up in it as a child. When the store closed, she never let go of the dream of owning her own business.


&#8220;I always tell people that if they have an entrepreneurial dream, they can make it happen.&#8221;


  When my mother retired, she achieved her dream by opening a vintage store in Owasso. I worked there as a teenager, and I knew from that moment on that I wanted to be a business owner. I held onto this dream long enough to open Modern Cottage in 2017 with my father as co-owner.

  I was inspired to open this business because I’ve always been interested in home goods. My mother was an interior designer when I was a child, and I always wanted input on my room. Opening Modern Cottage just seemed like a natural fit. I decided to open on Cherry Street because it’s such a beautiful place. It’s surrounded by a lovely community and historic buildings that add a ton of charm to the area.

  I always tell people that if they have an entrepreneurial dream, they can make it happen. All you have to do is put in the work and never lose hope. If you want to visit our store, you can find us on Cherry Street in the Colonial Building, 1325 E 15th St #106, Tulsa, OK 74120. You can always shop on our website as well at ShopModernCottage.com.”


What a great story! I appreciated speaking with Morgan today, and I loved her beautiful store. If you have any questions about today’s blog post or concerning real estate, please give me a call or shoot me an email. I am always willing to help!

        <description>

Here’s how our current market compares to that of 2020.

It’s a fun time in the real estate market, both locally and around the country. Today I’ll update you on what’s going on specifically here in the Tulsa area and show you how it compares to last year.

As you can see on the chart at 1:30 in the video above, closed listings are up 21%, pending listings are up 7%, and new listings are up 4%. The main problem, and why we’re feeling like there is a shortage of inventory, is more properties are leaving the market than are coming on the market.

The average sales price has gone up 22.72% in the last year, which is an advantage for sellers, who didn’t even have to do anything to their homes to enjoy this increase in value. Now imagine if you had some equity in your home even before 2020—you have almost 23% more! This could be a great time for you to take advantage of the inventory shortage by selling your home.

Both buyers and sellers are noticing that homes are selling faster. The average number of days a home spends on the market here in Tulsa is 24 days, which is eight days faster than at this same time last year. Additionally, the list-to-sales price ratio is currently 99%, meaning that properties are selling faster and for more money.

All this feeds into the absorption rate (or month’s supply of inventory), which is currently at 1.87. That means if no new homes came on the market, we’d sell all of what is currently available in almost two months. The lower the month’s supply is, the more the market favors sellers, which we’re definitely seeing today.

&#8220;Properties are selling faster and for more money.&#8221;

However, low interest rates are keeping many buyers in the market. Lower rates mean increased affordability, so it could make sense for you to buy a home right now. If that’s a goal you have, we’re here to help you figure out the best way to win.

If you’re thinking about selling your home, we created a Seller Rescue Plan that will help you work through the hassles of buying and selling a home at the same time. Whatever your goals are, we can help you take advantage of this rare opportunity. We don’t know how long the market is going to remain like this, but for now, we’re just helping our clients through it.

If you’re curious about the value of your home, we have a great free website called tulsahomevalue.com and you can get an overview of what’s going on in the market!

Whether you’re buying or selling, if you have any questions or need advice, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.

        <description>

This is how our Seller Rescue Plan ensures you don’t end up houseless.

You’ve heard the news (how could you miss it?): The real estate market is red-hot right now! Home values are up around 20% over last year, which could net you $50,000 more today than last year. That means now is an amazing time to sell your home and take advantage of the historic low inventory and increasing home values.

There’s just one problem—where would you go? Let’s face it; it’s a hassle to deal with making a move and figuring out all the details. That’s where The Wolek Group’s Seller Rescue Plan comes in.

&#8220;These scenarios may include moving twice to make more money today than you would have in the past.&#8221;

We’ve created a list of the three options you have as a seller, as well as some discounts from local service providers:

1. Buy first, sell later. Finding a home is more of a challenge than selling a home in today’s market. We can get you set up on a home search to see what’s out there and so we can discuss your financing options. With a loan modification, if you can qualify for both properties and have a minimum down payment, you can purchase now without a contingency and sell after your purchase is secure. If there are no homes available that fit your criteria, we have a plan in place to help promote your wants and needs to uncover off-market properties.

2. Sell now, stay put for now. With today’s listing demand, many buyers are willing to allow sellers to rent back the property after closing or set an extended closing date, which would allow you time to find your next home. This allows you to be a non-contingent buyer and have more money in the bank from the equity of your home sale to put down. That way, you’ll be a much stronger buyer in this market.

3. Sell now, move now. Now might be the time to relocate or bunk with your friends or family in order to capitalize on the increase in equity, or you could possibly move into a short-term rental. We’re continually compiling a list of options to help with this arrangement.

As you can see, these scenarios may include moving twice in order to make more money today than you would have in the past. We know that moving is hard work (especially twice), so we’ve found some available options and resources for you:


  T-Town Storage: Discount at local storage facilities to store your belongings. Get your first two months at half-price.
  Great Day Moving: Discount with a local moving company to offset some costs. Get half off your service fee of $150.
  ForRent.com: List of local short-term options, including some available in-office rentals.
  A list of utility and moving information to help expedite the process.
  A staging and design expert to help consult on furniture and belongings.
  Discounts on a home inspection and appraisal prior to listing.


If you have any questions about today’s topic or the resource list provided, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to chat with you.

        <title>5 Reasons Why Springtime in Tulsa Is So Wonderful</title>

        <description>

These are a few of my favorite things about the springtime in Tulsa.

Spring has sprung in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and the weather has been absolutely gorgeous. These refreshing and sunny days have made me begin to think about all the things I love about this season. 

First of all, I love that we get to enjoy all the different seasons here (though most of us don’t particularly enjoy the tornadoes or ice storms). The other things I love about our spring season include:

1. Flowers. Spring means that plantlife is blooming, and you can see beautiful flowers in front yards, fields, and anywhere else you look in the city. There’s so much beauty here. On top of this, Woodward Park and the botanical gardens are now open to the public, and they have tons of gorgeous flowers and blooming trees to enjoy. 

2. Shopping. I love to shop, especially at our outdoor malls. We have Utica Square, which is full of both local and big-brand stores that provide everything you could ever want. The Farm Shopping Center has also had some big updates and fun new things to check out. We also have Cherry Street and Brookside for all of your dining and boutique shopping needs.

&#8220;These refreshing and sunny days have made me begin to think about all the things I love about this season.&#8221;

3. Eating outdoors. Many of our restaurants have wonderful outdoor dining areas; with the pandemic, many restaurants had no other choice but to expand their patio seating. Now, this means we have even more places to choose from.

4. Exercising outside. Maybe your fitness goals fell by the wayside this year, but Tulsa’s beautiful spring weather provides the perfect opportunity to get outside and start working out. If you’re looking for ideas, the riverside is a great area to walk or jog while enjoying the beautiful scenery.

5. Enjoying the front porch. I just love to sit on the front patio and watch everything the city does throughout the day. It gives me time to get outside and breathe, have a happy hour, and just smile at the beautiful weather.

What do you enjoy most about our Tulsa springtime? Or are you living outside of our area and hoping to become a resident in the near future? Either way, I’d love to hear from you. And as always, I’d be happy to answer any questions you may have about buying, selling, or real estate in general. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Consider selling your home to a qualified buyer in this unique market.

Would you be willing to sell your home to one of our qualified buyers? You may have noticed that houses are selling extremely quickly in your area. That’s because we have record-breaking low inventory levels combined with historically low interest rates. Therefore, it’s a wonderful time to sell your property.

You can capitalize on your home’s increased value over the last year, and if you’re buying a new home, you may be able to buy more house for the money. It’s a win-win. We have many motivated, qualified buyers ready to buy a house but there just aren’t any properties to choose from on the market. Whether you’ve considered selling or not, this is the time to think about the huge opportunities for you and your family in the real estate market.

&#8220;We have record-breaking low inventory levels combined with historically low interest rates.&#8221;

We have plenty of ways to help you find your dream home such as negotiating a rent-back or renting a house for a while while you search for the right home. We won’t leave you hanging or wondering what to do next.

We want to help you. If you would like to have a confidential conversation about the value of your house and how you can take advantage of the current market, just give us a call or send an email. Reach out to us if you have any questions in the meantime. We would love to speak with you.

Our team is relentless in many different ways.

&nbsp;

2020 was a tough year for so many. We are blessed that we were able to safely help so many families with their real estate needs, even in a historic pandemic.

Typically, our team would be together in person, celebrating our previous year’s production with each other and our Keller Williams family. Instead, we’re still mostly operating through Zoom. I still wanted to acknowledge our amazing team’s hard work and our gratitude for all of the families who trusted us with their 2020 move.

As a team, we helped over 170 families last year, which was around $43 million in volume. We also were able to donate $20,000 to the Tulsa-area community, which we could not have done without your support and referrals.

&#8220;Our team is relentless in many different ways.&#8221;

We’re grateful for last year’s business, and you know that we are already focused on helping even more families in 2021! The real estate market is still hot. The way home values are increasing, your home may be worth more than you think. Interest rates are still low, so buyers are getting more home for their money.

We work daily to help our buyers and sellers achieve their real estate goals. We focus on listening to all their wants and needs and strive to assist them seamlessly through the sometimes bumpy process. We are also focused on following through on our 2021 word of the year, which is Relentless. We are Relentless in:


  Delivering an amazing experience for our clients
  Learning and growing
  Bettering ourselves daily
  Connecting and communicating as a team
  Purposefully achieving our goals
  Giving back to our community
  Being flexible, caring, and kind to all
  Having fun while doing what we love


Thank you for trusting us and allowing us to do what we love! If you have any questions for us or real estate needs we can assist with, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Check out our Certified Pre-Owned Home program for sellers.

Have you heard about our Certified Pre-Owned Home program? Just like how cars can be sold as a certified pre-owned car, we can do the same for our home-selling clients.

We know that deals can fall through due to certain factors that give buyers pause. That’s why, under our program, we’ll help you get a pre-inspection and pre-appraisal done to make sure your home is priced correctly in our current market and in the proper condition to sell for the most money possible. We’ll also provide a home warranty to your buyers so they can be confident your listing is ready to go and will be protected even beyond closing.

If you’d like to learn more about our Certified Pre-Owned Home program and how we at The Wolek Group ensure our sellers end up with more money in their pockets at closing, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be so happy to share this program with you.

Let's look back at the 2020 market and ahead to what you can expect in 2021.

Happy New Year! As we begin 2021, I want to congratulate you on making it through 2020. I also want to make sure you’re aware of what’s going on in the local market, so I’m sharing the most recent data with you today.

This data is from November, and the report itself was produced on December 11. It doesn’t cover the full year, but it does give us a great idea of what happened in 2020 as a whole. Although COVID made things crazy for everyone, low interest rates drove demand and we were able to help 172 families as a result.

One interesting thing to note is that although sales were down just a fraction, inventory was down by a lot more. We operate based on supply and demand, and this year, the supply was very low, and demand was very high. This clearly puts us in a seller’s market, but the low interest rates gave homebuyers more buying power than they would have had otherwise. It was a rare win-win type year for buyers and sellers alike.

&#8220;Our team was able to operate and stay connected via Zoom and other technology.&#8221;

Our low inventory drove more than just demand. The average listing price was pushed up this year, which made the average sale price go up by 20%! By not doing anything, homeowners who waited to sell from a year ago are going to put tens of thousands more into their pockets. That’s some great motivation if you’ve been on the fence about selling your home this year.

Buyers are frustrated with a lack of options, and there might be multiple buyers out there just waiting for a home like yours to hit the market. With just 2.85 months of inventory, things have tilted even more in favor of sellers.

As for the Wolek Group as a whole, we doubled our team from five to 10 members. We mostly operated and stayed connected via Zoom and other technology, and we were blessed to be able to help so many families through a time of transition and great stress. Additionally, our team’s list-to-sale price average was 99% with an average days on market of just 33. That’s more money and a shorter time on the market for our clients than the industry average.

If you have any questions about the current market or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thank you all for your support this year. We&rsquo;d like to return the favor.

2020 is almost over, and what a wild and wonky year it has been! Our business increased this year, and we are so grateful for all the families and friends who trusted us to help them with their real estate needs. We know it wasn’t easy for everyone.

&#8220;The Tulsa community has come together to help each other get through these tough times.&#8221;

Now, though, we can say that we’ve been through a pandemic together. We’ve learned a lot this year; perhaps we’ve spent way more time at home than we thought we would, and we’ve certainly become a lot more comfortable with wearing a cloth mask over our faces!

This year has hurt many people, but I’m so glad that the Tulsa community has come together to help each other get through these tough times while staying positive and productive. We at the Wolek Group have done our level best to stay true to our mission, which is to deliver an amazing client experience while giving back to our community, supporting local businesses, giving to local nonprofits, and empowering our youth and agent community through training and coaching.

Since times are tough for some, we want to be a resource for you. If you’re facing challenges finding employment or staying caught up on your mortgage payments, we are always available to have a confidential conversation with you. All you have to do is reach out to us!

Thank you all so much for allowing us to do what we love, and we look forward to giving some real hugs very soon.

The market stats for September are in; here&rsquo;s everything you need to know!

What’s been happening in our Tulsa real estate market lately? Starting at 0:23 in the video above, you can see the data table that we real estate agents are privy to every month when the latest market stats come out. As with every other update, we’ll be comparing the stats from the previous month (September 2020) to the stats from that same month last year.

Closed listings are up 12.65%, while pending listings, or the homes for which a buyer and seller have reached an agreement, are up by 41%! However, the pain that all of us are feeling right now in the market can be best expressed in the number of new listings we saw in September: 2,212—only a 4% year-over-year increase. Clearly, way more homes are coming off of the market than coming onto it, and that’s squeezing the market.

In turn, that squeezing of the market greatly impacts every other statistic you see. When the inventory is low, the prices go up; the average list price for the month of September rose 27% since last year, while the average sale price jumped up by 28%! That’s the highest year-over-year increase I’ve seen throughout my time in the real estate business here in Tulsa.

&#8220;If you need to sell right now, you’ll sell fast, but pay attention to your hyperlocal neighborhood market.&#8221;

The list price-to-sale price ratio for September 2020 was 98.70%, meaning that sellers are fetching almost 99% of the price they list their home for (Remember: You can list your home for any price, but that doesn’t mean the market will agree with it). It’s important for sellers to know that if their home is priced correctly and in good condition, they’ll be able to get near full listing price. Buyers, too, benefit from knowing this stat, as it proves our current market is not one in which they’ll be able to get a ‘good deal’ on a home; there’s simply no room for lowballing.

At the moment, the average days on market is 28, meaning that a home will likely spend just under a month on the market before selling. So, if you need to sell right now, you’ll sell fast. That said, sellers still need to take into account what’s happening in their hyperlocal neighborhood markets and properly prepare their homes for sale.

Lastly, let’s take a look at the months’ supply of inventory, which tells us the amount of time it would take for all the active properties on the market to sell if no other homes were to come on. Right now, our Tulsa market has a 3.15 months’ supply of inventory, meaning it would take just a little over three months to soak up everything active on the market. Anything under a five months’ supply of inventory is categorized as a seller’s market, so Tulsa sellers certainly have the upper hand today.

The numbers matter, and it’s important for your real estate professional to be monitoring the numbers on a daily basis to help you smoothly navigate the market as a buyer or a seller. If you’re a buyer who’s deeply discouraged by September’s stats, know that it’s not all doom and gloom. Interest rates are still under 3%—it’s basically free money to go buy a home! If it’s time for your family to make a move and you find a home that’s priced correctly, don’t hold back just because you’ve heard we’re still in a seller’s market.

If you need to sell and buy, we at The Wolek Group have tons of creative ways to help you do so with as little headache and stress as possible. We’ve helped more than 100 families make a move this year, and we’d love to help you reach your real estate goals. Reach out by phone or email if you simply have any questions or are ready to start your home-selling or home-buying journey! We look forward to hearing from you soon!

Here are my five tips for buying in a fierce seller&rsquo;s market like ours.

It’s no secret that our market is hot right now and favors sellers. How can you compete as a buyer when homes are selling quickly for top dollar? Keep these five M’s in mind:

Meet: Meet with a real estate professional to discuss your plans and truly understand the process of buying a home in today’s market. Pick an agent who isn’t just selling homes today, but who also has a proven track record of helping clients in any kind of market. For example, we at The Wolek Group have been in this industry for 20+ years combined, so we have the systems, tools, and technology in place to ensure a smooth transition for you and your family.

Motivation and Mindset: Pinpoint the ‘why’ behind wanting to make a move, and understand that it may not be easy. Buying a home can be one of the most exciting times of your life, but it can also be stressful and overwhelming. Be honest with yourself about having a true desire to make a move and know that it may be competitive, depending on your price point or desired location.

Money/Mortgage: How are you going to purchase your home? Cash offers are actually very common in tight real estate markets, meaning that sometimes they may win in multiple-offer situations, since there will not be an appraisal or any lender delays. However, most buyers do obtain a mortgage, so you want to be sure to start that process now so you are confident in your ability to purchase and have a letter to prove it to a seller.

Move safely through the process: All throughout the real estate transaction, we have implemented a step-by-step guide to assist you:

1. First we’ll meet either via Zoom, FaceTime, or in person—you pick your comfort level.

2. Then we’ll look at houses, which may be through virtual walking tours/open houses, or in person with masks and distancing.

3. We’ll help you write a contract with an electronic signature system.

4. You’ll order inspections, which you may or may not attend; inspectors will be wearing masks, and some will even record a video report for you.

5. Finally, you’ll attend closing. Title companies have created a mostly ‘contact-free’ process for attending closings and signing the paperwork for your new home.

&#8220;Start your pre-approval process as soon as possible.&#8221;

Make memories: Welcome HOME! Now it’s time to celebrate and move into your new home!

Here are five tips that will help you prep your home for the market.

Here are five tips to get your home market-ready so that it sells quickly and for top dollar:

1. Remember that first impressions matter. How does your front yard look when someone drives up to your home? Clean up your yard, add some landscaping, and dust off your front porch so it’s clean and inviting.

2. Work on any overdue repairs. This eliminates objections from buyers, and when they see that you’ve taken good care of your home, they’ll feel confident making a good offer for it.

3. Choose neutral paint colors. You may have a bright accent wall that you absolutely love, but all a buyer sees is something that they’ll have to paint over later. Paint your interior a nice, bright, neutral color.

4. Make sure your home passes the sniff test. If buyers walk into a home that stinks, they’ll walk right back out again. I’ve seen it happen! Your home should be clean and smell fresh.

5. Declutter and depersonalize. You’ll be moving anyway, so you might as well pack up your stuff. Our team has an amazing service we use for virtual staging, so if you’re interested in this service, let us know and we’d be happy to send you the link.

If you’re ready to start the home selling process or have any other real estate questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.

This one quick tip could win you the home of your dreams.

Are you considering buying a home in this extremely hot real estate market? 

Our team loves thinking outside the box to set our clients up for success. These days we’re frequently seeing multiple offers on houses, and it can be stressful for all involved. One way we have found to help our clients win the home is to write a love letter. 

Writing a letter to the seller about why you want to buy their home and what features you love will help your offer stand out amongst the competition. It should be written by the buyer, not the real estate agent. When a seller is comparing a bunch of offers, your letter is something different for them to consider.

&#8220;Our team loves thinking outside the box to set our clients up for success.&#8221;

Let us know via phone or email if you’re interested in making a move or have any questions. We would love to share our secrets with you.

Here&rsquo;s what home sellers should know before they decide to sell.

Real estate is hot here in Tulsa, and homes are flying off the market. However, before you make the decision to sell, I want to ask you some questions to understand how to best help you with your real estate needs.

My first question: Were you already thinking about making a move this spring or summer? The market has really heated up over the last few weeks, but since we were deemed essential here in Tulsa, we’ve been working our systems virtually to help buyers and sellers this whole time.

The reason I know the market is hot is because last weekend, we had two listings go on the market, nab multiple offers, and sell for $10,000 over their list prices. This shows that demand remains very high, especially for desirable homes in desirable price ranges.

The next question I’d ask: What’s your timeline? Due to new regulations, some lenders may need extra paperwork and details from borrowers before a loan is approved. The great thing about working with a team selling a lot of homes is that we’re on top of it and have plans to help you through the process.

&#8220;Demand for homes remains very high in Tulsa.&#8221;

We’re also watching and monitoring the real estate market every day. As a team, we keep a close eye on homes that come on the market, homes that sell, and homes that come off the market for whatever reason. This really gives us the pulse of the local Tulsa market and helps us serve our clients better and help them achieve their real estate goals.

If buying or selling is something you have in mind but you’re still a little nervous about starting the process, don’t hesitate to reach out to us to learn more about how we can help you buy or sell safely or even virtually.

If you have any other questions, contact us via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

We&rsquo;re taking our business to the virtual world in order to make sure you still get the best possible service as a homebuyer or seller.

The health and well-being of our clients and community are very important to us. We are in this together, Tulsa! The Wolek Group is now offering several virtual features to help protect your health while also meeting your real estate needs, if now is the time to buy or sell a home. Please let us know how we may serve you!

Virtual Showings

Our showings are going online! We are offering virtual house tours of our active listings and premier Open Houses each week! Enjoy our house tours from the comfort of your home, on your phone, tablet, TV, or computer. Follow us on Facebook for all the details.

Virtual Consultations

Want to chat with one of our Realtors about buying and/or selling a home? We are offering digital consultations that will allow us to get to know you and your real estate needs via phone or video meetings. Helping you feel in control and thoroughly educated during your home purchase or sale is our priority! Contact us today to schedule a time!

Preview Homes Online

Our Buyer Specialists will preview the homes that you are interested in viewing and then send you a video walkthrough. Want to tour the home with us? We’ll call, text, or video conference you in to answer any questions you have.

KW Consumer App

Another way to explore all the current homes for sale is through our website or the KW Consumer App! To download the app, click here.

To be good stewards of our community and to help keep our clients safe, we are here to help you during these challenging days. We know that you may still need to buy or sell a home, and we are here for you every step of the way!

If you need anything at all, please reach out to us. We’ve already sent you helpful resources, but we want to be doubly sure you have everything you need. 

We have a Facebook page called Tulsa Looks Good on You, which was created to share all the wonderful things Tulsa has to offer, and during this time we’re being extremely deliberate about adding helpful things to it to assist our community.

&#8220;With interest rates still low, there is plenty of activity.&#8221;

We do want you to know we’re still doing business. People are still buying and selling homes.

For example, we’re conducting tons of virtual open houses, home tours, and appointments via Zoom and FaceTime. Still seeing each other sometimes is critical during this distancing period.

        <description>

We love Tulsa, we love food, and we really love new bars in town! We’re so excited to introduce you to Niki and Andrew Layson, the owners of Bar 473 here in Kendall Whittier district. 

The bar’s name is an homage to the building it occupies, which was once a nationally registered historic place: Phillips 66 gas station No. 473, one of the early businesses in the first suburban development of Tulsa. 

According to Andrew, the location was also unique in that it allowed for more patio space, creating a more organic social atmosphere. Beyond being nestled in a lovely neighborhood, 473 draws in patrons with well-crafted, affordable cocktails. Providing a venue for local acts—comedy, music, poetry, etc.—also means that 473 is truly a community gathering space. 

Niki and Andrew were able to accent the neutral colors of the World War II-era building and create a clean, inviting space. The bar’s minimalist approach to decor ensures that the smaller inside area never feels too overcrowded. 

&#8220;Beyond being nestled in a lovely neighborhood, 473 draws patrons in with well-crafted, affordable cocktails.&#8221;

Right across the way from American Slayer and Cabin Boys Brewery, 473 is yet another testament to the increasing vibrancy of our Tulsa community! Though the many bars and breweries in this district cooperate more than compete, 473 aims to separate itself from the pack by having a deeper commitment to the city’s blossoming music scene. 

As Andrew put it, “We need to pay more attention to those local artists that are creating real, raw music and who are trying to put themselves out there as artists.” 

Follow 473 on Instagram (@four.seven.three) and Facebook (@bar473), or visit their website: www.bar473.com.

If you have any questions about the wonderful ways in which Tulsa is growing, or you’re interested in buying or selling soon, give us a call. We’d love to talk with you.

        <description>

Each year, our team has the privilege of helping hundreds of families make their real estate dreams come true. We know buying and selling a home can be stressful, but if you work with us, we make it easy on you. Through these incredible experiences, we create friendships and memories that last a lifetime.

With that in mind, I want to share a testimonial from one of our clients that speaks to our mission in this business. 

&#8220;We know buying and selling a home can be stressful, but if you work with us, we make it easy on you.&#8221;

We helped the Garman family sell their old home and buy a new one. They interviewed three Realtors before reaching out to us, but once they did, they described it as “a dream come true.”

At the time, they already had enough stress they could handle, so they wanted the buying and selling process to be as stress-free as possible. After staging their old home, we managed to sell it in just three days. We also staged their new home after helping them purchase it so they could settle in more comfortably. 

Watch the video above in its entirety to see their full testimonial and why they’d recommend the Wolek Group to all of their friends and family. 

If you ever have any real estate needs, don’t hesitate to call or email me. My team and I would love to help.

        <description>

Today I sat down for a chat with Nate Araskog, an agent here at The Wolek Group. He’s here to share his experiences as an agent on our team.

Before coming to The Wolek Group, Nate Araskog had obtained his real estate license and worked with Daniel Sprik, a Realtor and good friend of his who had encouraged him to get into the industry in the first place. 

I helped him to sell a couple of his properties before, so one day Nate and I met for coffee. It was supposed to have been a short introduction, but it ended up becoming a two-and-half-hour meeting. During that conversation, Nate saw my experience and the opportunities that lay in the foundation of my team’s structure and he decided he wanted to be a part of it.

For my part, the conversation over coffee had originally been about real estate in general, but toward the end, something clicked within me. I asked him, “Are you asking me all these questions to join Keller Williams or to join my team?”

&#8220;It’s fun to be on the front end of change within the real estate industry at large.&#8221;
 

With a smile on his face, Nate responded, “I don’t know—maybe both.”

With that, I recommended that he and I set up another time to get back together. We did, and the rest is history.

We’ve grown so much since then, and his experience with our team and with Keller Williams has been fabulous overall. It’s fun to be on the front end of change within the real estate industry at large.

By the time Nate and I met for that fateful coffee meeting, he was already a go-getter who found success as a single agent. What was he missing that helped him see the value of joining a team?

For him, the biggest factor was the opportunity to learn from someone who had experience. He knew that our team would provide the ability to help people as a part of an organization, not just a single agent. He knew from the first time we met that the partnership we could create by being in business together was going to be hugely successful for all of us.

If you have any questions about starting career in real estate or would like to contact us about joining The Wolek Group yourself, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to hear from you and discuss why making the switch to Keller Williams and The Wolek Group would be a great decision for the trajectory of your career.

Deneen Natural Health offers supplemental solutions for health and wellness. Here’s what you should know about their approach.

I am so excited to introduce you to Dr. Shana Deneen with Deneen Natural Health. I wanted to talk to her because she does something quite special that I think everyone should know about.

At Deneen Natural Health, Shana brings a more natural approach to health, wellness, and disease prevention by practicing naturopathic medicine and acupuncture.

People come in for a variety of reasons. Maybe they’re trying to get pregnant, going through side effects of cancer treatment, or simply have some back or neck pain. What makes Deneen Natural Health different is that they offer supplemental solutions to improving the health of their patients. There are a lot of natural ways to promote health through nutrition, acupuncture, and herbal medicine.

&#8220;Eating legumes can help prevent heart disease.&#8221;

As far as diet and nutrition go, she’s a big promoter of eating legumes like lentils, split peas, and beans. These foods are really healthy and can help prevent heart disease, promote gut health, and help with the prevention of many different kinds of cancer.

For those with cancer undergoing treatments with a lot of side effects, acupuncture is a great way to mitigate those effects and improve their overall quality of life.

If you’re interested in learning more about Dr. Shana and Deneen Natural Health, visit her websiteor give her a call at (918) 884-6005.

If you have any additional questions for me about real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

If you have a craving for wood-fired pizza, I have just the place to introduce you to on the latest episode of “Tulsa Foodie.”


On the latest episode of “Tulsa Foodie,” I want to introduce you to one of my favorite restaurants: the East Village Bohemian Pizzeria. Joining me for a quick sit-down is Amy McMillin, who co-owns the restaurant with her brother. 

Amy and her brother have been involved in the food industry since they were teenagers, and they share a special love of Italian food. Amy got her first taste of wood-fired pizza 15 years ago when she got the chance to visit Naples, and after she did, she decided that she had to recreate the same taste back home. 

The secret to their pizza’s amazing taste, according to Amy, is their dedication to cooking everything fresh and authentic, just like they do in Italy. 

&#8220;I learned the hard way that you need a reservation on most nights if you want to get a table here.&#8221;

“Every morning,” she says, “we come in and light the fire in our wood-fired oven, which has no gas—we’re stacking the wood and making the fire—and we’re roasting all the fresh vegetables every day. All the meats are getting roasted. We make our dough from scratch. We import our flour from Italy. And we’re doing that fresh every single day.”

In addition to the great food, they have a fun, cool vibe inside their restaurant. Their five-year anniversary at their current location in downtown Tulsa is coming up on December 19, and in those five years, they’ve built a wine room and a second kitchen which makes handmade pasta daily. They also have an amazing patio (which I’m a big fan of), where guests are known to wine and dine year-round—even when the temperature is nearly freezing. 

I learned the hard way that you need a reservation on most nights if you want to get a table here, and I can’t wait to try my next Bohemian pizza. 

If you’d like to know more about the East Village Bohemian Pizzeria, visit their website atwww.eastvillagebohemian.com or check out their Instagram feed @bohemianpizzatulsa.

As always, if you have any questions for me or there’s anything I can help you with, give me a call or shoot me an email.

        <description>
 

People often ask me how I got into real estate, and so I’d like to share that story with all of you today.I’m originally from Tulsa and attended the University of Oklahoma just a couple hours away from there (Boomer Sooner!). I spent a lot of those years in school being average and only just barely getting by. I think that’s because, like a lot of college-aged kids, I didn’t know my passion or purpose in life. Finally, I got into classes that I cared about and I realized that I was a good student after all. I went on to get my master’s degree in Human Relations.

During that time, I was still waiting tables at the mall in Norman. I really think that a lot of the best real estate agents are those who have been servers. A friend of mine from high school who had just gotten into real estate reached out to me, asking if I needed to buy a house. At the time, I didn’t have any money, so how was I supposed to buy a house? To that, he responded, “You should get into real estate; a friend in my office just made $100,000 last month.”

The flexibility and lucrative nature of the real estate industry was very appealing to me at that age. After a while, though, I realized that there was a lot more hard work necessary than just selling lots of houses and raking in the money. I realized that my work ethic, which I somehow just had in me, was starting to pay off.

I began working for a small brokerage with just five people in the office. I was learning how to be a property manager and how to be an office manager; I partnered with a broker and got to go on listing appointments and worked with homebuyers. 

After four years of working in real estate in Norman I knew that I was getting to the age where I wanted to be able to get back home to my family. I sold the two houses that I had bought in those four years and moved back home to Tulsa.

&#8220;We’re always looking for more people to come into our world so that we can help more families, have fun, give back to the community, and live large.&#8221;

Once I did, I signed on with a local, traditional real estate company. I was doing well at the time, but I didn’t know how to be anything other than a lead receiver, which means that I would show up to open houses and smile and be nice to people—over time, they would open up and let me help them.

Then, I discovered a company called Keller Williams. That’s when everything changed for me in my business and my personal life. Once I signed on with Keller Williams, I just ate up all of the available training, coaching, and mentoring that I could get my hands on. That really opened my mind; I started to dream big and realized that with Keller Williams, I could achieve those dreams.

However, as a single agent, I was starting to get overwhelmed. I was working all kinds of crazy hours, and when I reached a breaking point, I knew that I needed help. That’s when the idea of building a team entered my mind. I didn’t want to build a team to crush the faces off the Tulsa, Oklahoma real estate market, but rather because I wanted to hold on to my sanity! I wanted to be a good wife, mother, and agent, and building a team allowed me to do that.

What’s fun about growing a team is that you get to help others do the same. It’s such an amazing experience. We’re always looking for more people to come into our world so that we can help more families, have fun, give back to the community, and live large.

If you’ve ever thought about starting a career in real estate, or if you’re currently in the business but you’re not finding the success that you want, reach out to me. I’d love to chat with you about an amazing opportunity to join our team.

        <description>

Why does Katherine Fondren recommend The Wolek Group to anyone interested in buying or selling real estate? Today, she can tell you herself:

“I had a home that I needed to sell. I had known Jennie Wolek over the years through mutual friends, and I was definitely looking for something different… something outside of the box. I was a Realtor in Louisiana when I lived there, so I thought I knew everything about the real estate business, but that was a long time ago, before the age of social media and all kinds of new marketing things.

“That’s why I loved about Jennie and what her company was doing: They were doing some outside-the-box marketing. Jennie would come over; we sat at my kitchen table and discussed what our goals were. She asked me what I liked best about my home and what prospective buyers should know about it. I was happy to share that information and she definitely used it in her marketing.

&#8220;I felt she really wanted to do what was best for me and my family, as well as the people buying my home.&#8221;

“Then we immediately started the buying process. I met with one of her buyer’s agents and we discussed what we were looking for and needed in a home. And throughout the process, there was a lot of feedback, which I really value; being a former Realtor, I know that’s really important. A lot of my friends who are looking for Realtors always want feedback. If someone looked at your house, what did they think? How can we improve? What do they like? What do they not like?

“When we finally did get a buyer, I was really excited. Jennie did everything she could to walk us through the process. She was great from beginning to end, and I felt she really wanted to do what was best for me and my family, as well as the people buying my home.

“We found this beautiful house that we’re standing in right now in a neighborhood we didn’t even know about. It’s a new home from a builder I didn’t know; Jennie’s team had the knowledge of the market, so they knew what was going on even in new construction. 

“I’m thankful to The Wolek Group for helping steer us in the right direction and helping us find our dream home. It’s a wonderful process from beginning to end, very stress-free with a lot of communication, and I definitely, definitely recommend them!”

If you, like Katherine, ever need any help with your real estate needs, please feel free to reach out to us here at The Wolek Group. We’d be happy to help you.

        <title>A Conversation with Luke Frazier of INSPiRE Financial Group</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/a-conversation-with-luke-frazier-of-inspire-financial-group.html</link>

        <description>

Today I’m excited to introduce you to my friend Luke Frazier with INSPiRE Financial Group. I met Luke at a Tulsa Chamber of Commerce event and I was so inspired by him and how he runs his business as a financial planner.

Luke started this firm three years ago with what he calls “uncommon knowledge.” He felt that the industry as a whole was going in one direction, but not enough people were asking why. We’ve taken that knowledge and applied strategies and recommendations behind it to better our clients. As opposed to the stock market, they tend to focus on cash flow.

Products and services can only get you so far if you don’t have a strong “why.” For Luke, he believes that there are five core areas in which everyone is trying to improve: relationships with family and friends, career, finances, spiritual well-being, and physical well-being. 

Luke and INSPiRE feel like the financial aspect too often adds stress or negatively affect the other five areas. Their goal with their clients is to put strategies in place to turn the financial aspect into a positive and positively affects the other areas.

&#8220;Everybody has a different personality and mindset about finances.&#8221;

Way too many people are relying on Wall Street and big banks for their finances. Luke and his team promote investing in themselves instead of Wall Street or big banks. They work with a lot of small business owners and even real estate investors to produce cash flow instead of just putting money away and not ever seeing it for 30 years.

Their program is based on what the truly wealthy people in our country do. They go to work and make money, put their money to work for them, and use other people’s money to make even more money. They finance their own deals and use their own leverage, and Luke uses a lot of these types of strategies with his clients. As opposed to paying a lump sum for a boat, for example, you can take that amount and put it towards a rental property, for example. The income on the property can pay that mortgage and the loan on the boat. If we repeat that process over and over, it will create wealth.

Everybody has a different personality and mindset about finances. Where Luke and his team shine are with the clients with abundant mindsets who want to get wealthy now and not wait for it for later.

To learn more about Luke and what he does at INSPiRE, visit their website at www.planwithinspire.com or call Luke at (918) 500-2931.

Thanks so much to Luke for joining me. If you have any other questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>
Today I’m driving to a listing appointment, and I just ran into a friend I’ve known since high school who is also in the real estate business as a house-flipper. She was talking about the challenge she’s been facing in the pursuit of great homes to buy, fix up, and resell. Another friend and client of ours who is in real estate as well has the same issue.

&#8220;We have a whole database for flippers, investors, and clients looking for an affordable home to fix up and resell.&#8221;

Given that, I thought today’s blog post would be a great opportunity to share this message:

If you have a home that needs a little love in the form of a few updates and repairs and you just don’t want to put the time, energy, or money into doing it, then go ahead and reach out to us at The Wolek Group: We have a whole database for flippers, investors, and clients looking for an affordable home to fix up and resell.

In addition, we can help with any kind of home or home buying needs you have, so don’t hesitate to reach out to us. Hope to talk to you soon!

We have testimonials from volunteers, public school teachers in Tulsa County, and Executive Director Nancy Bolzle as part of our spotlight. As Nancy says, “There is no greater investment than our youth.”

        <description>

Blue Jay Cleaning Services has been around in the Tulsa area and the Oklahoma City Metro area for about three years. They offer recurring residential services, as well as move-out cleaning and make-ready cleaning, which is done before your home goes on the market. In addition, they also do small office commercial services.

Here at The Wolek Group, we love helping our clients get their homes ready in the pre-listing period, and cleaning is no small part of that process. Whether you’re preparing to sell your home and move or you just want to simplify, Blue Jay’s owner Britt Greenwood says that decluttering is the way to go. This is especially important if you’re planning to sell your home. Look at your countertops in the kitchen—a good rule of thumb is to have no more than two or three appliances on them.

&#8220;A good rule of thumb is to have no more than two or three appliances on your countertops.&#8221;

In the bathroom, try not to have more than a handful of items on your surfaces, including your shower. When you sell your home, you need to live in it differently than you would if you weren’t planning to move.

As you’re decluttering the home, pack things in moving boxes to help speed up the moving process. When filled, these boxes can be stored in the garage or in an out-of-the-way storage area.

It’s also a good idea to make a list of things that need to be done in your home regarding renovations, repairs, and touch-ups. Be sure to have all those things done before you have a professional house cleaner visit your home, since trade workers can sometimes leave a mess.

If you’d like to contact Britt for an estimate, reach out to her by phone at (918) 277-3378, visit her website at www.BlueJayCleaning.com, or visit her Facebook page. One-time cleanings can be discussed over the phone, but if you have need of a recurring service, she or one of her staff members can come visit your home to see what needs to be done.

For any questions you have for me or the Wolek Group at large, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you!

        <description>

Welcome back to another edition of “Tulsa Foodie”. Today I’m super excited to introduce you to Melvin Piper, owner of Nouveau Chocolates. This Rose District shop is everything you’ve ever wanted in a chocolatier.

Melvin always wanted to own a business and food is one of his biggest passions. He fell in love with chocolate on a trip to Europe and started working at Nouveau about eight years ago. About a year ago, he bought the business from the previous owner and has put his own spin on some new classics while also maintaining the quality that people have always come to find at Nouveau.

They get a lot of foot traffic from the lunch and dinner crowds. There are some people that even come in for some coffee or tea every day or hot chocolate in the winter.

&#8220;Nouveau produces some of the finest Belgian chocolate around&#8221;

Nouveau produces some of the finest Belgian chocolate around. There are about 49 different selections in the showcase, which they are constantly adding to. They also serve delicious ice cream and chocolate-dipped cones. 

For all of you Tulsa Foodies out there, you can get 10% off of a 15-piece box for the entire month of July! Just make sure to mention us when you order!

Some of their most popular chocolates include maple bacon, key lime pie, and chili pepper flavors. Their oil-fire whiskey is infused with caramel and has a creamy liquid center. I tried one for myself and it was absolutely incredible. 

Come check out Nouveau Chocolates for yourself on 205 S. Main St. in Broken Arrow. You can also check them out on Instagram or Facebook @nouveauchocolates.

Thanks so much to Melvin for joining me and letting me take a look at some of his fantastic creations. If you have any questions for me in the meantime or any real estate needs that I can assist with, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yesterday, I ran into one of my lender friends, and he happened to mention that interest rates are still crazy low. For a 30-year mortgage, rates are right around 4%!

Since it’s summer, now is the best time to make a move if you have a family and want to get settled in before school starts again in the fall.

        <description>

Having spent more than 18 years in the real estate industry, our team knows that making a move can be very stressful. We’d like to make this important step in your life go more smoothly by not only helping to guide you through the market but also listing your property as a certified pre-owned home.

Our team sends you through the inspection and appraisal process before your home ever goes live on the market. This will prevent certain issues from sinking your sale once you’ve got a buyer on the line.

&#8220;We know that when homes are priced correctly, in good condition, and are marketed well, they sell quickly and for top dollar.&#8221;

Along with these preliminary steps, our team also implements a “coming soon” marketing program that helps to build buyer interest in your property before it’s listed. 

We know that when homes are priced correctly, in good condition, and are marketed well, they sell quickly and for top dollar. When you’re ready to make a move, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to helping you sell for the most money, in the least time, and with as little hassle as possible.

        <description>

Recently I had the opportunity to speak with Jennifer Barcus-Shafer of Revitalize T-Town to talk about her organization and what makes it so great. Having been in business for almost 22 years, Revitalize T-Town (formerly Rebuilding Together Tulsa) is an incredible force for good in our community. 

“Revitalize T-Town, or ‘RTT’ as we call it, makes homes safe, secure, and weather-proof for homeowners within the Tulsa city limits,” says Jennifer. The majority of RTT’s clients are seniors or individuals with disabilities, and these people generally find out about the organization through word of mouth. The more people RTT helps, the more their reputation grows in our community. And the more their reputation grows, the more effectively they’re able to achieve their mission: revitalizing Tulsa.

&#8220;The more their reputation grows, the more effectively they’re able to achieve their mission: revitalizing Tulsa.&#8221;

The first step RTT takes after receiving and reviewing an application is to assess the person’s home and determine what must be done to improve its condition. After that, the various improvement projects a given home needs are ranked by priority so that local contractors can handle the most urgent areas first. You can check out the video above at 1:13 for a slideshow of some before and after photos from RTT’s previous projects. 

Even more impressively, the money that funds RTT comes straight from our community. That said, monetary donations are always welcome. Still, there are many other ways to give back. If you’re a local contractor like an electrician or plumber, RTT would be happy to connect you with projects that fit your skill set. 

If you’re interested in helping out or learning more, please visit https://revitalizettown.org/. 

And, as always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

What are we seeing from the spring market so far? How are mortgage rates affecting buyers and sellers? 

Today I’ve invited Chris Padley of the Gateway Mortgage Group to join me for a quick chat so he can help answer these questions. Chris has been in the lending business for 16 years, and he’s one of the trusted lenders we work with here in the Tulsa area.

According to him, what we’re seeing from the market right now can be described as the normal springtime explosion. 

“Every single week is a new rush of pre-qualifications and contracts,” he says. “Every year it’s exciting, and I’m loving it.”

&#8220;If you’re a buyer and you’ve been on the fence the past few months, now’s a great time to take advantage of these conditions.&#8221;

The ups and downs of the real estate business can get crazy, so for Chris, staying positive when things get really busy means sticking to the systems he’s put in place—his scripts, daily phone calls, etc. He knows that letting the day in, day out craziness change his routine can cause everything else to fall apart. Every day, he’s on the phone and lead generating with potential clients and Realtors, and each day has its own theme.

“Mondays are my top 40, Tuesdays are my Tuesday update calls, Wednesday I’m following up with anybody who’s pre-qualified to make sure they’re taken care of, and Thursdays and Fridays I’m following up with miscellaneous—builders, leads that haven’t applied yet, and whatnot. Every single day, there’s work to be done.”

What are mortgage rates like right now? Chris says that they’re, in a word, awesome. In fact, the 30-year fixed rate is as low as 4.125%. This means if you’re a buyer and you’ve been on the fence the past few months, now’s a great time to take advantage of these conditions. We don’t know what’s going to happen in the future, but we do know that you can lock in a low rate right now. Since so many buyers will be getting into the market, now is also a great time to sell. 

If you’d like to get pre-qualified and start your home buying journey or you have any mortgage questions for Chris, you can message him at his website ThePadleyTeam.com. 

If you have any other real estate questions for me, feel free to give me a call. I’d love to speak with you!

        <description>

I’m here today with Brian Young, who works with Youth Services of Tulsa. We’d like to share all the wonderful things this organization is doing for our community.

Youth Services of Tulsa is a nonprofit partner agency of the Tulsa Area United Way. They’re celebrating their 50-year anniversary this year.

The agency works with teenagers and young adults, and they’re the only organization in the area that focuses on these age groups. They offer a full continuum of care to end youth homelessness.

Brian sees a lot of runaway and homeless youth end up in their facilities. They offer safe places to stay and hold outreach programs during the day where youth can have their basic needs met.They have 20 beds in their facility and have helped 300 different individuals in their shelter within the last year.

&#8220;They helped 300 different individuals in their shelter within the last year.&#8221;

Many come to Youth Services of Tulsa through their safe place program, which is advertised throughout the area. If an adolescent is going through a crisis and needs immediate help, a volunteer can pick them up and bring them to the shelter.

A common misconception is that youth become homeless through some fault of their own. The vast majority are simply going through hard times. A third of the homeless youth population, for example, is made up of 18-year-olds who aged out of foster care and don’t know how to make it on their own.

You can help support Youth Services of Tulsa through donations or volunteer work. They rely on both in order to operate, and they also need items such as underwear and socks. To see how to donate and learn more about the organization, visit www.YST.org.

I’d like to thank Brian for giving us an insightful look at this wonderful organization. If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

We love Tulsa. We love food. And we really love featuring local restaurants. 

For today’s “Tulsa Foodie” feature, we’re shining the spotlight on “SMOKE. Woodfire Grill” here on Cherry Street. With the help of Chef Tim, the restaurant’s culinary craftsman, we’ll get to know more about SMOKE. and go on a little tour as well. I’m so excited to acquaint you with this wonderful restaurant! 

Tim joined the SMOKE. team a year and a half ago, and the restaurant itself has existed on Cherry Street for close to eight years, where it has built up its reputation as a preeminent restaurant in Tulsa. They boast a full-service experience with a bar and cigar lounge to complement their outstanding food. 

And no matter what time or day of the week you’d like to stop in, SMOKE. can oblige: They serve lunch and dinner seven days a week and are open a little earlier on weekends to serve brunch options. In Tim’s own words, they “have a little bit of everything to offer everybody.”

&#8220;SMOKE. has existed on Cherry Street for close to eight years, where it has built up its reputation as a preeminent restaurant in Tulsa.&#8221;

Some of Tim’s personal menu favorites come from their steak selections, but he was excited to share some other novel choices that give SMOKE. its signature feel. Many people don’t realize that, as Tim points out, beyond the meat and potatoes cookery, they offer some great vegan dishes including their vegan cauliflower steak. 

From the moment you walk into SMOKE., you’ll notice a delightfully smoky smell. This permeates from their Aztec grill from which their chefs cook over an open fire. This really draws out an unmatchable amount of flavor in the food they serve, Tim says. 

Now, we’re going to take a look around and get to know SMOKE. inside and out as well as check out their recent remodel. You can begin viewing our brief tour at 3:53 in the video.  

For more information about SMOKE., you can visit their website at SmokeTulsa.com or go ahead and stop in today to find out all that it has to offer! 

And for any real estate-related questions you have, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me by phone at 918-706-9845. I look forward to hearing from you!

        <description>

Today I’m excited to cast the spotlight on a premier local business, Elite Cabinets, and to get to know the story of its owner, Brandon Massey. I also had the opportunity to pick his brain for his advice to those thinking about doing a kitchen remodel.

Right out of high school, Brandon began his trade as a carpenter. From there, he transitioned into finished carpentry, and then to building cabinets in the modern, European-style that Elite Cabinets specializes in today.

Since he began his business four years ago, Brandon has been very busy due to the popularity of his cabinets. In that time, he’s noticed that the market in Tulsa has trended toward modern, clean, simple lines. What’s really cool about Elite Cabinets is that Brandon’s products can also blend into more rustic, traditional, or craftsman-style homes, depending on the finishes and wood grain colors.

&#8220;Think about the layout of the cabinets and how that will interact with the way you use your kitchen in terms of storage and access.&#8221;

If you’re planning to remodel your kitchen, Brandon has some advice to offer: Keep the finishes of the products in mind so that they tie into the aesthetic of your home, and also think about the layout of the cabinets and how that will interact with the way you use your kitchen in terms of storage and access (e.g., if you’re right-handed or left-handed).

To make an appointment with Brandon and to learn more about his excellent products, he can be reached at (918) 794-0757 or you can visit his website at www.EliteCabinetsTulsa.com.

For any other questions regarding real estate, you are, as always, encouraged to reach out to me. I’d be happy to speak with you.

        <description>

Based on the market statistics that just came in for December 2018, we’re seeing that compared to December 2017, home sales were down 13%. Speaking truthfully, our team definitely felt that drop; it was slower than what we’ve experienced in recent years.  

It’s also useful to note that the number of new homes that came on the market was down 8% to 1,380 homes. Though fewer homes were coming on the market and fewer were selling, homes that were in great condition did sell pretty quickly. Some of you may have noticed that as well.

&#8220;We fully expect more sellers to place their homes on the market this year, especially as we draw closer to the prime time of the spring market.&#8221;

In Tulsa, the average sales price was $189,325. Within that price point, our average days on market was 47 days. Now, if your home was listed at a price higher than that, it would have taken a little longer to sell. That’s why it’s so important to work with a professional—they can look at your area market to come up with a detailed pricing strategy appropriate for your home. 

We monitor whether a market is a buyer’s, seller’s, or balanced market by looking at the absorption rate, otherwise known as our months’ supply of inventory. The market is always in a state of flux between those market types, so we look at where it’s been to help us understand where it’s going. In December 2017, there were 5.49 months of inventory available. As of last month, there were 4.35 month’s worth of homes on the market. We fully expect more sellers to place their homes on the market this year, especially as we draw closer to the prime time of the spring market.

These stats are important to have on hand when you’re thinking about real estate, no matter if you’re buying, selling, or both. Whatever the case is, we can help and guide you through the process so that you can make smart decisions regarding when it’s a good time to buy or sell. If you have any questions or need any guidance, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Today I’m joined by professional structural engineer Jahan Abdoveis of Foundation Engineering Inspections (FEI) to talk a little about home inspections.

For Jahan, structural engineering is a family affair. His father was a structural engineer too, and he’s the one who started FEI. Their company handles all kinds of inspections, but their primary focus is structural inspections. According to Jahan, the biggest home inspection issue he deals with in Tulsa is the foundation and floor slab problems. 

“Unfortunately, we have uniquely bad soil and uniquely relaxed building standards in Tulsa,” he says.

&#8220;A great way for sellers to lay a foundation for a successful home sale is to get a pre-inspection done on their house before they list it.&#8221;

Becoming a certified engineer requires a lot of schooling and a long apprenticeship, so inspectors like Jahan are the main authority on whether a home is safe and secure. Jahan and his father don’t see eye to eye on every single home, but between the two of them, they’ve done about 50,000 inspections. 

A great way for sellers to lay a foundation for a successful home sale is to get a pre-inspection done on their house before they list it. That way, you won’t have to deal with any unwelcome surprises when the buyer does their own inspection and you give them peace of mind that they’re getting a quality house. 

If you have any more home inspection questions for Jahan, you can visit www.FEIinspections.com or give their office a call at (918) 865-2593. 

As always, if you have any questions for me about our Tulsa market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.

        <description>

Today on “Tulsa Foodie,” I’m spotlighting Hodges Bend, a coffee and cocktail bar in Downtown Tulsa. Joining me for a quick chat is co-owner Noah Bush. 

Noah got into the restaurant business at a young age and has worked a lot of different jobs in the industry over the years. He always had a love of food, but after he started working at a wine bar here in town, he fell in love with wine too. After making a name for himself at Doc’s Wine &amp; Food, he met up with his business partner and they developed the concept of a bar that specializes in coffee, wine, and cocktails. 

Aside from serving high-quality drinks, what you might not know about Hodge’s Bend is that they also serve food. They open at 7 a.m. every weekday and serve breakfast all throughout the day. Once nighttime hits, they switch over to their dinner menu, and on weekends they also serve brunch. Moving forward, they plan to make a few exciting menu changes while retaining their core products.

&#8220;Moving forward, they plan to make a few exciting menu changes while retaining their core products.&#8221;

“We always wanted to be a bar with really good food,” Noah says. With his wine background and the background of their two chefs, they plan on putting on more wine dinners in the future.

What they’re really known for, though, is their drinks, and I had the pleasure of sampling their best-selling item while we sat at the bar: Irish coffee. Their version of this popular cocktail is made with espresso, sugar syrup, Irish whiskey, and a nice, thick layer of cream on top. 

If you want to try one yourself, you can find Hodges Bend at 823 3rd Street. If you’d like to know more about their establishment, you can visit their website at www.hodges-bend.com/welcome-tulsa/ or email them at info@hodges-bend.com. 

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Recently I had the opportunity to speak with Jim Means of Kitchen Concepts about his business here in Tulsa. 

Jim has been in working in design since 1994, but it wasn’t until eight years ago that he transformed his business into what it is today. Now, Kitchen Concepts has its own design team and in-house construction staff, which work together on kitchen and bathroom remodel, additions, parties, and more. 

According to Jim, Kitchen Concepts is “all about you.” 

And as far as price goes, Jim and his team prefer to work within their clients’ budgets. From super high-end products to more modest options, there’s something for every price range.

&#8220;Jim and his team at Kitchen Concepts are more than happy to work around your schedule, budget, wants, and needs.&#8221;

In general, though, Jim says a full kitchen remodel will tend to cost between $50,000 and $70,000. That said, Jim is more than willing to find solutions for clients who can’t afford quite that much. 

Their showroom is conveniently located in the London South Shopping Center at 5936 S Lewis Avenue. Walk-ins are welcome during the week, or you can visit by appointment on Saturdays. 

Of course, if you aren’t quite sure what you’re looking for, they would be happy to guide you. Not only does the team at Kitchen Concepts stay on top of current trends, but they also like to focus on functionality. Often, this means opening things up to create more space. 

The bottom line is that Jim and his team at Kitchen Concepts are more than happy to work around your schedule, budget, wants, and needs. As their motto says, the goal of Kitchen Concepts is “Creating a kitchen for the way you live.” 

If you want to get in touch with Jim and his team, you can reach them by visiting www.kitchenconceptstulsa.com or by calling (918) 779-4480. 

And, as always, if you have any other questions or would like more information from me, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Today on “Tulsa Foodie,” we’ve decided to feature Ediblend Superfood Cafe in Utica Square. To give us a better idea about what this great restaurant is all about, we decided to meet up with its founders: Piper Kacere and Amy Murray. 

The idea for Ediblend Superfood Cafe began years ago when Piper and Amy, who are sisters, decided to do a juice cleanse. They got off to a rocky start, but shortly after beginning their second attempt, Piper and Amy began to attract the interest of people around them. 

Eventually, they started making cleanses for these people and, before they knew it, they started receiving text messages and calls from total strangers who were interested in their product. So they bought up all the mason jars and shower caddies they could find, then started making and packaging cleanses from a playroom in Piper’s home that they had converted into a kitchen.

&#8220;Though these juice blends are where they got their start, the Ediblend Superfood Cafe has a lot more to offer.&#8221;
That coming summer, they moved their operation into a test kitchen they had rented out, and, lo and behold, they completely sold out for the season. Their satisfied customers couldn’t stop raving about their experience, so Piper and Amy knew it was time to open a permanent location. Now, since opening in 2014, the Ediblend Superfood Cafe has two locations and a massive fan base here in Tulsa.

Looking at their wide range of healthy and delicious blends, like the Sweet Green, 1717, and Sexy Yowza, it’s no wonder why. And though these juice blends are where they got their start, the Ediblend Superfood Cafe has a lot more to offer. When you visit their restaurant, you can also enjoy great salads or one of their customizable açaí bowls. Best of all, everything in the cafe is made fresh every single day. 

In the future, Amy and Piper are looking forward to expanding their business, and its menu, even wider. If you’re as interested as we are in seeing what’s on the horizon for Ediblend Superfood Cafe, or you’re curious about their hours, locations, or menu, be sure to follow them on Facebook or visit their website: https://ediblend.com/

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Should you get a home warranty? I think so. There are many benefits of having a warranty, no matter if you just bought your home, currently own, or are looking to sell. To help me explain why home warranties are so important, I recently met with Shelley Carson of First American Home Warranty to discuss home warranties and all their benefits.

I have timestamped the conversation below so you can jump to the section(s) that you find the most interesting.

&#8220;There are many benefits of having a warranty no matter if you just bought your home, currently own, or are looking to sell.&#8221;

0:25 – How Shelley got into the industry.1:20 – What she has learned about that value of home warranties.2:15 – The cost of adding a home warranty.3:00 – The benefit of adding a home warranty at the time of buying.4:40 – Why sellers should get a home warranty.5:50 – How a home warranty works for sellers.

If you have any additional questions about home warranties, you can reach out to Shelley by phone at (918) 480-0924.

As always, if you have any questions about buying or selling, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

        <title>5 Deal-Breakers That Can Wreck Your Home Sale</title>

        <description>

There are five deal-breakers sellers must prepare for and avoid if they want to sell their home quickly and for top dollar:

1. Structural problems. Here in Oklahoma, our houses move over time. Depending on how old your home is, you might be able to notice a few settlement cracks here and there. Sometimes these are the normal effects of settling, while other times they can be more serious and may require the installation of a few piers. A single pier costs around $500, so if you see some cracks around your house that look a little more extreme than normal settling, you’ll want to get that checked out. 

2. The roof. Is your roof insurable and do you have proper coverage on it? If the buyer’s insurance company isn’t able to insure your roof, many times the only other solution is to replace it. 

3. The HVAC system. It’s a good idea to schedule regular maintenance checks for your HVAC system with a local heating and air company. When the appointment is finished, make sure to ask for a receipt or to have a sticker placed on your system. This way, you can prove to buyers that the system has been checked.

&#8220;Termites aren’t prejudiced—they love all types of wood and all types of houses.&#8221;

4. Termites. Termites aren’t prejudiced—they love all types of wood and all types of houses. If there’s termite activity in your house, treatment costs anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000. If your home had termite problems in the past, it may have been damaged, so get a visual inspection to see if that’s the case. If past termite damage is apparent and it isn’t fixed, termite inspectors will have to declare that your home needs termite treatment. Wood rot is another item that gets checked during a termite inspection, and if your home has this problem too, you need to get it cleaned up. 

5. Low appraisals. This is a prevalent deal-breaker we’re seeing in our market right now. Appraisals are based on the current market, and appraisers have to look back in time at recent sales to make sure your home is priced correctly. There are always ups and downs in the market, though, so even though your appraisal might not be up to date with current trends, you have to go with what the appraiser says. A low appraisal hurts both sellers and buyers because when a buyer’s obtaining a mortgage, they can’t pay more than the price the appraiser sets. 

We love helping sellers plan their move in advance, so if you’re thinking of selling your home any time soon, give us a call so we can help you get it ready for the market and have buyers wanting to pay full price for it. 

If you have any other real estate questions or you’re thinking of buying a home in our Tulsa market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us as well. We’d love to help you.

We’re more than halfway through 2018, and it’s been an amazing year for The Wolek Group. 

We’ve been able to help more than 104 families buy and sell real estate so far, and we look forward to helping many more through the end of 2018 and beyond. Of course, another way we love to help all of you is by providing key insight into what’s happening in our market. 

At this point in the year, real estate tends to slow down a little bit. With school starting up, buyers with families are mostly done shopping for homes by this point. This lull in our market is nothing out of the ordinary, but those looking to sell should be aware that it might take a little longer now than in recent months to find a buyer. Not to worry, though.

&#8220;It’s not the time to throw in the towel, but it is time to be realistic about how you’re presenting your listing to the market.&#8221;

After school is back in full swing and labor day is over, market activity will likely pick back up. Seasonal market changes are normal, and there is still plenty of time and opportunity to sell your home before 2019. 

If your home is already on the market and you’re feeling discouraged by current conditions, though, a price adjustment may be just the thing to jumpstart buyer interest. Buyer activity may be down, but it is not stagnant. 

There are still people out there looking for homes, and, with the right strategy, your property could be the one they choose. It’s not the time to throw in the towel, but it is time to be realistic about how you’re presenting your listing to the market. 

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are curious how we can help you achieve your real estate goals, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

On today’s episode of “Tulsa Foodie,” we’re taking a look at one of my favorite downtown restaurants: Juniper. 

To give you all a better idea of what makes Juniper great, and how it got its start, I met up with general manager Derek Hillman. 

Opened six years ago by first-time restaurateur Justin Thompson, Juniper has been a local favorite ever since. Juniper offers standout entrees such as seared duck, fried chicken curry, and a refreshing seared ahi salad. 

Of course, Juniper’s menu is always changing. New dishes are released each week to fit the restaurant’s ever-shifting themes, as well as the seasons. It’s no wonder why Juniper’s growth comes from its kitchen, where head chef Neil Trumpy works his culinary magic. 

&#8220;Whether you’re in the mood for a savory meal or a sweet, tasty drink, you can find what you’re craving at Juniper.&#8221;

Chef Trumpy received his education from the Oregon Culinary Institute, where he developed a skill set based around sustainability and the use of local ingredients. As you’ll see in today’s episode, watching him work is an amazing sight to behold. 

But delectable dishes aren’t the only thing there is to enjoy at Juniper. Diners can also enjoy any of the many refreshing signature cocktails they offer. So whether you’re in the mood for a savory meal or a sweet, tasty drink, you can find what you’re craving at Juniper. 

Dining at Juniper is an amazing experience, so be sure to come check it out yourself. 

Juniper (located at 324 East 3rd Street in downtown Tulsa)  is open for lunch Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., and for dinner from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Monday through Saturday. 

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Today I’m back to talk about a fantastic event that’s coming up here in a few weeks. Angela Evans, who works in the marketing department for WildBrew, joined me recently to talk about the event and what you need to know about it.

They don’t call it the greatest party ever hatched for nothing. WildBrew is a fundraiser for the Sutton Avian Research Center located in Bartlesville. This is the 20th year for this festival, making it the oldest craft beer festival in Oklahoma!

The event is on Saturday, August 25th at the Cox Business Center downtown. 

Over 50 local and non-local breweries and 50 amazing restaurants will be in attendance for this wonderful indoor festival. Here’s what a ticket to this festival will get you:


  All the beer tastings that you can responsibly handle
  All the food from all the restaurants.


&#8220;Over 50 breweries and 50 restaurants will be in attendance.&#8221;

General admission tickets are $65.00 and get you in for three hours from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. The patron-level tickets get you in an hour early and get you into a special area for an additional hour.

In addition to having a heck of a time, your ticket purchase will fund some amazing research. The Sutton Avian Research Center played a crucial role in bringing the bald eagle off of the endangered animal list. More recently, they’ve been working with the Greater Prairie Chicken and the Masked Bobwhite Quail. For the Masked Bobwhite Quail, they incubate eggs, hatch them, then take the chicks to Mexico to mate and become released into the wild.

To get tickets to this wonderful event, head on over to wildbrew.org. Experience the restaurants, the beers, and the ciders. It’s going to be a great time and we would love to see you there. We’re very excited to sponsor this event.

If you have any other questions about the event or about real estate in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Without you, we wouldn’t be able to do what we love every single day and have fun doing it. For this, we want to say thank you. 

We’ve been able to help over 100 families buy or sell a home this year so far. What’s most exciting about this is it allows us to give back to our Tulsa community. Every time we help someone buy or sell a home, we make a commitment to donate to their favorite local nonprofit. On top of that, we donate to Keys to the City, which is a foundation that we set up that allows for strategic donation. 

&#8220;Without you, we wouldn’t be able to do what we love every single day and have fun doing it.&#8221;

For example, we’ve donated $500 to Global Gardens, Emergency Infant Services, and the Community Food Bank of Eastern Oklahoma. 

We also put together an event where we collected donations for Dress for Success. Every time we host one of these events to raise money for a local nonprofit, we have so much fun, so if you have a favorite local nonprofit, don’t hesitate to mention them to us. We’d be happy to include them in this initiative. 

We appreciate you very much, so if there’s anything you need from us or we can assist you in any way, give us a call or send us an email anytime. We’d love to speak with you.

        <description>

We all know that it’s important for a homebuyer to use a licensed real estate agent when buying a home. But do you know why? Today I will share three of the top reasons. 

1. We have the inventory. As real estate professionals, we have access to the multiple listing service (MLS), which is a database for Realtors. Of course, there are other websites out there that list houses for sale, but we all know that the MLS is the most up-to-date database for listings. Buyers who look for homes on other websites will only to be disappointed to find out they’re not available.

And, if we do not have the inventory, we have the tools and technologies and databases to help find you a home that fits all of your needs.

&#8220;When a seller lists their home on the market, they have already agreed to pay the buyer agent’s compensation.&#8221;

2. We have the negotiation skills. As a homebuyer, you may be hesitant to speak your mind on certain points, for fear of offending the seller.

With an agent on your side, you will get the best deal and terms, you will know what is normal, and you will know what to expect. We will keep you up to date on timelines to make sure that you do not miss out on an opportunity for inspections or appraisals.

3. A buyer agent is free. When a seller lists their home on the market, they have already agreed to pay the buyer agent’s compensation. There is no reason for you to do all of the work when you can use us. We can help you negotiate your best terms, hold the deal together to get you to closing on time, and provide you with all of our years of experience for free!

If you have any additional questions or are interested in buying, please feel free to call me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

        <description>

Today I am excited to bring you some important information about a great local organization: the Community Food Bank of Eastern Oklahoma. 

Eileen Bradshaw, the executive director of the Community Food Bank, joined me to explain a little bit about what they do. 

With approximately 450 partner programs, this organization helps to distribute food throughout the state. According to Eileen, about one in every four children goes to bed hungry at night. And, as we can all agree, this is unacceptable. 

“It’s part of our job just to make sure [these children] get what they need,” says Eileen.

It was truly amazing to get a behind-the-scenes look at operations here at the Community Food Bank. Especially because at the time of my visit, they were preparing for “Summer Feeding.” The Summer Feeding program is one way that they are able to continue providing for kids who rely on school meals at other times of the year. On day one of this program, they fed an estimated 1,100 children.

&#8220;Approximately one in every four children goes to bed hungry at night, so the work the Community Food Bank is doing is critical.&#8221;

The workers at the Food Bank are also delegating more resources to their partner programs, as they know that their lines grow longer in the summer months, as well. 

So, with as much as this organization does for our community, how can we give back and help them make a difference? Well, for every dollar donated, the Food Bank is able to produce four meals. Obviously, financial gifts are always welcomed. 

Of course, volunteering your time and donating food are also great ways to help.

So, if you want to get in touch with Eileen, you can give her a call at (918) 585-2800, or visit www.okfoodbank.org.

        <description>

It’s spring and that means it’s time to get our hands dirty in the garden. 

With that being said, today I’d like to discuss some pros and cons of a common gardening option: raised beds. 

One benefit of raised garden beds is simply that they’re nice to look at. Beyond that, raised beds also keep animals from getting to your garden. 

They also allow you to plant earlier, since the loose soil you fill the bed with will be warmer than the ground itself.

&#8220;The decision as to whether a raised bed is right for you depends on your preferences and circumstances.&#8221;

Now, let’s take a look at some of the downsides. 

First, they’re pricey. You’re going to have to invest in the bed, the materials, soil, and fertilizer to get started. Raised beds also aren’t as sustainable as simply planting your garden in the ground.

Ultimately, the decision as to whether a raised bed is right for you depends on your preferences and circumstances. And if you’re unsure, my friends over at Grogg’s Green Barn can help you decide what gardening solutions may work best for you.

As always, if you have any other questions for me or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Today I’m coming to you live from the downtown office of Emergency Infant Services (EIS) here in Tulsa to tell you a little bit about this great organization and what they do for our community. Joining me is EIS Executive Director Bill Andoe. 

For the last 40 years, the mission of EIS has been to serve families who are experiencing financial hardship and have children under the age of five. They provide clothing, diapers, groceries, formula, and other essential needs these families have. All these families have to do is meet with an EIS interviewer to assess their needs so they can determine which services they can provide and which community services might be available to them—even if their children are over five. 

Aside from their downtown location, they also have a location on the east side of Tulsa and two satellite locations on the north and south sides of town. Right now they’re in the middle of a capital campaign, so a year from this summer, they’ll be moving to 11th and Denver. This move will help them provide more resources for families, centralize their warehouse, and stockpile more supplies.

&#8220;Anyone is welcome at EIS.&#8221;

One thing in particular I love to share about EIS is anyone is welcome there. They provide their services with love and without judgement—it’s one of their founding principles. According to Bill, they average about 18,000 visits per year, and they expect that number to reach 20,000 in the near future. To help carry the loan, they have church groups, school groups, and a number of other regular volunteers who help them on a weekly basis. 

“We’re in this because we want to help,” Bill says. “That’s what attracts employees and volunteers to EIS. We often talk about the people who come in—we talk about professionally mentioning them statistically as clients, but they’re really more than just clients. They’re members of our community. They go to our churches. We see them at public events. They’re Tulsans just like us. We’re here to help them.”

EIS relies on the generosity of donors and the Tulsa community at large, so if you’d like to help them in their mission, they always welcome financial donations. They also accept diapers, wipes, car seats, strollers, and anything else a family with a young child might need. 

If you’d like to get in touch with EIS or you’d like more information on how to donate, you can visit their website at www.EISTulsa.org. 

As always, if you have any questions for me or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

        <description>

Decluttering is so important in getting your home ready to sell as well as just cleaning up for spring. Whatever your motivation, thinning out your home is a great way to feel good. Today let’s go through the seven steps it takes to declutter your home.

1. Make sure the front of your home is welcoming and encourages buyers to come inside. First impressions are everything. Buyers are probably going to find your home online first, and then they might even drive around the neighborhood to check it out. You’ll want to clear out any dead leaves and put some fresh mulch down. Be sure that there are no mud daubers or bird’s nests in your eaves. Pretend you’re a buyer and walk up to your front porch. What would you think? 

2. Take it one room at a time. Decluttering can be really overwhelming, so just start small. Thin out the things in your room and closet; think about what your room would look like in a photograph. What isn’t needed? Pictures will amplify those extra things on countertops and other areas. 

3. Decide what furniture you really need in the home. To make your property look like a model home, get rid of extra furniture and end tables.

4. Clean off countertops. These are common places for us to pile things up, but kitchens are very important rooms to make a good impression with. Put your toaster, blender, and other similar appliances away in a cabinet, and clear away other extraneous papers and tidbits.

&#8220;Think about what your room would look like in a photograph. What isn’t needed?&#8221;

5. Clean your shower. When we come to preview your home, we’re going to pull back the shower curtain. Be sure the grout is clean and that tiles or paint aren’t peeling. Your shower will tell buyers a lot about how you take care of your home.

6. Take away your collectibles. It’s great that you care about and collect things that are dear to your heart, but that can become a distraction to buyers. Go ahead and box it up and put it away.

7. Declutter the garage and storage sheds. If there are things in there that you need to keep on hand, put them in boxes or storage bins that are neat and organized.

All these things sound crazy, however, they make a lot of difference. A decluttered home will help you get the most money for your home in the shortest amount of time.

If you need any help with decluttering your home or have other questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you however I can.

Spring has sprung for us here in the Tulsa market. We’re very busy this time of year, so I wanted to take a short minute to talk about our listing shortage.

We need good, ready-to-move-in homes in the $150,000 to $250,000 price range. If you have a home that would match this criteria, please let us know so that we can help all of our buyers. We have more buyers than we have homes for sale that match their criteria.

&#8220;We need good, ready-to-move-in homes in the $150,000 to $250,000 price range.&#8221;

Another tool that we use is called “My Buyer Listings,” a website just for buyer listings. That means we’ve met with our buyers, we’ve qualified them, and they’re ready to go buy a home. They’re just not finding homes that match what they’re looking for. Be sure to check out our listings that we already have with buyers and let us know if this is the perfect time to put your home on the market in this price range. That way, you get to take advantage of the market by moving up—and that’s always a win.

If you have a home in this price range that you’d consider selling or if you have any other questions, please reach out to us and let us know how we can help you.

Maryann Donahue from Global Gardens is here today to share how this wonderful organization helps empower children in high-poverty areas of Tulsa.

Something that’s really important to us as a real estate team is giving back to our community, which is why we like to spotlight our local nonprofits that are doing great things in the Tulsa area. Today, I’m talking to Maryann Donahue from Global Gardens.

Global Gardens was created by a teacher from Tulsa named Heather Oakley [spelling?] in 2007. Heather had a background in urban science education and peace education. She also had a bachelors degree in botany. She combined all of those things to create Global Gardens.

The purpose of Global Gardens is to help fight the cycle of poverty and empower kids from high-poverty communities to be agents of change in their own lives and in their communities.

When Heather came back to Tulsa in 2007, she started the first program at Eugene Field. She offered during and after-school programs. At that time, there was an empty lot next to Eugene Field that was bare, empty, and forgotten. She and that first group of students turned it into a beautiful, bountiful garden, and that’s what Global Gardens has done ever since.

Since then, Global Gardens has added three more sites in addition to Eugene Field, including the one Maryann and I are filming from today. This field services Union Middle School and Union High School. There are two other elementary schools in the program as well: Rosa Parks Elementary and McAuliffe Elementary in East Tulsa.

&#8220;THE PURPOSE OF GLOBAL GARDENS IS TO HELP FIGHT THE CYCLE OF POVERTY AND EMPOWER KIDS.&#8221;

“We serve over 1,800 kids every week in this program,” says Maryann. “We’re helping about 2,500 people a year.”

Global Gardens uses gardening as a vehicle for empowerment. They also use gardening to teach science and how to be peaceful. “In the during-school program, they have a class garden. They get to decide what to plant, and they have a harvest party at the end of the year,” says Maryann. “They do all of that together. It’s very intentional.”

These programs teach science that addresses state science standards while also teaching teamwork. The students don’t have many opportunities outside of Global Gardens to do hands-on, real-world things and have to do them as a team.

We really believe that Global Gardens is doing a great thing. How can you help? Go to Global-Gardens.org to make an online donation. All of their funding is raised from community donations; they don’t have state contracts or charge fees.

Maryann says that Global Gardens hopes to add a fifth site at Jackson Elementary School in North Tulsa by 2019. This has been in the works for a while, so please consider helping them reach their goal.

I would like to thank Maryann for taking the time to talk to me today. You can learn more details about Global Gardens at Global-Gardens.org.

If you have any real estate questions or know another local nonprofit you think we should spotlight, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

Today, I want to talk about an incredible home cleaning business here in our town: Cleansing Rain.

When I asked how she got the idea to begin her business, owner Lacie Partney told me she wasn’t always such a neat and organized person.

According to Lacie, it all began when she returned to Tulsa after two years on the mission field. At that point in time, she was searching for something to do.

Since then, she’s found cleaning homes to be very fulfilling. She says it really helps her build relationships. On top of that, Lacie herself makes all of the natural cleaning products she uses.

&#8220;FROM YOUR ATTIC TO YOUR JUNK DRAWER, LACIE IS HAPPY TO HELP ANYONE DECLUTTER.&#8221;

This is just one of the things that help her stand out from other cleaning companies in town. She also loves to help people get more organized. From your attic to your junk drawer, Lacie is happy to help anyone declutter.

But, it doesn’t stop there. Once she helps her clients declutter their spaces, Lacie also helps them develop an organizational system that can be implemented into their specific lifestyle.

One thing Lacie highly recommends is to make use of vertical space. Instead of buying new furniture that takes up floor space, she suggests that people try to utilize their walls for storage, instead.

To learn more about Lacie and her business, you can visit her website at www.CleansingRain918.com.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

John Carter from John Carter Bathrooms is here today to answer a few questions about his business and some of the latest trends in bathroom remodels.

Today, I’m here with John Carter from John Carter Bathrooms. John has graciously agreed to answer some questions about his business.

How did you get into this business?

It started way back. I’m from Namibia and my father did remodeling. He taught me everything I know. I learned everything from scratch and got to love remodeling, which made me decide to make it a business.

I moved to the United States a couple of years ago and got a job like everybody else. Then I realized that I wouldn’t be able to work on my dreams, so I decided to start a remodeling business. I can do kitchens, bathrooms, and even build homes, but I wanted to focus on something special, so I learned how to specialize in bathrooms.

I love your story and that you are doing something you are passionate about, which is important to me as well. What makes you stand out from the competition?

There are a couple of things that make us different. First, we complete all projects on time and on budget. It is a top priority for us to work around your schedule and your finances. Second, all of our projects are designed to fit your size and your style. We don’t ask you to cut corners on the perfect remodel. Finally, we are the most available and we provide daily progress reports on what’s done, so you’re never left wondering what we did all day.

&#8220;YOU WILL GET DAILY PROGRESS REPORTS SO YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH WORK HAS BEEN DONE.&#8221;

What’s a new style or trend that you have noticed lately?

In kitchens, soapstone has been popular lately. We’ve been using it in bathrooms for a little bit. People do want to use quartz for their surfaces these days. There are a lot of new materials out there. People like wooden countertops as well.

For bathrooms, people stick to light, neutral colors. Those will last a long time. Back in the 80s, people made pink, green, and purple bathrooms. That doesn’t work. My job is to come into somebody’s home and put something in there with tile that will last. Technology has improved with tile and cement, so we can build up bathrooms that are mold-free and 100% waterproof, which is great.

How can someone get in touch with you about a remodel or to ask any questions?

My phone number is 918-574-4610 or look at my website, JohnCarterBathrooms.com. You can enter your information and get a free 3-D model of what your bathroom could look like at no cost to you.

Thank you to John for answering my questions. As always, if you have any real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

Today I’m here with Tamara Noel, owner of Luxe Furniture and Design, to discuss the products and services her company provides.

Today I’m here with Tamara Noel, owner of Luxe Furniture and Design, and I’m so excited for her to share with you all the great things they have here at Luxe.

Along with beautiful furniture and decor, Luxe also offers a great design service that’s complimentary with purchase. When you shop there, you get to work with a qualified, educated, and talented interior designer to help you every step of the way.

They’re not just salespeople who are knowledgeable about all the products Luxe offers; they are honestly legitimate design experts. The designers went to school to learn the skill and have spent their entire career honing the craft. They love what they do, and they’re very good at it.

When somebody walks through the door with a need, what does the process of helping them look like?

It could be anything from one of the designers helping the client navigate the store to identify their wants and needs to schedule a house call where someone isn’t quite sure what they’re looking for or they have a larger project they don’t know how to start.

&#8220;THE HELP OF A DESIGNER CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE.&#8221;

Our designers make complimentary house calls out to your home. They’ll do all the measuring, look at your paint colors, work with what pieces you already have, give guidance on space planning, give direction for new pieces, and more. It could be something as simple as window treatments, but whatever it is, the help of a designer can make all the difference.

We do a lot in stages. It may just be planning for the big picture—doing a few changes now and a little bit more down the road to ultimately get the look that you want.

What are you seeing in terms of design trends?

Clean lines are still key here in Tulsa. It’s becoming a transitional market, but neutrals are still very popular, and a lot of the taupes of years past are coming back. Adding in a little bit of fun with texture or a pop of color is a good way to brighten up your space.

How can people get in touch with you?

You can find us in our showroom at 9922 Riverside Parkway in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in the King’s Landing Shopping Center. You can also visit our website www.luxetulsa.com, give us a call at (918) 459-8950, or like us on Facebook.

As always, if you need anything in terms of real estate from the Wolek Group, please feel free to reach out to us. Have a great day!

The mission of The Parent Child Center of Tulsa is to prevent child abuse and neglect through education, treatment, and advocacy.

Today I’m excited to be joined by special guest Carey Baker. I had the opportunity to ask Carey some questions about her involvement with The Parent Child Center of Tulsa. Her and her husband, Brett Baker, are Co-chairs for Toyland Ball 2018.

The Toyland Ball, held every January, is The Parent Child Center of Tulsa’s annual signature fundraising event. This black tie gala featuring a whimsical theme offers an elegant evening of dinner and dancing, with a live auction.

I caught up with Carey at the Toyland Ball Stock the Bar Party where attendees bring a bottle of wine valued at $50 or more to be auctioned off at the Toyland Ball 2018 in January. In past years, the wine auctioned off at the event in January has raised between $8,000 and $10,000 for The Parent Child Center of Tulsa. That is just the money raised from auctioning the wine. There are other items that are auctioned off that raise even more money for the cause.

For those of you who may not know, the mission of The Parent Child Center of Tulsa is to prevent child abuse and neglect through education, treatment, and advocacy. People who have been victims of abuse or neglect are given education and counseling so that they are able to end the cycle. Many people only know what they’ve been taught, so The Parent Child Center of Tulsa aims to reverse this.

If you’re interested in attending, the Toyland Ball auction will take place on January 20th, 2018 at the Cox Business Center. For tickets, visit www.ParentChildCenter.org. You can also become a patron sponsor by donating $1,000 for two people.

At the event, there will be raffles, an auction, and a live band. Also, all of the proceeds go directly to the counseling funds for The Parent Child Center of Tulsa.

We hope you have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

I’m on the hunt for an investment property in the TU/Midtown area. These kinds of properties are hard to find, so I’d love your help.

Usually, I’m the one helping buyers. Today though, I’m the one who’s buying.

I’m looking to buy an investment property around the TU/Midtown area for anywhere up to $125,000. I would love one that has three bedrooms, but I’d be fine with two bedrooms as well. One or 1.5 bathrooms would be ideal.

Midtown is a great place to live, so these kinds of properties are hard to find. If you’re thinking about selling your home and don’t have it on the market yet, I would love to talk to you and see if I could be your buyer.

&#8220;I WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO YOU AND SEE IF I COULD BE YOUR BUYER.&#8221;

If you know of anyone else making a move from or selling an investment property that’s already being leased in that area, don’t hesitate to send them my way.

If you have any questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call at (918) 712-2252 or send me an email at info@TheWolekGroup.com. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

I’m back again to highlight another great business here in town. We’re getting into the holiday spirit today at Saks Fifth Avenue. Candra Monck joined me to discuss holiday gift ideas, style advisors, and some fun events they have coming up at the store.

First, let’s take a look at some great holiday gift ideas, all of which are available in the store:

• Artist makeup brushes. Not only is this set of brushes gorgeous, they are light and easy to use as well.
• Dyson hairdryer. This is a brand new product from Dyson. They have taken their air circulation and noise-canceling technology to the hairdryer market.
• Chanel skin regeneration set.

If you have somebody on your list that’s a little bit harder to buy for, Candra recommends giving one of their style advisors a call. They know the ins and outs of everything that the store carries. Candra even uses these advisors herself.

&#8220;KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR ALL OF THEIR UPCOMING EVENTS ON THEIR FACEBOOK PAGE.&#8221;

There are a ton of great events coming up at Saks Fifth Avenue Tulsa. They include visits from national makeup artists, spa days, complimentary makeovers, makeup lessons, and more.

The best way to contact them is through their Facebook page, which they are constantly updating with events, deals, and more.

If you’ve struggled to find your dream home by searching on your own, we have a proactive solution that may be the answer you need: buyer listings.

Today I wanted to tell you about our buyer listings.

We’ve had many buying clients who have either exhausted the market because they just can’t find what they’re looking for, or they aren’t ready to move right this minute.

We have come up with a plan to proactively search for listings for our buying clients. We call this our buyer listings.

Just like we do for sellers, when we gather all the information on the property and market it on the MLS, our websites, and social media, we do the same thing for our buyer clients.

We have a website set up specifically to host all of these properties for our buyers, and we definitely push those listings out to our social media avenues and networks as well.

&#8220;IT’S KIND OF LIKE A DATING GAME BUT FOR A HOME.&#8221;

It’s kind of like a dating game but for a home. We are so excited to help match you up with a great home you’d be interested to move to.

Even if you’re just starting to think about the buyer search or you’ve been searching online with no luck, go ahead and get with us. We’ll have a consultation where we talk about all your wants and dreams and get you set up on our website so we can help you find your perfect home.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call at (918) 712-2252 or send me an email at info@TheWolekGroup.com. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

We’re out at Grogg’s Green Barn today with owner Carla Grogg. She’s going to talk to us a bit about what they do.

Today I’m happy to be joined by Carla Grogg of Grogg’s Green Barn. This place is so cool, so I wanted to talk a little bit with Carla about all the things that are going on here.

Carla and her husband started Grogg’s Green Barn seven years ago. As far as I know, this business is the only one of its kind in Tulsa. Carla and her husband started Grogg’s Green Barn, an all-sustainable organic nursery, after a few of their family members were affected by cancer, causing them to take their own health more seriously.

Grogg’s Green Barn carries all kinds of perennials, trees, shrubs, and more. Additionally, they have quite a selection of edibles, like berry bushes, fruit trees, vegetables, and herbs. They also have a ton of great pollination plants, which are becoming more and more important as bee and butterfly populations continue to dwindle.

&#8220;YOU NEED TO COME DOWN AND CHECK THIS PLACE OUT.&#8221;

Just this year, Grogg’s has added another component to their business. They are transitioning part of their facility to be a new dining facility: The Reserve at Grogg’s Green Barn. They will use their own produce as well as meat and dairy from other local farmers to prepare delicious meals from Chef Matt Owen. You can RSVP to the next dinner right here on their site.

I highly recommend that you come down here and check out Grogg’s Green Barn. To learn more about what they do, head on over to their website. If you have any questions, you can give Carla a call at (918) 994-4222.

If you have any real estate questions or needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’re always here to help.

        <description>

When you encounter an offer that is lower than asking price, it’s common to negotiate.
Do not take the low offer personally.

Today, I’m going to give my two cents on a topic that keeps coming up in our business. I know if you’ve watched my videos in the past, I say the same things over and over again. That just because we sell lots and lots of houses and we get to help lots and lots of people. We have a lot of experience with this.

I am still primarily the listing agent for our team, so I mostly work with sellers. I receive offers from agents that are working with buyers, and so many times these offers come in lower than the listing price, and sometimes with other concessions built in, such as closing costs and warranties.

I will admit that sometimes, I’m a little shocked at some of the offers we get.

Then I remember that in a buyer’s mind, they are doing the best that they can for their family. Of course they want to make a lower offer, because they feel like it’s their job to negotiate.

Well, as an agent, that’s also part of our job: to best prepare our clients and to explain the market to them.

When we receive these lower offers or offers that have different contingencies built in, it’s our job to settle the client (the seller) and explain to them that these are expected—low offers like these are the norm.

&#8220;I WILL ADMIT THAT SOMETIMES, I’M A LITTLE SHOCKED AT SOME OF THE OFFERS WE GET.&#8221;

I’ll admit it: I forget that you guys don’t do this every day like I do. I do need to slow down and understand where you’re coming from, because as a seller, you are working to get your best deal and to put the most money in your pocket. That is my goal for you, too.

However, I do know that I’m studying the market all the time and monitoring the average list-to-sales price of the MLS, how we can put the most money in your pocket and at the same time, get your home sold.

An offer early on may be a little lower than you were planning on, and yet, if it doesn’t sell, how much longer will you have it?

Remember that the process of selling is a negotiation. Please do not ever reject an offer; you have to do a little bit of negotiating to show that you want to sell your house. The buyer is working to get their best number, and you’re working to get your best number, so sometimes you have to get together in the middle somewhere.

That’s our goal: to get you the most money, and for the buyers to get the best deal. At the same time, we have to work together to achieve your real estate dreams.

Let me know if this was helpful to you, and if you have any questions, give me call! I’d love to speak with you.

Our market is shifting, but if you’re a home seller, it’s still an ideal time to put your home on the market as long as you price it correctly.

Our market is starting to shift, so what does that mean for you?

We’re at the end of the summer rush and the kids are back in school. Typically during this time of year, our market experiences a slight downturn before encountering another uptick in early fall. This is a seasonal trend that happens every year—the real estate market always works in cycles, after all.

We don’t know what’s going to happen beyond this cycle, but I do know there are buyers and sellers in the market all the time looking to make a move. I also know from years of experience that it’s always about price.

This means if you’re a seller, it’s still an ideal time to sell—you just have to price your home correctly. This will give you your best chance at attracting a buyer early on, getting the most money in your pocket, and moving onto where you want to go. Pricing right from the start is everything, and we call this “pricing ahead of the market.” When we get together and examine the numbers, we analyze what’s happened with sales in the recent past and what’s happening currently with your competition.

&#8220;REAL ESTATE IS A CONTEST—ARE YOU GOING TO WIN?&#8221;

Real estate is a contest—are you going to win? Are you going to be the No. 1 or No. 2 house buyers have to choose from in your area? Buyers buy homes that offer the most value. Do you have all the nice amenities, updates, and features that the other homes you’re competing with have? If not, you need to offset that by offering a better price.

You have only one opportunity, and that’s early on in the listing period. That’s where you’ll see the most amount of activity, and that’s when you need to capture a buyer.

Whether you’re thinking about selling or buying a house in our market, we’d love to help you out. Just give me a call or send me an email and I’d be happy to speak with you.

As we start to see our local market trend away from the seller’s market we’ve been enjoying, it’s more important than ever to stay educated about what’s going on locally.

We are seeing a shift in our market. I know that some people might have a little fear about that word, but we are always seeing shifts in this market throughout the year. As real estate agents, we are always prepared for these types of shifts.

Based on the last few months, we’re seeing a bit of a change in the market. You’ve heard me talk about home sales above $200,000 slowing down. Homes in the $100,000 to $200,000 price range which have been selling within days over the last few months have also seen a slowdown in sales as well.

We have put great homes on the market in the last month in the $150,000 to $185,000 price range that I thought for sure would be easy sellers, and they haven’t sold as quickly as we thought.

If you’re a consumer, just know that the market is always changing. You should always pay attention to what’s happening locally, and pay less attention to what’s happening on a national scale. There are other markets in different parts of the country that aren’t seeing the same type of shift that we’re seeing locally.

&#8220;BASED ON THE LAST FEW MONTHS, WE’RE SEEING A BIT OF A CHANGE IN THE MARKET.&#8221;

Here at the Wolek Group, we make sure to pay attention to those local trends and statistics. All the Keller Williams agents in town do their best to ensure that we’re sharing the same message to the consumers. We want to be open and honest about what’s going on, especially now that we’re starting to move away from the seller’s market we’ve been enjoying for quite awhile.

Make sure that you’re choosing an agent that is really researching the market and understands what’s going on in your neighborhood. As a final note, I wanted to assure you that homes still are selling, so don’t be afraid of the market if you’re looking to dive in. Just make sure to be educated on what’s going on.

As we start to see our local market trend away from the seller’s market we’ve been enjoying, it’s more important than ever to stay educated about what’s going on locally.

The moving and real estate industries have a lot in common. I recently spoke with Julie Woolslayer about some tips and tricks of the moving process.

I was recently joined by Julie Woolslayer of Great Day Moving, who you may remember from past conversations we’ve had.

She and her husband have a great business that I’ve used personally and also that I’ve referred to multiple clients.

The moving industry is very much related to the business of real estate, so I wanted to give Julie the chance to present some tips and tricks for moving.

First of all, Julie recommends that you should always start early in the process. If you think you’re moving, decluttering will help you for a number of reasons. Not only does it prepare a home for showing but it also makes it easier on you when it comes time to move your belongings.

Get as much help as you can from friends and family members when you undertake the task of organizing and decluttering your home. One tip that Julie recommended on the matter was to read the book “It’s All Too Much” by Peter Walsh. It’s full of great tips on how to organize and get rid of items in your home.

You may even want to enlist the help of professional organizers. The bottom line is that there is a lot of help available—you just need to get motivated and get started.

&#8220;THERE IS A LOT OF HELP AVAILABLE—YOU JUST NEED TO GET MOTIVATED AND GET STARTED.&#8221;

This process is especially helpful for sellers who are downsizing. Julie and her team are more than happy to talk to people undergoing the downsizing process in order to assess what kind of help will be most useful to them. She also mentioned Settled In—a company she’s worked with in the past that helps clients decide what to take and what to leave in a move.

Julie also has a plan for people who are unable to move into their new home right away but need to move their items out of their old home.

In situations like these, Great Day Moving partners with another Tulsa business: Premier Logistics. Premier Logistics has trucks and trailers available for rent, which Great Day Moving then loads and stores at their 24-hour secured lot for as long as the seller might need.

Then, once it is time to move, Great Day Moving brings the truck on site to the new home and unloads it as they would during any other moving process.

Overall, Julie works hard to offer moving solutions. In fact, if you call and tell our scheduler Kelsey that you saw this video, you can save $75 off on any move over two hours.

If you’d like to reach out to Julie you can contact her by calling (918) 877-1971 or by visiting GreatDayMoving.com.

If I can answer any other questions or you’d like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you, soon.

Team building is today’s hot topic because our buyer division is exploding and we need help.

I wanted to reach out to see if you know anyone who has been in the real estate business for a couple years but not finding the success they’re looking for, or they’re looking to hook up with a great team. Our buyer specialist needs help showing our houses to buyers, so we’re looking for a showing agent.

&#8220;WE'RE LOOKING TO ADD A TEAM MEMBER WHO CAN TAKE CARE OF THE FUN PART OF REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.&#8221;

As a showing agent, you’ll get to do the fun part of real estate: opening doors for clients and helping them check out homes.

We’re looking to build our team with a member who has been looking to get into real estate or has their license already. If you or someone you know fits the bill, reach out to us so we can connect! We’d love your help.

Just give us a call or send us an email soon. I look forward to hearing from you!

Our Homekeepr app is a must-have for homeowners. These are just a few of the features it has.

If you’re a homeowner and you haven’t already, you need to download our Homekeepr app. It’s got so many different uses, but I wanted to highlight some of its best features today.

One is maintenance reminders for your home. Whether you need to have your furnace filter changed or it’s time to clean out your gutters, this app will remind you at regular intervals to do those things. There are so many things that we can forget to do around the house, but this app stays on top of things for you.

Another awesome feature is our directory. Within it, you’ll find all of our preferred service providers. These are people we have vetted, people we have worked with, and people we trust to give you fair prices and great customer service. All of their contact information is located right here within the app.

&#8220;OUR DIRECTORY IS FULL OF REPUTABLE, VETTED SERVICE PROVIDERS.&#8221;

Finally, it can be stressful trying to keep or remember where you put certain receipts, manuals, and home improvement plans. If your phone has a camera, you can just take a picture of these documents and save them right in the app. You can then access the documents from any device or desktop.

If you’re a small business owner or service provider who’s interested in being one of our partners, give us a call or send us an email today.

If you have any other questions for us or you’re looking to buy or sell in Tulsa anytime soon, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
