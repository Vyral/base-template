        <description>

Here are the two best upgrades a property owner can make.

If you’re a homeowner looking to spruce up your unit a bit, what updates offer the best bang for your buck? The average home in Hawaii is usually anywhere from 40 to 60 years old—wow, that’s my age; I need an update! 

Jokes aside, you can’t just take your 60-year-old unit and put it on the market for rent. It won’t rent, and if it does, it won’t rent for a lot of money. So where should you invest your time and money? 

1. Flooring. Always put some vinyl product down in your house (tile is also an option, but it’s a little more expensive). If your carpet is weathered or your laminate is old, put down some vinyl; it’s not that costly and has a 25-year shelf life. 

2. Air conditioning. People that come from the mainland cannot take our humidity. Trust me, I know this from experience: I lived on the mainland for a while, and when I moved back home, I simply couldn’t sleep without air conditioning. Here in Hawaii, there’s a roughly 50/50 shot that you’ll find a home equipped with air conditioning. In my experience, the houses without air conditioning rent last. 

If you have questions on these two updates, or would like us to put in contact with some of our talented in-house handymen or trusted contractors, give us a call or send an email. We’re happy to help!

        <description>

We offer owners an eviction guarantee. Here’s what that means.

Here at HI Pacific Property Management, we offer you an eviction guarantee. This states that if you choose to put a tenant we approve of in your unit and they later need to be evicted, we will pay for the legal eviction costs. We’re the only property management group that offers this guarantee. I stand by our work, and we do such a great job with background checks that we’ve only had to use this guarantee once. 

We’ve been in business for 10 years, have tons of units, and all we do is property management. Yes, even with all that, we’ve only had to pay for an eviction once. In fact, we offer three guarantees to owners: eviction, rent, and communication guarantees, which you can read more about on our website.

Give us a call or send an email if you have any questions about the eviction guarantee or property management. We would love to speak with you.

        <description>

I’m explaining why walk-throughs are crucial and how we do them.

What is a walk-through? Why would we need to walk through your property? The truth is, several rental owners have switched to us because no one has walked through their property in years. How would anyone know what’s going on there if someone doesn’t walk through it? 

“Walk-throughs are crucial.”

As a property manager, this is the most important part of my job. When I do walk-throughs, I’m looking for damage, illegal tenants, and abuse. I’m looking for all these things in about a 10-minute walk-through with your tenants twice a year. If you allow pets in the house, we’ll walk through it three times per year. 

Walk-throughs are crucial because we can tell if the tenant is living according to the rules, if they’re overly dirty, if there’s drug use, illegal alterations, and more. These are great times to catch whether any of these things are happening and protect your property. You will get a report from us with pictures stating how the property is doing, how it looks, and what we saw from the tenants.

If you have any questions about walk-throughs or property management in general, please call or email me. I would be happy to speak with you.

        <title>Q: Should I Replace the Carpet?</title>

        <description>

If you have carpet in your rental property, it may be time to replace it.

I get asked all the time by rental owners if they should replace the carpet in their properties with wood, vinyl, or tile. My answer to these questions is always yes. 

“The average life of carpet is two to three tenants.”

Carpet has gone out of style over the last decade. Many tenants with children ask if we have houses available without carpet because they can’t be sure of what kind of care was taken with the carpet before they moved into the house. Also, children will usually be much harder on carpet than adults. A lot of owners will have damage or wear and tear, and the average life of carpet is two to three tenants. 

Today many floor products are being made harder, water-resistant, or waterproof. I believe vinyl is the best flooring for rental properties; it has the most variation, a 25-year warranty, and it’s often waterproof. You can have a huge water spill in your house and have no damage or wood issues like bowing of the edges. Tile is also great, but it’s very expensive to lay, though it has a shelf life of about 50 years. 

My recommendation is to switch to waterproof vinyl if it’s time to change the flooring in your house. There are many products out there, so you can choose what’s best for your property. 

If you have questions about flooring or property management, please call or email us. We would love to speak with you. Aloha!

I’m sharing our methods for keeping clients healthy amid COVID-19.

Today I’m sharing some of the protocols we’ve put in place to combat the pandemic. We’re doing showings via video on a variety of platforms so tenants don’t need to be there in person. However, if they insist on seeing it physically or with an agent, we open the doors for them, walk away to give them privacy, and everyone wears masks and gloves. We try not to do face-to-face interactions, but if for some reason we need to, we keep six feet of distance between us. All the property managers that work for us know our protocols and will enforce them. To learn more about how we’re keeping everyone healthy, watch the short video above.

Here’s how to handle insurance claims as a rental property owner.

Today’s message is all about insurance claims and what to do if damage happens. If you’re turning your house into a rental property, you should have renters insurance, homeowners insurance, and loss of rent insurance. Water damage is the most frequent type of damage to a home, and it usually happens when there’s a leak. A valve could fail, or a tub or toilet overflows and then you have a water problem. However, water damage isn’t the only type to be concerned about. To learn more about insurance claims and damage, watch the short video above.

Curfews have been invoked in Hawaii; here’s how our business has changed.

COVID-19 protocols are going to change the way that we do business. Unfortunately for us here in Hawaii, a curfew was just implemented, meaning that no one is allowed on the roads between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. We’ve already sent out information regarding how homeowners can expect our business practices to change with quarantine rules in mind, and new tenants coming into our system can expect to sign some extra paperwork. To learn more about how we’ve had to adapt to these recent challenges, watch the short video above.

Although the March real estate numbers were not significantly affected by the coronavirus pandemic, I believe that we will see some repercussions in the months to come.

We’ve actually had a good year so far and we hope you have too. During this pandemic, it has been so complicated to do business in all sectors of the economy, but especially in real estate. The good news is that real estate and property management have been deemed essential businesses and we’re working our hardest to ensure that we keep moving forward and doing business. There are going to be some effects on the real estate market, but we may not know what those effects are for the next six months or so. To learn more about how I think COVID-19 might affect the real estate market, watch the short video above.

What’s in store for us in the coming summer? Here are my thoughts.

With the stay-at-home orders in place to combat the spread of the pandemic, it brings up a very important question: What is this summer going to look like? Typically, as schools let out for the summer, the market tends to heat up. However, this year is sure to be a little different from the typical summer; the pandemic is going to shake everything up. To learn what that will mean for our market, watch the short video above.

        <description>

For our properties, pest control is the tenant’s responsibility, except when they first move into the house.

For any property owners who decide to leave their homes under our care, we always tell them the same thing regarding pest control: It’s the tenant’s responsibility, except when they first move into the property. 

Specifically, if they find pests within the first 10 to 20 days of moving in, the problem has to be taken care of at the owner’s expense. After the initial move-in period, it shifts to the tenant’s expense. 

As you know, our last video blog was about termites, and oftentimes, the cabinets that are brought into condos or townhomes come from outside Hawaii. The walls and grounds of those properties can be treated, but any outside furniture and the moving boxes encasing them can carry termites. We’ve seen plenty of infestations occur after tenants move in because of this, so it’s something you need to know. 

As always, if you have questions about this or any other property management topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

        <description>

Termites are one of the worst things to have in your home. Today I’m sharing my advice on how to handle this problem.

When I have to be the bearer of bad news to homeowners and tell them we’ve found termites, that’s really the worst news a person can get in Hawaii. That’s because, if you’re part of a townhome or condo situation, most of the time you can’t tent the building, you can only spot-treat the issue. That’s a challenging situation. If you’re a single-family homeowner, you can consider tenting the entire house, but it’s problematic if you have a tenant because they’ll likely have to find other living arrangements during that time.

Termites can eat up to five pounds of wood per week! My advice is to tent the property or have someone spot-treat the problem immediately. Termites are the most formidable adversary we have in Hawaii. Another problem is, many people try to put off termite treatment and then end up having widespread damage to their homes. 

“Termites can eat up to five pounds of wood per week!”

I always try to tell homeowners the bad news myself, as it’s the right thing to do. 

If you have a termite situation, or you know of one in a house, feel free to call or email me. I would be glad to discuss your options. Also, as usual, contact me if you have any questions about property management in general. I’m here to help.

        <title>How HI Pacific Property Management Handles Maintenance Calls</title>

        <description>

Here’s how we handle maintenance calls for our property owners.

If you’re a property owner thinking of managing your property yourself, what are you going to do when you get a maintenance call? 

We at HI Pacific Property Management average around three maintenance calls a day, seven days a week, most of which come after 4 p.m. or on the weekends. If you manage your own property, you’ll get at least three maintenance calls per lease year. Since you’re required by law to have an on-island representative, do you have someone you trust to handle this type of thing? Someone who knows plenty of insured vendors? 

If not, let me tell you how we handle maintenance calls.

Maintenance calls from tenants are channeled through our portal system. An email gets sent to me and the property manager before being directed to the maintenance department, which is on-call daily from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Property managers are free to handle the problem however they want, but 99% of the time, they ask us to take care of it. Our maintenance department contacts the tenant and one of our vendors and puts them in communication. You then get a notification once the job is complete. 

“Since you’re required by law to have an on-island representative, do you have someone you trust to handle this type of thing?”

We have hundreds of rentals, so we have a whole host of vendors who can service your home at a moment’s notice. Since we keep our maintenance department in-house, we can oversee the process and immediately resolve any issues. If one of our vendors makes a bad diagnosis, most of them will give you a credit. 

Property management is all we do, and maintenance is part of the job. If you have us take care of your property, I promise you that we’ll do our very best. Remember, there are only two reasons for me to be in your home: to protect it and to put money in your account. 

As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic or you are thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m happy to help.

        <description>

A new law was recently passed pertaining to homes that contain six or more bedrooms and take up 60% or more of a lot’s size. Here’s what you need to know.

The new monster home law just passed in Hawaii. It states that if a home’s size takes up 60% or more of the lot, you’re going to have some new specific guidelines on how to build it. You can read more about them in the building department’s new requirements for monster homes.

This law has just been changed after already having been changed last year. With the latest change, monster homes are going to be much harder to build, both legally and illegally: builders who build monster homes occupying more than 60% of the lot size and containing more than six bedrooms will now incur penalties.

We have a ton more information on this that we’d be happy to share with you. If you’d like to read through it, or if you have any other questions, feel free to reach out via phone or email and we’d be happy to help you.

        <description>

What is renters insurance and why is it important for your tenants to have it? 

Renters insurance is the insurance your tenants get to protect them from any losses or hotel bills they may have to cover. 

If, for instance, you have a termite problem or a water leak and you need to move your tenants out for a bit to make some repairs, they’ll likely have to stay at a hotel, and they’ll use their renter’s insurance policy to pay for it. Or, if one of your tenants has some type of accident that damages your property, they’ll use their renters insurance to cover that too.

“Getting renters insurance from tenants keeps money in your account.”

At Hawaii Pacific Property Management, we require all of our tenants to get a minimum coverage of $50,000 in liability and $10,000 in loss. For tenants who have a pet that’s considered a “dangerous breed,” we require $100,000 worth of coverage. 

This is mandated to protect you, as well. As I’ve said before, there are two reasons for us to be in your house: to protect your property and put money into your account. Getting renters insurance from tenants keeps money in your account. 

If you have any more questions about renters insurance, I advise that you contact your insurance carrier. If you have any more questions for me, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to help you.

        <description>

Property management companies can be distinguished by the services they offer. One add-on to our services that we offer you, the owner, that you won’t find just anywhere is the “eviction guarantee.”

If you’re unfamiliar with how this guarantee works, allow me to explain: If we put a tenant in your property, and they must be legally evicted by way of Hawaii’s landlord-tenant code, we promise to pay all legal fees.  

This puts a check on us and ensures that we don’t become complacent in our selection of tenant applicants. In fact, this is a chief reason why I got into this business—I could never find a property manager that could be held responsible for this painstaking process. 

“If we put a tenant in your property, and they must be legally evicted by way of Hawaii’s landlord-tenant code, we promise to pay all legal fees.”

It’s our job to be diligent in conducting background checks and to make the necessary calls up front. Otherwise, we risk letting in a tenant in that is evasive about rent payments or worse. Ask yourself: Who pays for that? If you’re with any other property manager, you’ll be on the hook for legal costs relating to the eviction, and I’ve seen that run anywhere from $1,000 to $6,000. 

What will you get with us? 

We’ll run checks on their background, credit, income statements, LES statement, their job contract, and we’ll also check with their last two landlords. These sorts of checks are all very important, and, along with our eviction guarantee, they’re part of the package when you work with us. 

If you have any questions regarding the eviction guarantee and what we can do for you, as an owner, please give us a call at 808-445-9223. I look forward to speaking with you and answering your questions directly!

When our team notices a pest problem in a property under our care, this immediately indicates two things:

The unit wasn’t properly cleaned

It’s time to call a professional pest controller

No tenant wants to pay rent on a property that has a pest problem, so any such issues must be resolved immediately.

“No tenant wants to pay rent on a property that has a pest problem”

When we identify a pest problem within the first 10 days following our initial walkthrough, we ask that the owner handles the initial treatment. If a problem arises at any point after this window, though, the tenant is responsible.

We recommend contacting a local pest professional if you have any additional questions about pest control.

As always, if you have any questions for us or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

As your property management company, we take care of pictures and videos of your property for you.

Pictures and videos are very important. If your car is not washed and shiny, it doesn’t look its best. We make sure that your unit is clean and vacant before we send a professional photographer in to take pictures and video.

We also promise and commit to taking new pictures and videos every time your unit goes vacant. We need to have everything date-stamped for the court system. In case an unfortunate event happens and we have to evict somebody, we need before and after pictures at the ready.

“We commit to taking new pictures and videos every time your unit goes vacant.”

These pictures come as part of our service at no cost to the owner. We’ll take pictures each time we get a new tenant in as part of our 10% fee. There are no rental fees, rental buffers, or maintenance buffers.

If you have any questions, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

Credit protection is an incredibly important subject to those of who use credit in our daily lives. Recently, the Equifax data breach impacted 145 million people’s credit.

Good credit is extremely valuable these days. As an owner and a business manager in the rental management business, I can tell you that we always check credit.

We won’t accept people with a credit score below 620, which just goes to show how important your credit score is.

Personally, I recommend that you research the Equifax credit breach. Do so as soon as possible. Being unaware of your circumstances would be a huge mistake. With approximately 350 million people living in America, a massive portion of the population has been affected.

“Don’t wait until it’s too late.”

Having protection like LifeLock could make a big difference in the security of your credit. Don’t wait until it’s too late. Correcting your credit score can take between 60 to 90 days.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

This month, I want to talk to you about some of the things we do to protect our property owners.

We have two reasons to be in your house: to protect your home and to put money in your account.

I live by those models, and I make all my decisions based on those two reasons to be in your home and manage your home.

If you do decide to use us, one of the things we do is a walkthrough. If we allow pets in your home, we will walk through the house every four months. We’ll get a picture of the pet and send it to you and get your approval before we even consider putting the pet in your home. If there is no pet (or a pet like a fish that won’t affect the flooring), we’ll come through every six months.

“We have two reasons to be in your house: to protect your home and to put money in your account.”

Walkthroughs are so important, for a couple of reasons:

1. They let the tenant know that we are looking out for the owners.

2. We’ll send the owners pictures of anything that’s affected by the tenant—if there is any damage in the house that we find on our walkthroughs, we will give the tenant a 10-day warning. If they don’t correct the issues within 10 days, then we’ll terminate the lease. This is listed on the lease agreement with the tenant, and they’ll sign their move-in addendum up front, as well as a pet addendum, even if they don’t have one.

Owners, we’re looking out for you. You are our first and only concern because you pay our bills, and I appreciate that. Please feel free to call me if you have any questions. Aloha!

        <description>

A rent guarantee is something no one else in Hawaii does, but we do.

This guarantee essentially means that we guarantee the amount of rent we can pay you as an owner.

If you’re thinking that’s crazy, that’s because it is. That’s how confident I am that our vetting and advertising processes will rent your home quickly.

We put our rent guarantee in writing once we’re face to face and after I’ve seen the home, its condition, and the surrounding neighborhood. If we advertise the home for 30 days or more under the terms of the guarantee and we don’t secure a tenant, we’ll pay you.

“We’re the only ones who provide a rent guarantee.”

We also provide an eviction guarantee that states if we vet our own tenant to rent your property and there’s an eviction, we will cover the cost.

Lastly, we provide a communication guarantee that acts as our promise that we’ll always be there to pick up the phone for you. I get a lot of business from a lot of other property managers because they didn’t do the same for their clients. You’ll have the property manager’s number as well as my own and our office’s.

If you have any questions or want to give this rent guarantee a shot, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.

Water leaks are one of the biggest pains we have in the home rental business. Here’s how you can avoid them before they even happen.

Water leaks are probably the most menacing opponent we face in the home rental business. If you’re a homeowner/investor, I highly suggest getting additional rent loss coverage on your home for this specific purpose.

If you end up having a big leak, you’ll have to bear the full brunt of it most of the time. If we have a flooded unit, we have a tenant who can’t reside there. We will then have to immediately dry the unit out. However, that process takes three to five days to complete. During that time, you won’t be collecting any rent.

“HALF OF OUR LEAKS RESULT IN INSURANCE CLAIMS.”

About half of our leaks result in insurance claims. The sooner we can get to them, the better. If you end up having to lose rent for a month or two, it will be offset by the money you saved by having that extra insurance.

If you have any questions for us or you’re thinking about investing in real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

You can choose whether you want to allow pets in your rental property. Here’s what we recommend.

One of the most common questions we get from homeowners is if they have to allow pets in their rental home. The answer is no. It’s totally up to you what kind of pets, if any, you will allow in your home.

However, keep in mind that eight out of 10 people in today’s market have pets. Especially when rent is up a little higher and families are out there looking. Most families have one or two children and one or two pets. It just comes with the territory.

If you do choose to allow pets in your home, our addendum helps protect you. We’ll go inspect the property every four months and look for pet damage, as well as any other damage. We’ll send you pictures of any damage, as well as a picture of the pet in the home.

“OUR ADDENDUM PROTECTS YOU FROM PET DAMAGE.”

We don’t take our pet policy lightly. We’re here to protect your home and put money in your account. If you don’t want to allow pets, that’s fine, but just know that you’ll be missing out on a huge part of the market and it might take us longer to find a tenant than normal.

If you have any other questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out. We would love to hear from you soon.

If a tenant leaves food out in the house and a rodent problem develops, who is responsible for pest control: the owner or the tenant?

Find Out How Much Your Home Will Rent For in Today’s Market

Pests can be a formidable adversary. Their job is to come into your house and find whatever food and water they can.

That’s why pest control is an incredibly important subject for tenants and owners.

As an owner, it is totally optional to carry pest control through the lease period of the tenants. That said, our addendum states that pest control is covered by the tenant.

Pest control includes rodent control. The owner has no control if tenants leave out food, which attracts pests—so they should not be held responsible. If rodent control is an ongoing problem mentioned in the owner’s interview, I would recommend that you continue to carry rodent control in your house.

“THE OWNER IS NOT THE ONE WHO ATTRACTED THE PESTS, SO THE OWNER DOES NOT INCUR THE COSTS OF PEST CONTROL.”

Rodents are brought in by food not being stored properly in the home. So, as I mentioned, since the tenant is the one who attracts the rodents, they are the ones responsible for the costs of rodent control.

Although pest control is important, I would say that 90% of my homes do not have a rodent problem.

If you have any other questions about pest control or would like to learn more about how we take care of your investment properties, just give me a call or send me an email. Feel free to check out our site as well. I would be happy to help you!

Our move-out addendum ensures that your property is always in good condition. Here’s how it works.

Find Out How Much Your Home Will Rent For in Today’s Market 
Learn More About Guaranteed Rent

The Hawaii Landlord-Tenant Code is a 29-page document that spells out all the expectations for owners and renters. Here at Hawaii Pacific Property Management, we add an additional 14-page addendum to our rental contract called a “move-out addendum” that we wanted to talk to you about today.

This addendum states that the tenant will get professional services to clean the home and leave it in the same condition it was when they moved in. To ensure this, we require tenants to sign the agreement up front before they move in. We also require them to provide receipts for any carpet cleaning or maid services they use. This way, there are never any questions about the condition of the property. It will look the same each time a tenant moves out.

“WE PROTECT YOUR HOME AND PUT MONEY IN YOUR ACCOUNT.”

We do two things very well: We protect your home and put money in your account. If you need help with either of those things or have any questions about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Find Out How Much Your Home Will Rent For in Today’s Market

One of the most common questions we get is, “How do I get paid?”

It’s pretty simple. We collect rents on the first of every month. Hawaii has a “no grace period” law for tenants, which means that rent is definitely due on the first.

It takes a couple of days to process the payment but thanks to ACH and the magic of online banking, our owners will get paid on the fifth of the month.

We do all of the behind-the-scenes work to manage your property. However, the only thing you need to know is that we make the rent appear at no hassle to you.

“RENT IS ALWAYS COLLECTED ON THE FIRST OF EACH MONTH.”

When you work with me, you don’t have to pay any money up front. If your property needs repairs, the cost will be taken out of the rent. Don’t worry—we don’t do anything without your permission, and you will be communicated with about everything via text, email, or a phone call.

If you have any other questions about your payment or would like to learn more about how we can help you, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

Discerning the difference between normal wear and tear versus actual damage is a difficult but important part of property management. Here’s how we handle it.

Find Out How Much Your Home Will Rent For in Today’s Market 
Learn More About Guaranteed Rent

How do you discern wear and tear versus damage in a rental property? Getting a property condition form filled out correctly is one of the biggest problems I face in my business.

The standard property condition form is four pages and it’s very extensive. We require tenants to fill out this form on their way in within the first 10 days of living in a unit. We then go back in on a 10-day walkthrough to remove your lock box and collect the property condition form. During that time, we walkthrough each item on the form that’s listed as damaged or not working properly.

“GETTING A PROPERLY FILLED OUT CONDITION FORM IS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST PARTS OF PROPERTY MANAGEMENT.”

If we commit to the repairs during the 10-day walkthrough, they’ll be repaired at the owner’s cost.

Wear and tear means things like scratches and scuff marks on the stairs, walls, and bathtub, dirty mirrors, and yellowing on the toilet. We have to determine whether it’s wear and tear from living in the unit or damage from negligence by the tenant. Our job is to make that determination for our owners upon move out.

We also do a six-month walkthrough to make sure the home is cared for, four months if the unit allows pets. We provide pictures of the walkthrough, guaranteed.

If you have any questions about assessing wear and tear or damage in a unit or you’re interested in our property management services, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’d be glad to speak with you further.

What is a rent guarantee and why do we offer one? I’ll explain everything today.

Learn More About Guaranteed Rent

When you work with us, I guarantee that we’ll pay an agreed upon amount if we don’t rent your property in 30 days or less.

How do we do that?

First of all, very few property management companies guarantee their work. We will look at your property’s area, present you with a market rent, and guarantee your rent at a certain amount. For example, let’s say your house’s recommended rent is $3,000; we’ll guarantee your rent at $2,400 or $2,600.

There are many factors that go into renting your home. Until we actually look at the property, we don’t know how renting will go. We don’t know if the people who lived there used to bully the neighborhood, what the parking situation is, or if the house has pets.

When we arrive at the house, we will look at all of those factors to determine whether or not we can rent your home. If we can, then you sign a contract that states that we will do everything in our power to rent your home. The contract also offers a rent guarantee, an eviction guarantee, and a communication guarantee.

Many property management companies do not offer an eviction guarantee, even though they put the tenant in the property! If we have to go to eviction with a tenant, we will pay for that. We will also do a four and six-month walkthrough to make sure that your tenants are holding the line as far as your lease goes.

“WE ARE HERE TO MAKE YOU MONEY AND PROTECT YOUR PROPERTY.”

Our communication guarantee is extremely important. Many other property management companies can take a while to call you back if they call you back at all. We will give you an updated report each Monday to let you know how many people looked at the home, how many are interested in renting, and give you any feedback from the renters. You have three numbers to reach us: my number, your property manager’s number, and our 800 number that connects to all of our property managers. If you need to talk to us, someone will answer you, guaranteed.

There are two reasons why I am here: to put money into your bank account and to protect your home. We promise and guarantee that we will do both of those things. If you have any questions for us, please don’t hesitate to give us a call. We are always happy to help you!

        <description>We recommend that our owners carry certain types of insurance coverage so they can maximize their investment property’s value.

Free Insurance Quote

One of the questions we get asked a lot by our owners is, “How much insurance should we carry on our home while we don’t live in it?” Today I want to delve into this topic to give you an idea of what owners and tenants can expect.

The first thing you must do as an owner is notify your current insurance company that you’re not using the property as your primary residence. This is an important detail for insurance companies because that makes the property an investment property.

After that’s done, we first recommend you take out a renter’s insurance policy that covers at least $10,000 in personal property. This is primarily to cover your appliances. This sum won’t be enough to cover a disaster like a wind storm blowing off your roof, but we’ve been fortunate enough in Hawaii to mostly avoid hurricanes and other storms capable of that kind of damage in the past 100 years. Your liability coverage will be $100,000, which is in place in case an accident happens on the property.

The other thing we recommend for owners is to get loss of rent coverage. This is important because if there’s a leak or your home incurs some type of water damage, the tenants probably won’t be able to reside in it and pay rent. The loss of rent coverage makes sure you are compensated for the lost rent on your investment.

“AS AN OWNER, YOUR LIABILITY COVERAGE WILL BE $100,000.”

What do we ask on the tenant’s side? We require all tenants to carry a renter’s policy, which is a simple renter’s policy to cover a minimum of $10,000 on their property, $50,000 in liability, and more if they have a dangerous pet. If they happen to have what we consider a dangerous pet, we ask them to cover $100,000. We also ask them to have loss of rent coverage in their policy so that policy will kick in if something happens to them and prevents them from paying rent.

If your house has wood floors and experiences a water leak and the tenants can still live there but aren’t happy about it, the tenant’s coverage will take care of what they can cover, and the owner’s coverage will take care of the rest. We often see this situation happen with condos and townhouses.

Depending on the insurance company, this will cost an owner anywhere from $100 to $300 and a tenant anywhere from $100 to $200. It’s a minimal cost, and we require it of both our tenants before they move in and our owners before they have a tenant reside in their unit.

If you have any questions about this topic, please feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you!

How do we earn our fees as a property management company? Here are all the things we do for owners to help them protect their investments.

This year has been great so far. Interest rates have gone up, so I commend those of you who have invested in property and chose us to help make your property more valuable. It was a smart move.

A lot of people want to know about our owner fees and how we earn them when it comes to maintenance and finding tenants. We put a lot of work into these areas so that our owners and their investments are protected.

Before we take over a property to manage, we first look at the appliances. If they need to be serviced, we take care of them. However, once the tenant gets in there, all bets on maintenance are off. People handle day-to-day living differently. Many times we’ll see a disposal overload or toilet backup.

“DOING THE HARD WORK UP FRONT ALLOWS US TO FIND GREAT TENANTS.”

Whenever something goes wrong, our property manager will contact the owner to see how they want to handle the situation. If they have a friend or family member that can take care of the maintenance, we will go to them. If not, we have our in-house vendors that we have approved and worked with in the past. We won’t repair anything for you without your permission, however.

Another area of our business where we are really strong is our marketing. We make sure to take pictures and video of our properties each time a tenant moves in or out. We also push our properties to the major websites like apartments.com, Trulia, Zillow, Craigslist, and more. Some of those sites have been very strong for us in finding good tenants.

We do background checks, credit checks, and criminal checks on all potential tenants. We believe in doing the hard work up front because once it’s done, we can foresee and chase out all the bad prospects or tenants we may get.

Once we have a tenant, we do a four- or six-month walkthrough to ensure proper maintenance in the home. If they have pets, it’s every four months. If they don’t, it’s every six.

In a nutshell, that’s how we earn our fees. We think we are more than worth our price, and many of our owners can attest to that. If you have any questions for us or you’re looking to invest in property here in Hawaii, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.

        <description>

For every home we lease, we have the tenant sign a move out addendum. This ensures that the property is left in good condition for the next tenant.

Today we wanted to talk about an important part of our leasing contract: The Move Out Addendum. You see, every tenant that signs with us signs a move out addendum.

This contract is an agreement that the tenant will leave the property in the same condition that they got it, specifically with regard to ensuring that the carpet and the interior are professionally cleaned, because this is the service that we offer to them. This addendum also guarantees us in writing that if the tenant has a pet, they will get special pet treatment on their carpets and deodorize the entire home so that there is no residue.

“WE WORK TO PROTECT YOUR HOME AND PUT MONEY INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.”

In addition, this addendum gives the tenant the option of allowing us to professionally clean the home if they don’t want to do it themselves. That way, they don’t have to clean the house twice. If our tenant does choose to do their own professional cleaning and we get the receipt that things aren’t finished, however, we have the right to recall the service company, specify what they didn’t finish, and make sure the job gets done.

Remember, we only work with two goals in mind: 1) to protect your home; 2) to put money into your account.

If you have any questions about our move out addendum or anything else related to property management, please feel free to call us or shoot us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!

As a property owner, complications can arise for you if one of your tenants can’t pay rent. As a property management company, we have a system in place to alleviate this concern.

Sometimes, life happens and there’s nothing you can do about it.

As a property owner, your goal is to pick the best possible tenant by making sure that they have a great credit score, a good background check, minimal criminal history, and great references. Even if you pick the most qualified tenant for your property, though, things can go wrong.

For example, let’s say your tenant is in the military and they either get injured, have a medical discharge, or get divorced. That would mean a likely income change. If one of the spouses moved out of that house, things would also likely change dramatically. Whether that means trying to find another tenant or working with the tenant you already have, problems can arise that can complicate the rent situation.

“THE THING THAT WE DO BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE IS FIND TENANTS FOR YOUR HOME.”

This is where we come in. We’re a property management company. The thing that we do better than anybody else is finding qualified tenants for your home. How do we do this?

We have a break lease agreement with the tenant that states they are responsible for the lease as long as the property goes vacant. As soon as we find another tenant, the Landlord-Tenant Code specifically states that we cannot charge rent to two different tenants for the same days. That’s against the law!

In the event that one of your tenants can’t pay rent, we would quickly replace them to alleviate any negative rents or mortgages that you have to pay. We would get you your rent payments by the 7th of each month in your account, while collecting rent payments on the 1st. That’s our guarantee.

If you have any further questions about property management, please don’t hesitate to contact us. Just give us a call or send us an email and we’d be happy to help in any way we can. Aloha!

We offer our homeowners an eviction guarantee.
How does that work exactly? I’ll take you through each step today.

We offer our homeowners an eviction guarantee. How does this work exactly?

The Landlord-Tenant Code is very specific on the steps you are required to take when you’re going to evict someone from your property in civil court.

As soon as we realize that the rents are going to be late, the first thing we do is post a five-day
notice to terminate the lease. We then take a picture of the five-day lease (which is usually posted on the front door) and submit that photo to civil court.  At the same time, we file for an eviction notice for the tenant to appear in court. That eviction notice to appear in court will normally take 14 to 21 days to get served.

Once the eviction notice is served, we get a court date. As soon as the tenant is in court, the first question the judge will ask is, “Do you owe rent on this house and why have you not paid?” The tenants normally answer that question like this: “Judge, we do owe the money, but we have an explanation.”

I will go to the court proceedings along with my property manager for the area. We will testify that the rents are not paid. In that case, we do not take any partial rents for you; if we did, then we couldn’t file for an eviction.

Once the eviction is granted, the judge will ask how many days I will give them to vacate your unit. We will show up on the agreed-upon day with a police officer to accompany them off the property. Once we show up, they have 120 minutes to vacate your home. After they are out, we change the locks, go in with cleaners, and start the re-up process to get your home back on the market.

“WE WILL CHOOSE YOUR TENANT AND HANDLE ANY EVICTIONS AT NO CHARGE TO YOU.”

Remember now, every time we move a tenant in and out of your home, we take new pictures and videos of your property. All of those pictures and videos are date-stamped just in case we end up in court.

That is the eviction process. If you elect to use our eviction guarantee, we will choose your tenant for you. We will find a tenant with a credit score of at least 620, and we guarantee to pay for the eviction process. If you choose to select your own tenant and ignore the eviction guarantee, you will have to pay for me to go to court and evict your tenant.

Ultimately, I recommend that you let us choose your tenant. We will look at their credit, criminal, and eviction history, and then check their references from past landlords. If you have any questions about the eviction process or our eviction guarantee, please give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
