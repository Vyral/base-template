When is the best time to clean your gutters? It’s always a good idea to clean them in the spring, but I recommend getting ahead of the problem and cleaning them now.

The leaves are falling and filling up your gutters. Most people wait to clean their gutters in the spring when the rain comes, but guess what?

If you clean your gutters before winter hits, snow won’t pack those leaves down and clog your gutters. It is easier to clean your gutters when the leaves are dry, anyway. If you wait until spring, the leaves will be a soggy mess.

Not only that, if we happen to have a 40° day this winter, it could rain. If your gutters are clogged, that rain will come down the side of your house. If your sump pump does not keep up with it, you’ll wind up with water in your basement.

“IT IS EASIER TO CLEAN YOUR GUTTERS BEFORE ALL THE SNOW HITS ANYWAY.”

So, check your gutters now. It’s always good to clean them in the spring, too, but cleaning the gutters now should help you avoid any major problems in the winter or early spring.

If you have any real estate questions or need to hire someone to clean your gutters, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I can certainly refer you to someone. I look forward to hearing from you!

Placing an insulated cover over your home’s outside spigots can prevent them from freezing over and possibly causing your basement to flood once you turn them on again in the spring.

One of the easiest, cheapest winter home preparation tips I always recommend is placing an insulated cover over your home’s outside spigots.

If left uncovered during the winter, they can freeze over, which can cause your basement to flood once you turn them on again in the spring. Repairing that kind of damage can cost you a couple hundred dollars to fix.

You can buy insulated spigot covers at Lowe’s, Home Depot, or any hardware store for as little as $3. As you can see in the video above, attaching them over your spigot is a simple process.

“PUTTING A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY TOWARD YOUR HOME’S PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE CAN GO A LONG WAY.”

Most of us are almost done using our spigots anyway, so you might as well do this now. Putting a little bit of money toward your home’s preventative maintenance can go a long way.

If you have any other questions about preparing your home for winter or you’re curious about what’s going on in our Kansas City market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.

Today I have some advice about patching your walls: never use brushes.

Today I’m at one of my investment properties touching up sheet rock dents in the wall.

I’ve got a little spackle on it, and I’m about to sand it down. While doing this, I realized that a lot of my clients don’t realize that if you use a brush to cover a patch, the strokes will show; almost all your walls are rolled on.

For little spots like this, I use a mini tray and roller to make the process easier. Regular-sized trays and rollers make a mess and would really be overkill for a small patch. When you roll it on, the texture matches the wall around it, and when it dries, it’ll look perfect.

“IF YOU’RE EVER TOUCHING UP YOUR WALLS, USE WHATEVER SIZED ROLLER YOU NEED, JUST DON’T USE A BRUSH.”

If you’re ever touching up your walls, use whatever sized roller you need, just don’t use a brush.

If you’d like one of these little roller kits, I’ll be happy to give one to you. Call, email, or text me, and I’ll bring one over to you and say hi. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

There’s a quick, easy, cheap solution for loose screws I want to show you.

A long time ago, my dad taught me a quick, cheap, easy fix for loose screws that never fails.

All you need to apply this fix are Elmer’s glue and a few toothpicks. Just squirt a little Elmer’s glue into the hole, jam the toothpicks in, and break them off. If you put your screw in after that, it’ll fit just like new.

“THIS CHEAP, EASY FIX NEVER FAILS.”

The first person who emails me and tells me they tried this tip and it worked will receive a $20 gift card to Lowe’s.

In the meantime, if you have any questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in the Kansas City market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help!

Don’t let your yard go to the geese—it’s much easier to take care of landscaping projects yourself.

It’s very important that you keep up with landscaping this time of year.

You don’t want to let your yard get out of control. Good, clean landscaping adds value to your house. Plus, it just looks nice.

Don’t let crabgrass take over your yard or garden beds. Your house will benefit so much from your steady upkeep. After all, it’s much harder to track down some geese to do your weeding for you than it is to just take care of it yourself in the first place.

“YOUR HOUSE WILL BENEFIT SO MUCH FROM PROPER LANDSCAPING.”

If you have any questions or need a referral to a landscaping company—I do not recommend these geese—just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

Some birds that nested in a light fixture outside my house got too big to even get out, and it got me thinking about move-up buyers who have outgrown their home. I’ve notice this being a common problem for homeowners here in the Kansas City area.

My advice for you today is not to wait so long that your house becomes so small that you can’t even get out.

“DON’T WAIT UNTIL YOUR HOME GETS SO SMALL THAT YOU CAN’T GET OUT!”

If you’re looking to move to your next home, check out all homes available on the Kansas City MLS here on our home search tool.

If you have any other questions or just need some helping flying the coop into a new home, give me call or send me an email. I’d love to help you out!

With the storm season fast approaching, it’s essential to take a look at the trees around your home. What condition are they in? Are you worried a storm could potentially knock down a tree and cause damage to your property?

Now is the time to have a certified arborist come take a look. Power lines are also a huge concern when it comes to trees and storm season. Kansas City Power and Light will trim back foliage around the main power pole, but the lines running to your house are your responsibility as the homeowner.

“BEING PROACTIVE ABOUT YOUR TREES NOW COULD SAVE YOU TIME, MONEY, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF STRESS.”

An arborist will come out to give you a free evaluation and provide you with an estimate for trimming. Being proactive about your trees now could save you time, money, and a large amount of stress.

If you have any questions about getting ahold of an arborist, or if you have any real estate questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m always happy to help.

Water is a home’s worst enemy. Today, I wanted to show you how to keep groundwater out of your home using my house as a live example.

Groundwater in your basement is an issue that nobody wants to deal with, so today I have some preventative maintenance tips that I wanted to share.

Water is a home’s worst enemy and it can get in three ways: your roof, plumbing leaks, or groundwater.

To get water to shed when there’s heavy rain, you need one inch of drop per foot. As you can see in the video above, there’s a spot near my home’s downspout where water will pool and try to get into my basement when it rains.

I’ve started by adding some dirt to divert water. I’ve brought in a dump truck’s worth of dirt, but $1.33 per bag at a hardware store will take care of it too.

“WATER IS A HOME’S WORST ENEMY.”

I created a nice slope that will keep water from pooling when it rains. Some people would say that this is what a sump pump is for, but the best sump pumps to have are the ones that never have to run!

If you have any other questions about preventing groundwater from getting into your house or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home here in the Kansas City area, give me a call or send me an email. I’m always here to help!

We are in an extremely strong seller’s market now, despite slightly increasing interest rates. That said, sellers need a strategy if they want to capitalize on this great market.

Right now, we are in a strong seller’s market.

Interest rates are still historically low even though they have started to creep up a little. Now that the election is over and rates are still low, things are really selling pretty quick. Inventory is extremely low for the number of buyers out there and as a result, homes are selling within a couple of days.

We have a great strategy to help sellers get top dollar in this market: our “Coming Soon!” program. We put up a “Coming Soon!” sign in your yard two weeks before your listing goes live on the MLS. That way, we get plenty of calls about the house before it comes on the market.

“OUR ‘COMING SOON!’ PROGRAM DIRECTS BUYER DEMAND TO YOUR HOME.”

By driving up buyer demand, this program helps you get multiple offers and higher prices because buyers do not want to miss out on your house. Then, you get to choose the best offer. Another benefit of this program is that our houses are selling very quickly.

Rates will creep up soon but if you’ve been thinking about selling, now is a great time to get a record-high price for your home.

If you’re curious about what your home is worth in today’s market or you have any other questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

Hands down, remodeling a kitchen before you sell will get you the best return on your investment. Today I’ll go over a few things you can do to update your kitchen if you’re on a budget.

Kitchens are the number one selling factor in a house, which is why I want to talk about the best ways to update yours before you put your home on the market.

A beautiful, updated kitchen will get you top dollar every time. The kitchen being remodeled in the video above is going from a very small to a very large kitchen, but most remodels don’t need to be that extensive.

There are a few things you can do if you don’t have the budget for a complete remodel. If you have golden oak cabinets, have them painted or go to a darker stain. Replace fixtures and make the switch to a gas cooktop. Additionally, if you have Formica countertops you’ll want to update to granite or quartz.

“A BEAUTIFUL, UPDATED KITCHEN WILL GET YOU TOP DOLLAR EVERY TIME.”

You might not even be thinking about selling your home anytime soon and that’s fine, but when you do decide to sell, you’ll get the best return on your investment if you update the kitchen.

If you have any questions about updating your kitchen, updating other parts of your home, or if you’re nervous about putting money into an update, I’d be happy to come by and talk with you about your options. If you have any other real estate-related questions, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!

We’ve got some great footage of our referral appreciation party to share with you. This was a celebration for all of the people who have referred friends, family, and coworkers to us that we have been able to take care of.

To say thank you to all of these people, we decided to hold a casino party, which was a blast. We had craps tables, mice races, and more for people to bet on. Check out some great footage from one of the mice races in the video above.
