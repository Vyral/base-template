        <description>

Many sellers have recently asked me how we have such great turnout at our open houses, so I wanted to share some quick advice. 

We have a 15-page marketing page that explains our whole open house process that I’d be happy to send to you, but for now, I wanted to give you the main points.

Start by keeping the home clean and maximizing the curb appeal. The home should be completely decluttered and the curb appeal should be 10/10 because it means everything. People will drive up to the house, take a look, and keep on driving if the curb appeal isn’t up to par. If it needs to be painted, get it painted. If it needs pine straw or mulch, get some. To get people inside the home, the outside has to be beautiful.

It takes about 90 minutes to prepare for our open houses because we put up more than 100 signs. We’ll put one sign per turn in the neighborhood, and once we get to the major arteries outside the neighborhood, we’ll put 10 directional signs pointing to your neighborhood from one direction and 10 more from the other direction. That way, traffic on both sides of the street can see the signage.

“To get people inside the home, the outside has to be beautiful.”

Additionally, we generate a lot of interest with our digital marketing. We have a database of more 800 active buyers looking to buy a home, so we’ll not only market to them, but target people on social media who are likely to make a move. We run marketing campaigns for about a week in advance to drum up interest.

Publications also work great, so I publish a 15-page real estate-related newspaper that goes to 28,000 homes with an open house section where we feature homes. Finally, we try to get everyone to register once they come in so we can follow up with them and ask questions.

Again, if you’d like our full 15-page document, I’d be happy to share it with you. If you have any questions about open houses or anything in your real estate career, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I hope to hear from you soon!

(5:00) How I took the next step in my business by implementing different systems.
(8:05) How many people I talk to a week and how I went from three to 30 sales a year from my database.
(10:25) How many opt-ins I get every week.
(15:20) What caused my recent increase in production? The conversion of previous leads we already had or the increased attention to my database?
(20:00) How to avoid spam when marketing online.
(21: 50) My take on traditional real estate farming.
(26:45) What do I recommend for you to feed your database?

A lot of people want to know how our team is able to be so productive. Our agents’ 40 transactions per year, do over $10 million in volume, and take home big paychecks. How are they able to do this? A lot of their success is due to one simple tool that will change the way you approach your career.

It’s a simple form called “Dominate your day, win your week!” and it’s something our team members fill out each day. It helps you plan out your day to make it as productive as possible. There are six steps to personal productivity mastery:


  Focus, do not multi-task, and eliminate distractions.
  Make lists based on dollar-producing activities. 20% of your activities will produce 80% of the results.
  Prioritize everything you do based on your goals.
  Protect your time blocks. Plan your day in 30-minute increments and don’t let anything interfere.
  Eliminate clutter.
  Plan your week on Sunday and plan each day in advance.


Once you figure out what your top money making activities are, put those on your list first. Then, you can fill out the different time slots, noting when you plan to start and stop. As we move down the form, you have sections for determining how much each activity is worth to you so you can wrap your head around what it will cost you to neglect those activities.

There’s also a section on there for you to write down your “10 wins for the day” to give yourself a more positive focus. Sometimes a win is setting an appointment. Sometimes it’s having lunch with your spouse. It’s important to keep things in perspective.

Finally, there’s a section on the form for you to write down notes. Anything that comes to mind during the day can be written, including notes for the day and things you might need to add to your dollar-producing activities.

If you have any questions about this form or would like to get a copy of your own, just give me a call or send me an email and I’d be happy to get you one. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Send me an email and I’d be happy to get you one. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
