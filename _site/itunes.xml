        <description>

Each year during the month of April, homeowners receive a letter from the appraisal district notifying them of their home’s current assessed value. This assessed value is important because it’s what the county uses to multiply your current tax rate each October.

A lot of my clients have been fortunate to have their properties appreciate over the last year, which is great for resale purposes, but not so great for property tax purposes. Many of my other clients, then, have been asking me how they can lower their property tax bill.

One of the only ways you can lower your property tax bill is by protesting the assessed value your property taxes, and there are a few ways you can do this.

The first way is by compiling any comparable data you have, taking that data down to the appraisal district, and protesting your case.

“I’d be glad to refer you to a professional who can help you protest your property taxes.”

However, not everyone is equipped with the knowledge to do this, so you can also try hiring a property tax consulting firm. They’ll do all the work, and you don’t pay them anything unless they save you money. The downside of doing this, though, is they’ll take anywhere from 30% to 50% of what they save you.

Also, a lot of these firms have assessed value cutoffs where they’ll only accept cases for properties over a certain threshold because of the time it takes to protest these taxes. If using one of these firms isn’t an option for you, there are some do-it-yourself vendors out there who can provide you with all of the data you need for a small nominal fee in exchange for you doing all of the work with the courthouse.

I have contacts in all of these fields, so if you’re interested in working with one of these professionals, I’d be glad to refer you or anyone you know to one of them.

If you have any other questions about protesting your property taxes or you have any other mortgage needs I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.

        <description>What is freezing your credit all about? 

It’s a tool that restricts people and companies from accessing your credit report without your specific permission.

It is not the same as a fraud alert. It does not affect your credit score. You can still request your free credit report once a year. 

And you can temporarily remove the credit freeze.  Or, you can permanently remove the credit freeze.  And it does not cost you anything to do so. It can be done within minutes of your requesting an “unfreeze” (but double check the time frame with each bureau). 

The bottom line, it makes it harder for identity thieves to steal your credit and personal information or open new credit in your name. 

I have listed below the three main credit bureaus to call or go online to learn about it further. 

Here’s what they will need from you:


  Name
  Date of birth
  Social security number
  Your address


Other than creditors, here are some other reasons you may need to unfreeze your credit report access:


  Applying for a new job
  New credit card
  New credit requests you have initiated
  Utility or cell phone companies.


Once a credit freeze is in place, it secures your credit file so nobody can access it unless you give direct authorization to the credit bureaus, usually through a password-protected credit bureau website or PIN.

Please contact me if you would like more information.


  Equifax: Call 800-685-1111 or go online. Check out a step-by-step Equifax credit freeze guide.
  Experian: Call 888-397-3742 or go online. Here’s a detailed walk-through on a credit freeze with Experian.

        <description>

Most people when they hear the word “points,” they associate it with a higher cost on their loans.

However, the reality is one point equals 1% of the loan amount. This means that ​if you are borrowing $100,000, paying one point would increase the closing cost by $1,000.

Yet most people don’t realize that points can work in reverse, as well. ​In exchange for you agreeing to a higher interest rate, you can actually receive a lender credit which can go to lowering some of the closing costs. ​This is called premium pricing.

Whether or not you pay points or get lender credit depends on your particular situation. We can analyze that as part of a cost break-even analysis to determine which one is going to be appropriate for you given your holding period and your goals.

“Whether or not you pay points or get lender credit depends on your particular situation.”

Keep in mind, though, that one point equals roughly a .25% difference in interest rate. Therefore, if you pay a point, you can expect the interest rate to be about a quarter of a percent lower. If you increase the rate by a point, or if you get a lender credit for a point, you can expect it would be about a quarter of a percent higher.

I don’t want you to think that if you pay a point, your interest rates will be a full percent lower. This is not how it works. It is just a rule of thumb.

        <title>How Escrow Accounts Work</title>
        <link>http://winningwithwade.com/how-escrow-accounts-work.html</link>

        <description>

Escrow accounts are accounts that are set up to fund your property taxes and/or homeowners insurance. Every month, you put money into that account so your servicer will have the full amount to pay those bills when they’re due.

Here’s the thing, though—we only collect from the escrow account based off of what the previous year’s bill was, and unfortunately, property taxes and homeowners insurance tend to increase over time. This means that each year, you’ll have a small deficit in your escrow account that you’ll need to cover. 

“We only collect from the escrow account based off of what the previous year’s bill was.”

For example, let’s say your property tax increases $1,200 year over year. You might be thinking that your monthly payment will have to increase by $100 to account for that, and you’d be correct, but what you might not realize is that your escrow account was likely $1,200 short the previous year, so your future payment will have to increase by another $100 to account for that as well. Therefore, a single $1,200 year-over-year increase in your property tax actually equates to a $200 increase in your monthly payment.

This is why it’s important that you partner with a lender who’ll keep the servicing of their loans. This way, if you have any questions or any problems arise, you’ll have a single point of contact who can help you. If you work with a lender whose servicing rights get sold over and over again, you’re more likely to get treated as a nameless, faceless customer. We, on the other hand, are committed to being your long-term lender, and we always have your best interests at heart.

As always, if you have any questions about this or any other mortgage-related topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you.

        <title>How Are Interest Rates Determined?</title>
        <link>http://winningwithwade.com/how-are-interest-rates-determined.html</link>

        <description>

Many people don’t seem to understand how interest rates are set.

In reality, interest rates track the mortgage-backed securities market. We’ve gotten a lot of comments from clients saying that the 10-year Treasury did this or that, but in actuality, the 10-year Treasury and the mortgage-backed securities market don’t always move in step—sometimes, one will move in one direction while the other goes a different way, leading to occasional discrepancies.

“The 10-year Treasury and the mortgage-backed securities market don’t always move in step with each other.”

This is why it’s a good idea to talk to a lender, so you can learn what the real rates are at any given time. Yes, they do change every single day so make sure that you know what you’re talking about and that you’re not comparing apples to oranges.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to my team. We’d be happy to help.

        <description>

Mortgage insurance has a bad reputation, to be sure. However, the reality is that it is an insurance policy that you, the consumer, pay to benefit us, the lender, in case you default as a borrower.

This is important because back in the day, banks did not often lend more than an 80% loan-to-value; people once had to put down a very large down payment. Mortgage insurance came along, and that changed the scene dramatically. Now you are able to get into a home with a lower down payment. As a result, mortgage insurance is now included with the mortgage.

“Back in the day, banks did not often lend more than an 80% loan-to-value; people once had to put down a very large down payment.”

There are a multiple ways you can structure your mortgage insurance policy. Most people are familiar with having it included in your monthly payment, but you can also factor it into the loan amount, or build it into the interest rate—each has its pros and cons.

If you would like to have a conversation about which might be the best structure for you, please reach out to me. Hearing from you would mean the world to me, and I will take great care of you.

        <description>

Since not everyone is aware, today I want to explain how your mortgage payments are applied to your most homeowners know that their payment is due the first of the month, but it generally is not late until the 15th..

Most homeowners know that their payment is due on the 1st of the month, but it is not late until the 15th.

“Your payoff amount will always be larger than your principal because it includes the interest that you have yet to pay.”

One thing you might not realize, however, is that interest is paid in arrears.  That means your July payment would cover July’s principal, but would cover June’s interest. This is the reason you typically skip a payment when you close on a new loan, and also why you might have a little bit extra due over your principal balance when you go to pay off your loan. Your payoff amount will always be larger than your principal because it includes the interest that you have yet to pay, since interest is collected in arrears.

If you have any questions about this or would like to walk through how that works for you specifically, please feel free to reach out to me. It would mean the world to us.

        <description>

There are many myths about the real estate market. Today I am discussing the biggest myth surrounding down payments.

The biggest myth I hear is “I need a 20% down payment.” After the last recession, underwriting guidelines tightened across the country, and the perception became that you needed at least a 20% down payment to qualify for financing. While this was true at the time for jumbo financing, it has since changed. There are a wide array of loan programs with different down payment options.

“An FHA loan has a 3.5% down payment minimum, assuming you have a credit score over 580.”

In Texas, jumbo loans are set by the government, and this year, the amount for a jumbo loan is anything over $453,100. A loan larger than this will usually still require a 20% down payment. However, there are plenty of lenders who will loan at 100% loan-to-value for the right borrower. Just remember that the lower the down payment, the higher the interest rate.

Loans lower than $453,100 will be considered a conventional loan, and their down payments can range from as low as 3% to however high you want to make it. These loans will have different requirements for mortgage insurance that you should be aware of.

Your next option is the FHA loan, which has a 3.5% down payment minimum, assuming you have a credit score over 580. If you have a credit score of less than 580, it will be hard to qualify for financing, but at that point, 10% is required.

The final two loan programs you can use are USDA and VA loans. USDA loans are used for rural properties and VA loans are for veterans. Neither requires any down payment.

As you can see, there is definitely a wide range of down payment possibilities. If you have any further questions about the myth of the 20% down payment or how to best use your funds, please don’t hesitate to ask. I’d be glad to help you.

        <description>

Recently, Fannie Mae enacted a few changes in regards to transferring the ownership of investment properties into entities such as an LLC. You may remember the recent video I filmed on this topic, but, of course, things have changed again. This time, there are essentially three points you need to know.

1. The loan must have been securitized by June 1, 2016 or later. This means you must have closed on or after this date in order to carry out this kind of transfer in ownership.

2. The LLC must be in good standing with the state.

3. You must be the majority owner of the LLC.

This recent change is actually very positive. A lot of my investor clients have taken advantage of it already.

“A lot of my investor clients have already taken advantage of this recent change.”

If you or someone you know is thinking of investing in real estate, please think of us at Guardian Mortgage. We have a lot of experience and offer several loan programs. We would love to help guide you.

        <description>

A lot of our customers contact us with questions about owning a second home. The good news is that transactions for second homes are treated almost identically to transactions for primary residences.

The one big difference is that a lot of lenders will look closely at the distance between your primary and secondary residence.

“Lenders will pay a lot of attention to the distance between your potential second property and your primary residence.”

Something like a vacation home, located far away from where you currently reside, will make sense. However, a secondary residence in the same, or near the same, neighborhood as your first home isn’t going to pass a sniff test.

So, talk with your lender ahead of time to develop a roadmap for making a successful offer on your second home.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

FHA loan limits have recently increased. Due to its flexible approval guidelines, the FHA loan program is a great option for first-time buyers or those with little available for a down payment.

Loan limits will vary by county, but in the DFW Metroplex, the single-unit limit has increased to $386,400. This limit also varies depending on the number of units in a property. For example, the loan limit is $494,650 for duplexes, $597,500 for triplexes, and $743,100 for quads.

“The FHA loan program is a great option for first-time buyers or those with little available for a down payment.”

As long as you occupy one of the units as a primary residence, you can structure a loan on a multi-unit property using the FHA program.

This program is a great option if you or anyone you know is looking to buy a house in 2018.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like help obtaining an FHA loan, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <title>3 Tax Law Changes to Know</title>

        <description>

As you’ve probably heard by now, the government has passed sweeping legislation to dramatically change our tax code. A lot of things are going to change.

Before I get started, let me just remind you that if you need individualized tax advice, you should consult your tax advisor. However, I want to provide you with some helpful information about how the changes could affect your mortgage and other payments.

The main driver in the changes is that the standard deduction has been increased to $12,000 for an individual and $24,000 for a couple. This is important because it will encourage more people to claim the standard deduction as opposed to itemizing those deductions. As it relates to real estate and real estate finance, there are three ways the new tax code may affect you. And, one important tax benefit that is staying put.

1. Mortgage interest deduction. Previously, you could deduct the mortgage interest on a loan up to $1 million. That number has been lowered to $750,000. While that’s still a very large number, this change will undoubtedly affect some people at the upper end of the market.

2. Equity indebtedness. If you’ve taken cash out of your property at some point in the past, there were complex rules about what can and can’t be deducted. Starting in 2018, none of the interest on the equity piece of your loan can be deducted. If this is something that might affect you, I recommend discussing it with your tax advisor.

3. The property tax exemption. You’re only going to be allowed to deduct up to $10,000 on your property taxes. Although that might sound like a large number, especially in the DFW area, it’s not the largest property assessed value that affects you. Keep that in mind.

“The capital gains exclusion is still in place.”

The key benefit that is remaining from the previous tax policy is the capital gains exclusion, allowing you to deduct up to $250,000 in capital gains on the sale of a property if you’re single and $500,000 if you file jointly I know many real estate investors who have greatly benefited from the exclusion.

If you have any concerns about the new tax bill and how it will affect you, it may be worth the time to consult with your tax advisor. If you plan to buy a home in 2018, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call. I am happy to help answer any questions you may have.

        <description>

I’m pleased to let you know that the government just recently announced a new maximum conforming loan limit for 2018. The reality is that in 2017 the limit was $424,000 and it has now been raised to $453,100.

This is a big deal because it gives consumers more buying power. If you go above the $424,100 threshold, that puts you into the jumbo loan category, and that typically comes with certain downsides such as tighter underwriting guidelines, higher credit minimums, typically higher interest rates, and others.

“This is a big deal because it gives consumers more buying power.”

Those downsides are why it’s important that if you’re able to structure it as a conforming loan, you do so, because it’s just more advantageous for the borrower.

If you’re thinking of purchasing a property or meaning to refinance and you’re in the $500,000 to $600,000 price point range, please reach out to us. We’d be honored to walk you through your options to make sure that we can structure this so that it accomplishes your long- and short-term financial goals.

If there’s anything else that we can do for you, don’t hesitate to ask either. We’d be happy to help you.

        <description>

Today’s topic is about why your lender matters in a competitive market.

I talk to a lot of Realtors in my profession, and frankly, they tell me there are about four key things that make a difference in the likelihood of an offer getting accepted.

1.) Local lenders. Listing agents routinely look for local lenders; they prefer not to work with large national banks or internet lenders. They want to be able to contact someone local if there’s an issue and someone who has local appraisers on their panel. Choose who you work with carefully.

2.) Pre-approval letters. In the state of Texas, pre-approval letters are required to list what documents have and have not been verified, so if the letter that you’re looking at doesn’t have those items on there, I’d encourage you to ask your lender why, or find a different lender. Make sure the lender has actually looked at some documents.

3.) Have the underwriter sign off. Have the lender take the process a step further and have the underwriter sign off on the pre-approval letter. Even though it takes a little bit more time for the lender, it’s a much more thorough way to go about it. It gives the listing agent certainty that you can actually close on the financing that you’re applying for because the underwriters actually sign off on it. As long as you don’t lose a job or blow your down payment money in Las Vegas, you’ll be able to close on the transaction.

4.) Have your loan officer contact the listing agent to talk up your offer. Frankly, that type of call goes over very, very well with the listing agent. This can be the thing that pushes you over the edge in a multiple offer situation. I had a client just last week who was one of 22 offers on a property, and the seller took our offer because I called them—even though it was $8,000 less than the highest offer. We’re a local lender with a good reputation, and they knew we were communicative about having the underwrite on the file.Frankly, that type of call goes over very, very well with the listing agent.

“When you find your dream home, you need to be working with a lender that will do whatever it takes to get you into that home.”

These measures can really put you in the driver’s seat with your offers, because let’s face it, you’re not in the market to just make offer after offer and not get a property under contract. When you find your dream home, you need to be working with a lender that will do whatever it takes to get you into that home.

If you or someone you know is looking for that type of service, please contact us. We’d be honored to help.

        <description>

After the devastating hurricanes, we have a unique situation out there in the insurance world. I wanted to take just a minute to talk about flood insurance here in Texas and how it relates to your mortgage.

When you take out a home loan, your lender is required to pull a flood certification to see if your property is in a flood zone. If you are, you’ll be required to take out a flood insurance policy. These can get quite pricey.

You have to pay for them in full prior to closing, and you have to have them escrowed in your account regardless of whether you’re escrowed for taxes or insurance. It’s very important that if you are in a flood zone or looking at a home in a flood zone, you learn about it early on in the process so you can have time to make an educated decision on how to proceed.

“Many of them don’t protect against water damage at all.”

Being from New Orleans and having to go through Hurricane Katrina, I have deep sympathy for all of our friends in Houston and Florida. I’ve learned from first-hand experience that the biggest floods tend to happen in non-flood zones. Even if your home isn’t in one, I encourage you to at least have a conversation with your insurance professional about what exactly your policy covers. Many of them don’t protect against water damage at all.

If you have any questions in the meantime or if you know anyone looking to buy a home in the near future, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Most people associate an adjustable-rate mortgage, or ARM, with the market crash of 2008. In reality, ARMs were misrepresented to the public during that time and people have been slow to come back to them. However, they have a purpose. An ARM could be the perfect thing for you, depending on what your goals are as a homeowner.

“There is some risk involved, but it can be a very useful tool.”

If you’re going to be in a home for a set period of time, let’s say four or five years, it behooves you to look at an ARM mortgage because it could actually save you a lot of money. While ARMs are known for adjusted rates, they usually have a fixed period at the beginning of the loan. This means for a certain time, the interest rate is lower on that mortgage than it would have been on a traditional 15 or 30-year loan. After the “fixed period,” the rate will adjust up or down depending on what you agreed to on the front end. There are caps in place to protect you from large swings, however. That’s what happened to a lot of people during the recession.

Those who benefit from ARMs have a defined holding period and know exactly how long they want to own a property. You can also benefit from an ARM by rapidly paying down your loan at the beginning of the term while the rate is low. By the time the rate adjusts, your payment will have lowered, even with a higher rate.

An ARM definitely has a place in the lender’s toolbox, but there is some risk involved. If you have any questions for us about ARMs or any other type of loan, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.

Removing mortgage insurance is different for conventional and FHA loans. However, most people may not realize that the removal of mortgage insurance, regardless of loan type, is actually dictated by the federal government.

If you take out an FHA loan, your ability to remove mortgage insurance is predicated on the down payment amount. If you put more than 10% down, you are only required to pay mortgage insurance for 11 years. If you put less than 10% down, then you have to pay mortgage insurance for the entire life of the loan. So, keep that in mind if you are considering an FHA.

Conventional loans carry private mortgage insurance, or PMI. Most people think that once they get to 80% loan to value, the mortgage insurance falls off. That’s not exactly true. The rule states that if you pay mortgage insurance, it automatically falls off at 78% loan to value—but you can request to remove it at 80% LTV. Contact your loan servicer once you reach 80% and ask to get that PMI removed.

“Appreciation in value adds a bit of a wrinkle to this process.”

Appreciation in value does add another wrinkle to this process. A lot of customers say, “My home appreciated in value since I bought it. Now I have the 20% equity and would like to remove my mortgage insurance.”

That is fine, but the rules for using appreciation as justification are different than the rules based on the original purchase price. You are ineligible to use appreciation as justification years zero through two of owning the home. Between the two and five-year mark, you need 25% equity for justification; after five years, that number goes back down to 20%.

Your loan servicer will require an updated appraisal at that time to make sure that you have subsequent equity levels.

If you have any other questions about removing mortgage insurance, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

You may not realize it, but we actually have some of the most conservative equity laws in the country down here in Texas. They limit the maximum loan-to-value of your financing to 80% of the home’s value. Regardless of the financing you are doing, the state requires an appraisal to be conducted to determine its value to make sure it doesn’t exceed the 80% threshold.

There are a few different types of equity loans out there. Here’s a little bit of information about each.

Equity lines of credit are variable and can be used for practically anything. Standalone second liens are typically taken out for home improvements. Cash-out refinances are when you refinance your entire loan balance in excess of what you want to borrow to get cash out of the property.

“You can only have one equity loan at a time.”

There are advantages and disadvantages to each, but one thing about these loans is universal in Texas. Whenever you take one out, there is a 12-month cooling off period until you can touch it. If you did a cash-out refinance and rates cratered immediately after, you are prevented from refinancing again until after the period has passed.

Also, keep in mind that in Texas, you are only allowed one equity loan on a property at a time. If you did a cash-out refinance, for example, you are not allowed to take a home equity LOC out after the fact.

If you have any questions for me or would like to discuss your specific scenario, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

Many people would like to buy a home for their parents, but don’t know the best way how. The answer largely depends on the circumstances of the parents.

Fannie Mae guidelines allow a child to buy a property for their parents, and if the parents don’t qualify, the child can purchase it as a primary residence.The advantage of this is the lower interest rates and lower down payment requirements.

“How you buy a house for your parents depends on their unique circumstances.”

If the parents qualify for a mortgage, the child can still purchase the property, but it has to be structured as an investment property purchase, which will have more restrictive down payment requirements and higher interest rates.

If you or anyone you know are thinking about buying a home for your parents, we’d love to sit down with you and talk about the intricacies of this kind of transaction and how to put you in the best possible position. We’d be honored to serve you.

If a marriage ends, what happens to the house and the mortgage?

It’s important to know the plans for the home. You can refinance to remove one person from the loan or sell the house.

Texas is a community property state. A refinance may not be necessary if you dictate in the divorce decree who will be obligated to make the payments. However, the downside is that the departing spouse’s credit is still tied to the home. If the occupying spouse misses a payment, it would still negatively affect the other’s credit. That’s why I recommend refinancing.

“It’s important to know the plans for the home.”

The timing will dictate whether an owelty lien is used. In Texas, if you’re trying to refinance to remove one spouse, many times you need to take cash out to pay them their share of the equity. Texas has limits for the maximum loan-to-value you can have on a cash-out refinance of 80%. Depending on what the home appraises at or the agreed payment, it may or may not be enough equity to take out. The alternative is the owelty lien, which gets put on the property for the agreed-upon amount and prevents the occupying spouse from refinancing or selling the property without guaranteeing payment to the departing spouse.

It’s the most secure way to get equity out of the home. However, it needs to be agreed upon before the divorce is finalized. Sadly, I many people come to me after the divorce is already finalized, so this option is off the table.

Selling the property releases both parties from the obligation of the mortgage, but they both still need to move somewhere. That’s why it’s still important to speak with a mortgage lender to get the situation resolved.

        <description>

We often get questions from clients asking about bi-weekly payment options.

The fact is, once you close on a transaction, you’re going to get inundated with junk mail, much of which will be requests for you to sign up for a bi-weekly payment option. This means that instead of paying your mortgage once a month, you’d pay twice a month.

“With this plan, you get the same effect as bi-weekly payments without the middle man and their fee.”

The reality of working with these companies, though, is that you’ll pay them a month in advance. Then, you’ll pay every two weeks, and in turn, they will pay your lender once a month. This will continue until they’ve built up enough reserves in the escrow account they’ve set up for you to make that 13th payment a year.

I advise my clients to take that monthly payment you’re paying to your lender each month, divide it by 12, and add that amount to what you pay every single month. This results in a 13th payment being made every year. It’s exactly the same as the bi-weekly payment plan, with the only difference being that by doing it yourself, you cut out the middleman—and their fee.

If you have any questions about this payment plan, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be honored to help!

Closing on time is a promise that every lender makes, but the reality is that very few actually do it consistently.

When I have an initial conversation with a borrower and I ask them what’s most important to them, I’ll often hear things like the interest rate, the communication level, the products that are offered, and the ability to close on time. Out of all of those factors, the one that has the most bearing on a successful transaction is the lender’s ability to close on time.

If you take out a loan, it’s very important to partner with a lender that will go through the due diligence steps up front to ensure that you’re fully pre-approved. After that, they should set the correct expectations for you so that when you shop for a home, you know how to properly negotiate for it so the transaction is a smooth one and you have a happy closing.

Nationwide, about one-third of all home loans don’t close on time, according to the Campbell/Inside Mortgage Finance Housing Pulse Tracking Survey. FHA loans only close on time 59.2% of the time. Conventional loans (e.g., those that are backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) only close on time 63.6% of the time. Cash transactions—believe it or not—only close on time 79.1% of the time.

“Who you partner with for your financing has a large impact on your transaction.”

Who you partner with for your financing has a large impact on whether you have a successful closing or not. If you or someone you know is planning on purchasing a home in the next six months, please don’t hesitate to give us a call or shoot us an email so we can set up a consultation. We’d be happy to help!

        <description>

What makes piggyback loans beneficial to home buyers? Why would a recast be more advantageous for you?

A piggyback loan is when you take out a single loan for 80% of the home’s value and either 10% or 15% of the remainder to purchase the home. It’s usually either an 80/10 or 80/15/5 split.

Structuring the loan this way usually makes sense when you’re very close to the $417,000 conforming loan limit. There are definitely better ways to structure this if possible, though. I say this because when you structure it with the first and second lien, the interest rate on that first lien is quite a bit higher than it would be otherwise.

If the loan amounts cooperate, most of our clients actually structure this with a single loan, pay the private mortgage insurance, and then pay the loan down in either a lump sum payment as a result of the sale of another property, or with accelerated principal payments throughout the loan so that the mortgage insurance drops off.

At that point, they can then contact us to recast the loan so it acts as a retroactive down payment. What happens, then, is you end up at the same place as if you structured the loan with the first and the second lien. The difference is by structuring it with a single loan with mortgage insurance and throwing in a recast there, you end up with a lower interest rate over the life of the loan, which ends up saving you quite a bit of money.

“Structuring your loan this way will give you a lower interest rate.”

        <description>

When buying a new construction home, the financing works a bit differently. But how?

There are basically two ways to fund new construction—a one-time close or a two-time close. Each has its pros and cons, so I wanted to provide an overview of both.

A one-time close uses one loan from the beginning to fund the construction and purchase of the home. The advantage of this option is that there is only one set of closing costs and there won’t be potential issues with qualifying after closing if you have any personal circumstances change. These changes would include things like job loss, for example. The downside to a one-time close loan product is that the interest rate is quite a bit higher.

The alternative is to structure it with two separate loans, or a two-time close. This means you purchase the property and construct the home with construction financing, and when the home is complete, a lender will come in and refinance you to permanent financing. The downside here is that you will have two sets of closing costs. However, the advantage is that the interest rate will be quite a bit lower (assuming that rates hold steady while the home is constructed). The two-time close is the more common of the two options.

“Each financing type has its own pros and cons.”

        <description>

After you close a real estate transaction, there are certain documents that have to be filed with the county courthouse. The unfortunate thing is that county courthouse records are public access, and marketing companies will routinely buy this information to tailor their solicitations to new loan recipients.

With that being said, there are three things you can do to reduce the amount of junk mail you receive from credit bureaus and marketing companies who purchase your information from other sources:


  
    Go to optoutprescreen.com. This is the shared web portal for the three major credit bureaus. By opting out of that website, you can remove your credit profile from being sold to third parties. All those offers and solicitations will cease, and you can opt out for any period of time, whether it be five years or permanently. If you do opt out permanently, there is a bit more paperwork you have to fill out.
  
  
    Opt out of direct marketing from dmachoice.org. This is the police for all the catalog mail and other mail that isn’t tied to your credit profile. It does have a nominal fee and lasts for only five years at a time.
  
  
    Visit catalogchoice.org. If you want to take things a step further, you can visit this site and input the different vendors that slipped through the cracks from your other opt outs and block their solicitations as well.
  


“The less junk mail the better.”

The days when we don’t receive any junk mail are sometimes the greatest days of all. If you have any questions for us or any real estate needs we can help service, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <title>2 Ways to Finance Your New Construction Home </title>

        <description>

When you buy a new construction home, there are basically two financing options available for you: a one-time close or a two-time close. Each option comes with advantages and disadvantages.

A one-time close finances the purchase and the construction of the home at the same time. The advantage of doing that is you only have to worry about one set of closing costs. Also, if something affects your ability to qualify for a loan down the line, such as job loss or a job change, you won’t have to worry about your home purchase because you have already closed.

The downside of a one-time close is it comes with a higher interest rate because you have to finance the construction and the home all in one fell swoop. The longer you plan to be in the home, the less advantageous this financing is.

A two-time close allows you to take out a construction loan to purchase the property and then refinance the loan into permanent financing once construction is complete. This option gives you a much lower interest rate, which is great. However, you will have to take care of two sets of closing costs. The other issue is that interest rates may change while the property is being constructed..

“Each financing option has pros and cons.”

Ultimately, there are pros and cons to each financing option. If you are buying a new construction house and would like to learn more, my team and I would be happy to answer any questions you may have. Just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

        <description>

Many people have no idea what to do if an appraisal comes in low on a home they are trying to buy or refinance. There are a number of different options you have based on what kind of product you have. The first big distinction to determine is if it is a home purchase or refinance.

If it is a home refinance, your lender would have started the loan with an assumption of what the appraisal would be, and priced your loan accordingly. If the value happens to come in lower, it could put you into a higher risk loan. If you’re trying to do a cash-out loan, it could also prevent you from being able to take cash out.

“Lenders won’t lend more than the appraised value.”

For a purchase loan, it’s a little more different and complex. The sales price is set by the sales contract. The lender is only allowed to lend on either the sales price or the appraised value; whichever is lower. When you have a low appraisal come in as a buyer, there are three different ways to handle this:


  Ask the seller to renegotiate the sales contract to bridge the gap.
  Rebut the appraisal by providing the lender additional information for the appraiser to consider that they may have missed.
  Accept the value as-is, and by doing so, cause your cash to close to increased.


That’s kind of the big picture overview of what happens when you have a low appraisal. No matter what happens, your loan officer will be contacting you to resolve these issues as soon as possible. If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

What all goes into the loan process?

The loan process starts once a lender has a 1003 Form, also known as a loan application. With that, they’ll pull a credit report. From there, they’re going to request the specific documentation from you in order to pre-approve you for your loan. As we’ve previously covered, the most common documentation include tax returns, W2s, paycheck stubs, bank statements, and other things of that nature.

“Mkae sure that all documents get sent in timely fashion.”

Once you’re pre-approved, you’re free and clear to start shopping for your new home and hopefully place a property under contract. Once you’ve placed a property under contract, make sure you forward that contract to your lender as soon as you can so they can update the federal disclosures to be sent to you. We’re required to send you a loan estimate within three days of you identifying a property address to us.

Once your lender has those disclosures electronically signed, they’ll be able to move your file forward into the underwriting phase. During the underwriting phase, the underwriter will review everything and issue a conditional loan approval. At that point, the processor will introduce themselves to you and send you a needs list to help clear the conditions of the loan. By “conditions,” we usually mean an updated bank statement or paycheck stub.

Once final loan approval is granted, the file will be sent to a pre-closing quality control reviewer, and then onto the closing department where the closing package can be prepared for you. Once the closing disclosure gets sent to you, it has to be acknowledged by you three days prior to closing, or the closing would have to be pushed back. Once the lender has the closing disclosure, the next step is for you to show up at the official closing with a valid photo ID and any certified funds that are required for it.

Stretch out your forearm beforehand, because you will be signing a lot of documents. After that, you can count yourself as a happy owner!

If you have any more questions or need help with this process, just give us a call or send us an email. My team would be happy to help.

        <description>

To get fully approved for a mortgage, you need to make sure all of your documents are in order. We’re going to talk about some of the documents you will definitely need in order to get approved, and when you should have them ready.

The first one you’ll need is a 1003, by far the most important document lenders need to complete an approval. We use that to pull a credit report and from that point we can dig into all the specifics required. The high-level overview will need two years of tax returns, two years of W-2s in addition to the two most recent paycheck stubs covering a 30-day pay period. You will also need to provide the two most recent account statements for whatever bank accounts or asset accounts you have.

The reality is that there are literally dozens of potential documents we could be requesting, but until we get the loan application and review your credit we won’t be able to tell you. When you’re ready to purchase a home, make sure you’re prepared for a pre-approval. The document request is just an initial request. There will likely be more requests throughout the process as we get closer to closing.

“We want you to be able to make an offer on your dream home.”

At the end of the day, our goal is to be in compliance with the government by showing that you have the ability to repay a loan and have been given no special treatment. We document your file so we can stay compliant and try to shrink any problems that may occur from the get go. We want you to be able to make an offer on your dream home when it comes along, so that’s why a pre-approval is so important.

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out. Give us a call or send us an email, we would love to hear from you.

        <description>

You may have heard real estate professionals tell you that you need a pre-approval letter or a pre-qualification letter to buy a home. Do you know the difference between these letters?

In Texas, we have the conditional qualification letter and the conditional approval letter. When most consumers contact us about getting a letter, they are referring to the conditional qualification letter. One of the quirky things about the state of Texas is that lenders are required to list the documents that they have and have not verified on that letter.

When people contact us saying that they want a pre-qualification letter, most think that we’ll help them with a loan application by pulling their credit and writing them a letter. While that’s fine and we can do that, we must list on the document that nothing has been verified, and that can make it a very weak letter. In today’s highly-competitive real estate market, you need as strong a letter as possible when making your offers.

For that reason, we encourage our clients to take it a step further and provide us with the supporting documents so that we can issue a strong letter for them. Almost all of our clients take us up on that, and we can do it very quickly just as long as they provide us all the info in a timely manner.

“In today’s market, you need as strong of a letter as possible.”

Again, there is that second type of letter in the state of Texas - the conditional approval letter. The great thing about this letter is that once you’ve been pre-approved, we can push your file forward to an underwriter for full credit approval. Basically, all of the hard work of the loan is done up front, the underwriter signs off on everything, and, with the exception of getting an appraisal on the property, you are completely done with your mortgage. With all the hard work done up front, the time frame for being under contract is shortened, and the experience is just more enjoyable all around.

If you’re looking to buy and looking for a lender, we’d be honored to serve you. Send us an email or give us a call and our team will get working with you right away.
