        <description>

Here are three mistakes not to make if you’re in the home-buying process.

Today Chuck Simmons from Motto Mortgage Midwest joins us to discuss the three main things you shouldn’t do if you’re in the process of buying a home. Some of these things may seem obvious, but many people don’t know the ins and outs of how the process works. Don’t get caught making one of these mistakes:

1. Don’t change jobs. If you’re getting a mortgage, job stability is a crucial factor. If you do change jobs, let your lender know because there are many extra verifications needed. Not communicating leads to delays in your closing. Just wait a couple of weeks until you close on the house to change jobs.

“Don’t get caught making one of these mistakes.”

2. Don’t take on new debt. People often get excited and buy new furniture for their new home right before closing, for example. Even if they won’t be making a payment for 18 months, we still have to stop the process, verify that debt, and build in a payment. In the worst scenarios, this can cause huge problems for buyers. Chuck had to call a client on Black Friday once and ask them to stop making purchases!

3. Don’t miss any payments. Don’t miss payments or pay them late. Keep showing your creditworthiness. We don’t have to pull credit again for four months, but if you’ve missed a payment during that time, it causes issues. 

These blunders are why it’s so critical to work with an expert who educates you about the process, though occasionally we have to explain it again because some people don’t quite make the connection as to why this is such essential advice. The lesson from today: Keep your situation the same while you wait to close on a property.

If you have any questions about these buyer errors or real estate in general, please reach out to me. I would love to help you.

Here are two easy ways to prepare your home for the real estate market.

When it’s time to prepare your home for the market, there are a couple of simple fixes that make a huge difference and get you more than your money back:

1. Make it sparkling clean. This is the easiest way to improve your house for the market and the most crucial. For some, this may seem obvious, but others don’t realize just how much of a difference this makes. People generally also acquire a ton of stuff, so you must also depersonalize the home.

“‘Agreeable gray’ is the current go-to ultimate neutral paint color.”

2. Paint. The most popular colors right now are soft grays, and many are even moving to whites again (I know, five years ago that would have sounded crazy). “Agreeable gray” is the current go-to ultimate neutral paint color that stagers and builders use. If anything looks a bit dull or scuffed up, painting can help. 

If you have any questions about preparing your house for the market or real estate in general, I’d love to speak with you. Call or email me at your convenience.

        <description>

On this episode, we’re focusing on multiple-offer strategies for sellers.

When you are a home seller who is receiving multiple offers, it’s very common for your agent to reach back out to buyers to ask for their highest and best offer by a certain time frame. I try a different approach because I’m not the biggest fan of the sense of finality conveyed by this strategy. The approach I take involves going back to the buyers, letting them know that we have a multiple-offer situation, and asking if they’d like to make any adjustments to their offer before proceeding. 

With this method, we can counter any of the offers that come in. It doesn’t just have to be the highest-priced offer; I think that’s something a lot of people get caught up on. A lot of agents don’t explain to their clients that price isn’t the only thing that should be considered; terms like the earnest money deposit or inspection period are very important, too.

If you have any questions for me about how to choose the best offer or compete against multiple buyers in this market, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

On this episode, we’re focusing on multiple-offer strategies for sellers.

Heather Burnside and I are back once again to give you the latest in Central Iowa real estate news. During this episode, we covered a lot, from multiple-offer strategies that can help sellers in this market to an interview with brand-new homeowner Emory Songer. Most of these strategies are things your agent should know about already, but if they don’t, we’re happy that we’re able to share them with you today. For example, feedback is extremely important from buyers, especially those who have made offers. To learn more about what it’s like to buy and sell real estate in Central Iowa right now, watch the latest episode here.

        <description>

Here are six tips that will make your offer stand out in a bidding war.

Nationally, multiple offers are becoming more and more frequent in the real estate market, and that’s certainly true in most segments of our Des Moines market. 

As a buyer, when you make an offer for the home you want, it has to be presented in a way that will actually win the home. If you work with an inexperienced agent who doesn’t have a strategy, you’ll end up making offer after offer with nothing to show for it. The key is to work with the right agent. Additionally, there are six tips to help make your offer stand out in a multiple-offer situation: 

1. Have a strategy in the presentation. My team and I sell hundreds of listings each year, and I can tell you that your agent isn’t doing you any favors by just sharing your offer and not saying anything about it. This leads me to my second tip…

2. Share the love. We often have our buyers write a letter or take a picture of themselves to share with sellers because it’s a way of adding a personal touch and showing why they love the home. Many of us have a sentimental connection to our homes, which means sellers will want a buyer who will enjoy their home the way they did. 

3. Shorten or waive contingencies. You don’t want to make it difficult for the seller to like you. Asking for things like closing costs, a 21- day inspection period (as opposed to the normal seven-day period), or professionally painted walls is a good way to do just that. 

“Have a strategy to win and don’t try offering less than the list price.”

4. Pre-inspect the home. This is somewhat of a continuation of the previous tip, since getting a pre-inspection allows you to waive the inspection contingency in your offer. Plus, it will help you uncover any potential problems with the home. 

5. Make your best offer. In other words, don’t test the seller by offering less than what you’re able. In a multiple-offer situation, it behooves you to put your cards on the table. You don’t want to miss out on the home you want over $500 or $1,000. 

6. Make it easy for the seller. For example, they may have to wait to take possession of their next home, so give them extended possession of your home after closing to make the moving process easier. 

Remember—win the bidding war for the home you want before worrying about the appraisal, inspection, etc. Have a strategy to win and don’t try offering less than the list price. If a home has hit the market in the last week and it has multiple offers, that means it’s priced or underpriced for the market, which means you’re underpaying by paying the asking price. 

If you’d like to know more about how to win the home you want or there’s anything else I can assist you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

        <description>

I recently appeared on a talk radio show with Heather Burnside to discuss our certified pre-owned program for sellers.

We’ve been doing the certified pre-owned program for several years now, and it is a great marketing feature for our sellers. However, there’s more intent behind it than just marketing to appeal to buyers.

We find that when sellers are going through the process, the home inspection is the most stressful stage because someone else is critiquing every aspect of the home. 

Part of the stress comes from the fact that, after the seller has negotiated everything down to the penny, they’ll then have to go through a second negotiation 10 days later based on the results of their inspection. There are many things that can come up during the inspection that might scare buyers, even if those things aren’t that big of a deal.

“With our certified pre-owned program, your home will be fully vetted, which allows you to choose what repairs you’ll take care of and know the cost of those items.”

We explain to our sellers that we want to put them in the driver’s seat of this part of the process. With our certified pre-owned program, your home will be fully vetted, which allows you to choose what repairs you’ll take care of and know the cost of those items. That way, when you’re negotiating the sale price, you can have that in mind instead of having to take care of thousands of dollars in surprise repairs after you already thought your home was sold. 

Our Certified Pre-Owned Home program also includes a 13-month home warranty through Home Warranty of America to help repair or replace any issues found with a seller’s major systems—home warranties usually last for 12 months, so you’ll get a bonus month from HWA!

Adam McCarty from Rightway Home Inspections is here to answer a few home inspection questions.

In today’s message, I sat down with Adam McCarty from Rightway Home Inspections on my weekly radio show “The Central Iowa Real Estate Scoreboard” on 106.3 KXnO to discuss a few key questions people tend to have about his industry, including the importance of pre-inspections, things that tend to surprise sellers about inspections, and the kinds of technology that help inspectors spot issues that homeowners might not even be aware of.

“Do you need to be a certified home inspector?”

There are a lot of really good inspectors in the state who were previously in the HVAC, plumbing, or construction industries, and that prior experience is a big plus for consumers.

“How important is a pre-inspection?”

Instead of having to negotiate twice, it just makes sense for a seller to get everything out of the way with a pre-inspection. 

“What kinds of things do people need to do to prepare for an inspection?”

If you already know there are issues with your home, Adam recommends taking care of them before he comes to your home for the inspection. In terms of preparing the house, that homeowners need to provide clear access to things like your furnace, electrical panel, attic, etc. 

“Do the sellers need to be present for the inspection?”

They don’t have to be, but it’s great if they are. That way, Adam can explain what items buyers are concerned about and what sellers should do to prevent issues later on in the transaction. 

“What is a thermal camera?”

Thermal cameras are a special type of camera that allows Adam to see differences in heat within the home. This allows him to spot issues that sellers might not know about because they can’t see them.

“What are the biggest surprises during an inspection?”

Sellers often don’t realize how hazardous electrical panels can be.

For more information about home inspections and the services that Adam and Rightway Home Inspections offer, visit their website or call him at (515) 802-0141.

In the meantime, if you have any questions about buying or selling homes, don’t hesitate to reach out to the Misty SOLDwisch Home Selling Team. We’re here to help.

Listen to “The Central Iowa Real Estate Scoreboard” with Misty SOLDwisch and Heather Burnside Sundays 9:30am on KXnO.”

Here’s everything you need to know about our new radio half-hour!

Our new radio show, The Central Iowa Real Estate Scoreboard, is aptly named but not just because it airs on sports station 1460 KXNO; the parallels between the sports world, life itself, and the real estate market run deep. For instance, life could throw you a huge curveball, and suddenly you need to relocate for a new job. Maybe after quarantining with your family for two months, you’ve finally admitted to yourself that your house isn’t big enough (something we’ve been hearing from folks a lot lately). 

Thankfully, every Sunday at 9:30 a.m., I’ll be updating you on an ever-changing real estate market, and answering your questions so you can be equipped as a potential home seller, buyer, or investor. Ours is an equally exciting and challenging market to navigate. Since the onset of the coronavirus, the Misty Soldwisch Home Selling Team—like countless other professionals nationwide—has had to adapt our model for success. That’s the benefit of having a whole team behind you though; when things get flipped upside down, you’re able to change course rather quickly. 

“Ours is an equally exciting and challenging market to navigate.”

First, we studied those markets affected earliest by the virus and asked, “How are real estate professionals there responding, and how can we apply the most effective responses to Iowa?” Then, we leveraged the tools and technology we’d already been using by integrating it further into the process. Ultimately, people need to buy and sell no matter what’s going on in the world—we had to be prepared to meet our clients’ evolving needs. 

Cited below for your convenience are timestamps that will direct you to various points in the conversation. Feel free to watch the full message, or use these timestamps to skip to topics that interest you most: 

2:40 — The switch to virtual open houses

5:50 — How the virtual process works

7:20 — Who is active in our market? 

8:18 — Changing trends in home buying 

10:39 — The real value of swimming pools versus their perceived value 

12:53 — Which home exterior projects are worthwhile investments?

14:59 — What homebuyers need to know about interest rates 

18:28 — Is demand still outpacing our housing inventory?

22:35 — What is a ‘normal’ real estate cycle, anyway?

24:11 — The Misty Soldwisch guarantee explained 

25:45 — The featured home of the week 

28:00 — Wrapping up the show 

As always, if you have questions about anything discussed in this week’s episode or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out by phone or email or visit soldincentraliowa.com. Our team is here to be a resource for you!

Today’s message is about what the experts see on the horizon for the housing market. If you’re considering buying or selling a home, I’m sharing what you need to know. According to the National Association of Realtors, 77% of potential sellers are preparing to sell their houses following the end of stay-at-home orders. Millennials in particular are predicted to lead the way back into a positive, purchase-driven housing cycle. Let’s connect soon to discuss your real estate goals! To learn more from the experts, watch the short video above.

We have tools and services to help you buy a home virtually. Learn how here.

Today I want to tell you about our virtual home buying services. The health crisis has people concerned about the safety of going into occupied houses for their home search. The great news is, our virtual home buying services help you decide on a property without having to necessarily go through the home physically. We have had many of these tools and services for quite some time and have used them successfully with out-of-state buyers or people who, for whatever reason, couldn’t go to the house. A few of the services we offer virtually are consultations, tours, open houses, electronically signing paperwork, and more. To learn further about buying a home during this pandemic, watch our latest video above.

Showing homes to clients only makes up about 5% of what an agent does, but you can make it 100%.

On the latest episode of my podcast with Van and Bonnie, I have exciting news to share: The Misty SOLDwisch Home Selling Team is looking for showing agents to show houses for our team.  

It’s no secret that I love real estate. There are so many different aspects of it, and we’re making a difference in people’s lives. Being in real estate also means you have to be good at many different things. It’s not just about showing a house—you have to do paperwork, handle inspections, etc. 

That’s the advantage our team brings to the table. We have people who fill specialized roles, and this new role we’re launching is designed for people who love focusing on the fun part of real estate and don’t want to handle the more challenging aspects of it. 

“This position is a great fit for anyone that loves spending time with people and helping them find their dream home.”

A lot of people tell me they want to sell real estate because they love looking at houses, but the reality is that showing houses is only about 5% of what a full-time agent does. This new role makes showing homes 100% of the job. 

The agents in this new role will set their own schedule to show houses for our clients. Instead of working on commission, they’ll earn an hourly rate for simply being there for our clients during the fun part of real estate. Having a real estate license is a requirement for the job, but we’re flexible with schedules.

This position is a great fit for anyone that loves spending time with people and helping them find their dream home. The right candidate can be part-time or full-time, depending on what their needs are. 

No one else in the industry offers this role to the same degree that we do, but I’m excited about it because I know there are some great people out there who’d love to be in the business on a more expanded level. If they have a real estate license and aren’t putting it to good use, or their career hasn’t turned out exactly how they wanted it, this could be their solution.

So if you know someone who wants to get paid to show a bunch of brand-new houses to families looking for their dream home, give me a call today or visit www.SOLDinCentralIowa.com. I’d love to hear from you.

Today Max Wilker from Better Homes &amp; Gardens is here to talk about the trends and decorating motifs that are sweeping the housing industry.

Today’s guest Max Wilker is the Style Director at Better Homes &amp; Gardens, so he definitely has his finger on the pulse of the hottest trends in home decorating. He’s here today to share some insight about what’s in and what’s out in terms of home decor.

Max informs me that butterflies, bugs, and insects are increasingly popular decorating motifs. This includes things like stylized dragonflies on dinnerware and/or butterflies on pillows.

Additionally, textures are a huge trend right now, and manufacturers are coming up with unique ways to tap into it. For example, Max showed me a butterfly pillow where the butterfly itself was printed onto the fabric, but then an embroidery overlay was added to give the image some texture and depth.

“A decorative motif that brings the outdoors inward can definitely give your home a warm, inviting, and comfortable feel.”

Next, realistic bird motifs are gaining popularity. In the past, more whimsical bird motifs were popular, but the market has circled back around to realism, including things such as lifelike illustrations of native birds on dinnerware, fabric patterns, clocks, and more.

Continuing in the vein of bringing the outdoors into the home, botanical prints are also coming back to the market. Whether they’re stylized and monochrome or they’re detailed and lifelike, these motifs are a classic, beautiful addition to a home that can give it an upscale feel. They would look great in a modern loft or an industrial farmhouse.

Finally, given how bold, natural motifs are surging forward in the market, it follows that furniture, light fixtures, accessories, and decorative pieces made from rattan, bamboo, and reeds are becoming popular, too.

Especially here in Iowa, where the winter gets bitter and everything outside is buried in snow, having a decorative motif that brings the outdoors inward can definitely give your home a warm, inviting, and comfortable feel.

If you have any questions about this or other real estate topics, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.

Homebuyers: Follow these 10 real estate commandments to ensure you make it all the way to the closing table.

If you’re a homebuyer and you want to be sure to make it to closing, follow these 10 real estate commandments: 

Thou shall not:

1. Change jobs or become self-employed. If you change your industry or how you’re compensated, it can really shake up how the mortgage approval process goes for you.

2. Buy a new vehicle. Even if your car is totaled, it’s very important that you wait until after closing to replace it; anything that affects your credit can really affect your ability to get approved.

3. Buy new furniture. Wait until after you’ve closed, no matter how exciting, because, again, changes to your bank statements/credit can negatively affect your ability to get a loan.

4. Fall behind on credit card payments. It can be tempting to skip a payment one month and just catch up next month, but this can have a massive effect on your credit score. Lenders do credit checks prior to closing even if you already had one.

5. Omit financial debts or liabilities from your loan application. If you forget to inform your lender of liabilities that don’t come up until later in the underwriting process—like deferred loans or loans you’ve co-signed—those can catch up with you later.

“Anything that affects your credit can really affect your ability to get approved.”

6. Stop paying current mortgage or rent. Most lenders follow the guideline that if you’re more than 15 days past due with your mortgage payment, you then have to go a full 12 months of making on-time payments in order to qualify.

7. Allow additional credit inquiries.

8. Co-sign on a loan. Even if it’s for your kids, wait until after you’ve closed.

9. Make large deposits into your bank account. If your lender finds deposits that can’t be accounted for, that’s a red flag. Those funds need to be seasoned in your account so that it’s not considered a potential liability.

10. Change banks/accounts or do excessive transfers. Lenders want to understand where your money is coming from so they have a real sense of your ability to pay and what kinds of obligations you have.

If you follow these 10 real estate commandments, it will make the process of getting all the way to the closing table much easier.

If you have any questions about buying or selling a home, reach out to us. I’m always here to help.

        <description>

Realizing success in your home sale or purchase starts with who you hire, as you’ll learn from today’s video.

My good friends Van and Bonnie invited me back on their podcast show to discuss the importance of hiring an agent you can trust and who will deliver results when it comes to your buying and selling needs. A professional agent will always work to put your interests first and will go above and beyond in ways the standard agent won’t.  

In the video above, you can listen to my full interview with Van and Bonnie, where I cover such topics as our Love It or Leave It Program, other special services and tools we offer our clients, the emotional side of moving, and so much more.     

If you have any questions about what we covered today or if you’re looking for professional guidance in the buying or selling process, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you!

I recently sat down once again with my good friends Van and Bonnie to talk about an important topic: Our market. Now that 2019 is more than halfway over, we thought now was the perfect time to share some insight into how the first half of this year played out in terms of our real estate market.

        <description>

If you’re curious about buying a new construction home, this video may help you get off the fence.

Often when we speak with buyers, they express frustration over the fact that they can’t find exactly the kind of home they’re looking for in the market. When this happens, one option we present to them is the possibility of building a new home from scratch. 

New construction homes allow buyers to fully customize every detail of their next home. Working with an agent who has experience with these kinds of homes really opens up a lot of doors for buyers. 

Some fear that the new construction process may be too long or too complex, but the truth is that many great builders in Central Iowa can make building a home easy and stress-free.

“If your dream home doesn’t exist, why not build it?”

Our team would be happy to streamline the process even more by offering our professional guidance throughout your home building experience. 

A lot of communities in Central Iowa even offer tax abatements, and many builders have strong relationships with local lenders who can give you some generous financing incentives. So building a new home can actually be quite affordable with the right approach. 

All in all, if your dream home doesn’t exist, why not build it? We would be happy to help you to do so. Or, if you’re still willing to search the open market, we would also love to guide you to a resale home that fits your needs.

Real estate investing has had a huge impact on my life. It’s helped me to build wealth, support my family, and prepare for the future. 

Renting out investment properties is an incredible way to create passive income. Better still, paying down the mortgage on these properties becomes much easier when you’re using a tenant’s money to do so, as opposed to your own. 

Tax benefits related to mortgage interest deductions and depreciation are also a major advantage for real estate investors. Beyond that, properties appreciate over time, making real estate a very powerful way to build wealth. 

At this point, you may be thinking to yourself, “Well, that sounds great. But what about taking care of the property? I don’t want to get a phone call in the middle of the night from a tenant asking me to fix their leaky faucet.” 

“Renting out investment properties is an incredible way to create passive income.”

This concern is completely understandable, but also easy to resolve. Many rental investors feel this way, which is why they hire a property management company to take care of these tasks for them. Property management companies can handle all of the logistics of running a rental property for a very affordable price, depending on who you work with.  

As for the kind of property you should invest in, there is no one correct answer. It simply depends on your goals. So if you are thinking of investing in real estate, please reach out to me. I would be happy to speak to you more about how investment properties work and connect you to an experienced, local mortgage professional. 

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like to be on the mailing list of one of the real estate investing seminars my team will be hosting in the upcoming months, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

What’s the latest news from our Central Iowa market as we look back on the first half of the year?

2019 has been pretty exciting so far. The real estate market has been strong despite all the crazy weather. Because of that, we didn’t hit our stride until the midway point of the year. With that being said, there are a few trends to keep an eye on moving forward whether you’re a buyer or a seller.  

First of all, a lot of price reductions are happening. In fact, last June, 44% of all inventory underwent a price reduction. This tells us a lot of sellers were optimistic entering the market but then changed their expectations to meet a slower market demand. This is good news for buyers because it means there are a lot of motivated sellers itching to get their property sold and who are willing to negotiate. We have more properties on the market now than we did at this point last year—not because there are more sellers, but because inventory isn’t selling as quickly. 

“There are a few trends to keep an eye on moving forward whether you’re a buyer or a seller.”

Second, just because a property is under contract doesn’t mean the deal is done. Year to date, we’ve seen nearly 20% of all deals fall apart after they’ve gone under contract. There are a lot of ways a deal can fall apart, but in my opinion, there are a couple reasons that explain this trend:


  You’re in a competitive price point. In a competitive price point where multiple-offer situations are more common, there’s a higher fallout rate during the inspection phase because buyers are pickier due to having to pay a premium. On our team, we have our Certified Pre-Owned Home Program in place to prevent this from happening.  
  Buyers’ financing falling through. This is why, if you’re a seller, working with an experienced Realtor is key, because we know how to find out as much as possible about a buyer’s financial qualifications. 


Third, there’s a lot of dichotomy in the market. In terms of days on market, there’s a big difference between homes listed above and below $300,000. The average list price for resale homes in our market is $265,000, which is a hot price point to be in as a seller. If you go anywhere above $300,000, though, it’s more of a buyer’s market. 

The other dichotomy lies between resale and new construction homes. New construction homes tend to have more inventory and a much higher average days on market, and right now we have about seven months’ worth of inventory for these types of homes. Some of this makes sense—it takes a while for these homes to be built in the first place (typically four to five months), and with the crazy weather we’ve already seen, it’s no surprise that this build period may have been extended.

This is why, whether we’re working with buyers or sellers, we key in on the specific market you’re focused on. 

The bottom line is we’re seeing a strong-but-changing market as we move through 2019, so we’ll have to be extra diligent at keeping an eye on what’s happening in other markets as well. 

If you have any other questions about our market or you’d like to know what your home is worth, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

There are many moving parts to a real estate transaction, and it’s a Realtor’s job to guide you through the process. Even in a hot market, you still have to prepare and market your home, and having the right expertise behind you makes all the difference in terms of maximizing your sale price. What does that expertise look like, though? I was recently a guest on the radio show “Van and Bonnie in the Morning” to help answer that question. To listen to the interview, watch this short video.

But breaking real estate news isn’t all we cover in this great new podcast. We also share tips for buyers and sellers on how best to navigate today’s market, as well as information regarding today’s most innovative real estate programs.

I recently sat down with Van and Bonnie to talk some more about Central Iowa real estate. Specifically, I talked about a few different projects I have going on with Kimberly Development Company. They have been around since 1978, and the quality and attention to detail in their homes really shines. I also talked about Woodland Hills Villas, what’s in and what’s out in terms of home trends, and much more. To hear the full episode, watch this short video.

We work with people all the time who are thinking of putting their home on the market but are concerned about the potential stress involved in the home selling process and how that will affect their family and their lifestyle. This fear of the unknown can cause them to delay their decision.

If you find yourself in this same situation, your first step should be to hire a great real Realtor. A great Realtor will shoulder a lot of the stress for you by doing three important things:

1. Setting expectations. Most people undergo the home selling process four to six times in their life, but we Realtors do it every day, so we can tell you what you can expect during the process from start to finish.

2. Eliminating surprises. For example, we eliminate surprises for our sellers through our Certified Pre-Owned Home program. Over the years, I’ve found that the most stressful part of the home sale process for sellers is usually when their home goes through its inspections.

“We can tell you what you can expect during the process from start to finish.”

You can take great care of your home, but certain things you’re not aware of might still show up once an inspector starts digging through it. It’s a terrible feeling to be at the mercy of the buyer’s home inspector, so taking this preemptive approach is how we take control of the situation.

3. Communicating. This means communicating through the good times and the bad times. Time and time again, I’ve heard from buyers and sellers that the most disappointing part of working with a real estate agent is when they don’t communicate.

On our team, communication is our strong suit. Each member has a specialized role that allows them to focus on a key part of the home sale process. This not only helps with facilitating our communication, but it also helps with setting expectations and eliminating surprises.

If you’d like to talk more about making your home sale as smooth and stress-free as possible or you have any other real estate needs I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak to you.

        <description>

I’ve seen so many situations in which people get excited about a home they’ve found and fall in love with it. It’s their dream home, so they’re willing to stretch and struggle to make it work. But unfortunately, that’s sometimes just not feasible.

To gauge whether you’re stretching yourself too thin, keep an eye on the following five signs:

1. Are you relying on creative financing and tax abatement to make your payment? Here in Central Iowa, we have many communities with amazing tax abatement incentives that range from a portion of the value being abated for three to five years to 100% abatement for seven years. Oftentimes people who are really stretching their budgets will combine that along with an adjustable mortgage rate or another creative means to get the financing they need.

“Don’t squeeze your budget too tightly.”When you know exactly how this works and you’ve done the research that will tell you want your monthly payment will be like in the end, that’s one thing. However, many people just jump into it with plans to figure it out later. That can set you up for tough economic situations in the future.

2. Do you need down payment assistance programs to qualify for this house? If the purchase or sale price of the home is so high that coming up with the down payment is a struggle, then it could be an indication that you’re trying to purchase outside your range.

3. Do you have just enough money to cover your mortgage? If you have enough money per month to cover your mortgage, but have little left over for the rest of your expenses, that’s a definite sign that you’re exceeding your limits. Don’t squeeze your budget too tightly. Some loans are generous with your debt-to-income ratios and will only consider one person in your household’s debt. You need to have a good overall picture of your financial situation.

4. Are you considering taking money from your retirement funds? Now, some people can use this strategy successfully, but that’s highly dependent on their situations. If the only way to make your mortgage work is to take money from your hard-earned retirement funds, then that’s an issue.

5. Do you have a bad feeling about the purchase? If, during your purchase, you get an overwhelming sinking feeling that the whole thing is a bad idea, it’s a good idea to go with your gut. We do want to help you purchase a home, but you should also be happy with it. You’re the one who has to live in the house and manage your expenses, so your feelings are paramount.

If you’re a homebuyer who is experiencing one or more of these signs or if you’re interested in purchasing a home, please feel free to reach out to me. We’re always here to help.

        <description>

A statement we hear from homeowners often goes like this: “I’d like to do something in the future, but I just don’t know if the timing is right for me.” Here are four signs that it is time for you to consider making that move.

1. Your home is too small. This one seems obvious, right? If the home that worked great for you with small babies and toddlers feels like it’s bursting at the seems as they grow into pre-teens and teenagers, it’s time to check out the options that might be a fit for you. You’d be surprised at how easy it is to transition into a space that makes much more sense to you.

“You have flexibility in this market that you wouldn’t have had ten years ago.”

2. Your lifestyle has changed. An area that makes sense at one point in your life might create a really difficult commute when your work changes or you retire. The home that served you really well until this point might not really be the fit. The good news is that there are really good options out there that will give you the lifestyle you want for today.

3. Remodeling isn’t enough. When remodeling the home simply doesn’t give you the return you need to alter the space, it might be time to go find a different place. I see this happen quite a bit. We get really attached to our homes, especially if we’re comfortable there and have been there for a long time. Sometimes it doesn’t make sense to remodel because you’ll end up over-improving for the neighborhood or over-leveraging yourself on the house. We have access to many studies that give information about what kind of returns different improvements will give you. If you’re curious about that when weighing the pros and cons, we’d be happy to pass that information along.

4. You have some flexibility in your timeline. I know this might seem a little strange, but the thing is that in 2018 we have a great market. I’ve been in real estate for 19 years and have seen some markets that are really rough. In these markets, someone may have wanted to make a change because of one these reasons, but values had declined so much that they were stuck and couldn’t make a move until the market improved. If you know what you want for your future and know something different is what you need, explore the market right now while the market is great and there are a lot of different advantages to being a seller.

As always, if you have any questions for me or you’re interested in buying or selling a home anytime in the near future, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Having been in the real estate business since 1999, I’m frequently approached by people who are fascinated by the idea of joining this industry but have no idea where to begin.

“I’d love to talk to you about what makes the Misty SOLDwisch Team here at Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Innovations such an amazing place to work.”

Because of this demand, I’ve decided to launch a monthly meet and greet where people thinking of entering real estate can learn about the business. During these meet and greets, I’ll discuss my experience, my team’s unique approach to home selling, and what to expect from a real estate career.

The meet and greet also provides people with the opportunity to learn about how our team functions on the operational side. Getting into real estate doesn’t have to mean taking on a sales position.

If any of this sounds interesting, I’d love to talk to you about what makes the Misty SOLDwisch Team here at Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Innovations such an amazing place to work.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

The Misty SOLDwisch home selling team is so thrilled to have amazing relationships with different local builders, as this gives us a unique perspective and unique advantages in assisting our clients with their new construction purchases.

“When you build a new home, you can pick out every detail.”

There are a number of advantages to building a new home over purchasing a resale property. Today I’d like to list three of these advantages to give you a better idea of whether this may be something that’s right for you.


  You get to choose exactly what you want. When you build a new home, you can pick out every detail. This means you won’t have to worry about making compromises on carpet, back-splashes, or any other features. Our team works with builders who have streamlined their process in order to make buying new construction as easy as possible. These builders provide buyers with options so that they can design a home that is truly customized to their needs and tastes. 
  You don’t have to wait for the right home to come on the market. Instead, you get to create the right home. This is very important in a tight inventory market, especially if you’re searching in a price point where multiple offer situations are common and competition is fierce. 
  You get great incentives when you buy new construction. Many builders offer amazing financing options through preferred lenders. Also, many communities around Central Iowa offer tax abatement incentives for buyers purchasing new construction. This can equate to thousands in savings and help increase your buying power.


So, if you’re curious about your options in terms of buying new construction, please get in touch. My team has a high level of expertise on this subject and would be happy to lead you through the process. With the right help, it’s a lot easier than you might think.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Some pretty significant changes have happened in our market recently, and there are three reasons why now is a great time to buy.

First, with how low inventory is, you may be surprised at how much equity is in your current home that you can tap into. One thing our team works really hard at is coaching our clients on how to maximize the value of their home to get as much equity out of it as possible. We’re finding that sellers are pleasantly surprised with the numbers that we’re coming up with which give them incredible buying power.

Second, banks are coming out with some amazing financing options which offer low down payment amounts and great incentives. These options make the buying process so much easier than what we saw two or three years ago when the lending environment was more restrictive. We’re seeing a lot of people take their home equity and use these low down payment options to pay off debt, relieve their monthly cash flow, and improve their overall financial situation.

“Buy now while you can still get a great payment at a historically low rate.”

Third, mortgage interest rates are on the rise and are predicted to keep rising until the end of the year. Since January 2018, interest rates have risen about 0.75%, and that kind of jump has a big effect on buying power. However, rates are still historically low. Conventional wisdom states that by the end of 2018, we’ll be looking at about a 5% rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage. Buy now while you can still get a great payment at a historic low rate.

As always, if you have any further questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

        <title>Sellers, Beware of These 3 Myths</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/sellers-beware-of-these-3-myths.html</link>

        <description>

As a seller, there are three main real estate myths that you need to ignore when putting your home on the market.

Myth #1: You need to raise your listing price to leave room for negotiation.

This is a tough one because it’s been reinforced time and time again, but just because people say it doesn’t mean it’s true. In our Central Iowa market, homes typically sell very close to their list price when they’re priced for today’s market. Depending on your home’s location and what type of home it is, it’s easy to anticipate getting anywhere from 98% to 100% of your list price. When we prepare a market analysis for our sellers, we give them an idea of what to anticipate and structure their pricing strategy based on those two factors.

Myth #2: All homes sell in springtime, so it’s the only time to put your home on the market.

While it’s true that a lot of people are fond of how their home looks in the springtime when everything’s in bloom, the truth is that homes sell every month of the year in our market. There are pros and cons to listing at any time of the year, so don’t worry about timing the market perfectly—worry about what’s best for your needs.

“Don’t follow these myths—follow our tips instead.”

Myth #3: You don’t need to make any changes to your home because the buyer will just want to change it anyway.

Even though buyers love the idea of making renovations and improvements to their future home, the homes that sell the fastest and for top dollar the ones that are already neutralized in stylish, current colors. For carpeting and floor coverings, there are only so many different shades of gray and beige you can use. As a rule of thumb, we always suggest to our sellers to use carpeting that’s very in-style in new construction homes because that’s market-proven to be what buyers desire.

So remember, price your home correctly and don’t artificially inflate it thinking you’re giving yourself room for negotiation. Also, remember that spring isn’t the only time homes sell—strategize your listing according to your family’s needs. Lastly, don’t leave it up to buyers to upgrade your home—make those changes yourself to make your home market-appealing so it sells for top dollar.

If you follow these tips instead of the myths, you’ll have a successful sale. If you’re curious about what’s happening in our market or you have any other real estate needs I can assist you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help.

        <description>

Everyone knows the basic steps of preparing a home for market. Things like decluttering and neutralizing are obvious, but in a competitive market there are three extra tips you can use to really polish your listing.

1. Pay special attention to your entryway.The front door of your home represents such an important first impression for a buyer. When a buyer visits your property for the very first time, they’ll probably have to stand at the front door for a few minutes waiting for their agent. As homeowners, we don’t always use our front doors to enter or leave the home. Therefore, the area is often neglected. Before you list, spruce up your entryway by adding a clean doormat and a fresh coat of paint to the front door. Also, make sure the entry within your home is clear of shoes or other clutter.

“The front door of your home represents such an important first impression for a buyer.”

2. Clean your mechanical areas. Make sure mechanical areas are tidy and dust-free and that furnace filters are replaced. This will give the buyer a great impression, leaving them more certain about the general care and maintenance of your listing.

3. Clean up closets, storage areas, and your garage. Obviously it is very important to clean, stage, and declutter the main living areas of your home. However, tidying up the storage areas throughout your property can give your listing an extra boost. If your storage areas are in disarray, buyers will feel as if your home lacks adequate space for the things they themselves will need to store when they move in.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Frustrated homebuyers in the Central Iowa market may be able to use the backup offer strategy to their advantage.

Want to buy a Central Iowa home? Search all the homes on the MLS

A lot of Central Iowa homebuyers are frustrated right now. Certain segments of the market are on fire, and they aren’t able to get into homes fast enough. As a result, they feel they don’t have very many homes to choose from.

There may still be hope if you use the backup offer strategy.

In the past, once a home went under contract, there’s very little chance for a competing buyer to get their foot in the door. Once the seller had chosen another buyer’s offer, typically they made it to the closing table with no problems.

However, in those super hot segments of the market, we are seeing a higher fallout rate. Why is that?

First of all, many buyers feel like they need to make a quick decision in those market segments or they will lose the home. As a result, it’s very common for people to make offers on a home without fully vetting the property to make sure it’s the right home for them.

“IF THE FIRST DEAL FALLS APART, THE SELLER HAS YOUR OFFER TO FALL BACK ON.”

Secondly, multiple offer situations really drive up the price of a home. Buyers then have very high expectations of how that home will perform during the inspection. Buyers and sellers have a hard time agreeing what condition the property should be in, which has led to a number of deals falling apart after the home inspection.

Having a backup offer in place puts pressure on that first offer. If for any reason that deal falls apart, the seller would much rather go to your offer than go through the hassle of putting the home on the market again. Plus, since you have a backup offer in place, the seller may be more willing to let the first deal fall apart.

Not all agents can navigate the ins and outs of the backup offer, but we work hard at honing our skills in order to give our buyers the edge in this competitive market.

If you have any questions about this strategy or anything else, just give us a call or send us an email. Remember, if we choose your question for one of our upcoming videos, you’ll get a free subscription to Better Homes and Gardens magazine.

We look forward to hearing from you!

As a home seller, how do you know which offer to pick in a multiple offer situation?

Want to sell your Central Iowa home? Get a free home value report
Want to buy a Central Iowa home? Search all the homes on the MLS

If you’re moving, these three tips should help you out quite a bit:

1. Don’t pick a peak day to move: In the central Iowa market, Fridays and Saturdays are the peak days, as well as the 1st, 30th, and 31st of each month.

2. Pack smart: You can read about some great moving hacks here. They’ll help you plan, organize, and execute the process of getting all your belongings together efficiently. On top of these hacks, you should try to take the emotion out of packing. It’s hard to avoid taking a trip down memory lane when you pack your stuff, but try to save it for when you’re in your new place.

“AVOID MOVING ON PEAK DAYS IF AT ALL POSSIBLE.”

3. Use our moving truck: This is a big advantage to working with us. We’ll even give you the manpower to help you move things. Our truck isn’t some rickety old truck either; it’s shiny and new!

If you’re thinking about making a move and need to buy and or sell a home, give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to help!

As a home seller, how do you know which offer to pick in a multiple offer situation?

The central Iowa real estate market is pretty hot right now, which creates unique challenges for buyers and sellers. For sellers, it’s incredibly important that you choose an agent who has experience with multiple offer situations, as they are common in our market.

When you receive multiple offers on your home, how do you know which is the best one? There are a few things you should consider:

1. Price. Obviously, we want to maximize your equity and get you the best price available for your home. Our expertise really comes in handy when it comes to looking at the full terms of the offer, because the offer with the highest price is not necessarily the best one for your interests.

2. What kind of time frame are they looking for? How flexible will the buyer be on possession? As a seller, that can make or break your ability to get into your next property, so it’s important to know that up front.

“THE OFFER WITH THE HIGHEST PRICE IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST ONE FOR YOU.”

3. What kind of contingencies does this buyer have that might cause stumbling blocks in the process? Inspections, HOA documents, or having a survey completed are just a few examples of little things that might seem irrelevant, especially if the buyer is offering a high price. However, each of those contingencies gives the buyer a chance to renegotiate after they’ve won the deal, which could make the transaction unpleasant for you.

4. What are the financing terms? We love cash offers, but cash isn’t always better than financing. Someone who has a loan commitment is just as important as someone who has cash. The fortunate thing about working with an experienced agent is we know what to expect from different lenders. We know if a buyer is working with a reputable lender or a lender that we’ve had issues with in the past.

Ultimately, we will sit down, look at all your different options, and work together to make sure that your needs are being met and that you choose the best offer possible.

If you have any other questions about selling your home in our current market, just give us a call. We would be happy to help you!

Today I have some important news to share—my team is in the process of hiring a Home Selling Specialist.

Home Selling Specialists are a highly valued member of my team. In this position, your job is to meet face to face with our sellers and help them strategize pricing, value, what kind of marketing approach is appropriate to take for their goals, and guide them through the process of a successful sale and closing.

There are three tremendous advantages of being a Home Selling Specialist with my team.

The first is our unparalleled marketing. With exposure on radio, television, and many Internet enhancements, our sellers have the exposure to help them get top dollar for their home in the shortest amount of time.

The second is our amazing operations team. Instead of spending your time as a courier putting up signs or as an administrative assistant filling out forms, we provide that service for you so that you’re able to leverage your time for the highest-producing activity—selling!

“THERE ARE TREMENDOUS ADVANTAGES TO BEING A HOME SELLING SPECIALIST ON MY TEAM.”

The third is a guaranteed, steady flow of highly qualified seller leads.

We’d love for our ideal candidate to have a real estate license and some real estate experience. However, we’re open to candidates who have experience in related industries, such as insurance or mortgage. It’s extremely important that our Home Selling Specialist enjoys working with numbers, analyzing data, and coming to conclusions to give our sellers good advice.

It’s also important for them to have the ability to have both happy conversations about retaining equity and tough conversations about changing the seller’s expectations, especially when they have a life-changing need such as a death or a divorce that require them to get their home sold in a timely fashion.

If this sounds like something that would be of interest to you—to be able to leverage your time, our amazing marketing machine, and 17 years of real estate sales experience, I’d love to talk. Just click on the “Join Misty’s Team” button on my website to get started. 

As always, if you have any real estate questions, I’d love to answer them. We’re here to help!

Before you decide to downsize from your current home, ask yourself these three questions.

One question we are asked on a pretty regular basis by clients is, “How do I know when the right time to downsize is?” There are some very important questions you need to ask yourself in order to determine this.

1. Can you really live with less space? A lot of empty nesters realize that they don’t need as much space or as many rooms but when it comes down to it, a lot of them aren’t ready to give things up to fit in a smaller space. If you’re not ready to give up some of the luxuries of having a large home, downsizing doesn’t make sense right now.

“CAN YOU REALLY LIVE WITH LESS SPACE?”

2. Are you ready for a truly lower-maintenance lifestyle? Going from a large home to a condo or townhome leaves you with less yard work, less maintenance, and less square footage to take care of. If that sounds like an exciting change in your life, it’s something for you to consider.

3. What kind of equity position do you have on your home? If you are in a great market, the timing might be perfect for you to maximize the equity you will pull out of the home. It might be time for you to talk to us if that is the case.

If you have any questions for us or are looking to buy or sell in Des Moines, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

Why do we recommend that every home buyer or seller gets a home warranty? Here are the benefits that warranties provide.

Whether you are a home buyer or a seller, one thing that we always think is a good idea to include in your real estate transaction is a home warranty.

What is a home warranty? It’s an agreement with a warranty provider to cover the mechanical systems and moving parts of your home for a period of time. Warranties usually last up to one year after the closing.

How do home warranties benefit buyers? The biggest benefit is that it significantly reduces the potential for large, out-of-pocket expenses after the home purchase. When we consider everything that is included in the home—appliances, the HVAC, electrical systems, and plumbing to name a few—the peace of mind that comes from knowing that a provider will cover any issues is critically important.

“WARRANTIES USUALLY LAST UP TO ONE YEAR AFTER THE CLOSING.”

How does a home warranty work? Whenever you experience an issue during that warranty coverage period, you’ll contact the warranty provider rather than your local plumber or handyman. They will connect you with one of their preferred providers and come out to look at the home. There will be a service charge up front, which you will know when you have the warranty coverage in place. They will then repair the item, and if they’re not able to do so, then they will replace it for you.

How does a home warranty benefit sellers? Most warranty providers provide free listing coverage during the time that your home is on the market. It is also a wonderful way to eliminate your liability after the closing in the event that anything goes wrong for that buyer.

Our personal warranty provider is HWA Warranty. They have an awesome platinum warranty that covers the home for 13 months, rather than the 12 months covered by most providers. We have had a lot of success with it and think that it is well worth the cost to provide our buyers with peace of mind after they have purchased their largest investment.

If you have any other questions about how a home warranty can benefit you or anything else related to real estate in Central Iowa, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help you!

        <description>

There tend to be a few common costs that buyers overlook when they purchase their home. Today, I have a full list of these items that will help buyers avoid getting surprised by extra costs.

When you buy a home, there are some hidden costs that you should be aware of.

While the home shopping process can be exciting, certain costs tend to sneak up on buyers. Here are some key tips to help you be fully informed when buying:

1. Property taxes. Of your monthly house payments, property taxes are the item that can fluctuate the most during the lifetime of your mortgage. That’s why it’s important to pay attention to the assessed value of your home and the tax rates in the area you chose. If the seller you’re buying from did a great job with home renovations but they’re not reflected in the assessed value, be prepared for the potential of your property taxes jumping up in the next year or so.

2. Insurance costs. Many people have a general idea of homeowners insurance based on the value of the home they buy, but some special considerations can greatly affect the costs. For example, acreages that are long distances from a fire station can cause the cost to go up exponentially. Another would be having an in-ground swimming pool. If you have any special circumstances, be sure to check what your insurance agent’s rate is.

“MANY BUYERS FORGET TO CONSIDER EXTRA COSTS FOR A NEW HOME, LIKE WINDOW TREATMENTS AND INSTALLING LANDSCAPING.”

3. Utility bills. Here in Iowa when we go from five below to 105 degrees over the course of the year, we really use our heating and cooling systems. It’s important to get a sense of the cost of running and maintaining them, and it’s very easy for us to get a 12- to 24-month average from a provider. Having that knowledge up front really helps you prepare.

4. Maintenance costs. We all know there will be maintenance involved—it’s part of the fun of owning a new place. There are, however, some things people don’t think about as much. Older homes, for example, will have a great, mature landscape with lots of trees and plants, but it can be costly to maintain with watering and other maintenance costs. With newer homes, people often overlook things like the cost of window treatments, landscaping installation, and all the things you need to buy because no one has lived there before.

All these items are very easy to overcome; it’s all about having the knowledge up front instead of getting surprised down the road.

If you have any other questions about the costs of homeownership or you’re thinking about buying or selling a central Iowa home, just give me a call. I’d be happy to help you!

There is no “right” time to sell your home; however, there are certain factors you can look at to determine what’s best in your specific situation.

When is the best time to sell your home?

Unfortunately, there’s no straightforward answer to that question. Truthfully (and against a lot of conventional wisdom that suggests a seasonal market), we see homes sell every month of the year in central Iowa.

In cold weather months, there might not be as many active buyers looking at homes, but the buyers that are out there are far more serious. This is because they’re usually driven by life events like a job relocation or the birth of a new baby. Hence, as a home seller during these months, you may not get a higher volume of buyers, but you will get a higher quality of buyers.

“WE SEE HOMES SELL EVERY MONTH OF THE YEAR IN CENTRAL IOWA.”

Another factor to consider in deciding when to sell your home is your level of competition. If you’re deciding between spring, summer, fall, and winter, what will you be up against during those different seasons?

If your house is in a newer neighborhood (e.g., the majority of the homes in the neighborhood were built in the last five to 10 years), one thing you need to be specifically mindful of is how much construction is happening in that area. There are some real advantages for a seller in a newer neighborhood when the builders have slowed down because of weather.

When it comes to helping you make the best decision regarding your home sale, we don’t deal in speculation—we strategize based on many different concrete factors. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us. We’re here to help!

Our certified pre-owned home program allows our sellers to have their home pre-inspected before it hits the market and puts them in a position of power when it comes to negotiations.

One thing that really sets our team apart is that we offer our sellers different listing options when they go to sell their home. One of the most popular options that have been well-received by buyers is the certified pre-owned home program.

What exactly does that involve? With a certified pre-owned home program, you have your home pre-inspected before you hit the market. We sit down together, go through the inspection, and look at the targeted items that need to be addressed to make your home the most marketable and most appealing to get top dollar. Along with that inspection, we offer a home warranty through HWA for the first 13 months after the buyer has purchased.

This program has provided amazing peace of mind for our sellers. We find over and over again that one of the most stressful parts of the home selling process isn’t having your home on the market or obtaining that accepted offer; on the contrary, it’s actually all the stuff that happens afterward. This is because after you hit that inspection period, there’s really a second negotiation that occurs.

“OUR PROGRAM PROVIDES PEACE OF MIND AND NEGOTIATING POWER TO OUR SELLERS.”

We put you as a seller in a position of power instead of weakness when it comes to these negotiations. We have you armed with information in order to eliminate all of these different questions.

As a buyer, it’s advantageous to know that you’re working with a seller who is diligent enough to take on this expense and all these different projects before they even put the home on the market. The seller, in effect, is presenting you with a move-in ready home.

We’re the only real estate company that offers this program, and we’re thrilled that it’s been so successful for our clients. If you want to check out some of our certified pre-owned homes, be sure to visit our website.

As always, if you have any other questions, please feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!

Here in Central Iowa, we see different options that are customary for the closing on your home. Your agent will have a relationship with an escrow company or an attorney’s office that will help with the legal and financial details of the settlement of the home.

What these other people do is assist in calculating the tax proration, assist in verifying that all of the fees have been done correctly on both sides of the transaction, and check if there are any clouds in the title that occur when we get the abstract updated and get the title opinion. They also help coordinate legally what needs to be done in order to clear that up.

“THERE ARE MANY HANDS INVOLVED IN DETERMINING YOUR CLOSING FEE.”

These other people assist in calculating the tax proration and verifying that all of the fees are done correctly on both sides of the transaction. They will also check if there are any clouds in the title that occur when we get the abstract updated and get the title opinion.” They also generally just make sure that everything was completed legally and in a way that’s going to protect you as a seller.

Whether it’s an attorney or an escrow company that does this, there are similar fees in our market that usually cost anywhere from $250 to $500, depending on who does the service. It’s something to note as an additional cost to anticipate.

If you have any other questions about how this closing fee works, feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you!

There are several different fees that you will encounter during the home selling process. I have gone over a few on my blog already. Today I am discussing Realtor service fees and what they cover.

People often call our office wanting to know how much we charge. That is totally understandable; after all, if you want to calculate how much it will cost to sell your home, you should compare the prices of different Realtors.

However, it’s important that you understand exactly what each Realtor is offering for that cost. There are many different providers in our market that have different charges and fees. Here at the Misty Soldwisch team, I can tell you that we do not have the lowest cost in the metro area, but there is a good reason for that.

We feel that it is important to make sure that we understand what your goals are in selling. We want to know what you want your bottom line to be. As part of our service fees, we will give you advice and strategies to maximize your sales price.

“FLAT RATE BROKERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO NET YOU AS MUCH MONEY AS WE CAN.”

We have worked again and again with sellers whose homes failed to sell because they worked with a discount or flat rate broker. Through our advice, we reposition the home at a higher price and help these sellers sell the home because of all of the different things we offer as part of our service fees and marketing. Ultimately, the seller walks away with more money than they anticipated.

Part of these service fees go to our marketing and our expertise, and another part goes to compensate the buyer’s broker. As part of the Des Moines Association of Realtors, we participate in the MLS, which shows other agents that we are willing to cooperate with them. They bring buyers to your home and we compensate them through the fees you pay us.

As I said, Realtor service fees are only part of the cost of selling your home. If you have any other questions about the cost of selling your home or about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

If you’re thinking about selling your home sometime in the near future, you’ll need to update your abstract. Here is what that means.

One thing that makes Iowa really unique when selling real estate is the fact that we are one of the few states in the country that utilizes abstracting.

What is an abstract? If you closed on a home in the past, you may recall that someone handed you a thick, legal-sized binder filled with all sorts of old papers and information, labeled “abstract.” Attorneys will tell you to guard these documents with your life because they’re so expensive to replace.

“IT WILL COST BETWEEN $300 AND $500 TO UPDATE THE ABSTRACT.”

When you go to sell your home, you’ll need to update that abstract. We’ll send that abstract to a local abstractor in the county in which your property is held, they will update it, then ship it to whoever the buyer is using as a title opinion attorney. That attorney will then look over the abstract and all of the information that’s contained in it, including the history of the property, which will go back all the way to when the land was deeded over from the U.S. government. They will look for any clouds on the title that need to be cleared.

The cost of updating your abstract will be somewhere around $300 to $600, depending on the county that you live in, how long it’s been since you last had the abstract updated, as well as other variables depending on your specific real estate situation.

In other states, title insurance will usually take the place of an abstract. This is a very different process, but it works for us here in Iowa!

If you have any other questions about abstracting or anything else related to real estate, feel free to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help you!
