Many people have asked me about how dangerous earthquakes in Montana are. Here&rsquo;s what you should know.

&nbsp;

Are earthquakes in Montana something to be worried about?

Having been born and raised here in Montana, I’ve felt a few earthquakes every now and then, but nothing severe. At most, you might experience one that rattles something off a shelf in a grocery store.

In fact, I was sitting at home the other day when I felt a loud thud. I thought it was snow falling off a tree and onto our deck, but there was no snow.

Sure enough, it had been an earthquake.

“Deadly earthquakes aren’t impossible in Montana, but are very unlikely.”

A belt of seismicity (seismic or earthquake activity) actually runs through the western portion of Montana, called the Intermountain Seismic Belt. It extends into Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, and southern Nevada.

There is a portion of the Belt called the Centennial Tectonic Belt that has eight active faults which have produced a few major earthquakes in history, although it’s been 40 years since an earthquake produced by this region has been destructive.

So in general, no, you don’t have much to fear from earthquakes in Montana.

For any other questions about real estate, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to talk with you.

Today I’d like to share a recap of all the different waterfront real estate markets in 2017. We’ll start with Flathead Lake and go down the line all the way to McGregor.

First, we’ll take a look at Flathead Lake. There are a ton of condos selling in this market, which is bringing down the average sale price. In places like Echo and Swan Lake, we’re seeing quite a few sales over that $1 million mark. To get all the latest details on your specific waterfront market, click the corresponding video below.

        <description>

In Flathead Lake, we saw 46 sales in 2017. That’s down from the 52 we saw the year before, but it’s up from the 44 we saw in 2015. The median price in Flathead Lake is up to $689,000 right now and there are seven pending sales on the lake as well. Each of these pending sales is below the $900,000 mark.

There are 85 active listings right now in Flathead Lake. Of those 85, 31 are listed under $1 million and 54 are listed over $1 million. Properties here are currently spending an average of 449 days on the market.

As far as vacant land sales go, everything’s pretty flat in Flathead Lake (no pun intended). The median price for those plots is sitting at $480,000.

We actually see a big chunk of Flathead Lake sales in the condo market. They fill in those gaps in the lower price ranges. The average sale price of condos in Flathead Lake is $380,000. Sales are down quite a bit from last year, but there are still 38 active listings right now with a $462,000 median list price. The sold condos on Flathead Lake averaged about 243 days on the market.

        <description>

Let’s look at Swan Lake, Echo Lake, and Lake Blaine. In Swan Lake, there were eight home sales this year, up from the five we saw the year before. We also saw two vacant land sales in 2017.There is one pending sale there right now, too.

Echo Lake saw two sales this year, down from the three they had the year before. An interesting thing to note is that one of those two sales was for $1.8 million.

We’ve seen just one sale on Lake Blaine this year. There just isn’t that much out there. We won’t ever have very high numbers there. There are seven vacant land plots and 11 active listings here. There is one pending sale for $1.5 million.

What’s happening in the waterfront market? Here are the latest numbers.

Today I’d like to share a recap of all the different waterfront real estate markets in 2017. We’ll start with Flathead Lake and go down the line all the way to McGregor.

In Flathead Lake, we saw 46 sales in 2017. That’s down from the 52 we saw the year before, but it’s up from the 44 we saw in 2015. The median price in Flathead Lake is up to $689,000 right now and there are seven pending sales on the lake as well. Each of these pending sales is below the $900,000 mark.

There are 85 active listings right now in Flathead Lake. Of those 85, 31 are listed under $1 million and 54 are listed over $1 million. Properties here are currently spending an average of 449 days on the market. 

As far as vacant land sales go, everything’s pretty flat in Flathead Lake (no pun intended). The median price for those plots is sitting at $480,000.

We actually see a big chunk of Flathead Lake sales in the condo market. They fill in those gaps in the lower price ranges. The average sale price of condos in Flathead Lake is $380,000. Sales are down quite a bit from last year, but there are still 38 active listings right now with a $462,000 median list price. The sold condos on Flathead Lake averaged about 243 days on the market.

Now let’s look at Swan Lake, Echo Lake, and Lake Blaine. In Swan Lake, there were eight home sales this year, up from the five we saw the year before. We also saw two vacant land sales in 2017. There is one pending sale there right now, too.

 Echo Lake saw two sales this year, down from the three they had the year before. An interesting thing to note is that one of those two sales was for $1.8 million.

“We only saw one sale on Lake Blaine this year.”

We’ve seen just one sale on Lake Blaine this year. There just isn’t that much out there. We won’t ever have very high numbers there. There are seven vacant land plots and 11 active listings here. There is one pending sale for $1.5 million. 

Last but not least, let’s look at Ashley, Bitterroot, and McGregor. 

Ashley saw a big jump in vacant land sales, Bitterroot saw a big jump in residential home sales, and McGregor stayed pretty flat with four total residential sales. There are 15 vacant land lots in these three areas total, with nine of them being in McGregor.

        <title>Should a Seller Do a Home Inspection?</title>

        <description>

Should a seller do a home inspection when they list? This question crops up quite a bit from sellers.

Overall, I’d say the answer was yes, unless it’s brand new or there’s some other reason why defects wouldn’t crop up. There are three reasons why we encourage people to do inspections:


  To save money. It seems counterintuitive to spend money on an inspection in order to save money. However, sometimes the inspection comes through and all of the sudden you’re pushing up against closing dates or some other plans, and things still need to be done. Those fixes are done in a hurry, or a seller ends up crediting money to a buyer to get them done. If you do it ahead of time, it shows that you’re proactive about taking care of a home that you’re aware of the condition of the home.
  It helps you close faster because a lot of the time, an appraisal won’t even get ordered for financing until after the home inspection is completed. If you can make the inspection period short, it will help shorten the time span between you and the close, as well as take away the contingency sooner.
  It can save a sale. Sometimes people see certain issues on an inspection and run for the hills. Having the inspection done in time to get those problems fixed can sometimes be the difference between a sale and a huge disappointment.


“Even if you don’t do the inspection, it can help to give your seller’s disclosure statement.”

Even if you don’t do the inspection, it can help to give your seller’s disclosure statement. That way, whatever issues you’ve discovered over time are made known during the sales negotiation, not afterward, which would open up the opportunity for renegotiation.

Thank you for the great question—I hope this answer was helpful. If you have any additional questions about this or other topics, always feel free to contact us by phone or email. We’d love to help you out.

        <description>

Just how accurate is Zillow’s Zestimate feature? Today, I’ve got some information you need to know before relying on this website.

Many people are curious about the true credibility of Zillow’s Zestimate feature.

First, the Zestimate relies only on data because it is computer-generated. Nothing else can be taken into account. This becomes even more of an issue because Montana is a non-disclosure state, meaning that real estate transactions are not public information and cannot be pulled up through databases.

The Zestimate also has the disadvantage of there being no personal viewing of the property. The Zestimate is based strictly off of numbers.

It also isn’t bankable. You can’t walk into a bank or lender with a Zestimate and expect it to count as an appraisal. In order to move forward, you will need a real appraisal.

A major reason for this is that Zestimates can be very inaccurate. The CEO of Zillow himself sold his home for $750,000 below his Zestimate, which was almost 50% of the sales price.

You can see for yourself how reliable Zillow is based on some of the information included here.

“The best way to value your property is to work with an agent who is experienced in your area and with your type of property.”

Ultimately, the best way to value your property is to work with an agent who is experienced in your area and with your type of property. The right Realtor will also have a strong pulse on the market.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

The off-season isn’t a bad time to sell your home. In fact, a good percentage of the sales in our market take place during this time.

Every year around this time, people who have their homes on the market ask me, “Should I take it off the market during the off-season or should I leave it on the market and continue trying to sell it?” We did a little research to help make the decision a little easier for you if you’re going through a similar situation.

If you were to leave your home on the market during the fall season, there are a few reasons why you stand to benefit greatly. One is the fact that the buyers out there during this time of year are serious. They aren’t in town to golf, swim, or fish. They are here to look at real estate and most of them are intent on buying.

“There are still plenty of buyers on the market.”

Another advantage for sellers around this time of year is that they have much less competition. About 30% of properties are taken off the market during this time of year. With plenty of buyers still on the market, this is more good news for sellers.

How do the numbers differ in the off-season (October 1 to April 31) compare to the numbers during the market’s peak (May 1 to September 30)? We looked back over the last five years, and the answer is not much. In the last five years, 53% of residential home sales and 59% of vacant home sales have come during those peak months. Meanwhile, the off-season has seen 48% of residential sales and 41% of vacant home sales in the last five years.

There’s still an awful lot of opportunity in this market during the off-season, as you can see. If you have any questions or would like to take advantage of current conditions yourself, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you soon.

        <description>

We’ve had eight years of slow movement in our market, but at some time that will go up. History has proven this trend.

This late in October marks an important anniversary in the history of our market. 30 years ago, on October 19th, Black Monday happened.

Why do I mention this? At that time, I had a lot of customers telling me they couldn’t take money out of the stock market to buy a lake home because they were doing so well in the stock market. After Black Monday, the real estate market in this area took off and stayed extremely strong for quite a few years after that.

Today, I’m having the same conversation with customers looking at lake properties. They’re saying that they haven’t appreciated in the last eight years, and they’re wondering why they should take money out of the stock market that’s doing so well.

“We’ve had eight years of slow movement in our market, but at some time that will go up. History has proven this trend.”

Well, I’m telling you history will repeat itself. This market will change and the stock market will correct itself. I’ve had customers already tell me they’re going to move some money into tangible assets like real estate. We’ve had eight years of slow movement, so at some point in time that will go up, and it’s always nice to buy at the bottom of the market.

If you have any more questions about our market or you’re thinking about buying or selling lake property in our area, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you.

        <title>3rd Quarter 2017 Waterfront Report</title>
        <link>http://blog.flatheadrealestate.com/3rd-quarter-2017-waterfront-report.html</link>

        <description>

What is happening in the Waterfront real estate market? I’ve got the latest numbers from the third quarter to share with you today.

How is the Waterfront real estate market doing? I have the latest numbers from the third quarter to share with you today.

First, let’s look at Flathead Lake.

There are 118 homes active on the market. 61 of them are over $1 million. There are six pending sales, three of which are over $1 million. There have been 36 sales so far this year, which is just one short of the 37 sales this time last year. Five of those sales have been over $1 million this year, while eight sales were over $1 million last year.

In other words, that $1 million and up market segment is struggling a bit this year. I’ll explore why that is in-depth in an upcoming video.

Meanwhile, Flathead Lake’s median sales price is $640,000 this year, which is down a little from $700,000 last year. That’s not a huge drop, so we are in a pretty steady market there.

As for vacant land in Flathead, there are 48 lots for sale, three pending, and 14 closed so far this year. Land sales are very strong right now. In fact, the number of closed sales went up 230% from six land sales last year. This may be because there are fewer homes for sale under $1 million in this area, and buying land at an affordable price is a great way to start owning in Flathead Lake.

Waterfront pricing in Flathead ranges from $1,500 a foot to $6,500 a foot, where the property had 60 feet of waterfront. The average is probably closer to $3,500 or $4,000 per foot.

Next up is Swan Lake.

Swan Lake has 11 homes for sale and two pending sales. Nine of the listings are over $1 million and two of them are priced under $1 million. Of the six closed sales this year, three were under $475,000 and three were over $880,000. Basically, there was a $400,000 gap where nothing was happening. There were only five sales last year, so closed sales stayed about the same.

As for vacant land, there are five properties for sale, and all but one are over $375,000. There is one pending sale and only one sale so far this year. There were only two sales last year, and not a lot of vacant lot sales over the last couple years. The three sales we’ve had were all under $300,000, so people are out shopping for affordable lake lots. Other price points are just struggling.

Now let’s see what’s happening in Echo/Blaine.

There are 15 active listings now and no pending sales on either lake. There were two sales this year and three sales last year, so the market has been pretty steady.

There are eight vacant lots for sale and one pending. The pending sale is over $1 million, so that just proves that you never know when lightning is going to strike. So far this year, there haven’t been any closings on Blaine or Echo.

Next, let’s check on the lakes west of Kalispell: Ashley, Bitterroot, and McGregor.

There are 16 properties for sale and seven pending sales. So far this year, 10 sales have closed. That is a 50% jump from the five sales these three lakes saw last year, which is interesting because inventory is down.

There are 20 vacant lots and one pending sale. The five vacant land sales that have closed were all on Ashley Lake. In 2016, there were only four closing sales, two on Ashley and two on Bitterroot. McGregor hasn’t seen any land sales in the last couple years and over half of the available lots are on McGregor, which may mean it’s the place to look right now.

Finally, let’s see what’s happening with Flathead condos.

There are 42 condos on the market right now, and two pending sales. So far this year, there have been 20 closed sales. Last year, there were 38. The median sales price last year was $305,000; this year, it’s $370,000. The interesting thing in this market is that we saw a 20% increase in the median sales price and a 20% decrease in sales at the same time.

        <description>

Making the decision to buy a home can seem daunting. However, sleeping on it could lead to you losing out on the property altogether. Is waiting to think about it worth it?

Imagine that you’ve found the perfect property. The neighborhood is great, the home is the right size, and it has everything you want. Still, you decide to sleep on it.

So, what happens when you wait to make that decision? Is it really a good idea to sleep on it?

Well, someone else who saw the home yesterday may have had the same thought as you, and that person is making a decision today.

While it can feel comforting having some time to mull over your decision, this can actually jeopardize your opportunity.

The person who slept on it yesterday and is making their decision today may have made the same mistake in the past, and lost out on a property as a result.

If a home fits and is priced right, why wait? If you’ve found the right property today, think about the fact that it might not be there tomorrow.

“If a home fits and is priced right, why wait?”

I highly encourage you to think about the possibility of making your move sooner rather than later. Doing so could be the difference between getting the perfect property and losing out.

When the urge is there to sleep on it, consider making a decision instead.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Wildfire season is upon us and there is no rain in the forecast.

It’s especially crucial right now to be aware of some key safety points. First of all, take care of the forest.

The denseness of a forest can greatly change how it will respond to wildfire. A thinner stand of trees will be at a much lower risk, while an unthinned stand will be at the greatest risk.

A good spacing between trees is a minimum of 15 feet between smaller trees and a minimum of 30 feet between larger ones.

“The denseness of a forest can greatly change how it will respond to wildfire.”

A home was saved last week in Missoula simply because someone took proper care of the surrounding land.

When trees are too tightly packed, they should absolutely be thinned out.

A fire spreading through a thickly populated area forest will spread much more quickly than one moving through a thinner stand.

For more information on how to keep land managed properly, how to minimize the risk of wildfires, and how to keep your trees healthy, click here.

        <description>

This summer, a lot of people have been interested in investing in short-term rental properties, also known as vacation rental properties.

First, you have to remember that our market is seasonal. It would be difficult for you stay during the summer and then rent your property out in the winter—our typical off-season. It just won’t generate the kind of income you’re looking for.

Given that our market is seasonal, people are coming and going at different times. Because of this, you’re likely to end up with your property staying empty for a period of time during the month. This inconsistency won’t do great things for your bottom line.

You also need to take into consideration the rules and regulations of the county and homeowners associations that your property is governed by. In our area, Flathead and Lake Counties are putting or have already put regulations into place for short-term rentals, so you need to be aware of those to avoid any legal troubles later on.

Then, there is the question of management. Management of your property can be done long distance or you can hire a local property manager with experience in short-term rentals that can take care of the property for you. Be aware of the costs associated with that as well.

If you do use the property yourself for a portion of the year, then there are some tax limitations that you need to be aware of. There is a certain period of time that you can stay at the property and still consider it an investment rental property.

Finally, you need to have an exit strategy. If it doesn’t work out for you, is this property something that you will be able to sell easily, or is it going to be an ongoing economic burden until you can get it sold?

“You need to have an exit strategy in case it doesn’t work out for you.”

These are all things to consider when you’re deciding to purchase an investment property for short-term rentals. If you have any additional questions about this topic or you’re looking to buy or sell a home in our area, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I’d be happy to help.

        <description>

How are things looking in our waterfront market as we reach the mid-year point?

Things got off to a slow start with a snowy, rainy spring, but our market is starting to pick up, so it’s likely that our third quarter report will be substantially different.

“Things got off to a slow start, but our market is starting to pick up.”

In the meantime, there have been 48 total vacant land and residential sales on the waterfront, which is down three from the 51 we saw at this time last year. We also currently have 17 pending sales, so there’s a good number out there waiting to close.

At the end of last year, the big story was the number of waterfront condominiums that had sold on Flathead Lake. This year, Flathead Lake has seen eight condominiums sell, which is down from the 12 we saw at this point last year. There are five pending sales in this category, however, so we’re getting pretty close to catching up. Right now, there are 47 condominiums actively for sale.

Staying in Flathead Lake, 21 homes have sold this year, which is down slightly from the 27 that sold last year. The median home price, however, rose from $560,000 to $628,000. Two of those 21 homes sold for more than $1 million. Last year, three homes had sold at this point for more than $1 million, so both years started out rather slowly in that price range. There are five pending sales, and all are priced under $775,000.

If we look at the current inventory of 115 homes for sale on Flathead Lake, 58 of those are priced for more than $1 million. If you’re a buyer or seller in this price range, you can expect to see some shifting happening soon.

On the vacant land side, there have been five sales, which is up slightly from the four that sold last year. There are no current pending sales in this category, and there are 48 active vacant land lots for sale. This will be an interesting area to watch as the season develops.

Moving over to Swan Lake, there have been two residential sales so far this year, which is identical to the two that sold at this point last year. There is currently one pending sale and 13 active homes for sale. The median price for these residential homes is $999,000.

On the vacant land side, there have been no sales so far this year. Last year, there were two. However, there is one sale pending and 11 active vacants on the market, of which the median price is $395,000.

On Echo Lake and Lake Blaine, there have been no vacant land or residential sales, and last year there weren’t any sales in either of these two categories. There are two pending residential sales—one on Echo Lake and one on Lake Blaine. There are 15 residential homes active on the market and 11 vacant lots for sale. The median price is $1 million for residential homes and $500,000 for vacant lands. There are also a couple cabin properties for sale on Deer Island inside Echo Lake.

Heading over to the “West Lakes”—Ashley Lake, Bitterroot Lake, and McGregor Lake—there have been seven residential sales so far this year: two on Mcgregor, three on Bitterroot, and two on Ashley. Last year, there were two total residential sales encompassing this area, so this year has seen quite an uptick. There are two pending sales in the West Lakes—one on Ashley and one on Bitterroot. There are also 23 active homes for sale with a median price of $710,000.

On the vacant land side, there have been three sales on Ashley Lake so far this year. Last year, there was one on Ashley and one on Bitterroot. There is currently one pending sale on Ashley and 31 active vacants for sale at a median price of $710,000.

If you have any questions about these statistics or some of the market trends we’re seeing, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you, and I hope you have a good rest of the summer.

        <description>

I’ve fielded a lot of questions lately from people selling their home wondering what kind of things they should do to their home prior to listing it on the market. Should you remodel the bathroom? Rebuild the deck? Update the kitchen? Replace all the carpet?

Over the years, my response has always been to do small things that add nice touches. Report after report has shown that larger upgrades and remodels never seem to get a dollar-for-dollar return. For example, if you spent $10,000 remodeling your kitchen the research shows you’re likely to only get $7,500 back in added value to your home.

Some of the best things to consider are those that make the home more saleable rather than trying to create value. This includes things like a fresh coat of paint on your front door or updating a light fixture here and there, which can be done relatively inexpensively. Leave the rest for the new homeowners because their preference for the carpet or the countertops will almost certainly be different than yours.

“Some of the best things to consider are those that make the home more saleable rather than trying to create value.”

You can see a more complete list of the research results about smart home upgrades here.

If you have any questions about updating your home for the market or you’re thinking about making a move, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help!

IRS FIRPTA information

Montana FIRPTA facilitator

Blog about FIRPTA issues

Are you a foreign investor getting ready to sell an investment property? If so, there are a few things you should know about how the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act affects you.

The Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act (FIRPTA) spells out what needs to be done at closing as far as withholding goes. With the exchange rate as it is, it’s quite favorable for foreign investors (Canadians especially) to sell and realize a profit.

“FIRPTA spells out what needs to be done at closing as far as withholding goes.”

Remember, there is a 10% to 15% withholding right at closing, depending on the type of investment. For example, residential properties that haven’t been used will differ from vacant land or residential properties that haven’t been used personally.

These stipulations can be somewhat confusing, but the IRS has authorized administrators to help foreign investors in this situation with things like the paperwork, holding the money, and filing the returns so the process is not as daunting.

It’s also important to note that during the closing phase of the selling process if what you owe on the property and what it sells for is less than 10% or 15%, you may have to bring money to closing to satisfy that withholding requirement by the IRS.

If you would like to get in contact with an expert on this subject or you would like more information, click here. You can also simply Google “FIRPTA” and it will answer a lot of your questions.

If you have any more questions about this topic, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you.

        <description>

How did we fare in the first quarter of 2017?

We had a long winter with lots of snow followed by a lot of rain. We are almost at 100% above average for precipitation this year, which affected first quarter activity.

“We are almost at 100% above average for precipitation this year, which affected first quarter activity.”

First, on all the lakes combined, there were 10 residential sales this year compared to eight residential sales last year. However, there were only two vacant lot sales this year compared to four last year.

Flathead Lake has 89 residential active listings and 42 vacant active listings. This year in the first quarter there were seven residential sales, zero vacant sales, and four pending sales compared to seven residential sales, two vacant sales, and one pending sale in the first quarter of 2016.

Swan Lake has 12 residential active listings and 10 vacant active listings. This year in the first quarter there were zero residential sales, zero vacant sales, and zero pending sales compared to one residential sale, one vacant sale, and zero pending sales in the first quarter of 2016.

Echo Lake has six residential active listings and three vacant active listings. Neither 2017 nor 2016 saw any residential or vacant sales in the first quarter, but there is one pending sale compared to zero pending sales last year.

Lake Blaine has seven residential active listings and zero vacant active listings. Neither 2017 nor 2016 saw any residential or vacant sales in the first quarter, but there is one pending sale compared to zero pending sales last year.

Out west, the three lakes out there have had some activity, mainly on Ashley Lake.

Ashley Lake has seven residential active listings and four vacant active listings. This year in the first quarter there was one residential sale, two vacant sales, and one pending sale compared to zero residential sales, one vacant sale, and zero pending sales in the first quarter of 2016.

McGregor Lake has three residential active listings and six vacant active listings. Neither 2017 nor 2016 saw any residential or vacant sales in the first quarter, but there is one pending sale compared to zero pending sales last year.

Bitterroot Lakehas seven residential active listings and four vacant active listings. This year in the first quarter there were two residential sales, zero vacant sales, and one pending sale compared to zero residential sales, zero vacant sales, and zero pending sales in the first quarter of 2016.

I’ve talked before about the surge in residential waterfront in Flathead Lake on the condominium sales side. There are 47 active listings right now, four of which have sold compared to eight last year. There is also one pending sale.

If you have any questions or topics you’d like to see covered or you are looking to buy or sell a home, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

Many of our clients ask, “What is the market like?” Today, I’d like to share some information that recently came in for the entire state of Montana. We’ll compare the the market from 2015 and 2016 and explore why the numbers are what they are.

Let’s start with Billings. From 2015 to 2016, the number of sales dropped by 7%. That’s probably because of the oil patch slowing down. The good news is that the sales price hasn’t changed. So, although the market has some strength, there are fewer transactions.

Livingston saw no changes in the number of transactions or in sales price, so that market has held steady for the last two years.

Now, Bozeman is the hotbed as far as market activity goes. They have a good number of transactions and the average sales price is $400,000, which is the highest in the state!

Great Falls saw no increase in the number of transactions or the average sales price. Helena didn’t have any changes in the number of transactions, but they did see a 9% increase in the average sales price. Why? All of the bank repossessions are gone and entry-level housing has been bought up. New construction has not replaced that inventory yet, so there is more demand in Helena than there is supply.

Missoula held steady from 2015 to 2016, with the same number of home sales and the same average sales price. On the other hand, Flathead Valley’s sales went down 10% in 2016. However, the average sales price did go up 4%.

Sometimes, when we get out of area customers that are in strong markets, like Chicago, Denver, and Seattle, they are coming from a much more competitive market. Those markets have larger population bases that can fuel supply and demand. It can be difficult for those customers to come to Montana and transition out of a market where people are fighting for homes with multiple offers over asking price.

“Montana has a lower population base to drive the market.”

Montana has a lower population base and a limited economic base that does not fuel the market in the same way, so we really depend on those outside resources to come in. Lately, those outside resources have been lagging a bit. We’ll see what will happen in 2017.

If you have any other questions about our current market or if you would like to learn more about other real estate topics, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

Today I’d like to talk about a common winter problem homeowners in our area have to face from time to time: ice dams.

An ice dam occurs when you’ve got a lot of snow on your roof and your attic is just warm enough to melt some snow, causing it to run down the roof until it gets to the colder parts and freezes. That water backs up the shingles and will eventually start coming in underneath through the roof.

The vent on our roof is snowed over, so the heat isn’t escaping out the top. One of the ways to prevent that is installing heat tape in the summer so it’s ready for the winter. Shoveling the roof off is also an option, but it is dangerous. A roofing company would be able to do it for you without damaging the roof. Also, if you google “roof rake” or “roof snow rake,” there are a lot of products out there that will help get the snow off your roof.

“Roofing companies aren’t as busy this time a year, so they could safely shovel your roof off for you.”

It’s not too late to get that taken care of, and you’ll want to make sure another snow storm doesn’t add to the problem.

If you have any further questions about this topic or if you have any other real estate questions, feel free to shoot me a text, give me a call, or send me an email. I’m always happy to help.
