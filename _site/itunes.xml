Mindy and I often get asked about the state of today’s market. In fact, this is probably the No. 1 question we get from buyers and sellers alike.

Thankfully, our market here in Dallas is very healthy. We’ve had a strong seller’s market for years, but from looking at recent news we may be seeing the market begin to cool off.

Recently we had lunch with a big, local lender who told us that applications for mortgage purchase loans are down by 10%.

This information points to a potential balancing off coming into the market.
“Our market here in Dallas is very healthy.”
But this doesn’t mean that you should panic if you’re a seller. If you have a good Realtor who will be able to do the right kind of marketing, you can still command top dollar for your listing.

And if you’re a buyer, this shift in the market could mean you’ll have more leverage so long as you know where to look.

Homes under $300,000 still have a lot of high demand and are likely to continue seeing multiple-offer situations. However, these conditions still aren’t quite as harsh as what we’ve seen in the last couple of years.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call at (214) 444-9014 or send us an email at Jay@TeamRobbins.com.  We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Zillow is one of the most common websites used today by people trying to figure out the value of their home.

However, while Zillow might be a good way to get a ballpark figure, you might think twice about trusting its accuracy. In fact, The New York Times and multiple Seattle newspapers have reported that the CEO of Zillow sold his home for 40% less than the Zestimate.

In other words, the Zestimate can be and often is, inaccurate. Right here in Dallas, it tends to be off by an average of 5%.

This might sound like a fairly close evaluation but for those seriously considering buying or selling a home 5% could total about $15,000 in today’s local market
 “The best way to make sure that your estimate is accurate is to hire a real estate professional.”
The best way to make sure that your estimate is accurate and that you are making the most out of a real estate transaction is to hire a real estate professional.

Working alongside someone able to determine a realistic price is going to make a big difference in your pocket.

So how does Zillow determine values, anyway? Well, they use a computer. As you and I both know, a computer is not what determines the value of a home.

A home’s value is determined by what a buyer is willing to pay as well as what the seller is willing to list it for. These two figures can be vastly different from what a computer might estimate.

If you’re looking to buy or sell a home, want professional advice, or have any other questions, feel free to give us a call at (214) 444-9014 or send us an email at Jay@TeamRobbins.com. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
