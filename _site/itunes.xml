        <description>

In the past, the way I would conduct myself when first meeting with buyer clients was much less structured than the way I conducted listing appointments.

My listing process involved a set number of steps I would carry through, so I began to wonder why my team and I weren’t applying this same sense of structure to buyer appointments.

So, I checked around with some of the highest producing and most innovative brokers in the country, and, sure enough, their buyer appointments were just as structured as their listing appointments.

Now, from the moment we’re setting up an appointment with a buyer, we explain what they can expect from the process. We let them know that we will first come together at the home, then go over the consumer notice and walk through the property, and then finish by discussing the real estate process.

“Thanks to this sense of structure, we’re able to build rapport, ask questions about the buyer’s goals and motivations, and solidify a professional relationship.”

Once the buyer confirms that they would like to proceed, we can move forward knowing everyone is on the same page. We also review what will happen during the process at the start of every appointment.

Thanks to this sense of structure, we’re able to build rapport, ask questions about the buyer’s goals and motivations, and solidify a professional relationship. Also during the appointment, we provide a packet containing mortgage information, the consumer notice, the buyer agency agreement, and what I call a buyer presentation. This last item outlines and unpacks the entire home buying process and goes into the role of a buyer’s agent.

The buyer presentation is about 15 pages long. It’s designed to help buyers understand exactly how we can advocate for them through the transaction.

Finally, we ask the buyer if they understand everything we’ve gone over. If they do, we can move on to signing the buyer agency agreement and get the rest of the process underway.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <title>Is It Worth It To Generate Business From Online Leads?</title>

        <description>

Today, I’ll be addressing the question of whether or not leads from Zillow and Realtor.com are worth the money we spend to try to generate business.

It’s important to remember that tracking is critical. We have a lot of data accumulated over the last few years about all sorts of internet business and what the return on investment is like.

What we’ve learned is that Realtor.com and Zillow business is market-specific. The price per inquiry here at South Central Pennsylvania is going to be vastly different than the price per inquiry in another market.

Also, due to the way Zillow is set up, the price per inquiry in one ZIP code may be dramatically higher than another simply due to temporary demand depending on how many brokers are investing in that ZIP code. They can push the price per inquiry way up. Zillow is contract-free, so you are able to keep an eye on the price per inquiry and move your investment elsewhere if necessary.

“According to the study, it’s critically important that we respond within five minutes of the initial inquiry.”

So, is it ultimately worth it?

It depends. We’ve gone through seasons where we’ve lost money and haven’t gotten a good ROI, and we’ve also had more positive seasons as well.

Here was the difference: If you Google “MIT lead response study,” you’ll get a PDF file of a robust study that shows that whether we convert internet business leads depends highly on a few things:

1. How quickly we respond. According to the study, it’s critically important that we respond within five minutes of when the inquiry happens. Every minute that goes by after the initial five exponentially decreases the odds that you’ll convert that business into a relationship.

2. What methods used to respond. People prefer different methods of communication. It’s important to not only call that business within five minutes of the inquiry, but also shoot them a text and an email.

3. How often we follow up.If you don’t make a connection quickly, it’s important to not give up. No salesperson calls only once. Studies show that a minimum of 10 times is required in order to capitalize on the highest probability to convert that business. Those follow-ups should be made within 12 to 15 days.

Hopefully you’ve found this information to be helpful. If you have anything to add, share, or ask about this topic, I’d love to hear from you. Feel free to reach out to me anytime.

        <title>A Great Way to Increase Client Retention and Conversion</title>

        <description>

Today I’m excited to share one simple tool with you that will help you increase your client retention and conversion.

Early on in my career, I learned a lot from a lot of different consultants and agents. I studied what they did and took classes. In one of my classes, we read a book about basic fundamental administration. It was like an executive assistant boot camp.

One thing I learned in that class is that there is an etiquette involved in serving people that will build their confidence and help you earn their trust very quickly. Practicing this method properly results in others seeing you as a professional and having increased confidence in your abilities.

This simple method is called “closing the loop” and it starts like this: When you have an inquiry, whether it’s a phone call, text, email, etc., the very first thing you should do is message that person back and let them know you got their message and will get back to them shortly. That simple exchange builds their confidence in your ability to serve them later on down the road. It might seem silly, but it works.

“This process is simple but effective.”

Next, you need to note that action somewhere in your calendar or wherever you keep your task list. Then, make sure you message them back the next day, whether you have an answer for them or not. If you do have an answer for them, just reach back out and let them know. If you don’t, let them know that as well.

Once you finally have an answer for the person, send them a message with the answer and ask if they need help with anything else in order to completely “close the loop.”

This might sound really simple, but executive assistants across the country have mastered this skill because it shows that they are supremely competent. That’s the same kind of vibe you want to give off to your clients.

If you have any questions for me about closing the loop or about anything else related to your real estate career, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <title>2 Business-Saving Strategies That Are Better Than Multitasking</title>

        <description>

A few years ago, I almost became burnt out in my real estate career. I was working between 70 and 80 hours a week with zero time off, juggling a huge number of different tasks and responsibilities. I began to wonder, “How do higher-capacity people do it? How do they manage to juggle all these tasks?”

At this point, I took it upon myself to fly out and visit various high-capacity CEOs across the country. Studying their habits changed my life. What I found out is this: Multitasking is a lie. There are more efficient ways to handle your work.

Time and time again, studies have shown that there’s no effective way to do two things at once. When people multitask, they become vastly less efficient. In fact, multitasking itself isn’t real. What’s actually going on in our brain is something called switch-tasking, which is the act of quickly shifting focus back and forth between two tasks.

But when you’re switch-tasking, you’re wasting time. It takes a lot of effort for your brain to continuously refocus on different tasks. To demonstrate what I mean, there’s an experiment I’d like you to try. I want you to try saying the alphabet and counting to 26 at the same time. Before you do this, set a timer to see how long it takes you.

You’ll notice that as you do this, the two things can’t occur simultaneously. Instead, you end up saying things like “A, one. B, two. C, three…” and so on and so forth. And even though each task is simple on their own, it’s easy to become confused as you try to handle both at once.

After you’ve done this experiment, try timing yourself doing just one of these tasks. In terms of time spent, the difference between counting to 26 and saying the alphabet at the same time versus doing one after the other might surprise you.

Now, counting and saying the alphabet are both pretty simple. That being said, imagine how much more difficult it would be to perform two complex tasks at once. The point is that tasks are almost always completed more quickly when they are done one at a time.

“Managing your schedule through time blocking allows you to run your business, instead of letting your business run you.”

Real estate is one of the few industries where professionals are expected to be experts in more than a dozen, separate skills.  Agents are asked to be good at negotiating, marketing, photography, showing properties, setting schedules, budgeting, accounting, administrative tasks, and much, much more.

After being told to juggle all of these tasks, it’s no wonder that so many agents attempt to multitask. But as we’ve already seen, multitasking doesn’t work.

So, what can you do to plan your day in a way that avoids the need for multitasking? The key is using time blocking and activity chunking. Time blocking is the act of scheduling blocks of time for specific activities.Scheduling activities a week or a month in advance can help you develop a routine. When you devote certain blocks of time to specific tasks, you ensure that everything you need to do is given adequate effort and attention. Time blocking will also leave you with vacant spaces in your day, which can be used for appointments.

Managing your schedule through time blocking allows you to run your business, instead of letting your business run you.

Of course, certain activities must be done together. This is where activity chunking comes in. Activity chunking is when you put light activities together in time blocks.

Once you block out recurring events, divide your “to-do” lists across the blocks of time you have already designated for those activities. At the end of the week, the end of the month, and the end of the year, you’ll save a ton of time by following these tips.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

How has the Bright MLS changed the way my team works?

First, I’d like to clarify that Bright isn’t paying me to write this blog. I just wanted to share some information about the Bright system that my team and I have learned over the past few months.

I’ll be the first to admit that when the Bright change first took place, there were a lot of kinks in the system. A lot of our properties didn’t show up on consumer sites, and some didn’t show up on my own website. Searching was also difficult; results didn’t come up the way they should have, especially in the first week or two.

Although a lot of organizations stick their heads in the sand when they go through changes, I was impressed by how responsive Bright’s staff was. Whenever we needed assistance or there was a technical issue, they would tell us where it was in the queue and when they expected the issue to be worked out.

They also held private trainings at our office, and we went to Harrisburg for additional trainings. There were five or six trainings as a whole.

Bright even sends daily updates about technical difficulties or where problems were in the queue. Bright was incredibly responsive, and most of the kinks have been worked out at this point.

“With the Bright MLS, I have access to data that I couldn’t get before.”

Now that I’ve had time to learn the system and get feedback from my agents and staff, I’ve been able to see that this system has a real positive impact, and I’m extremely grateful for that. Here are a few important things that Bright has been able to do:

1) I am able to get data in areas that I wasn’t able to before. I remember often feeling stupid because a customer was able to go on Realtor.com and give me property information that I had to struggle to find in the system. Now, I can just jump on Bright and get information on a market that’s 45 minutes away. I can even get more information than the customer can, which allows me to offer them some value.

2) I don’t have to pay for and learn a multiple systems. Since Bright is a large, regional system, I can look in the same system, pay the same dues, and save all that time and energy that I would have spent learning a new system.

3) There are many useful tips and tricks that have made us more efficient and saved us a huge amount of time. For example, the web mapping search allows us to look at flood zones, public record information, and more. I’ve been incredibly impressed with the owner information available for properties that aren’t listed, including the assessed value. There are many tips and tricks this system offers that Paragon didn’t.

I am incredibly grateful to Bright and their staff for the dedication they put into the transition. I think the Bright MLS will improve my life, my team’s lives, and my client’s lives.

I would love to hear any feedback or tips that you’ve discovered that impact your business. Just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

What’s the best way to structure a listing appointment?

A lot of people in the office have been asking about it, and I’ve been meaning to put together a training video together for listing appointments.

Now, I can’t say I have the best way to structure a listing appointment, but over the last 15 years, I’ve been on over 1,000 of them. I’ve also learned things from other agents both inside and outside of the market. As a result, I’ve been able to put together a good, professional listing appointment.

During the intake call, we fill out a seller information sheet. This is a proven process that helps us learn the needs of the seller as well as their interests. The sheet also helps us learn a bit about their property, what improvements they’ve made to the property, and which features they are most proud of.

From there, we set the listing appointment. Sometimes we do a one-step appointment, where we walk away from the initial listing appointment with the listing contract signed. Sometimes we have two separate appointments. It really depends on what the seller’s motivation is and what they are looking for from us.

The second thing we do is prepare for the appointment. We will pull all of the information from the public record that we can. If possible, we’ll pull a deed. We’ll also look at previous listing information and put together a listing preparation packet. We also add a listing presentation manual; we have 100 of those pre-printed at a time.

“I like to make the listing appointment about what the seller can expect from the process.”

Next, show up at the appointment and ask if they have a kitchen table you can set your things down on. From there, walk through the house with them. This gives you the opportunity to take notes, ask questions, learn more about the seller, and make a connection with them. Remember, it’s important to be super complimentary when you are walking through the home. This is also a good time to ask them what they love most about the property.

After the walk-through, we’ll go back to the kitchen table and review their needs one more time. That’s where the seller information sheet comes in handy; simply review the information you got on the intake call. At that point, you will go through the listing presentation.

I like to make the listing presentation about the seller.I tell them what they can expect when they list their home, what showings will look like, and how often we will provide feedback. I also go over exactly what we’ll do to market their property so they know where their home will be advertised.  

From there, we’ll decide if we want to talk about the value of the property. If it makes sense, you can go ahead and list the property. In some cases, the property may be a bit more difficult to price.

If that’s the case, we’ll set a second appointment at our office. We’ll take a couple of days to run the CMA. At the second appointment, we’ll go over their home’s value. If it makes sense to list their home, we’ll go ahead and do that. If they want to wait for a while or decide to go a different direction, that’s fine too.

If you have any questions about how we structure our listing appointments, or if you have any helpful steps to add, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.

What’s the fastest way to generate immediate business if you’re in a bit of a slow season?

The answer to this question is that it depends—it depends on who you talk to, what area of the world you’re in, and what season it is. Today, I have three of my own top answers that have worked for me year after year.

“If I do a really high-traffic open house in a great area, I’m bound to generate some quick business and connections that I can follow up with afterwards.”

1. Utilize your sphere of influence and trusted resources. If I’m a little slow in business and can project a slow season coming up, I immediately get on the phone with past clients and people that I know and trust, check in and connect with them, and before I hang up, I ask one simple question, “I’m in a bit of a slow season, and I’m just wondering if you could think of anybody you know who might be looking to sell their home in the next six to 12 months?” If I do that consistently, I’m sure to come away with some prospects to follow up on.

2. Prospect for expired listings.There are different technologies like Vulcan 7 and RedX that offer expired data for properties that came off the market unsold. If used with consistency, you can generate some quick business. From those calls, you can generate a connection and possibly an appointment.

3. High-traffic open houses. If I do a really high-traffic open house in a great area, I’m bound to generate some quick business and connections that I can follow up with afterwards.

If you have any questions or suggestions about strategies that have worked for you when you’re in a slow season, I’d love to hear them. Just give me a call or send and email and we can go over them.

        <description>

As real estate agents, we get internet inquiries and call-ins all the time. We know that our first initiative is to serve the client the best we can and serve the customer on the other end of the line.

But we also know that these are opportunities to get an appointment with a new potential buyer, and we want to capitalize on those opportunities while serving our listing client, if that’s applicable. If an internet inquiry or a call comes in, we usually call back within five minutes, and here’s a statement we use for that call that works better for us than just about any others:

“Hi (client name), this is (agent name) with (name of real estate company). I see you inquired about (property address) through Zillow. What questions can I answer for you about that property and do you have a time that would work for you to preview that home?”

Asking those two questions does two things. First, it addresses the reason they inquired. Second, it opens the door for them to preview the property with you. When someone calls about a property, they typically have a question in mind, but they may not have been thinking about previewing the property.

Typically, they’ll follow up with the question they called about. Assuming you have factual information, you can answer their question or say you’ll bring the property up and follow up with “As I’m bringing the property up, is there a good time that would work for you to preview this property?”

“The person wants the appointment, so go ahead and give it to them.”

Restating that opens up their mind even more. More often than not, they’ll opt into that appointment. Keep in mind that after they elect to have the appointment, if they’re going to be asking opinion-based questions, you still have to do the oral consumer notice and make sure you’re explaining agency relationships. We’re always going to need to qualify that prospect.

Here’s the thing—we’re often afraid to set the appointment because we’re putting the cart before the horse. Oftentimes, though, the person wants the appointment, so go ahead and give it to them. After that, make sure you qualify them well, because you don’t want to waste your time, the seller’s time, or the prospect’s time.

Go through all the typical questions, such as:


  “Are you already working with another agent?” If they say yes, make sure they get back to their agent so that agent can show them the property.
  “Have you looked out for or obtained financing yet?” If they haven’t obtained financing, you can simply postpone the home preview and put them in touch with a lender.


So, again, start the conversation with why they called and ask if they have time to preview the home. Asking those two questions in your first breath will go a long way in helping you get an appointment with every customer who calls in.

If you have any more questions about securing appointments, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to chat with you.

        <title>How to Throw a Great Client Appreciation Event</title>

        <description>

Over the last 15 years, we’ve tried just about everything related to client appreciation events. Some of them have crashed and burned. Others have been home runs.

Two examples of client appreciation events that have worked for us are our client appreciation cookout and our Thanksgiving pie and pumpkin roll giveaway. We throw both of these events annually and they’re definitely worth the effort.

To pull off events like these, we break them down into five manageable steps that you can use as a guide for setting up your own client appreciation event:

1) Make a list of preferred attendees. We recommend this list be comprised of past clients that have remained local and your local sphere of influence.

“Most of our clients really appreciate these events and look forward to them annually.”

2) Contact the vendors you need to support this event and confirm the dates. For example, the client appreciation cookout typically requires a caterer and a band. The Thanksgiving pie and pumpkin roll giveaway typically requires a bakery.

3) Have a print shop print out potential mail invite proofs. Make sure whichever you choose looks professional and has your logo on it. Also include an RSVP date on them.

4) Send the invites out to your preferred list and schedule a four- to five-hour prospecting time block so you can get on the phone and contact all of your invites personally. You can make sure they got their invite or you can just ask them if they want to RSVP right then and there. This is a critical point most agents forget about, but sometimes people just get too much mail and forget about invites like this. Attendance will be low if you don’t follow up your invites with a phone call. This is also a great opportunity to reconnect with your database.

5) Make connects with all of your attendees at your event and enjoy your time. You’ll get about two to three hours to connect with people you won’t get a chance to connect with any other time of the year.

When done correctly and with consistency, these events can be invaluable to your business. They allow you to connect personally with people you’ve worked with in the past or those who you like and trust. Truthfully, these events also give your clients a great opportunity to make connections they otherwise wouldn’t have a chance to make.

Most of our clients really appreciate these events and look forward to them annually. If you have any other questions about this topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to chat with you soon.

        <title>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Real Estate Agents</title>

        <description>

What are the seven habits of highly effective real estate agents? According to Stephen Covey and Brandon Doyle, these are the habits every agent should follow:

1. Be proactive. If you spend your day reacting to everyone else’s whims, your business will run you instead of the other way around. Make sure that you have time blocks and set boundaries around your time. Be proactive about communicating with your clients so they hear from you every week, instead of waiting to touch base after a problem comes up.

2. Begin with the end in mind. Create a plan for your life and your business. What do you want your life to look like 10, five, or three years from now? What about one year down the road? Figure out where you want to be and map out a strategy to meet these goals. Break that strategy down into bite-sized chunks so you don’t feel overwhelmed.

“Communicate with clients proactively instead of waiting for a problem to arise.”

3. Put first things first each day. There are important activities that need to be done. Since they are not urgent matters that need to be done right now, many agents tend to skip important activities like prospecting to grow their business. Spend two hours each morning getting those things accomplished before you get pulled into urgent reactive activities, like replying to emails or handling social media.

4. Think win-win. Take a collaborative approach to the real estate business in general. Think how you can create a win-win situation that will benefit your client as well as the other agent and their client. If you can do that effectively transaction after transaction, it goes a long way toward making everyone happy at the settlement table.

5. Seek to understand before being understood. Empathize with people. Put yourself in their shoes. Understand their needs first. Again, it may seem like more work up front, but it goes a long way to make everything go smoother.

6. Synergize. Even if you’re not on a team, there are a lot of people around you. From title companies to attorneys to home inspectors,  you can lean on them and act as a team to make your goals and your client’s goals a reality.

7. Sharpen the saw. What does this mean? According to Stephen Covey, it’s important to keep learning constantly. Watch webinars, read books, and go to seminars that will further your life and your business.

If you utilize these seven habits, you will become a highly effective agent.

As always, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

What is the No. 1 thing that affects customer or client satisfaction?

It’s the same thing that affects all interpersonal relationships from friendships and marriages to business partnerships.

In fact, if all else is equal—meaning that the agent is honest, genuinely works hard, and is knowledgeable about the market—this one thing goes the longest way to define customer satisfaction.

If you guessed that I’m talking about communication, then you are correct.

“We contact all of our clients once every seven days.”

On my team, one of the things we focus on is checking in with our listing or buyer clients once every seven days. When we contact them, we cover these four things:

1.) Here is what we did last week.

2.) Here is what the results were.

3.) Here is what we’re doing next week.

4.) What can we do differently or better?

If you can ask those four things every seven days, you will be a proactive agent rather than a reactive agent. By being proactive, you will run your business instead of allowing your business to run you.

Communicating with your clients this way creates happier relationships, happier customers, and more referrals for you and your business down the road.

If you have any other questions or if you would like to share something that you do to grow your business, just give me a call or send me an email. I would love to have a conversation with you.

        <description>

Welcome back to our business-building blog for high-producing agents on fast-growing teams. Today we’re here to answer the question, “How do you have a for-profit business with a nonprofit purpose?”

If you’ve been selling homes for a while like I have, you’ve probably been wondering about how you can have a bigger impact on your community. After about a decade in the business, I wasn’t sure if this is what I wanted to do with my life and I was questioning what I wanted to do.

After talking with my wife and a few other close friends and family members, I came to the realization that I’m uniquely positioned in real estate to learn about people’s needs and serve them on a really deep level.

I decided to start a new referral program. I always ask my clients if they know of anybody who is thinking about buying or selling, but I never ask them if they know anyone who might be going through a tough time that we could serve in an anonymous way.

“This referral program has brought joy to many people.”

That idea led me to developing the Community Appreciation Program that allows us to serve others in the community by using our database as leverage to find them. Here’s how we did it, in five easy steps:


  Open up a separate checking account.
  Put a percentage of every commission check in there.
  Ask every client this question: “Who do you know in the community with a random, urgent need whom we might be able to serve?”
  Have the client enter the person’s information in a Google survey or spreadsheet.
  Once you’ve picked someone, call the person who gave you the referral and ask them to partner with you to give the gift. Ask them how it went afterwards.


This is just one easy way to bring purpose back into your real estate business. If you have any questions, or if you have an example of another way you or your team is giving back, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.

Today, I’ve got two questions you can ask that can help you do just that. When done at the right time with a genuine attitude, asking these questions can go a long way in developing deep relationships with your customers. It will also help you with future referrals.

First, as a buyer consultation is coming to a close, ask your buyer the following before either of you leave: “What are your biggest fears or concerns in the upcoming transaction?” In this sometimes intimidating process, people want to feel understood and reassured.

There is a common belief that being a good listener is the best sales skill you can have. Personally, I believe that having empathy is a close second to that.

As professionals, we deal with the stress and uncertainties that come along with real estate transactions every day—but this likely isn’t the case for your client.

“Put yourself in your client’s shoes.”

Being able to genuinely listen and take a sincere interest in their concerns will not only help to assuage your client’s fears, but also build a better relationship between you in general.

Put yourself in your client’s shoes—doing so will make a huge difference.

The second question you should ask should also be posed at the end of a buyer consultation. That question is: “Is there anything unrelated to real estate that I can help you with?” By asking your client this, you are showing a level of service that extends beyond what they likely expect of you.

While it’s true that an agent’s job is not to be a therapist, the reality is that going out of your way to do something nice for your client can really make an impact.

After posing this question, listen to their response and consider taking notes. Empathizing with and caring for your clients will foster strong relationships and build a strong referral business for the future.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

When it comes down to it, we are all independent contractors and like small business owners in many ways. I run into a lot of agents who only focus on gross volume, income, and commission splits as financial indicators of their career. In reality, there are seven key variables to consider that will affect your bottom line when it comes down to deciding where you will practice real estate. Here are those seven things to pay attention to when looking at brokerages:

1. Commission splits. This is a fairly obvious one. Different brokerages have different splits.

2. Occupancy cost. Some brokerages charge expensive desk fees, some have cheap fees, and some have no fees at all. Neither is right or wrong, but it’s important that you understand what kind of support you’re looking for.

3. Brand recognition. This is a little less tangible, but still very important. A company with strong brand recognition in your market will make it easier for you to do more business.

“Do a thorough job at researching and vetting brokerages.”

4. Administrative support. A brokerage could have compliance officials, service coordinators, or even full-time transactional support. When you have a brokerage who focuses on the basics, you can spend more time on the dollar-producing activities that will grow your business.

5. Lead generation. Do they provide leads or not? Do they offer scripts? Both are important questions to ask.

6. Technology. Some charge for the best tech, some provide it for you, and some don’t provide it at all.

7. Leadership and accountability. It has been proven that coaching programs affect an agent’s bottom line as much as anything else. Some brokers provide this kind of support on their own, while others will point you to a coach and still others won’t offer anything at all.

The answers to each of these questions will affect where you practice. Make sure you do a thorough job at researching and vetting brokerages before you make your decision. If you have any other questions about any of these variables or how it could affect your bottom line, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

It is a well-known fact that one of the most productive activities in real estate is building relationships with the people we know, like, and trust. This is known as cultivating our sphere of influence, or SOI. Here are five simple steps to make sure those people are referring you business:

1. Make a list of everyone you trust. Write down their names and contact information, including email and phone number. This list should have anywhere from 50 to 300 people.

2. Highlight the top 10 to 20 contacts that are most likely to refer you business. These people should be labeled or noted as “SOI-A+” and everyone else on the list should be noted as “SOI.”

“Bring an item of value to your meetings with your contacts.”

3. Be sure to contact everyone on that list at least 30 times a year. They should hear your voice through either a phone call, an image through direct mail or email, and/or a handwritten note.

4. Meet in person with those highlighted as “A+” over lunch or coffee three to four times a year.

5. When you touch in with anyone on your list, make sure you bring them an item of value. This is usually a piece of important information, but can also be an actual item of value. Make sure they’re aware that you’re in real estate and you’d love to hear from anyone they know who might be buying or selling in the next year.

If you have any questions about this topic or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, please give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help!

        <description>

We can’t control the amount of time we have as real estate agents, but we can control how we spend that time. I’m here to tell you that if you can improve that control, you can double your productivity.

To do this, you need to focus on the actions and tasks that give you the highest return on the investment of your time. These are activities like following up with leads and prospecting. They are very important, but we often don’t treat them that way. We tend to procrastinate on them.

“I have time set aside each day for money-producing activities.”

To manage your time more wisely, I recommend using activity blocking to make sure you have specific times set aside in your calendar each day where you can focus on those money-making activities. As you can see in my calendar in the video above, I have time set aside each day for specific tasks and time set aside for focusing on things other than work. Here are my three steps to doubling your productivity:

1. Block time out in your schedule each day where you are specifically not working.

2. Block time out in the morning for a specific task, whether it be prospecting, business building, or something else.

3. Protect those time blocks with a vengeance.

By following these three steps, you can use the remaining time in your schedule to accomplish the rest of the things you need to do. Setting up your schedule like this will ensure you devote plenty of time to the right things.

If you have any questions for me about your career or you just want to have a quick conversation about the business, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

How do you ensure all of your clients are treated with the same level or service, whether it’s you providing that service or someone else?

This is a loaded question because the more people doing business on your team means the more variation there will be within the service provided, but we use a system called Top Producer.

With Top Producer, we break down every action step in the sales process to a specific action item and then to a specific person so all of our processes are repeatable and orchestrated properly. So, whether I’m providing the service or someone else is, the client will receive the exact same level of service.

For example, in the video above, we have listing plans that have specific action items for specific people. If you were to click on that action item, you’d also see specific notes we’ve typed up explaining how that person is supposed to complete that action item. We also set a timer so every action item listed is completed at the exact same time in the transaction right up until the property goes under contract.

“Action items are there to make our processes repeatable.”

If one of our buyers or sellers goes under contract, we also have a closing plan for them. This breaks down the entire closing process so each client gets the exact same treatment, whether they’re working with me directly or someone else on our team.

You can do all sorts of action items—both for business and personal use. Again, they’re there to make sure the process is repeatable. Just like a chef at a 5-star restaurant has a recipe that breaks down every part of the meal they’re going to cook, it’s helpful to us real estate practitioners to do the same thing.

If you have any questions about this topic, please feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to brainstorm with you.

        <title>5 Critical Technologies You Need to Grow Your Business</title>

        <description>

As an agent, I’m a big advocate of not getting distracted by shiny objects. Think of all the things presented to us real estate agents that we could easily go after and spend our money on. With that in mind, here are five critical technologies to grow your business that are tried and tested for solo agents, small teams, and teams with as many as 30 agents handling 1,000 transactions:

1. Google Apps for Work. The Google suite provides a collaborative office suite with Gmail, Google Calendars, and shared calendars with all sorts of notifications settings and appointment tracking for your team members. Also included is Google Docs, which offers sharing settings, storage, and collaboration within Google Sheets and Google Docs. There’s a whole other suite of applications within the Google Apps for Work suite. It’s a great piece of technology that’s essential for any team in the real estate world.

2. Top Producer. Top Producer has a reputation for being clunky, but the truth is that it’s great to use as a CRM as well as for listing and closing plans. There is no better way to ensure that all your clients are treated the exact same way and they’re treated up to the service standard they have come to expect from you.

3. Buyer side CRM. In a world of Internet technology and website leads, it’s important you’re able to both create a funnel for prospects coming into your world and organize those prospects so a system can prompt you to follow up with them.

4. A call recording and tracking system. It’s important that you track your business as you grow it so you can decide what’s worth spending money on and what’s not. A call recording and tracking system can help you improve quality control for training purposes and ensure that your team members treat your clients in the most effective and personable way possible. It can also track where you’re getting your leads from.

5. A business tracking system. There are all kinds of business tracking systems out there in the real estate world, but something on an Excel spreadsheet works as well as anything. Make sure that every lead source that brings a prospect into your world has a tracking code on it and every appointment that’s set contains that tracking code. At the end of that month, do a reconciliation to figure out where your business is coming from and what the return on each of those advertising investments has been.

“These five technologies will help your business immensely.”

If you have any questions about any of these technologies, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.

        <description>

When it comes to time management and planning your week, there’s one critical tool you must have. We call it the “Dominate Your Day, Win Your Week” worksheet and we fill one out every morning to stay focused on growth activities.

As you can see on the sample sheet in the video above, we put ‘on business’ projects on top. We consider ‘on business’ things to be systems and other things that will grow the business like projects and lead generation. You should always be working on two or three projects in 90-minute time chunks each weekto grow the business.

Below that is a breakdown of the top six money-making activities for a given day. For example, prospecting to 20 people or hand writing two notes could be a top task every single day. Then, you can categorize other tasks that are good to get done each day, but aren’t completely necessary.

“You should always work on a few projects in 90-minute chunks each week to grow the business.”

Then at the bottom of the list, you can write down miscellaneous action items that you know you need to finish each day. It’s pretty much a laundry list of errands and other things related to the business.

Finally, since I’m big on gratitude and having a positive focus, we have a list for these items to make sure things are looking forward.

If you’d like to talk more about how we use this tool or why we’ve had success with it, or you’d like a copy, just give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to speak with you.

        <description>

There’s one critical tool you need to use every day to assure you grow your business.

There are plenty of quick fixes and shiny objects out there that you’ve probably been tempted to spend a lot of time and money on to grow your business, but as we all know, to grow a sales business, you have to be in contact with a lot of people. There a lot of ways to do this, but one phrase that stands out to me is, “We respect what we inspect.”

There’s no better thing to inspect than our critical activities used to get in touch with people. And that’s why my agents and I carry a document called the Weekly Critical Activities Success Tracker every day. You can take a look at this document in the video above.

“This document tracks everything we do on a daily basis.”

It tracks everything we do every day and puts it on a worksheet. For example, the middle of that page has prospecting and follow-up calls because we know we should make between 15 and 30 prospecting and follow-up calls every single day. We can also notch off referrals and new contacts added to our database.

I encourage you to set a goal for yourself for the amount of outbound touches you want to make every day and record them on this document. Then, set yourself up with a Google Form like we do and it will come to your inbox every Monday to help you stay accountable.

If you have any other questions about growing your business or you’d like a copy of our activities tracker, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to hear from you!

        <description>

At some point, the time may come when your best move will be to hire a real estate assistant. If you’re doing 15 to 20 transactions without an assistant, you’re probably having trouble finding balance in life. An assistant can not only give you an opportunity to find that balance, but increase your productivity at the same time.

How will you know it’s time to hire an assistant? There are three qualifiers we look for before making a hire:

1. Your transaction count: If you’re looking to do 25 or more transactions, your count is probably at or over capacity.

2. Your income: If you’re in the $4.5 million to $6 million annual production range, it might equate to about $130,000 to $150,000 GCI. If you’re at that level or more, you should consider hiring an assistant because you likely have the financial capacity.

3. Your savings: The conservative in me thinks it’s important to have an emergency fund. If you have between three and six months of an assistant’s potential income saved in a separate account, then you have the financial reserves to be able to afford an assistant. That way, if you have a slow period, you’ll have a bucket of reserves you can pull from without getting too stressed. We all know we can have slow times of a month or two at a time, so this is really valuable to have.

“Your transaction count can be a good indicator that it’s time to hire an assistant.”

If any or all three of these qualifiers relate to you, it might be time to really think about whether you should hire an assistant. I can say with certainty that every time we’ve hired an assistant or agent to help us grow our business, we’ve never regretted it.

If you’d like to discuss these qualifiers further, I’d love to sit down and speak with you about your best course of action. Just give me a call or send me an email and we’ll talk soon

        <description>


Should you spend your time and money on Internet leads like Zillow and Realtor.com? There’s a lot of talk in the industry about these kinds of leads and whether they’re worth your while. A lot of teams have success with Internet leads, but the question is whether it’s worth your while for you specifically. Two years ago, an NAR study showed that referral business was still the No. 1 source of real estate business in the United States, but also that 20% of real estate business was generated by Internet leads. Keep in mind that an MIT response study found that if you can’t follow up with an Internet lead in five minutes or less, it’s probably not worth your while. Do you have the technology, systems, and capacity to follow up with them that quickly? The average agent last year took 61 hours to follow up with an Internet lead, so consider that before you decide to invest your time and money in them. Secondly, be aware that it takes seven to eight follow-ups to build a rapport with a lead. Do you have that kind of time and capacity?

“Overall, it takes a lot of money, time, systems, and technology to do it well.”

Third, remember that the money generated from Internet leads are often generated in long-term follow-up. Most Internet leads are six to 12 months from their buy-in window at the time that they inquire. Not only do you have to follow up quickly and often, you have to follow up for a long time. Overall, it takes a lot of money, time, systems, and technology to do it well. If you’re at a point in your business where you’ve leveraged help from other people and you have the time and money to spend on systems and technology to pursue Internet leads, it might be a great decision for your business. I hope you found this discussion helpful. If you have any questions or you’d like to talk further about building your business, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you!

Don’t let your business run you. Implement these three strategies to run your business.*
Join The Team
&gt;How do you make sure that you are running your business instead of letting your business run you? I use three strategies in my day-to-day business that work really well.
First of all, set a daily voicemail. It only takes about 30 seconds. Say something along the lines of, “This is Dave Hooke. Today is Wednesday, February such-and-such. I will be available from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. today. Your call is important to me and will be returned as soon as possible. If you call after 5:30, I will call you back tomorrow. Thank you and have a great day.”
That voicemail gives me peace of mind because it lets my customers know right away when they will hear back from me depending on when they call.
We’ve all gotten a call at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. from a customer. I used to feel guilty or like I was slacking off if I didn’t answer the call. Now, thanks to the voicemail, there are boundaries. The customer knows that I am on top of things and that they will get a call back tomorrow. After you use the voicemail for a couple of months, your customers will start any calls after 5:30 p.m. with an apology.

Secondly, make sure to include an office hours page in each and every buyer and seller presentation. This sheet summarizes when your team is open for business. Ask your team to abide by those hours as much as they can. The office hours sheet sets expectations with the buyer or seller before they sign with you.

When you explain that, like any other business, yours has business hours, your clients will respect that. Let them know that if there is an emergency, you’ll get back to them as soon as possible. The office hours sheet combined with the daily voicemail will make a big difference in your business.

“Set expectations and boundaries with your clients.”

Finally, make sure that you time block your important, but not urgent, tasks. We know what those are because these are tasks we like to procrastinate on. Those tasks really drive our lives and businesses forward. Whether it’s managing your database or sending handwritten notes to clients, block out an hour or two every day to take care of those tasks.

I like to go a step further and time block for exercising and family time. After 5:30 p.m., my rule is no work, no exceptions. If you have kids, add a note in your calendar that says, “We are counting on you, Mom!” or “We are counting on you, Dad!” It might feel like you are missing out on some things at work for the first couple of weeks but after a month or so, things will fall into place. Keep those time blocks in place, no exceptions.

Implementing these three strategies will help you run your business instead of allowing your business to run you. If you have any questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
