*I recently learned something about the home inspections process that will benefit your clients that I wanted to pass along.* 
 
**Click [Here](http://parkcityrecareers.blogspot.com/p/consultation.html) for Business Coaching or Career Information** 
We've all been trained to give the names of three home inspectors when your clients ask for a referral, but I suggest that you highly **encourage them to seek out a certified inspections expert.** Since home inspectors are not regulated by the department of commerce, so this certification provides valuable benefits to your clients. 

For starters, they provide a **90-day warranty** for any items that were inspected and deemed to be in good order. This is important because not all of your clients will buy a home warranty plan, even though you recommended it. That 90-day window is critical because many things that can go wrong will go wrong during those first 90 days in the home. 
 

Certified inspections come with a national resource line that homeowners can call for any questions. 
 

With a certified inspection, your clients can also get sewer and septic inspections that use cameras to inspect the pipes and other areas. They can also bridge the gap between the inspection warranty and home warranty, which is another nice added benefit. Additionally, they have a national resource line that homeowners can call with questions. 

They also have specific coverages pertaining to mold, which can be an issue sometimes up here in the mountains. They also have very specific **roof leak protection** that I haven't seen in the general home inspection process. 

If you have any questions about this topic or you'd like to talk further about how it can benefit your clients, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I'd love to talk and help you with your career however I can.

        <description>

As most of you know, Zillow is by far the largest consumer facing web portal out there for real estate. Many of your clients use it as they are contemplating selling their homes. Instead of fully rejecting Zillow and their Zestimate, I challenge you to embrace the concept and allow Zillow to be your friend rather than your foe.

On Zillow’s home page, you can find what they call their “data accuracy table.” It gives you several points that they use to assess the valuation. This table is your best friend when dealing with sellers who want to take Zillow’s word as law.

Here in Utah, one key thing to note is that we are a non-disclosure state. In other states, Zillow looks at the deed transfer information to get home sale prices. In Utah, they don’t have access to that information. This means their accuracy will be off significantly, adding more value to your listing presentation.

“UTAH IS A NON-DISCLOSURE STATE.”

Before you go on a listing presentation, check out the Zestimate for that particular property. Be prepared for the seller to bring that value up, and be prepared to rebut it with facts from the data accuracy table. Show them that Zillow doesn’t take upgrades to their home into account nor does it differentiate between properties with different locations and amenities. Zillow’s algorithm treats them all the same.

All you need to do to embrace Zillow is understand what it does and does not do when it comes to determining a home’s value. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <title>Helping Your Buyers Avoid Down Payment Pitfalls</title>

        <description>

As you’re beginning to work with buyers who you know will require a loan to purchase a home, typically 90 days before closing, talk to them about their fund’s availability. If they’re going to be pulling together funds to come up with a down payment, which might include a gift from their parents, they need to do that outside the 60-day window because lenders will typically look at two months worth of bank deposits.

So, if the down payment is going to be a gift from a family member, or, say an engaged couple is going to be putting their funds together for a down payment, **make sure all of that is done outside of the 60-day window. **

Also, if they are for some reason stashing cash in their home instead of putting it in the bank, they need to start depositing that money in small deposits on a regular basis.

“THERE WILL BE FINAL CREDIT CHECK SO DON’T MAKE ANY UNWISE PURCHASES.”

Although the engaged couple might be splitting the down payment, they both need to qualify, so funds should be in both accounts. They also shouldn’t wait until the last minute to consolidate their funds. Liquidating assets takes time, and they want to make sure they have the funds for their part of the down payment.

Finally, counsel your buyers not to buy something like a car or furniture until after the closing. There will be a final credit check, so they need to wait until after the home is bought to make those kinds of purchases.

If you have any questions about avoiding down payment pitfalls, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would be happy to assist you.

        <title>Why Staging is Crucial When Listing Your Home</title>

What makes staging so important? The simple answer is that staged homes sell quicker and for more money. So, what can you do to make sure your home is staged and ready to be put on the market?

Inside, you want to make sure you depersonalize and edit your home to appeal to a wide variety and large number of buyers. Buyers really want an emotional connection to a home, which they can achieve if it’s easy to picture their things in your home. You want to make sure your home is clean, functional, and above all, welcoming.

In the kitchen, you need to declutter. Get rid of dated accessories and things you don’t need and make sure you have nice, clean countertops

In the living areas, you need to declutter and get rid of extra furniture to make the room feel more inviting. Stage it nicely by adding a focal point on a coffee table. Felicity puts groups of three or five accessories of various heights, widths, and materials in a room to really make the area pop. She is a big fan of using sparkly accessories that catch the eye and help open up space.

“STAGED HOMES SELL QUICKER AND FOR MORE MONEY.”

You’ll also want to clear the clutter from the laundry room, clear off countertops, and put laundry away. If you have a pet, you should pack away pet toys and the pets themselves. Many people are allergic and some people find pet things off-putting. Get rid any unwanted smells and stains caused by your pets as well.

In the master bathroom, you want to make it look as much like a spa as possible. Clear off the countertops, add contemporary accessories, and maybe even put on some soothing spa music. Everything left out in the bathroom needs to be pristine, which means watered plants and clean towels. Also it’s a good idea to remove any bathmats or fuzzy toilet covers.

The outside of the home is just as important as the inside. After all, your curb appeal is the first impression. You’ll want to powerwash your siding, clean the windows, make sure the lawn is nicely mowed, plant flowers for a pop of color, powerwash the path, and check to see if the garage and front door could use a spruce. In the backyard, powerwash your patio area and consider getting some great patio furniture.

Felicity Gardner is available to assist your clients whose homes need editing.  She is available on an hourly or project basis. Please contact her at 435-640-4174 or felicity@gardnergroup.com.

As always, if you have any questions about real estate, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!

When you sell real estate, it’s important to maximize the value of your marketing.

Most of us use email consistently to communicate with our clients, and that’s a good thing. With many of our clients having a high net worth, though, they get a lot of emails. You probably have a communication schedule that follows a marketing calendar as part of your business plan.

When you deploy a message, you’ll get a response from maybe 2% to 5% of the recipients if you’re lucky—but what about the rest of them?

“DON’T JUST RELY ON MARKETING, BE PURPOSEFUL IN YOUR FOLLOW UP.”

When you deploy a piece of marketing, set a reminder for yourself on your calendar for two to three days after to call the recipients. Be very purposeful about these calls and pick out a piece of content from what was deployed that you can use to start a dialogue. You want a good reason to start a conversation over the phone.

They might not have a current real estate need, but they might know somebody who does. They might have a real estate need in the near future. We all know that one-on-one time is the most productive time to spend with a client, and we’re challenged by that since many of our clients don’t live here. That’s why being able to get them on the phone is important.

In the end, don’t just rely on the marketing to do all the heavy lifting. Be purposeful about your follow up!

If you have any more questions about how to do this or about your real estate career, give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to hear from you.

        <description>

Now that warmer weather is fast approaching, you’re probably anxious to start listing homes for your spring clients. Luckily, I have two tips to share with you today that will reduce your days on  market.

Suggest that your client get two reports that are really going to help you narrow down the pricing and expedite the sale: a home inspection and an appraisal.

Your client is probably going to tell you that they’ve maintained their property beautifully. However, you need to know what’s behind the walls and how the roof is looking, not to mention making sure all the major systems like the A/C unit and furnace are working. Any issues with the home are going to come up during the buyer’s due diligence period anyway, so the seller might as well get out in front of that. Having that information will also help you price the home accordingly.

“MAKE SURE YOUR CLIENTS GET A RADON INSPECTION ALONG WITH A HOME INSPECTION.”

Along with the home inspection, make sure your clients go ahead and do a radon inspection as well. Most home inspectors have an add-on which isn’t that expensive, and it’s important to many buyers that the radon inspection is done.

The appraisal is going to be the best tool you can use for pricing the home. Prices have increased fairly quickly in the last month, so keep in mind that the appraisal might be a bit off as they haven’t caught up yet. You can factor in a little bit for appreciation and take a good look at what’s been happening in the neighborhood to come to a fair market price.

If you have any other questions about pricing a home for a quick sale or if you are curious about other real estate topics, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!

        <description>

Many of you are probably looking to social media as a marketing channel as you finalize your plans for 2017. I absolutely encourage you to do this.

Did you know that 75% of adults are active on some social media channel? The trick is finding out which one. Here are five tips to avoid when it comes to social media:


  
    No free-wheeling is allowed! You’ve got to have a plan or it can become very time-consuming. Plan out where you’re going to be in terms of budgets for things like paid ads and what you’ll hold that budget accountable to—how much business do you expect it to generate? Have a plan and content strategy for what’s going to be your key messaging.
  
  
    Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Even if you love Pinterest, don’t put 80% of your focus there and spread 20% across all the remaining platforms. Hootsuite.com is a great scheduling program that allows you to push out the same content on multiple social media channels. It takes some time to schedule, but I suggest you spend about six hours a month mapping out your schedule. From there, it’s basically set it and forget it. You also need to allow time to be spontaneous for things like big news. You want to be able to jump in with timely content on social media.
  


“YOU’VE GOT TO HAVE A PLAN OR IT CAN BECOME VERY TIME-CONSUMING.”


  
    Don’t wait for the bugs to be worked out. There are constantly new social media platforms coming out, and as soon as you start hearing about them, it is too late! You want to be an early adopter because there are usually benefits associated with being an early adopter. Applications like Hootsuite will keep you informed of this news.
  
  
    Be prepared to embrace rapid change. The world of social media constantly evolves, so I like to stay abreast with a site called Mashable.com. It’s a good general clearinghouse for information about social media where you can get quick updates on things you need to be aware of.
  
  
    Keep an eye on your analytics. Google Analytics, for example, is a great way to stay on top of your site’s traffic and to see where it’s coming from. Facebook has a great analytics tool, as well.
  


Good luck with your social media strategy in 2017! If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be glad to help!

        <description>

Millennials (people under 35) are finally hitting the real estate market. It’s important to understand these four trends when working with a millennial on a home sale:


  
    They love mobility. They are not very loyal in the job market; millennials are constantly looking for their next opportunity, so they move frequently. When you talk to them about purchasing real estate, they don’t want a place where they can live for 10 years and raise a family. Instead, focus on the investment value of the property. Choose homes with good rental histories in high demand areas. That way, when a millennial hops into a new job, they can easily transition that property into a rental property.
  
  
    They really love cities. When millennials move to Park City, focus on high-density areas like Redstone, Lower Pinebrook, and Old Town. Millennials want to be where the action is. They are accustomed to walking everywhere. They don’t like jumping into a car and driving around.
  


“MILLENNIALS ARE NOT NECESSARILY LOOKING TO SETTLE DOWN.”


  
    They love incentives. Incentives can be hard to come by with our huge resale market, but if you are helping a millennial buy a new construction property, look for builders that offer strong incentives.
  
  
    They tend to have a lot of student loan debt. When you work with buyers in this age group, make sure that they are pre-qualified. There is an income-based repayment program available for millennials to use as well. Who knows what will happen to it under our next president, but for now, the program allows them to rework their loan payments over a longer period of time. That way, they have more disposable income to put toward their mortgage payment.
  


If you understand these trends, you will be able to help your millennial buyer find the right home. If you have any questions for me, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

We are excited to be joined today by Heather Feldman, who is going to talk to us about marketing as it relates to new construction and new home sales. Heather has been doing new home sales since 1998 and she has a lot of knowledge and experience in this market. She knows how homes are built and what to expect through the process.

There has been a spike in new construction in our area recently, which opens the door to a lot of fabulous properties and a lot of fabulous opportunities. Here are the top three things agents should consider when they go down the new construction road:


  
    Find a great general contractor. It’s important to find one who has subcontractors that they have worked with and vetted as well.
  
  
    Know the numbers that are in front of you in regard to the new build and know what they mean.
  
  
    Be ahead of schedule. Things will sneak up on you and you don’t want your build to fall apart because you haven’t made the necessary decisions to proceed.
  


“THIS CAN BE A STRESSFUL PROCESS.”

**This is a stressful process, and when buyers have someone like Heather who can keep them on track and keep things manageable, it’s a lot easier. The build process is also very complex. Things will come up and buyers will have to decide if they want one option over another.

You also want to have a good idea of what the budget will be ahead of time. You can build a really nice home for around $300 per square foot. Work with your architect during the process and ask them what you can control during the process.

I hope you all enjoyed hearing from Heather today. If you have any questions for her or me, give us a call, send us an email, or fill out the form below and we’ll follow up with you. We look forward to hearing from you!

        <title>The Importance of Gratitude</title>

        <description>

With Thanksgiving just around the corner, I thought it would be appropriate to talk a little bit about gratitude.

I think that the poet Maya Angelou said it best when she said, “When you have an attitude of gratitude, you wake up saying, ‘thank you!’”

Successful entrepreneur, life coach, and business coach, Tony Robbins, has stressed the importance of seeking gratitude in everyday life, too. He makes a point every morning to meditate and to express gratitude to the people and things that he’s grateful for.

Think about how fortunate we are to live in Wasatch Back; we have much to be grateful for. Some days, this business can beat you down, but think about how much we have to celebrate. Whether it’s a successful closing, a great client meeting, or the Cubs winning the world series, think about how these kinds of causes for celebration can lift your spirits. Better days are ahead.

“GRATITUDE BREEDS POSITIVITY.”

Try this exercise: every day, to yourself, silently express your gratitude for the three things you’re most grateful for. I bet you’ll be very surprised by the results.

With it being so close to Thanksgiving, I’m going to challenge you. Try to not only express your gratitude for three people, places, or things each morning, but to reach out to the top 20 people in your sphere of influence as well. Simply give them a call, let them know that you’re thinking about them, and thank them for being in your life. I think you’ll be very surprised with what happens next.

Remember: gratitude breeds positivity. I’d love to hear your results! If you have any other questions about this topic or anything else, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!

        <description>

In previous videos we talked about time blocking and time management as a way to organize your day, but today we want to talk about a different kind of management: energy management.

We are all different, both physically and psychologically. Knowing what gives us energy is very important to maximizing your productivity. Think about it- what gives you energy?

For some of us, a great morning workout helps us get our day on track. We feel energized, awake, and enlivened by the activities. For others, perhaps it’s a diet rich in fresh ingredients and protein. Others rely on caffeine. Keep an eye on what gives you energy, as well as what takes it away. I don’t eat bread or pasta for lunch because it brings my energy down. Others don’t feel that same effect. Knowing where your energy comes from is important in maximizing your productivity.

“PEOPLE GET ENERGY IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS.”

If you have any questions about energy management, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you!

        <description>

Branding helps agents differentiate themselves from one another. Branding also allows people to structure their real estate businesses.

Today I’m here with Steve Kotsenburg, who recently returned to Keller Williams after working with a luxury brand. Steve and I will discuss his branding process and what Keller Williams allows him to do differently.

More than anything else, Keller Williams allows Steve to be himself. The branding and marketing talk about what he can offer personally as an agent, rather than focusing on the larger company. “It allows me to be more creative,” Steve says. “We all bring something different to this world.” Keller Williams really allows Steve to show what sets him apart from other real estate agents.

“YOUR BRAND SHOULD BE RELEVANT TO THE SERVICES YOU PROVIDE.”

Steve’s tagline is “Gold Medal Service.” This tagline was inspired by his son, Sage Kotsenburg, who went to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and won the first gold medal in men’s snowboard slopestyle. “My son . . . he’s a very humble kid,” Steve says. “As a family, we don’t want to brag about being gold medal people, but over the last couple years we’ve come to realize what that [medal] represents to people in our country and our community.”

Many people told Steve that he needed to incorporate his son’s medal into his marketing. Ultimately, Steve landed on the tagline “Gold Medal Service” because that is what he aims to provide, even if his son wasn’t a gold medalist. “We want to provide that class of service, so we punched it in with our branding and it worked wonderfully,” Steve says. As an agent, it’s important that your branding is relevant to the services you provide, and Steve truly found the branding that works for him.

Since joining Keller Williams, Steve has gotten more responses from his SOI and fellow agents, and his ability to pull off that branding so quickly has been really good. “Working together here has been a great fit for me,” Steve says.

If you would like to see an example of Steve’s branding, check out www.TheKotsenburgGroup.com. You can email Steve with any questions at Steve@TheKotsenburgGroup.com. Also, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me with any questions or concerns you might have. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

If I said, “Send, Call, See,” would you know what I meant?

It’s a way to maximize the value of your database by having a strategy for communicating. The “Send” portion refers to sending something of value to your clients between 12 and 20 times a year. The best way to do this is by mapping out the whole calendar year when you’re looking at your business plan. You’ll send something to them once or twice a month.

Then, after you’ve sent out content, you must have a call strategy. I suggest you call your clients at least four times a year. It sounds simple, but you need to build some discipline into your calendar. Anytime you talk to someone, it’s a chance to ask for a referral or get additional business from them. Don’t quit on these calls.

“YOU SHOULD TOUCH YOUR DATABASE 12-20 TIMES PER YEAR.”

Finally, we have the “See” portion, because you want to see your clients twice a year, face-to-face. One of your calls should be asking about what these people have going on and when you’re likely to see them, or if they could have a cup of coffee with you. Be very purposeful about creating a chance to see them.

I hope you’ve found some value from this message. If you have questions, you can always give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you.

        <title>How to Turn Property Tax Notices Into an Opportunity</title>

Today I wanted to talk about turning taxes notices into an opportunity. How can you do it?

The end of July is the time of year when tax notices go out to property owners. The purpose of the notice is to let the owner know how that municipality is going to tax that property for the upcoming tax bill due by the end of November.

Send all of the people in your sphere of influence an email with as compelling a subject line as you can, and let them know that tax notices have been sent out. Let them know that you want to offer your services for running comps for their property, and suggest that they call you rather than just responding to an email.

It’s an opportunity to talk to your client, let them know that you value the relationship, and that you want to provide value to them. Always come from a place of contribution.

“YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY TURN TAXES INTO OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOURSELF.”

Remember, whether you were on the buy or sell side of a transaction, you’ll also want to pull the HUD settlement statements, because they’re going to need that as well. Should they want to retain the services of a professional to help them with any kind of an appeal process, contact your local municipality or county, and find out who in the assessor’s office they might recommend.

There are usually a handful of people who do a really good job on the appeal process, and the people working in the assessor’s office will know who they want to work with on an appeal. Google it and find out who to call so you can have those resources available, should your clients ask for it.

I hope you find this helpful. Believe it or not, you can turn taxes into opportunities. Give me a call with any questions you may have.

Leveraging yourself and your time is an important part of growing any real estate business. Do you have leverage in your business? Here’s how you can find that out.

First, figure out your hourly rate. If you assume that it’s possible to have a GCI of $150,000 in Park City, which is reasonable for our price point, and on average people work 49 weeks a year and 40 hours per week, it gives you a total number of 1,960 hours. Divide that from $150,000 and you get an hourly rate of $76.50

So, as you are doing things like managing your transactions from contract to close, making your own marketing flyers, and writing your own blog content, ask yourself if you could hire someone else to do this type of work for less than $76.50 an hour who would be competent enough to do the tasks. Of course, the answer is yes.

“MORE LEVERAGE EQUALS MORE SUCCESS.”

Why don’t more people hire out this type of work on their teams?

They have plenty of excuses, whether they say it takes too much time or they don’t trust another person to do it. Just think about what you could do with either that extra money or extra time by hiring the work out. **That’s how you get leverage in your business. **

At a certain point, you’ll have to look into hiring a personal assistant or creating a team and hiring a buyer agent. But for now, look at your hourly rate, and see if you would be able to hire some competent help so you can leverage your business and make more money and be more successful. If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.

Today I’ll be sharing some secrets to maximize your time as a busy professional. However, if you have good ideas for topics, or if there is something you’d like to hear more about, please don’t hesitate to contact me.
1. Tap into the power of ‘Now’: Do it now, read it now, make it now.


  
    Relentlessly focus on one thing at a time: Multi-tasking has been proven to be extremely ineffective, so stay focused on one thing at a time.
  
  Be decisive but also purposefully delay decisions: Some decisions are easy - like what to have for lunch. But others will require more time. Perhaps you should take a run or ride a bike to clear your mind before making a major decision.
  Do the most-feared thing first: Stop procrastinating your least favorite task. Get it out of the way and get on with your day.


“MULTI-TASKING IS A MYTH”

Learn to say no to things that don’t advance your company: Learn to say ‘no’ to things that create little value for you and your company.  We were constantly being invited to events, and many of them were great, but we had to start saying no at some point.
Do one more: When you’re calling prospects, just try to call one extra person. Or when you’re mailing newsletters, just try to mail one extra out to someone.
Learn when to cut your losses: We’ve all had bad systems, bad clients, or bad strategies. Instead of sticking with them and hurting your business, you have to know when to call it quits.
I hope you’ve found these tips helpful, and I love hearing from everyone so please don’t be afraid to reach out to me!

There are 2 fascinating takeaways from the first quarter statistics for sellers in today’s market.

First, the median sales price across our 3 major markets increased 13% year over year. That means sale prices have gone up 13% in Park City proper, the Snyderville Basin, and in Heber Valley.

Next, Rick Klein from Wells Fargo released new information about sales velocity and pricing around the median sale price. When you’re working with a seller, this can be very useful information. Basically, if you price at the median sale price, or at least very close to it, your home will sell in about 2 to 4 months as long as the home is in good condition.

“Homes priced near the median sale price sell very quickly.”

However, if you price over the median sale price, it can take you 22 to 24 months to sell! The seller who wants to overprice must not be very motivated, right? As you can see, it takes 4 to 5 times longer to sell when a property is overpriced.

If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

What is the right mindset for someone who plans on moving? This is a crucial question every agent should know the answer to if they want to get results for their clients. An important role of the agent is to get the seller into the right mindset to move so that, should an offer come in, it is easy to facilitate the transaction. So, how can you get your clients in the right mindset?

One of the first things you should tell your clients to do upon listing is explore moving companies. Several companies offer local benefits to home sellers, so it’s important to have your clients explore all of their options. We like to use Two Man Movers; they have a program where, during the listing period, they provide a storage container in a climate-controlled facility in Salt Lake.

“Give staging and packing advice to your clients to help them along.”

Next, give staging and packing advice to your clients. Suggest they take family photos off the wall. Have them package them up and store them away so that potential buyers can envision themselves living in the home. Additionally, bulky furniture that doesn’t help showcase the property should be moved and stored. Another staging tip is to get rid of cords; either coil them together, label them, and put it near the device or keep a box with all the labeled cords. These are only a few of the many things you can suggest to your client in order to get better selling results.

If you would like additional tips on how to get your sellers into the mindset to move, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’re always available to help you!
