You’ll learn the top five warm advertising audiences for lead generation on Facebook. You’ll generate higher quality leads from the people who know you than strangers. It’s also cheaper to reach them. These warm “audiences” include the emails in your database, the people who visit your website, the people who watch your videos, your Facebook fans, and people who interact with your Facebook page. All this is tracked and you can run ads to these people. In this video, you’ll learn how to set up your Facebook ad account correctly - first by making strong offers to your warm audiences, and then boosting educational videos to your entire cold target market to build awareness. Interested in Facebook advertising?

“Essential Facebook advertising to your email database and website traffic is included in our core service.”

Essential Facebook advertising to your email database and website traffic is included in our core service.

You’ll learn how to read a simple script into a microphone so you don’t have to be on camera. A voiceover is the best way to record a video when you must be 100% on message. Voiceovers work best for sales and promotional videos. Simply send us photos or footage. We’ll add in music and the voiceover. We can record the voiceover for you (once we agree on the script) or you can record it using your computer.

“Remember, we can record the voiceover for you so there’s no work required of you.”

In this episode, you’ll see how real estate clients taking my upcoming recruiting class to launch Jan 8th are creating videos to sell tickets to upcoming training events. I use the Yeti microphone, with the levels set correctly, to read a client’s script into recording software (Audacity). This way you can see how it works to record your own voiceover. Remember, we can record the voiceover for you so there’s no work required of you. This is available to all clients. If you want to make a promotional video, and you don’t want to be on camera, this episode is for you.

You’ll learn how to hire an assistant in the Philippines, if you can’t afford American labor rates, to help with your marketing efforts or phone calls. I was invited to speak last month at an employee appreciation event outside of Manila for www.1000CallsADay.com – an outbound prospecting company – lead by Jessica Sanders who worked here at Vyral Marketing as our own lead follow up specialist. Jessica oversees 70+ callers, all based in the Philippines, earning $3-5 an hour. Each caller speaks with, on average, 35 people a day to pass 30-60 leads to you a month. WARNING: There are several marketing pillars to implement first (like referral, database marketing and inbound lead generation systems) BEFORE scaling up your outbound calling, however, the results do speak for themselves that outbound calling does work at scale.

“If you’ve ever wondered what it’s like to employ talent overseas, especially in the Philippines, this video is for you.”

Now, I want you to know hiring a call center - or even implementing an outbound calling plan - isn’t for everyone. Most importantly you must know the laws and expect long lead conversion cycles. But, when I was over there, I learned so much about the country, the working conditions, the pay rates, and more I wanted to share with you how it all works if you’re interested in this as a complement to your Vyral Marketing plan. I know many of you need help with extra marketing beyond the scope of our core service, help with calling people to invite to them to events or to subscribe to your video newsletters, or just plain ‘old recruiting. If you’ve ever wondered what it’s like to employ talent overseas, especially in the Philippines, this video is for you.
