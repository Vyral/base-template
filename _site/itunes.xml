        <description>

We’ve had a lot of growth in our economy in general over the last couple of years, and today we’ll be touching on one specific aspect of it: Interest rates. Before we get into our discussion, though, I’d like to clarify an important term: Basis points.

Basis points are used to describe changes to interest rates. A single basis point is a hundredth of a percentile, so, therefore, 25 basis points would be equivalent to 0.25%. 

So when you hear someone say that the Federal Reserve met and raised interest rates by 25 basis points, this means there was an increase of 0.25%. 

With that in mind, let’s move on to our main topic. Interest rates can have a significant impact on buyers and sellers alike in our market. And given that the Fed meets four times per year to discuss these rates, it’s important to understand how this may impact your goals.

“Even after the most recent increase, rates are still low compared to historical averages.”

Rates have been steadily rising in recent times, but even after the most recent increase in September, they are still low compared to historical averages. 

You can see this point illustrated in an extremely powerful graphic we’ve featured in today’s video (at 1:24). This graphic shows precisely how interest rate hikes correlate with drops in affordability. 

So, what does the current trend of rising rates ultimately mean for buyers and sellers?

For sellers, the good news is that recent appreciation has left homeowners with higher levels of equity. For buyers, these changes mean that it may be better to purchase a home as soon as possible. 

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Dear Friends and Clients —

Should you invest in a starter home?

Or is it a better idea to wait and save for your “forever” home?

First off, let’s make sure we’re talking about the same thing.

Economists often define a “starter home” as being in the lower third of a specific market’s value range (as opposed to trade-up homes and luxury homes).

For many homeowners, however, a starter home isn’t about price. Instead, it’s about how long they plan to stay there — typically, only a few years.

And that’s where the dilemma really occurs. That’s because buying and selling a home, as well as moving in and out, all have costs.

Also, since the bulk of the mortgage payments for those first years goes to interest, you’re also unlikely to build up much equity if you only own the home for a short while.In fact, according to one estimate, the break-even point for a starter home is somewhere from 5 to 7 years. In other words, if you’re planning to stay in the home for just a few years, then it might not make sense to buy it in the first place.

“A starter home can help you save money and build equity and net worth.”

So am I telling you to buy a starter home?

Nope. There are, however, good situations in which a starter home makes perfect sense.

For example, if you’re planning on staying put for 5 or more years, a starter home will save you money on rent, will help you build up equity and create net worth.

Or, if the home has long term potential, and you can imagine it becoming your forever home with the right renovations or additions.

Another option, is if you are open to keeping the home and renting it out as an investment property. Again, creating more net worth if your global financial picture will allow this option.

Ultimately though, this will be a decision that’s based on your own unique preferences and circumstances.

When you weigh all of that in, if you do decide that a starter home might make sense for you, then here’s something important you should know.

The best time to buy a starter home is fast approaching. That’s because fall is the season when starter home inventory peaks and listing prices drop, according to the real estate portal Trulia.

This means you should have the most choices, at the most affordable prices during the fall.

If you are curious what kinds of homes are becoming available around Central Pennsylvania area right now, take a look at this complete listing inventory:

Dear Friends and Clients —

Summer is here, which means the high season for real estate.

If you’ve been thinking of selling your home, you might be in for a golden moment.

But be aware it might not last long.

Let me explain why, with a few nationwide details of the current real estate market.

Right now, homes are selling in record time. This May, it took just 34 days for a home to go under contract, which broke last year’s record of 36 days.

Home prices also continue to rise. In fact, they’ve been rising for six straight years, and for the past two years, this growth has been accelerating.

As a consequence, 27.6% of the homes sold in May sold above their listing price.

All this is due to a woefully short supply of homes on the market. In fact, the total supply of homes is 5.4% lower this year than the same time last year.

However, the real estate market might be on the cusp of change.

For one thing, mortgage rates have been rising, and now stand near their highest levels in seven years. As a result, pending home sales were down as of April.

More worryingly, a Redfin survey found a drop in customers touring homes for the first time in 27 months.

“The real estate market might be on the cusp of change.”

What’s going on?

The home price surge might be nearing its end.

Overall, home affordability is dropping: Over the past 6 years, there has been a 48% increase in average home prices, while wages increased only 14%.

And while some sellers are still managing to sell at higher prices than listed, nearly a quarter of sellers actually had to lower their prices this April.

What does this all mean for you?

If you do decide to sell right now, you would have an easy time of it, and you could get a top price for your home. That’s because demand and prices are both still high.

However, if you decide to wait, things might go south quickly.

That’s because the market may be reaching the limits of price growth, and may be stalled by higher mortgage rates.

If you are considering selling your home, you can get started with an estimate of what your home is worth in the current market. Simply use this calculator, which takes into account recent Central Pennsylvania sales:

        <title>3 Real Estate Scams You  Need to Know About</title>

Buying or selling a home can be an intimidating experience and trusting real estate “professionals” may be daunting. Unfortunately, like any industry, there are some bad actors. Don’t become a victim!  

Here are some real estate scams that we’ve seen recently. If you know what to look out for, you can protect yourself with that knowledge.

1. The mortgage closing scam

This particular scam is spreading across the country. It’s become so prevalent that the FBI estimates it has led to more than $1 billion in stolen or diverted funds in 2017 alone.

It starts when hackers gain access to a real estate agent’s email account. Then, when it’s time to close a particular deal, the hackers, posing as the real estate agent, send instructions to the homebuyer on where to wire the money.

Of course, it’s only after the buyer has sent thousands of dollars to an unknown bank account that the truth comes out - the real estate agent wasn’t actually the one reaching out, and the buyer has been scammed.

Prevention. Select a reputable title company. A real estate agent should NOT be involved in the transfer of funds and your title company should never accept, nor follow, wire instructions from a real estate agent. Additionally, title companies should be insured against such fraudulent activities. 

2. Fake real estate attorneys

This scam is similar to the first one, in that the scammers will impersonate somebody legitimately involved with a deal.

In this case, the hackers will impersonate a real estate attorney who is associated with a particular transaction.

Then, at the time of closing, they will contact the buyer, either by email or over the phone, and tell them the wire destination has been changed. If this scam works, the homebuyer could again be out thousands of dollars.

Prevention. Again, selecting a reputable real estate law firm is critical. Your real estate agent will be able to recommend a well-established attorney who is properly insured against such fraudulent activities. 

“FIND A REAL ESTATE AGENT YOU TRUST TO REPRESENT YOUR BEST INTERESTS.”

3. The bait-and-switch

Unlike the first two scams, this scam targets sellers. It also doesn’t require any hacking or impersonation—just a dishonest buyer. Here’s how it works:

A buyer makes an offer that’s well above the listed price.  The seller happily agrees, and the contract is signed.

Then the buyer starts procrastinating, making excuses, and dragging out the process for months or even a year.

In the meantime, the seller continues to pay costs for the home, and is getting more and more emotionally worn out.

In the end, the unscrupulous buyer flatly says they can only buy the home at a lower price, usually under the listed price. And the seller, desperate by now, frequently agrees.

So, how can you protect yourself against these and other scams?

First and foremost, don't send account information over email.

Confirm everything over a phone call to a number that you already know to be valid…or even better, in person.

Finally, finding a real estate agent that you can trust to represent your best interests is critical. I’d be honored to serve in that role, so please give me a call at (717) 226-0819. 

I’ve facilitated real estate transactions in Central Pennsylvania for more than a decade, and I will happily provide contact information for my previous clients as references.

This winter is likely to be a very important moment for many home sellers. That’s because three big trends are coming together to affect Lancaster County home prices right now:

1. Housing inventory remains extremely tight. The total number of homes on the market fell 10% year over year in the last quarter. This is the biggest drop since 2013, and it’s part of a consistent pattern of very limited and decreasing housing supply. Of course, the fewer homes there are on the market, the easier it is to sell, and the higher the price you can expect to get. Home prices have increased almost 6.5% nationally since last year.2. Buyers are increasingly optimistic. Despite the tight inventory, homebuyers are increasingly optimistic and continue to look for homes. Some of this has to do with the recent growth in income and job stability. Loosening lending standards are also making many homebuyers eager to take advantage of current mortgage rates, which slipped under 4% recently.

“It’s the perfect time to get in the real estate market.”

3. The new tax reform bill will impact the market. The federal government recently passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which majorly overhauled our tax code. While it’s unclear how this will affect the real estate market as a whole, there are some changes that do not favor home sellers.  As a result of the changes made to the tax code, the National Association of Realtors now projects slower growth for home prices in 2018, with an appreciation rate of 1% to 3%. By doubling the standard deduction, Congress has significantly reduced the value of mortgage interest and property deductions as tax incentives for homeownership. On the bright side, no changes were made in the rules surrounding capital gains for home sales, which is good news for home sellers.

When you put all three of these trends together, two big conclusions emerge. First, now is a very favorable moment for home sellers, thanks to the shortage in the market, the many eager buyers, and the high and rising prices. On the other hand, higher cost, higher tax areas will likely see prices decline as the result of new restrictions on mortgage interest and state and local taxes.

If you are looking to take advantage of the present moment to sell your home, please reach out by giving us a call or sending us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Today, I want to share five important tips about moving that you can use to make your next move as smooth as possible.I recently moved into a different home. I learned quite a bit during the transition. As Realtors, we tend to focus on the technical aspects of real estate. We are professionals in negotiation and marketing. We try to offer extensions of service through different contractor recommendations and different providers for services associated with real estate.

But it’s not very often that we go through a full move ourselves. As a result of my recent experience, I want to share some tips that I learned through the process with the hope that it will make your move a little easier.

For one, begin packing and purging as early as possible so that you don’t have the stress of a last-minute scramble! We tend to collect things over time, whether they’re hand-me-downs or extra things you’ve outgrown or don’t use anymore. Get rid of those things. Rooms you don’t use should be packed as early as possible so when it comes down to the 11th hour of your move, you’re not scrambling or throwing things in boxes. The purge and the move can happen simultaneously; you can donate or toss things along the way when you’re cleaning up and packing.Secondly, you can hire a moving company. Treat yourself. Trust when I say that a moving company is worth every dollar. They can be expensive, but they offer a whole spectrum of services such as hauling your already-packed belongings to your new home or helping you pack your things in addition to helping you move them.

“Trust me when I say that a moving company is worth every dollar.”

The third tip is to contact all your utility companies in advance, usually about two weeks before the move. Make sure that all your payments and obligations are settled with them. You can also schedule installations around the same time for your new home, to save you the hassle of juggling those appointments at the last minute.

Fourth, take off more time from work than you think you need.There’s more to moving than getting your stuff from point A to point B. You also have to make time to unpack, organize, decorate, tear down boxes, and a general clean-up. If you try to do it over one weekend, you’ll find that you needed an extra day, and you might dwell on what you have left to do once you’ve returned to work. Before you know it, you’re spending your evenings and weekends for months at a time on finishing those things you didn’t get done initially. So just take a little bit more time and get things finished up.The fifth and most valuable tip is to enjoy it. Laugh about it. Things will go wrong, appointments will be missed, installations will be missed, things will break, and certain other things won’t line up the way you imagined. But make the best of it and exercise some humility.If you have any questions or have a move coming up, we can help recommend different service providers and moving companies. Feel free to give us a call; helping you move is just an extension of the service that we as real estate agents provide to you. We hope you had a great holiday season, and we wish you health and prosperity in 2018.

        <title>3 Things to Think About When Buying a New Construction Home</title>

        <description>

If you are going the route of building a home instead of purchasing a resale property, there are three things you need to keep in mind.


  Timing your move. When you buy a new construction home, your move will not be the simple 30-day or 90-day closing process you would find with resale homes. The process of building a new construction home can take between four and seven months, and sometimes even longer. So, if you’ve got a specific time frame in mind for your move, be sure to account for the time construction will take.
  Financing. There are different financing packages between resale and new construction purchases. Sometimes, new construction loans come with a slightly higher interest rate as well as a few more fees. There are bundle loans available where there is a single settlement, much like you would find with a resale purchase. But oftentimes in new construction loans, there are two settlements: one on the land and one on the total package once construction is complete. My team and I would be happy to partner you with a lender who can help.“Whatever you choose, make sure it is right for you.”
  The construction process. This is what I find most people really struggle with. When you’re looking at building a home, there are two ways you can go about it. You can work with a full custom contractor, which will allow you to control and customize every aspect of the home, or you can work with a volume builder. Volume builders have a set number of home plans that they work with. You can choose between these plans, but you will have limited control over customization. Outside of customization, the main difference between these two options is time. With a full custom home, you have to go to vendors and pick out everything. This can be extremely time-consuming, and the longer you wait on decisions, the longer construction can be set back. Working with a volume builder will generally expedite the process. Whatever you choose, make sure it is right for you.


If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

You may have noticed, there are fewer homes available on the market this year compared to last year, and buyer demand is still very strong.

As a result, new construction housing is beginning to accelerate. If you are unable to find an existing home, new construction may be an option.

I was recently featured in an article by the Central Penn Business Journal that explores new housing developments in the Carlisle area.

You can find the full article here

Cumberland Valley School District boasts some of the highest home prices in the county, causing buyers to look elsewhere. Large-scale projects in areas like Silver Spring and Hampden are also winding down. Land in those municipalities are at a premium. Developers and builders are finding opportunities in the greater Carlisle area.

New construction properties won’t satisfy all of the housing demand that we’re seeing right now, but it will provide new options for frustrated homebuyers.

Builders who historically haven’t explored Carlisle are now looking at the area to find projects, potentially helping boost our inventory over the next few years.

In fact, I am currently working on a residential subdivision off Meeting House Road in Carlisle to develop 18 single-family lots. These 18 lots will be available for construction in early 2018.

If you have any questions or are interested in a new construction property, just give me a call at (717) 609-8265 or  email me at AndrewK@HHandE.com. I would be happy to help you.

I always get a lot of questions from people about how they can determine what their house is worth and what’s involved in listing it.

For us, determining your home’s value is pretty straightforward. We start off with a comparative market analysis (CMA), which we’re happy to do for your home at any time. We provide these to our friends and clients at no cost and with no commitment in the hopes that you’ll think of us when it comes time for you to list the home and you’re looking to get top dollar on the sale.

We’ll come out to your house, take a thorough look around, and take detailed notes. After we learn as much as we can about your home, we’ll take our data and schedule the next meeting at our office.

In this second meeting, we’ll review the value that we came up with for the home. We’ll walk you through the process step by step, including what homes we used to compare yours with and all the features of your home that add or decrease its value. You’ll walk away with our determination of what the market value of your home actually is. The market moves quickly, however, so the analysis is only accurate for a month or two.

“Determining home value is pretty straightforward for us.”

The final step is the execution of paperwork, where we have you sign a listing agreement and provide you with a bunch of important documents. It usually takes about seven to 10 days to get the home on the market after this. In the meantime, we’ll schedule a professional photographer to come out and take pictures of the home, and write up a detailed MLS report for when the time comes to list.That’s our three-step process that has worked pretty well for us in the past. If you’re thinking about selling your home or you’re just curious about what it might be worth in the market, feel free to reach out to us and request your free CMA. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <title>Tips for Being a Prepared Buyer in a Seller's Market</title>

As a buyer, navigating a seller’s market can seem like a daunting task. However, there are a few key tips you can use in order to be a prepared buyer in a seller’s market.

First of all, get pre-qualified. This is a critical step. I’d be more than happy to help connect you with a reputable lender who will talk you through the different available loan products. Understanding the different loans that are available can give you a better idea of what will work best for your individual circumstances.

Do keep in mind, though, to not deviate too much in your spending habits during your qualification period. Large purchases, like a new car, or purchases outside of your routine can vastly influence the outcome of the qualification period.

Your lender will qualify you at the uppermost level you can afford based on your debt and income, but take care to also alert them of your comfort level. You should always be comfortable with what you’re going to be spending. This is an extremely important factor.

“Being ready to seize opportunities as they come will be critical to your success.”

The next thing to do in order to be a prepared buyer is to meet with an agent, like myself, to perform a search on the MLS—the multiple listing service. With the MLS search, you’ll be notified of updates more quickly than you would be by other websites, such as Realtor.com, Zillow, or Trulia.

The search will be based on what you want and need in a home. However, if you’re notified of a home that fits your criteria, you’ll need to move quickly. A well-priced, good-quality home will not last long on today’s competitive market. Staying alert and being ready to seize opportunities as they come will be critical to your success.

Thirdly, understanding the offer and contract process ahead of time will greatly help you to feel and be prepared as a buyer. Items such as the deposit money, inspections, financing contingency and appraisal contingency, as well other important items are all key to this process.

These are the kinds of things I review in detail with buyers in order to help them to compete in a seller’s market. Competitive offers are a common thing in this kind of market. In situations where your offer is up against others, you should always put your best foot forward.

If you do have a home to sell, be aware of its value. My team and I can help you by setting up a comparative market analysis notification. Finally, if you are leasing your property, make sure your landlord has ample notice of your move.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Are we in a buyer’s market or a seller’s market?

Right now, we are definitely in a seller’s market. The combination of low inventory and very high demand means that the market certainly favors sellers.

Since we are so short on inventory, home prices are on the rise. Buyers don’t have many options to choose from, so sellers can demand a slightly higher price for their home. Compared to this time last year, both the average and median home prices have gone up slightly.
“Low inventory and high demand place us firmly in a seller’s market.”
How do interest rates come into play in this market? If you have average credit, interest rates range from 3.875% to 4.25% depending on which program you go with: a VA, FHA, USDA, or conventional loan.

So, what does all of this mean for you?

If you are buying a home, you have to be prepared to act quickly. Make sure that you are pre-qualified and familiar with the inventory that is available.

As a seller, you can demand a slightly higher price this year than you could have last year.

If you have any other questions about this current market, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
