        <description>

What’s the biggest obstacle to homeownership?

According to a recent survey, “saving enough for a down payment” comes at the top of the list. A whopping 55% of prospective homebuyers cited this as their main stumbling block. With the continuing growth of home prices, things aren’t getting any easier. In fact, homeownership rates reached a 20-year low last November.

It wasn’t always like this. A decade ago, many lenders were offering easy, no-money-down mortgages. However, after the financial crisis, mortgage standards have become more restrictive. A typical mortgage now requires a 20% down payment. 

Here’s the good news. If you have decent credit and a steady income, you might be qualified for a number of specialized programs that require no or very little down payment. Here are a few of the top options.

First, there’s the USDA loan, which is valid for homes in certain regions, such as rural and suburban areas. With zero money down and lenient credit requirements, the USDA loan can be a great choice for many homeowners. 

Second, there’s the VA loan, which you can apply for if you or your spouse served in a branch of the military. It’s possibly the most generous zero-money-down mortgage because of low interest rates and low closing costs.

Third, there’s the FHA loan. It does require a 3.5% down payment — still drastically more achievable than the 20% required for a conventional mortgage. 

Finally, there are a number credit unions and first-time homebuyer programs that might apply to your particular situation.

“There are many ways to make owning a home a reality.”
There’s one important thing you should know. If you get one of these no-money-down mortgages, chances are good you will be required to pay private mortgage insurance, which can drive up your monthly payments.

Fortunately, private mortgage insurance will disappear after your mortgage balance is under 80%. Also, the money you do pay will be tax deductible in most cases. In short, there are lots of options to make owning a home a reality for you, even if you haven’t saved up tens of thousands of dollars.

If you have a pet and you’re looking to sell your home, we have some helpful advice for you.

The good news is, many homebuyers are looking for a pet-friendly home. Two out of three of us have a pet, and 61% of pet owners say they have trouble finding a home that is a good match for their pet.

In fact, a recent survey estimates that 31% of animal owners frequently don’t put in an offer because a home would not suit their pet. This means that if your home is a good match for a pet, it will be attractive to a large pool of dedicated animal owners.

On the other hand, 67% of Realtors also estimate that actually having a pet in your home can make it harder for you to sell. So what can you do? Here are three things I typically recommend:

1. Repair any damage. Floors, walls, doors, the yard — these are some typical areas that pets love to chew, scratch, and dig up. Repairing this damage is an investment that will pay for itself many times over in terms of a higher selling price.

2. Get a professional to remove pet odors. Many pet owners are less sensitive to odors in their home than prospective buyers will be. That’s why you should hire a professional cleaning crew to clean any carpets, rugs, or upholstery that have absorbed pet odors. Once you’re done with the cleaning, ask a friend or your Realtor for a sniff assessment to make sure the job is really complete.

3. Take your pet out during showings. Some people are afraid of animals. Others are allergic. And regardless of the time, money, and effort you’ve put in to clean and repair your home, many buyers will be prejudiced by knowing that a pet currently lives there. That’s why I recommend taking your pet out during showings and also removing any pet objects such as toys, food bowls, or scratching posts.

“The good news is that many buyers want a pet-friendly home.”

By following these three simple guidelines, you will be able to sell your home for top dollar, whether the buyer is a pet owner or not.

And in case you have any questions or concerns about preparing your home for a sale, give me a call. I’m here to help. In the meantime, have a great day, from all of us at Teixeira Realty Group.

Mortgage interest rates are one of the hottest topics with homebuyers right now. Many buyers are currently wondering whether they should wait for interest rates to go back down, but they are only expected to go up. The Federal Reserve has already increased rates and signaled that there are more increases to come.

The days of 3% interest rates are gone right now, but the good news is that rates are still at historic lows at about 4% currently. Here’s an example of why it’s smart to buy now and lock in a low rate rather than waiting six months or a year. 

For a $250,000 house under current rates, your principal and interest payments would be about $1,189 a month. Conservatively estimating that the house will appreciate 5%, waiting a year would mean the same house would cost about $262,500. If interest rates went up 0.5% this year as expected, the same house would cost you an additional $136 a month.

“Both values and interest rates could tick up if you wait to buy a home.”

If you’re selling your house, remember that as rates tick up, the buyer pool for your home shrinks since fewer people will qualify for your home at an increased price. If a buyer’s income doesn’t go up, they might be priced out of that house.

Buying a home sooner also means you will start building equity sooner in addition to getting it cheaper. There’s really no reason to wait and watch interest rates and home values continue to go up.

        <title>What You Need to Know About the Mortgage Lending Process</title>

        <description>

If you’re thinking about buying a home, your first step before actually looking at homes should be to understand the mortgage lending process. 

To help me broach this topic, I’m joined for the very first time today by my preferred lender, Trever Kerr of Gateway Mortgage. Trever has been in the business for 15 years, and I’ve been working with him for over 10 years. He’s the only lender I refer to my clients, and Gateway Mortgage makes many exceptions for their clients that other lenders can’t. 

The first part of the mortgage lending process is to find out whether you qualify for a loan. If you don’t qualify, your lender can tell you what you need to do to get qualified down the road. In addition to knowing what you qualify for, you also have to work with your lender to know what your comfort level is as far as what your monthly payments will be. Even though you might qualify for a $300,000 home, you might only want payments on a $200,000 home. 

If you don’t speak to a lender, you won’t know what your roadmap to homeownership is. Some people think they can qualify when they can’t, while others think they can’t qualify when they actually can. These people do the wrong things for their credit thinking they’re doing the right things, like paying off their collections once they think they’ll purchase a house soon. Trever and I both see this happen all the time. 

“If you don’t speak to a lender, you won’t know what your roadmap to homeownership is.”

Paying credit repair companies to help you fix your credit score isn’t necessarily the best idea, either. Many of these companies end up doing things that hurt their customers. To be clear, I’m not bashing the credit repair industry as a whole. There’s a place for it for some people, but overall, a lot of it is unnecessary, especially when you can call an expert like Trever and get his advice for free. 

Your loan qualification guidelines in our current market can depend on the type of loan product you intend to get, but you can generally qualify with a credit score as low as 600. If you don’t have the cash for the down payment and closing costs, there are different gift programs available for first-time homebuyers. 

Lastly, your debt-to-income ratio must also be in line. As a general rule of thumb, a debt-to-income ratio for the purchase of a home should be 35% of your total gross income before taxes. The second part of that ratio is the 45% of your total gross income you’re allowed to use to cover your house payment, taxes, insurance, and other bills.

I want to thank Trever for helping me today. Stay tuned for more videos featuring both Trever and I where we’ll talk more in depth about credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, and other facets of the lending process. If you have any questions for him, you can call him at (972) 822-7408 or email him at Trever.Kerr@gatewayloan.com. 

If you have any questions for me, please feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to help you.

If you’re thinking of selling your home, you need to immediately start preparing your neighbors. Here’s what I mean.

Home appraisals are 5% to 10% lower if you have a so-called “bad” neighbor with an unkempt yard or poorly maintained exterior. That shouldn’t be surprising when you consider that 63% of homebuyers drive by a home before coming for a showing. Make no mistake—these potential buyers won’t just be impacted by the exterior of your home, but by the state of your neighborhood as well.

On the other hand, your neighbors can also be your best friends in selling your home. They can provide you with free advertising, they can promote the neighborhood to inquiring buyers, and they might even actively work with you to help you achieve a higher price.

Here are three tips on working with your neighbors to achieve a faster, more profitable sale.

First, set up a special open house just for your neighbors. Many neighbors will be curious for a peek inside your home. You can make the deal even more enticing by providing some free snacks and drinks. Use this open house as an opportunity to show off your home, as well as to build better relationships with your neighbors so they’ll be more inclined to help you during the sale process.

One way to do this is to be forthcoming with information, including the price you’re aiming for, renovations you’re planning, or showings that might eat up local parking for an afternoon. Get your neighbors involved, ask them for suggestions, and ask them how you can make the process easier for them.

“Your neighbors can be your best friends when selling your house.”

Also, don’t forget to mention that if you are successful in selling your home, this will positively impact the values of all homes in the neighborhood.

Second, organize a neighborhood cleanup party. This is an opportunity to boost the image and value of your entire neighborhood, as well as to further cement good relations with your neighbors. You can also use this as a discreet way to suggest small home improvement projects to your neighbors. Which leads me to the third and final tip.

You can also offer to help with—or even pay for—any upgrades you’d like to see on your neighbors’ homes. For example, if you’re having a landscaping crew come as part of your sale preparations, ask your neighbors with the overgrown lawn if they’d be ok with the landscapers also taking care of their yard for free. These kinds of small investments can be worth thousands of dollars in terms of your final sale price.

If you want to get an estimate of what your home is currently worth without any of these upgrades or you need more advice on dealing with your neighbors in preparation for a home sale, just give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help you.

If you bought your first home in 2016, then you are in for a very new tax experience this year. Why? After you buy a house, it makes sense to itemize your taxes. 

The good news is that itemizing your taxes is surprisingly easy to do. There are a few things you need to keep in mind in order to save the most on taxes while minimizing your filing headaches. 

First of all, you need to locate your closing disclosure agreement. This is part of your closing paperwork provided by your lender. Then, you can add up the four main real estate deductions: 


  Loan costs and fees: These are the different fees from your lender spread throughout the closing disclosure agreement. Different lenders will call them by different names, so look for terms like “application fee,” “underwriting fee,” and “loan cost.
  Mortgage interest: You can deduct the entire interest portion of your mortgage payments. This will probably be your biggest deduction, especially at the start of your mortgage when interest rates are highest.
  Property taxes: You can deduct property taxes for the part of the year in which you owned the home. Amazingly, you can claim this deduction even if you managed to negotiate for the seller to pay the full year’s property taxes.
  Mortgage insurance: If you put less than 20% down when you bought the house, you probably have to pay private mortgage insurance. The good news is that PMI is tax deductible. Keep in mind that private mortgage insurance is completely different from homeowners insurance, which is not deductible.


“You can deduct the entire interest portion from your monthly mortgage payments.”

There are a few other items that you might be able to itemize when filing your taxes. For example, if you gave away furniture or appliances before moving in, those items can be deducted as a charitable donation. If you work from home, then you can claim additional deductions from that. 

The standard deduction for individuals is $6,300 while the standard deduction for married couples is $12,600. If your total is less than the standard deduction, then congratulations; you will save more money this year by itemizing your taxes. 

Although most of these tips are for new homeowners, other homeowners can also save money by itemizing their taxes. If you have any questions about filing taxes as a homeowner, or if you would like to know more about becoming a homeowner in 2017, give us a call. We would be happy to help you!

        <description>

If you’re concerned about the recent rise in mortgage rates, I want to reassure you—things are much better than they might seem.

Yes, mortgage rates have certainly risen. From a low of 3.44% last August, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate reached 4.12% recently.

This increase means that if you took out a 30-year mortgage on a $250,000 home, you’d pay almost $100 more each month. Your overall mortgage cost would be almost $35,000 higher. That’s a sizeable change, and it’s got some people nervous about a possible slowdown in the real estate market.

However, the current rise in rates is unlikely to affect the real estate market any time soon. The rates we saw last year were an all-time record low. Historically, rates have been far higher.

Ten years ago, the same 30-year mortgage rate stood at 6.34%. For much of the 90s, rates hovered between 7% and 10%. Throughout the 80s, average annual rates never dipped below 10%. In 1982, they were as high as 16%. When viewed in this context, it’s clear that current mortgage rates are still very low, and that the real estate market is actually in a very good place.

So what does this mean for you?

First, if you are looking to buy a home, the current low rates offer a great opportunity to afford an amazing home. Second, if you’re looking to sell your home, you are in a great position to do so quickly and at top price.

“The current rise in rates is unlikely to affect the real estate market any time soon.”

Last December saw a drop in home sales, but not because of any rise in mortgage rates. Instead, this slowdown was due to a constrained supply of new homes. In fact, there are plenty of eager buyers around Mansfield and prices continue to rise.

If you want to discuss upcoming trends in mortgage rates and how they could affect you—whether you’re buying or selling a house—give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help however I can.

        <description>

Have you heard the news?

The new administration is looking to revamp the tax code in a way that affects the long-standing mortgage interest deduction (MID). Some people are concerned this might impact home sales and drive down home values. 

I believe it will do just the opposite. 

First — a bit of background. Under the current system, you can include the interest you pay on your mortgage in your itemized tax deductions. If your itemized deductions turn out to be more than your standard deduction, you save more on taxes. 

Currently, about 20% of homeowners who have a mortgage take advantage of the MID for an annual average savings of $2,000 in taxes. Under the proposed new tax plan, the standard tax deduction would almost double. For example, the standard deduction for a married couple would go from $12,600 to $24,000. 

If this happens, an estimated 84% of people who currently itemize taxes would simply go for the standard deduction, and this is the part that has some people worried. After all, if people don’t take advantage of the MID, won’t this decrease the value of owning a home?

Here are two reasons why that won’t happen. 

First, most people do not buy a home in order to save on taxes. A survey from 2015 confirms this fact. The top reasons why people buy a home include the need for change, an increase in income, or a baby on the way, but there’s no mention of saving on taxes. This bears out what most real estate professionals see in real life. 

“People don’t buy a home just to save on taxes.”

Second, taxes will actually be lower under the proposed new plan. Traditional estimates of the impact of the MID assume other taxes stay the same. In this case, if the deduction goes away, home prices can indeed suffer to an extent. 

But under the proposed new plan, the overall tax burden will be less than it currently is. 

In other words, most people will not lose money because they aren’t claiming the MID. Instead, they will gain money by paying less in taxes altogether. 

With more disposable income, people will be free to spend more on a home. This will drive sales as well as prices. The fact is, current home prices around Mansfield keep increasing — not because of tax breaks, but because of tight supply. 

If you have any questions about the new tax plan and how it will affect the real estate market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in the Mansfield area, give us a call or send us an email. We’re always happy to help!

        <description>

Is listing your home in the winter a good idea? The answer is yes, and here’s why.

Homes listed during the winter are 9% more likely to sell than homes listed during the other seasons. These properties, on average, sell a week faster, sell for 1.2% more than their list price, and are more likely to sell above asking price than the homes listed in summer or fall.

If you’re surprised by these statistics, you’re not alone. Conventional real estate wisdom says to pass on the winter market and wait for the spring. However, as you can see from the numbers, passing on the winter market would be a mistake.

It’s true that there are less buyers in the winter, but that isn’t necessarily a problem as buyers during the winter are more motivated. Some of them might need to get into a new home for a job relocation, some might want to take advantage of low interest rates before another increase occurs, and some have been searching for months with no luck in finding their dream home.

“Homes listed during the winter sell a week faster than those listed during the other seasons.”

If you are looking to sell your home, I would definitely recommend selling in the winter. However, keep in mind that the winter market is a whole different ballgame. For example, you really need to list your home as close to market value as possible because an overpriced home causes low buyer interest and strips away time for any price reductions.

If you would like to know the current value of your home, get advice on how to prepare your home for the winter market, or if you have any other real estate related questions, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help!

        <description>

With regards to how our market has fared since the election, there is some good news and some bad news.

First, the bad: mortgage rates have shot up since the election.

From a low of 3.74% on November 7th, the average fixed 30-year mortgage rate increased to over 4% by the end of November.

Economists are saying this kind of volatility is likely to continue, with day-to-day changes driven by the moves and statements of the new administration.

The good news is that there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic down the line.

Promised tax breaks for high earners could reinvigorate sales of luxury homes, which have seen a glut lately.

This could have a ripple effect throughout the rest of the real estate market, spurring sales and construction of mid-level and lower-priced housing.

Also, looser financial regulation could make it easier for buyers to obtain mortgages.

One piece of good news is that the election is finally over. Also, you might have seen that the stock market has been surging in the past few weeks.

“More people are entering the market now that the election is over.”

That might be a vote of confidence for our President and his anticipated business-friendly policies.

It certainly seems things are getting back to normal as people come to realize the world’s not ending.

In fact, many people who were waiting on the sidelines while the election was going on are now entering the real estate market.

It’s a great time to take advantage of this if you are selling.

If you want an idea of what your home could sell for in the current market, just send me an email to myhomesvalue@jteixsells.com with your address in the subject line and I’ll get back to you.

And if you’re looking to buy, there are two things you should know.

First, even though mortgage rates have gone up, they are still historically very low, and worth taking advantage of.

Second, many new homes have entered the market since the election, and more new listings will arrive as the spring market approaches.

It’s definitely worth investigating what’s available around DFW right now.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email.  We look forward to hearing from you.

        <title>Are We in the Midst of Another Housing Bubble?</title>

        <description>

In June of this year, home prices rose for the 50th straight month. Nationwide, current home prices are only about 1% below record highs from 2006, which was the beginning of the housing crisis. At the same time, mortgage rates are trending lower and lower. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is now just 3.49%, which is only a few points above the all-time low of 3.31%.

When you put these two factors together, many people are wondering the same thing: Are we in the middle of a new housing bubble? 

The rising home prices over the passover years is undeniable, as are the low mortgage rates. However, the situation today is very different from the housing bubble that happened 10 years ago. 

Why?

First,** lending has been cleaned up**. The risky mortgages that fueled the housing bubble a decade ago aren’t happening today because of new laws like the Dodd-Frank Act. In fact, the stricter regulations surrounding lending is one of the reasons why mortgage rates are so low right now. Since banks have tighter criteria for the lenders they approve, they can afford to lend money at a lower rate.

“The situation today is very different than that of 10 years ago.”

Second, the current level of new home construction is below historical averages and is only a fraction of the level of 2006. This is the opposite of what you’d expect in a bubble. Home builders are simply not finding it profitable to build new housing right now. This shortage also explains the high prices that existing homes are selling for. 

In other words, demand is higher than supply right now. This means that it’s a great time to sell. If you’re curious about your current home value, send us an email at myhomesvalue@jtextsells.com. Put your address in that email and we’ll respond with its current market value.

The big housing crisis of 10 years ago was set of by speculation and loose borrowing. We’re not seeing either of those things right now. Instead, what we’re seeing is a shortage of certain kinds of homes on the market, which has increased the level of home prices. However, thanks to the lower mortgage rates, those homes are actually affordable. 

If you’re thinking about selling your home or buying a new one, just give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to help!

        <description>

If you have been thinking about trading up to your dream home, now is an excellent time. 

Builders have been focusing on new high-level homes, and investors have been turning mid-level, lower cost homes into rentals, causing the number of available mid-level, low priced homes to decline 40% in the last four years. 

This has caused a shortage of mid-level, low cost homes. 

The shortage is fantastic news for you as a seller. It means you will be able to sell your home more quickly. This summer, the typical home stayed on the market for just 17 days, and 64% of homes sold in less than a month. It also means you can sell your home for more in the current market. Prices are higher now than a year ago, and many sellers are getting more than the asking price. 

“You could get above asking price for your home.”

Because the shortage of homes doesn’t apply to high level dream homes, you have a fantastic chance to sell your home above asking price and buy your new dream home for a steal. 

If you have other questions about how to get your dream home, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        <description>

Are Fed Rates going up?

Over the past few months, we’ve been hearing about a possible rate increase from the Federal Reserve. First, experts were predicting that the Fed would raise interest rates in September.

That didn’t happen. Now we’re being told rates will go up in mid-December… we just don’t know by how much.

All this uncertainty is making people very uncomfortable.

Because of the uncertainty, news outlets are parsing every word Fed members are saying, and everyone is wondering: Will there be a rate increase? Will mortgage rates increase as well? What will happen to the real estate market?

My personal opinion is this: the moves by the Fed are nothing to worry about. I think it’s simply another case of people getting nervous while waiting for the test results.

In fact, I believe that an increase in the Fed Rate will have minimal impact on the real estate market in Mansfield for three reasons.

First, mortgage rates often move independently of the Fed Rate. An increase in the Fed Rate might actually lead to a decrease in mortgage rates — this is exactly what happened the last time the Fed increased rates, back in December of 2015.

Second, the likely rate increase will be small, probably 0.25%. If mortgage rates were to increase by the same amount, they would still would be at historically low levels.

Third, we know the members of the Fed are concerned with the shortage of new housing right now — it’s right there in their September meeting notes. Because of this, any actions they take will keep the real estate market in mind.  

In short: the real estate market is doing great right now—and it’s likely to stay that way, with or without a Fed Rate increase. 

“The real estate market looks great right now.”

Right now, if you’re selling, you can benefit from stable prices and strong demand:

And if you’re buying, you can benefit from historically-low mortgage rates so you can afford a great home in Mansfield:

Many potential home sellers have been worried about the uncertainties in the housing market in the face of the upcoming presidential election.

A lot of them want to wait until the election is over to sell, but that would be a mistake. It’s a great time to sell right now because of all the advantages in the marketplace. Here are six reasons why you shouldn’t wait until after the election to sell:


  
    It doesn’t matter who the next president is. What I mean by this is that the world will continue to spin and people will continue to buy and sell real estate regardless of who is elected to office.
  
  Real estate will still be one of the best ways to build wealth. Again, this is true no matter who wins the election. Real estate is always going to be one of the wisest investments to make.
“No matter who wins, the world will keep turning.”
  
    Inventory will continue to constrict because of uncertainty. Most people will decide to take their homes off the market until after the election. This will help you stand out more if you list your home right now. There is a higher concentration of serious buyers in the market who will see your home.
  
  
    Serious buyers want to move before the holidays. A lot of buyers in the market right now have been looking for months. Many weren’t able to get a home in the highly competitive market this spring and summer, so they have a sense of urgency in wanting to get a deal done.
  
  
    Many relocation buyers are looking now. Most corporate relocations take place at the beginning of the year. The families that are being relocated are looking for homes right now and checking out the areas that they want to live in. This is another pool of buyers that will see your home stand out.
  
  Interest rates are at historic lows. You’re probably sick of hearing it at this point, but it’s still true. Interest rates can only go up now, and we want you to be able to capture the buyers that are out there right now.


If you have any questions for us or are interested in buying or selling a home, we would love to hear from you. It’s a good time to make a move right now.

        <title>Why Mortgage Rates Are So Low Right Now</title>

It’s not very nice to profit from your neighbors’ troubles. Sometimes, though, there’s simply nothing you can do to stop it.

At the beginning of the summer, as I’m sure you have heard, the UK voted to leave the EU. This became known as “Brexit,” and it has created heaps of uncertainty and worry for our neighbors across the Atlantic.

Here in the U.S., though, Brexit has been nothing but good news for the real estate market. Because of Brexit, investors all over the world wanted a safer place to invest, and this pushed already low mortgage rates down even further to almost unseen lows.

In fact, we are now in the middle of the second-longest run of cheap mortgage rates in history. The 30-year fixed rate mortgage is 3.46%; this is only a few points above its all-time low of 3.31%.

What does this mean for you?

First, if you are looking to buy a home, now is an unusually good time to do so because these low rates mean you will be paying less. As an example, taking out a 30-year, $250,000 mortgage today versus a year ago (when the rate was 3.91%) would mean that you would save more than $25,000 over the lifetime of the loan.

The other way to look at it is that at today’s rates, you can afford a more luxurious home without paying more. For example, if you were to take out a 30-year mortgage, you could now afford $15,000 more for a home than a year ago while keeping the same monthly payments.

Clearly, this is a great opportunity.
“Here in the U.S., Brexit has been nothing but good news for mrtgage rates.”
Now, if you are looking to sell rather than buy, these low rates also benefit you big time. The more the mortgage rates drop, the more buyers there are, and the greater the demand is for homes.

This healthy demand keeps up the price of your home and ensures your home will get sold quickly. Not surprisingly, pending home sales are up by 1.3% this summer and are now at the second-highest level in over a decade.

As you can imagine, these ultra-low mortgage rates won’t last forever and will rise sooner or later.

If you are looking to take advantage of this unique situation while it lasts, give me a call or send me an email. I’m always here to help.

        <title>Fall Is a Great Time to Sell in Mansfield</title>
        <link>http://jtexvideoblog.com/why-fall-is-great-time-to-sell-home-25.html</link>

        <description>

Today I wanted to talk about why the fall is such a great time to sell your home.

Sometimes, it really pays to go against the crowd.

As you probably know, spring is the season when most people around Mansfield put their homes on the market. Summer is the high season, and it’s when most homes get sold. And yet, there are a few powerful reasons why fall might actually be a better time than either spring or summer to sell your home.

It makes perfect sense when you think about it.

By the fall, the bulk of spring listings are expiring. As a result, there is less competition, particularly when you consider the NEW label and the fewer days on the market that your listing will boast. Also, home buyers in the fall are more serious. They have been looking at listings for months, and they are eager to conclude their search and move in comfortably before the holidays.

“It makes perfect sense when you think about it.”

When you put those two things together, you get that homes listed in the fall sell more quickly and often command a higher price. In fact, fall is the season with the highest percentage of sold listings, beating out summer by 1%.

Now, if you are thinking of selling your home this fall, there are a few things you have to do differently.

First, you have to prepare your home to account for the particular fall conditions. For example, you need to check the HVAC system and replace your furnace filter so your home will be warm and smell fresh. Also, make sure to turn on all the lights; you’ve got to compensate for the shorter, cloudier days. Cleaning up the yard is also a must.

The second thing you need to do is price your home appropriately. To get started, check out the value calculator I created that takes into account recent Mansfield sales to give you an idea of what your home is worth right now.

Once you have an idea of what your home is worth, how should you price it? On the one hand, the fall is not a good time to start with a sky-high price. If you don’t sell right away, you might not have time to adjust the price because of the smaller number of buyers and the shorter selling period (nobody wants to move over Christmas).

On the other hand, those serious buyers I mentioned earlier might be willing to pay more simply because they’ve been looking longer and are more eager to buy.

It’s a balancing act. It’s also something I can definitely help you with. Give me a call if you are considering selling this fall, and I’ll give you my recommendations on how to price your home based on current conditions in Mansfield.

        <title>Which Updates Will Help Sell Your Mansfield Home? </title>

        <description>

If you are considering selling your home in the near future, you are probably planning on making a few renovations. However, some renovations are more appealing to buyers than others.

These improvements will actually deter buyers when it comes time to sell your home:


  Too much wallpaper. Buyers don’t want to tear down a bunch of wallpaper in order to paint; they want the walls ready for painting when they move in.
  Lavish lighting fixtures. You might have a different sense of style than the buyers, so keep it simple when it comes to the lighting fixtures.
  Textured walls, wall coverings, and ceilings. Many times, people think they are adding value with different DIY textures when, really, they put up too much. You should also avoid murals, permanent wall coverings, or cute ceiling decals that may damage the walls.
  The wrong kind of flooring. Flooring is expensive to replace and the wrong kind of flooring will be detrimental to your home sale. Buyers want plain, neutral decor when they move in.
  Too much carpet. Carpet holds dirt and shows traffic patterns. Most buyers do not want to see that everywhere.
  Bold wall colors. Remember, bright, loud colors are bad; neutral, soft colors are good.
  
    Swimming pools and hot tubs. You may enjoy a pool or hot tub but most buyers don’t want to deal with or pay for the maintenance.
“Keep the decor light, soft, and neutral.”
That said, other renovations will add value to your home and net you more money when it comes time to sell. The top four renovations to make when selling your home are:
  
  Renovating your kitchen. Buyers love to see updated kitchens. However, keep in mind that if you spend more than $20,000 on the renovation, you’re not likely to get all of that money back.
  Bathroom renovations. Everyone likes to have a large, luxurious master bathroom, and buyers will pay extra for an updated bathroom.
  New flooring. You probably can’t clean your carpet well enough to make people think that it’s new; instead, bring in new carpeting or tile. New flooring is a great way to add value and that new carpet smell will give buyers peace of mind.
  Curb appeal. When buyers drive past your home, you need to make sure your property makes a good first impression. Plant flowers, trim bushes, and pull weeds. The more organized and orderly your lawn is, the more appealing your home will be to buyers.


Now, this one is not on the list, but it’s incredibly important not to forget the backyard.

People want to see a yard that they can entertain friends in. A cluttered and unkempt backyard tells the buyer that you don’t take care of your home; a well-cared for backyard with trimmed trees, weeded flower beds, and trimmed grass tells buyers the opposite.

If you have any questions about getting your home ready for the market or about real estate in general, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

        <title>8 Inexpensive Tips to Add Value to Your Bathroom</title>

It’s commonly known that kitchens and bathrooms sell homes. Making improvements to your bathroom, therefore, is one of the best ways to create value to your home if you’re considering selling in the future. Here are eight inexpensive ways to do just that:


  Paint: As is the case with any room in the house, painting is the best way to update your bathroom. Due to the room’s small space, it’s important to use a neutral color.
  Paint the vanity mirror. If nothing else needs to be painted, you might consider painting the vanity mirror to contrast the rest of the room.
  Replace the vanity mirror.
  Update the flooring. Stay away from carpet and laminate floors. If you’re going to do it yourself, there are some great products out there with vinyl flooring that are easy enough to install, but please at least consider hiring a professional for the job. Adding a rug can also accent the room well.
  Change the showerhead. If you haven’t modernized the showerhead in some time, go down to your local home improvement store and consider the variety of inexpensive options you can choose from.
  Add shelving. If there is any place to add shelving, especially if there is storage needed, don’t hesitate to do so. It’s a nice place to put colorful towels, baskets, and other accents to the room as a whole.
  Cover any problem walls. If you have areas on any wall that are showing past damage, or or just have too many white walls, find a solution for them. Even if you have to hire a contractor to come out and retexture, it will be worth it.
  Change the lighting. Much like the showerheads, you have a surplus of options in how you would like to replace and update your bathroom’s lighting fixtures. Make sure you choose the right bulbs so the light works well with however much natural light you have coming in already.


If you have any questions, or have plans to buy or sell a home in the near future, please don’t hesitate to give us a call or send an email.

The latest numbers are in for the Mansfield real estate market, so we wanted to share them with you. We’ll compare them to the figures we saw at this time last year to show how the market has changed in the past year.

The median house price in Mansfield has remained the same since June 2015 at $247,500. When we look at homes that were listed on the market, 25% of homes were listed under $200,000, 72% of homes were listed between $200,000 and $500,000. The rest of them were over $500,000.
“Demand is strong in our market.”
Active listings in Mansfield are down 12.3% from last year, which doesn’t help our inventory problem. Despite that, the number of homes sold is up 21.7% over last year, which shows strong demand in our market.
DEMAND IS STRONG IN OUR MARKET.
Our average days on market are 26 days, six days fewer than last year. We have only 1.8 months of inventory, down from 2.3 months last year.

If you have any questions for us or are considering buying or selling a home, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help in any way we can.

We’re very excited to talk about a special home that has just been listed on the market. The home is located at 9321 Marble Falls in the Southwind subdivision in the southernmost part of Arlington. At 2,230 sq. ft. with four bedrooms, granite counters, and wood floors, this home has just been put on the market for $240,000. The home’s owner, Carol, is here today to discuss her home, why she’s selling, and why she will be sad to leave it.

Carol is actually the original owner of the home, and had it built on-site just over nine years ago. The most important part of the build, to her, was making sure there was plenty of room for family and friends to feel welcome and invited. The open floor plan has helped her achieve this and as recently as two weeks ago, Carol was able to seat 40 people for dinner.

“Southwind is a friendly and quiet community.”

The master bedroom in the home is large enough to have its own living room, and Carol has even been able to do workout programs like P90x in it without running out of space. The dining room comfortably holds 10 seats, with another eight spots in the kitchen, and four more at the bar.

The community of Southwind is very unique. All the schools in the area are within a 5-10 minute drive, and Carol describes the community as “very friendly and very quiet.” This is never more evident than when looking at the backyard. This home’s backyard opens up to a green space with hiking and running trails, with a creek bed on the opposite side.

Although Carol is selling because she is semi-retired and choosing to move out to her lake house, she’s sad to see this home go. She’s been very happy with her energy bills at this home, mostly because she had the builder put a radiant barrier on it.

We really appreciate Carol taking time out of her day to join us and talk about her beautiful home. If you have any questions for us or if you’d like to see the home in person, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you!

Today I’m with a sponsor for the Mansfield Shootout, Dr. Bobbit with Mansfield Chiropractic. Dr. Bobbit loves to help out the community, and he is eager to help us, as all of our donations will go to Habitat for Humanity to help build homes for those in need.

Dr. Bobbit’s desire to help people has guided him throughout his life, and that’s why he now owns his own chiropractic clinic. He is dedicated to helping people through a natural process. One of his recent innovations has to do with spinal decompression, but he also offers massages, chiropractic work, and nutritional advice.
“We’re still looking for sponsors!”
Last but not least, we are still looking for sponsors for our event. For just $100 we will put your business’ sign on one of eight shooting greens. It’s a great way to get your business seen.

Also, if you’ve never shot a gun, this tournament is a great place to start. The event will be taking place on June 18th at the Alpine Shooting Range at 5482 Shelby Rd. in Fort Worth. It’s $100 for one shooter or $385 for four. All proceeds are going to benefit the Trinity Habitat for Humanity.

Setting the right sales price is incredibly important before you list your property. You don’t want to price your home too low or too high. Today, we’ll go over how to set your price so you can net the most money for your home.

The first step is to hire an experienced real estate agent who will provide market comparables in your neighborhood. You can see what homes like yours are selling for in the current market.

When you evaluate those comparables, you should price your home somewhere right in the middle. We are in a seller’s market, and by pricing your home in the middle, you will generate a lot of competition, showings, and offers for your home. Since so many people will want to buy your home, that competition will drive your home to the highest price you can get.
“Price your home right in the middle.”
A lot of people are tempted to price their home based off the highest priced comparable. Some people even think that, since prices are rising, they can price over what the highest comparable sold for. If you do that, you will price yourself out of the market. When buyers do their searches using price ranges, they will not even see your home.

Ultimately, price your home appropriately. Don’t go too high and you will wind up being at the top of the market in your neighborhood.

If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

Today, we’ll talk about buying a home with a professional inspection. What should you do in this particular situation in Mansfield?

As a local real estate expert, I always recommend a home inspection. Never buy a home without one! There are a lot of things inside a home an inspector can identity that you cannot. A private contractor will review all the systems in a home, including plumbing and electricity, in addition to checking appliances. There are so many aspects an inspector takes into account when they go through your property.

When you walk through your own home, you won’t be able to detect any problems. Some buyers have more expertise in building and repairing a home. However, the inspector you hire will definitely have that expertise, so you can fix repairs and add upgrades before you even accept an offer. They will always find more than you will just by looking. This is a serious and wise investment that I recommend to anyone selling their home.
“I always build in an option period for my buyers.”
I always build in an option period for my buyers. During this period, and inspection will happen along with any negotiations for potential repairs, and the contract can be terminated if necessary. I like to use a seven to ten day period, but ultimately, it’s for your protection. You want to be clear about what you want in the beginning, so there are no surprises later on.

If you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in the surrounding area, give me a call or send me an email at your earliest convenience. I’d be happy to help you with any questions you might have!

Today we are going to be discussing the current market here in Mansfield. A lot of people have been asking us about the market’s current stats, and we’re here to share an update with you.

Right now, we have roughly 130 active homes on the market and 160 pending listings. That gives us less than a one-month supply of homes! This low-inventory is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.

Coming out of the holiday and winter months, we have seen a huge rise in activity, going from 77 sold properties over the last 30 days, to the current 160 pending sales. This is typical of a normal yearly cycle. But what does it mean for buyers, sellers, and investors?

For buyers, there are still homes on the market, but you’re going to have to compete for the best homes. For every good home, we have 10 to 20 buyers looking at it. If you’re buying, you need to be pre-approved, have a real estate agent working hard for you, and be ready to act quickly when the right property comes up.

“We have 10 to 20 buyers looking at every good home.”

For sellers, you have to get the condition of your home right and price it right. If you do these things, you are in great position to sell your home for more money than you could in the past.

For investors, there is a lot of competition out there, just as there is for regular buyers. If you’re investing in this market, you need to align yourself with a great agent who understands your goals and can work with you to help you achieve them.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to hear from you!

        <title>Avoid These 4 Mistakes When Selling in Mansfield</title>

As an experienced Mansfield Realtor, I oftentimes identify common mistakes within the local marketplace. It’s mind-boggling! Today, we’ll review the four most common mistakes, so you can avoid them when selling your home.

The first mistake people make is trying to sell their home themselves. One of the biggest reasons to hire a real estate professional is they can market to a wider net of people than you can. You also have limited knowledge of the real estate market. Real estate agents are working in the market all day, every day. We have a level of real estate expertise that you cannot reach and learn on your own. We can help you negotiate contracts and sell for the most money. Don’t miss out on maximizing profit from your property!

The second mistake people make is overpricing their home. Everybody wants to get the most money they possibly can for their home. People have a tendency to think their home is worth  more than it actually is. A real estate agent will examine comparable sales in your area so you know what your home is worth in today’s market. By accurately pricing your home, you will sell faster and for more money than you would if your home was overpriced.

“Pricing your home correctly will net you more money!”

The third mistake is using poor quality photos. Just because your phone has a camera doesn’t mean you should use your iPhone to take pictures for the MLS! Professional photographs will make your home shine, and a real estate agent will make sure that the MLS does not distort the size of your photographs.

The final mistake is forgetting about the backyard. We all tend to focus on curb appeal and cleaning the interior of the home but run out of steam when it’s time to take care of the backyard. The backyard matters to buyers, so make sure you get everything neat and tidy.

If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <title>How Important Is the Age of a Home When Buying?</title>

Today, we’ll talk about the importance of the age of your home when buying. You may not want an older home because you are looking for a newer neighborhood, or you may prefer an older neighborhood with mature trees. Older homes also have different character than newer homes.

First, you need to know that the age of the home doesn’t affect its appreciation. You may find a neighborhood that is depreciating rapidly, but those neighborhoods are far and few between.

Next, any home you buy, you can upgrade. You may need to make changes for energy efficiency, layout, or other updates. I have seen older homes updated with new windows or roofs to make them more energy efficient. Sometimes making these upgrades yourself makes your property more energy efficient than new construction homes.
“You can change almost anything in a home, no matter how old.”
Regardless of the age of the home, you need to get an inspection. The inspector will be able to tell you about all the idiosyncrasies in the home so you have a clear idea of what’s going on with the house from the foundation to the roof.

My appeal to you is to go with what suits your personality. Don’t let the fact that a home is 50 years old keep you from buying it. The neighborhood should play a bigger factor in your decision than the age of the home.

If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!

Real estate is a fantastic way to build wealth. People have been doing it forever, and real estate investments are actually some of the best long-term investments that you can make.

One of the first steps you need to take is to own the home you live in. Once you pay off your mortgage, you’ll be in great position to invest in another property. Interest rates are incredibly low right now, so this would be a very good time to invest in a home.

If you’re worried about being in debt because of a new home purchase, I wouldn’t think about it too much. Mortgage debt is the only good debt that you can have. Homes do appreciate, so you can bank on that if you’re worried about stepping too deep into mortgage debt.
“Real Estate is the best long-term investment you can make.”
Equity can be built pretty quickly after you have purchased a home. It can take five or maybe six years, but after this you can ride a nice wave of appreciation.

If you don’t own a home, I would contact a lender and forge out a path for home-ownership. It’s an incredible way to stabilize your family’s financial future.

My partner, Trever Kerr, is an excellent lender in the area. You can call him at (972) 822-7408. He is extremely consultative, and he can show you exactly what you need to do in order to purchase a home.

If you own a home right now, I invite you to give me a call to talk about investing in more real estate. Interest rates are low right now, so waiting to buy will cut into your purchasing power significantly.

Please don’t hesitate to contact me in regard to Mansfield real estate. I look forward to speaking with you!

        <title>What's Happening with Mansfield's Inventory Levels?</title>

Lately, I’ve found myself explaining real estate inventory levels to many people. Our market is crazy right now, and it seems like there are 10 buyers for each house on the market. Guess what? That’s because there is! Right now, there is a supply and demand problem that primarily affects buyers. Essentially, that problem exists because we have not been fulfilling our industry inventory levels since 2008.

Before 2008, builders were putting up new homes constantly. Whenever you walked down a street, it seemed like there was a new subdivision. Builders were also putting up spec homes so that people who were unwilling to wait the six to eight months still had inventory to look at. For most of those buyers, the financing has not come around for them to do that anymore. Plus, many builders are still a little gun-shy, as they were stuck with extra inventory back in 2008.

On top of all of that, we have an entire generation of millennials entering the market and looking for starter homes. Our inventory just started approaching industry levels this year, and I don’t think the supply and demand issue will be neutral for another three to five years.
“Here in the South, we’re supplying 30% more than demand.”
It’s different all across the country. In the Northeast, they still aren’t building enough for demand. The West is barely getting there. Here in the South, we’re doing better than anybody else. We’re supplying about 30% more than demand. However, we still have a lot of catching up to do, and while we’re catching up, more and more buyers are coming onto the market.

If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to me. If you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, call or email me today for a free consultation.

Welcome back. Today we are asking one of the most common questions we get asked, “What is the first step in the real estate process in Mansfield?”

My answer is almost always the same. Unless you are paying cash, call a lender. It’s a really important step for us to know how we can help you and what you can afford. There are a lot of steps involved in the process and the more you can anticipate, the easier and more stress-free it will be.

Even if you’re not a first-time buyer, finding a good lender is still essential to your transaction. They will let you know exactly what you can afford and what type of home you can purchase.
“”
Lending guidelines are constantly changing, so it’s important you are working with someone who is always up to date on the latest changes. If you are looking for a good lender, we always recommend asking a good agent. If they are a good agent, they will have a preferred lending partner.

We have a lender that we refer all our clients to, and that is Trevor Kerr at Gateway Mortgage, who you can contact at (972)-822-7408. There is no one else I would refer my clients to.

If you have any questions for us, or are looking to buy or sell a home in Mansfield, give us a call or send us an email! We would love to hear from you!

There comes a point in time when people need to move into bigger, better homes. Whether it’s because of a growing family or simply a wish to invest in a better property, people do this all of the time.

Usually move up buyers have to find a home to move into before they can sell, and vice versa, so sometimes the transactions can get dicey. However, I have a lot of experience helping move up buyers, and there are a few things that can be done to have a seamless transaction.

My advice to you right now is to focus on the purchase because inventory is low right now, so selling your home will be the easy part.
“Focus on finding a home before selling.”
In a normal market, you could use contingencies to sell your home, but right now, because of the low inventory, this may not work.

Another option is to build a new home, so then you can have a slow move in and have plenty of time to sell your home.

If you’re interested in moving up, please contact me and ask about my move up discount. I’d love to help you out!

There are a lot of benefits to building a new home in Mansfield, especially right now when we have low inventory.

Instead of waiting around to find the perfect home, you could build your own custom dream home! However, it does take 4-8 months to build a home, so if you’re in a hurry, it may not be your ideal option.

When you buy a pre-owned home, it is a lot more cost-effective because you get a lot more home in terms of cost per sq. ft. New homes are often more expensive, but you have total control over the price when you’re picking materials and amenities.

“Building a new home requires a lot of time and money.”

However, sometimes with resale properties, the previous owners have already customized the home and barred the expense, so you have to pay nothing for those upgrades!

If you’re thinking of building a new home, I would advise you to use a Realtor when you’re working with a builder, and I would be glad to represent you.

As always, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact me in regards to Mansfield real estate.

Today I wanted to discuss some of the more popular neighborhoods in Mansfield. Now is a great time to buy, so these are some of the neighborhoods that you might want to investigate:


  The Trails
  Walnut Creek Country Club
  Dover Heights


A majority of the new building is occurring in the Lake Ridge High School District, but there are some other wonderful new communities forming in Garden Heights, Bower Ranch, Las Brisas, and the D.R. Horton neighborhood. I think a majority of the growth in Mansfield will be happening in the southeast corner for the near future.
“Mansfield is becoming a hot spot to live.”
In the future, I expect growth will happen more out to the west of town. The city is really beginning to manage development out in those areas.

Overall, Mansfield is becoming a hot spot to live, so if you plan on buying in the near future, please don’t hesitate to contact me and I can help you to find a great place to settle into.

I look forward to speaking with you!

The market here in Mansfield is extremely active and we’re seeing a lot of multiple offers happening. This is why I thought I would shed some light on this topic, as a lot of my clients have been asking about it. There are different strategies that buyers and sellers can take when faced with this problem, and I’m here to tell you about them.

“Sometimes the best offer is the one that has the highest likelihood of closing.”
The important thing to know as a buyer is that your competition will be fierce, but this doesn’t mean that you don’t stand a chance. Sometimes a personalized offer can help push you to the top of the list. Sellers are always more comfortable choosing a buyer that they can relate to, and one that they know will be taking good care of their home. Writing a note to them explaining why you want the property can help a lot, but I’ve also filmed videos with families, and that can be helpful too.

If you’re a seller in a multiple offer situation, it’s important to have patience as we expose your property to a large audience of buyers. When you do get multiple offers, you want to ensure that the offers are from pre-qualified buyers, because they’re serious about purchasing a home. Cash offers are also good, but you just want to see proof of funds. However, sometimes cash is not the most important, sometimes the best offer is the one that has the highest likelihood of closing. Every seller has a different motivation, so sometimes it’s also just a matter of what works f

People always ask me how the local real estate market is performing, and the answer always depends on whether you’re buying, selling, or investing.

If you’re a seller, you’ll find that now is a great time to put your home on the market. Buyer demand is high and inventory is low, so you stand to make a good profit if you get your home on the market now. Just remember, it needs to be priced correctly and in good condition.

If you’re looking to buy a home, now is also a good time to do so. Interest rates are at historic lows (below 4%) and there are a lot of excellent loan products available. It’s more affordable to buy a home right now than it has been in a very long time. It’s a lot cheaper to pay a mortgage right now than it is to pay monthly rent, so if you’ve thought about purchasing a home, then now may be the time to pull the trigger. This is also true because interest rates are currently on the rise, so your affordability may drop if you wait to buy.
“You have a really great opportunity to capitalize on a move-up home sale.”
Investors will have a little tougher time flipping homes, but rental rates are increasing so you may find comfort in that fact. I would recommend investing in rental homes over properties that you’re just going to flip.

Overall, inventory is extremely low in our area. If your home is worth more than $200K, there is only about 1 month supply of inventory. If your home is worth less than $200K then you will find that there is only 1-2 weeks worth of inventory. This means that you have a really great opportunity to capitalize on a move-up home sale.

If you’d like any assistance buying, selling, or investing in a new home, then please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would be very happy to assist you!
