If you’re planning on renovating your house before selling it, there are certain things you should do and certain things you shouldn’t do.

Here’s a rundown of some of the do’s and don’ts of home renovation if you’re getting ready to sell your home.

Don’t: Wait until you’re ready to sell to start renovating. This is one of the biggest mistakes sellers can make. Do yourself a favor and do your renovations while you live in the property so you can enjoy them. You’ll never be able to get a dollar-for-dollar return for them, so the best way to compensate for that is to use those renovations for your own personal enjoyment.

Do: Work on curb appeal. People tend to overlook this here in Alaska because it’s hard to manage curb appeal in February, but curb appeal is the No. 1 thing that draws people into a home. If they don’t like what they see when they drive up, you’ll probably lose them before they ever step foot into the home. Just make sure to use common sense and avoid doing something like building a $10,000 decorative retaining wall because you definitely won’t get your money back. Just clean everything up and make your exterior look nice and neat and it will carry you further than you can imagine.

“DO YOUR RENOVATIONS WHILE YOU LIVE IN THE PROPERTY SO YOU CAN ENJOY THEM.”

Don’t: Expect to get a dollar-for-dollar return on invisible repairs. Repairing or improving things like heaters, septic tanks, and roofs is necessary for your sale, but buyers will already expect them to be done, so you won’t be able to raise your list price $15,000 just because you put $15,000 into repairing your septic tank. That’s not how the market works.

Do: Make sure the upgrades you make are appropriate for your home. You don’t want to tear apart a kitchen in a million-dollar home and replace it with $10,000 worth of upgraded kitchen cabinets. The reverse is also true—you don’t want to put $150,000 into a kitchen in a home that’s only worth $250,000. It’s OK to go high on a renovation, just make sure you’ll be living in that home for the next three to 10 years. The longer, the better.

Don’t: Overspend on a deck upgrade. Everybody loves decks, and in the lower 48 the return on investment is very good for an upgraded deck, but that’s not the case in Alaska. We typically don’t spend a lot of time on our decks—our winters are too harsh.

Do: Make sure your upgrades are appropriate for the subdivision. If you put $150,000 into a home that’s worth $250,000 and you wanted to get $400,000 out of the home, you should know that the subdivision would never support that $400,000 pricing.

If you have any questions about home renovation or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.

If you’re selling a home, there are many mistakes that you can make. Just be sure you don’t make any of these three.

If you’re thinking about selling your home, you need to make sure that you avoid these three major mistakes before you officially list your home for sale:

1. Overpricing. Often, the agent will give the homeowner a range in value of where they think the home should be priced. Many homeowners want to go above that because they think the property is worth more. However, overpricing your home will gain nothing. It will end up costing you months on the market, lead to multiple price reductions, more negotiations, and less money overall.

2. Marketing. Not all agents are created equally when it comes to marketing. Homes don’t sell themselves, contrary to popular belief. The best way to ensure a quick and profitable sale is by getting the property out there and in front of potential buyers. Last year, we sold more homes than any other agent or team in the state of Alaska. Our 574 total sales in 2017 is a much higher figure than the nine homes per year the average agent sells.

“YOUR HOME NEEDS TO BE SHOW-READY AT ALL TIMES.”

3. Not making the home presentable. If your home is on the market for sale, it needs to be in show-ready condition at all times. It should smell good, but not too good. What I mean here is that you want to get rid of any unpleasant or odd odors, but you don’t want to overdo it on the air freshener or candles because then the buyers will think you’re trying to hide something. You want to find a nice, happy, and fresh medium.

If you have any questions about selling a home or anything else about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

Hopefully you had a great holiday season! Now that it’s 2018, it’s time for a market update.


Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value report
Want to buy a home? Search all homes for sale


Welcome to 2018! I hope you and your family had a great holiday season and were able to spend some time with your loved ones. I apologize for being gone from my video blog for longer than normal; I had surgery and I’m hobbling around on crutches, so I’ve been out of the office.

Today, we’re going to talk a little bit about what our local market is doing.

Right now, we have 637 active listings, which is about 3.3 months of inventory. We have 200 pending properties at the moment, and that’s about a third of what’s out there. Pending properties mean that they’re under contract and haven’t been sold yet but are on the way to being sold.

We’ve had 160 expired properties over the last six months. There are really only three reasons why a property doesn’t sell and the listing expires: the condition, the pricing, and the location. Typically, location is the smaller percentage, with 98% of the reason being price and condition.

“98% OF THE REASON WHY A LISTING EXPIRES IS PRICE AND CONDITION.”

The average sales price is a little bit higher than it was in 2016, at just under $270,000. The sellers are still getting about 99% of their last list price, as long as they’re priced appropriately.

The average days on market to be sold is 54 days, but right now in the Anchorage/Eagle River/Girdwood area, the average days on market is 123 days. Why the difference? The properties that sold in 54 days were priced appropriately and were in good condition, so buyers swept them up quickly. It’s a red flag when properties have been on the market for 123 days, usually meaning that the price and/or condition aren’t attractive to buyers. As a seller, you really control how long it takes to sell your home through those factors.

If you are thinking of selling your home this year, now is the time to get started on it. If you’re thinking about buying, we’re going to start seeing inventory increase in February and it will be rolling pretty well by April.

For any questions or real estate needs, feel free to give us a call. We’d love to help you.

Don’t believe the hype; winter is a perfectly viable time to sell your home.

This week we’re going to talk about selling your home in the winter.

Many people think that homes don’t sell in the winter. Surprisingly enough, you’d be amazed at the number of sales that we have in the winter.

Let’s face it—when you have to sell your home, you have to sell your home, whether it’s winter or summer. However, if you have the convenience of waiting, many people prefer to do that.

Waiting can often be a mistake. Inventories in the fall tend to drop down, and buyers have fewer choices to pick from, which can often drive the pricing up on your home that is for sale.

The other thing is that in the summertime, you typically have more showings than in the winter, but often you get a lot of what we call “looky-loos” out there shopping and half-heartedly looking around. A lot of people like to go to open houses and look at homes for remodeling purposes.

In the wintertime, you have fewer showings. However, those buyers are typically more serious. They’re not out dragging themselves through the snow because it’s fun, but because they need a home.

Do not be afraid to put your property on the market in the winter. Yes, it is slower, but property still sells.

“DO NOT BE AFRAID TO PUT YOUR PROPERTY ON THE MARKET IN THE WINTER.”

If I can be of any help, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m happy to do a cursory walk around your property and give you some marketing tips. After all, now is the time to amp up your curb appeal to avoid having to do so with snow on the ground.

Have a great week!

Winter is here, which means it’s time to take care of some basic home maintenance items in order to avoid major damages and expenses down the line.

Winter is here, and we’ve had our first official snowfall. As a homeowner, there are a few things you need to do to protect your home from damage and avoid major expenses.

First of all, you need to remove your hoses from the hose bib. If you have the older kind of hose bib, you’ll need to put a cover on it. Newer hose bibs do not require a cover.

Secondly, although icicles may look really cool, they are not good for your roof at all. Find out why those icicles are forming and get someone out there to remove them. Do not try to remove them yourself. Hire a professional. Icicles can cause roof damage and cost you thousands and thousands of dollars.

Finally, caulk your windows and make sure that your doors are sealed. Caulk the baseboards and walk around the outside of your house to check for any other gaps. Get everything caulked and sealed up. If you were to add all of the cracks and crevices together, the average house has a 3x3 foot window of air coming into the home.

If you have any questions or need referrals to any professionals to help you with these maintenance items, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

There are more than a couple reasons why fall is a great time to buy a home in our market.

There are seven reasons what fall is a great time to purchase a home.

1. There is less competition. If you’re a buyer out there looking in the fall, chances are you face less competition from other buyers and steer clear of any multiple offer situations like you’d see in the spring.

2. Sellers are tired of marketing. They want to be done with things. They’ve probably been on the market since summer, and that tends to wear them down. This makes them a little more motivated.

3. Sellers are more serious. Oftentimes, they’re trying to move before winter hits, so that works in your favor.

4. You can also take advantage of the tax breaks you’ll get during this time of year.

5. Pricing tends to be more reasonable. Again, sellers have been on the market for a while and they’re tired of marketing their property. As we all know, the longer a seller’s home is on the market, the less they’ll typically take for their property.

6. There are fewer buyers out there. This is somewhat related to the first point, but fewer buyers means sellers are happy when they get active showings.

7. Interest rates are still great!

If you want to stay warm during the winter and lower your energy costs, there are a few things you must do around the house.


Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value report
Want to buy a home? Search all homes for sale


How can you make your home more energy-efficient now that winter is here? There are several things you can do.

One of the things I often see with sellers is them not having serviced their heating systems for sometimes as long as two, three, or even five years. By servicing your heating system, you can almost double the life of your heater. If you haven’t done that, now is the time to call a heating company to service and clean your heating system and make any necessary repairs to it.

Most people wait until the heater breaks, and that’s usually during the first winter freeze-up. Heating companies can sometimes be backed up three or four days during this time, though, so you want to stay ahead of that.

Another thing you can do is make sure all of your windows are caulked on the outside and inside. If you’ve got older windows that naturally leak air, you can also insulate them by putting plastic shields over them.

Next, consider installing a programmable thermostat. Turning your thermostat down 10 to 15 degrees at night or while you’re not at home can save you about 10% on your heating bill.

Also, don’t heat unused spaces. If you have rooms you don’t use, shut the heater down in them. That will filter the heat to other places in the house. If the heater works less, it will cost you less money.

“THE LESS YOUR HEATER WORKS, THE LESS IT WILL COST YOU.”

Lastly, if you have large windows that let a lot of sun in during the day, make sure those windows are open so that sunlight can heat your home naturally.

If you have any questions about energy efficiencies in your home or you have any other real estate questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send us an email. I’d be happy to help you.

It’s time for another quick market update for the Anchorage area.

It’s time for another market update for the Anchorage area.

Right now we have about 1,000 properties on the market, 35% of which are already under contract. About 360 properties have buyers who have written contracts on them.

We have close to 2.9 months of inventory on hand; if no other properties went on the market today, we’d have enough housing available for roughly three months. This is a very healthy level, and is considered more of a seller’s market, though that’s not what we’re seeing in the economy today. It’s been very give-and-take: the buyer gives a little, the seller gives a little, and everyone walks away happy.

“IF NO OTHER PROPERTIES WENT ON THE MARKET TODAY, WE’D HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING AVAILABLE FOR ROUGHLY THREE MONTHS.”

The average sales price for the area is around $360,000. Sellers are getting about 99% of the last list price.

The average days on market of what homes sold is about 43 days, and the average days on market of what’s currently active is about 84 days.

The discrepancy between the two figures is due to the fact that the properties that are on the market right now usually have had longer marketing times because we have many homes out there that are overpriced, or the condition of the home doesn’t warrant the price. The active days will typically always be longer than the days sold. If the property is in good condition, it’s going to sell quickly.

If you have any other questions, or you’d like to talk with me, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. Have a great week!

Today I’d like to take a break from talking about the market. Instead, I’m bringing you some interesting fishing facts.

This week we wanted to do something a little different.

Instead of talking about the market, today we’re going to talk about some fishing trivia.

Did you know that when salmon spawn, they travel 1,900 miles up the Yukon river to do so? Additionally, Alaska is home to five different species of salmon: the King, the Coho, the Sockeye, the Chum, and the Pink.

Of all of these, and of all Pacific salmon in general, the Pink is the smallest. And the Chum has one of the widest ranges of all Pacific salmon and can be found throughout the world including here in Alaska, but also in California, Canada, Russia, and Japan.

As another fun fact about salmon, the females, just like chickens, are called “hens.”

But Alaska isn’t just home to salmon. The Pacific halibut is one of the most sought after fish in our state.

“THE PACIFIC HALIBUT IS ONE OF THE MOST SOUGHT AFTER FISH IN OUR STATE.”

I remember the first time I ever saw a halibut. When I noticed both eyes on one side, I truly thought something was wrong with that fish. Another thing that might surprise some people about the halibut is its size.

The largest halibut to have been recorded weighed 495 pounds. Any halibut larger than 300 pounds is called a Barn Door halibut. Smaller halibuts, though, are called Chicken halibuts.

Fishing season this year may be over—but, if you’re a fisherman, remember to be safe and have fun when it comes around again.

If you have any other questions or would like more information feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Today I wanted to give you an update on what’s going on in our Anchorage market.


Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value report
Want to buy a home? Search all homes for sale


This week, I wanted to bring you up to date on what the market is doing since it’s been awhile since my last update.

Currently in the Anchorage market, we have 1,064 single-family homes listed. We have 371, or about 35%, of those listed properties that are pended, and about 2.9 months of inventory on hand. What that means is that if no more homes were listed, it would take 2.9 months for all the current inventory to be sold off.

Any inventory that sits at three months or less means that we’re in more of a seller’s market. If you’re a seller, now is a great time to get your home on the market. We’ve had a lot of multiple offer situations with listed properties that have been priced right.

In the last six months, we’ve sold 1,072 homes, which is right on par with where we were last year. Our average sales price is up to about $364,000, and sellers are getting 98.6% of what they’re asking for their home in their final offer. This is great news, as sellers are well within the recommended 5% margin.

Right now the average days on market of sold properties is around 52 days, while the average days on market for active properties is 80 days. So, why the difference? The homes that are in great condition and kept clean while they’re listed are selling much quicker.

The properties that are still active on the market aren’t getting sold because they’re overpriced, their condition isn’t that great, or accessibility is making it difficult for agents to show to potential buyers.

So what does this mean for you? If you’re a seller, now is a great time to list your home, as inventory is low and buyer demand is high. If you’re a buyer, we can help you find the home of your dreams.

“IF YOU’RE A SELLER, NOW IS A GREAT TIME TO GET YOUR HOME ON THE MARKET.”

If you have any additional questions about this update or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, please give a call. We’d be happy to help!

Wes Madden and Dar Walden are together today for a special announcement.


Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value report
Want to buy a home? Search all homes for sale


You might be wondering why I’m joined by my colleague Wes Madden in today’s video. We actually have some exciting news to share: The Dar Walden Team and Madden Real Estate, two of the top real estate teams in Alaska, are merging!

To put that into perspective, last year we served a combined 778 clients with almost $200 million in sale volume. The best part is that Madden Real Estate will be part of the Keller Williams group, the world’s largest franchise that has more than 150,000 agents and 800 offices around the world.

We teamed up so that we could provide our clients with true statewide service, making us the only team that serves all of Alaska. Our website is actually your only broker-owned source for all Alaska MLS listings.

We also have a worldwide referral network. If you’re moving out of state, we can take care of any and all of your needs thanks to our network of 150,000 worldwide agents.

The merger also adds even more horsepower to our proven marketing systems. You might already know that we have some of the most progressive and exciting marketing strategies, and our merger will let us have synergy between all of our ideas and campaigns. We also share many of the same endorsements, including Barbara Corcoran, Glenn Beck, and Gary LeVox from Rascal Flatts.

“THE MERGER ALSO ADDS EVEN MORE HORSEPOWER TO OUR PROVEN MARKETING SYSTEMS.”

We also share a lot of core values; this whole deal simply wouldn’t work if we didn’t. Having a team with two people that carry the same belief system is truly an amazing thing.

So if you’re interested in buying or selling a home here in Alaska or you’re interested in a career in real estate, just give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to hear from you!

The Feds are raising interest rates once more next week, which means if you’re a seller in our market, the time to act is now.

Today I want to share a quick market update with you.

As you know, the Feds have announced they will raise interest rates again. They’re predicted to raise them next week, and the margin is predicted to be 0.25%. Right now, rates are at about 4.25%, which means after next week they’ll settle at 4.5% for the time being. In the middle of last December, they were at 3.88%.

What does this mean to you if you’re thinking about selling your home? When interest rates go up, prices drop. The average sale price in the Anchorage/Eagle River/Girdwood area has dropped from $366,000 at the beginning of the year to $341,000. That’s a drop of about 6.7%, one of the largest we’ve seen in a long time.

Keep in mind that we’re also in the slow quarter, so some of this is a result of the time of year. Hopefully, that will level out as the year progresses. If you’re thinking about selling your house, don’t wait. Do it before these interest rates rise again and values go down.

“IF YOU’RE THINKING ABOUT SELLING YOUR HOUSE, DON’T WAIT ANY LONGER.”

If you have any questions or are thinking about putting your home on the market, please feel free to give me a call. I’d be happy to help you!

How can you keep your home safer while you’re away? Here are our best tips.

One question I’ve been getting a lot is, “What can I do to keep my home safe while I’m away?” Crime is on the rise in the Anchorage Valley area and keeping your house safe is important, especially if you’re traveling or on vacation. Here are a few things you can do to keep your home safer.

The first thing I would suggest is installing a camera in your doorbell. I’ve got one, and it tells me every time somebody rings the doorbell. I can even talk to the person before I open the door.

Another good idea is adding some exterior lighting with motion sensors. A lot of times, these will scare people off if they are snooping around.

It’s also a good idea to let your neighbors know you are leaving. I have neighbors on both sides of me that we inform every time we leave. Remember to put your mail on hold as well.

Finally, double check those windows and doors before you leave. One-third of all break-ins are unforced entries.

“Double check those windows and doors.”

I hope these tips are helpful and keep you safe and sound in your home. If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
