Most of the agents in our industry are transactional instead of relationship-based. Here’s why you should work with one who’s relationship-based.

What’s the difference between being transactional and being relationship-based in the real estate industry? The answer lies in how our team does business.

I read an alarming article the other day that described Realtors along the same lines as personal injury attorneys and insurance salesman. In other words, it held our profession in a really low regard. This was disheartening to me because I know how hard my team works and how much we love our clients. Overall, it was hard to read this article and think that the public thinks so little of Realtors.

I think the reason for this is most Realtors are transactional instead of relationship-based. My firm is relationship-based.

Let me tell you a quick story of how a transactional mindset works. I met with a couple last week who listed their home last year with a Realtor who was a friend of theirs. After six months, their home hadn’t sold and they were ready to take it off the market. When they told their Realtor this, their Realtor threatened to sue them for $8,000.

“I VALUE THE LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP OUR TEAM HAS WITH EACH OF OUR CLIENTS.”

That’s not how you build a business, build a career, or build trust with the public. I’ve never, ever told someone that I was going to sue them if they took their home off the market. In fact, we’re one of the few firms that offer an easy-exit listing agreement. If you’re one of our sellers and you want to take your home off the market, just call us up and we’d be happy to do that for you. I value the long-term relationship our team has with each of our clients—not the short-term, transactional gain of $8,000.

Long story short, we plan on selling this couple’s home. If their previous Realtor would have agreed to take their home off the market last fall, they might have retained the client this spring.

We want to earn your business, and we want to do business with you for life.

If you ever have any real estate questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you.

Is having a second basement egress actually as important as recent buzz would have you believe? Today, I’ll address this hot topic.

Spring is here and we’re seeing great buyer activity out there in our market. Many homes are selling above list price, but there certainly are some that are remaining stagnant on the market. The distinction comes down to things like price point, school systems, and location.

For example, homes I’ve got listed that are priced at or above $900,000 are seeing very little activity, while homes I’ve got listed at or under $350,000 are receiving tremendous activity.

But, this isn’t the main point I want to make today. The message I want to share with you is about basement egress windows. To elaborate, an egress window is just a separate way to get out of the basement.

Real estate goes through cycles. In the past, there’s been buzz about asbestos, radon, mold, and more. These days, there’s a lot of talk about homes without a basement egress. Homes without a basement egress have been causing a lot of grief for agents lately.

“NOT HAVING A SECOND EGRESS WON’T MAKE OR BREAK YOUR ABILITY TO SELL A HOME.”

If you’re a seller, think about this: You’ve got a finished basement. Most likely, you didn’t pull permits from the town. Still, in most municipalities, you’ve got to have a second egress out of the basement beside the stairs. Nevertheless, 90% of people probably don’t have this.

I have sold dozens upon dozens of homes that don’t have a second basement egress. I think it all comes down to an agent’s ability to negotiate. An agent who says you can’t sell a home without a second egress is an agent who can’t negotiate.

Let me tell you a story to illustrate what I mean. Two or three years ago, I spoke with a couple who had just met with another agent. They told me, “Don’t worry, we’ve already put a deposit down on a second egress.” I told them to cancel the contract and that I would sell the house without them putting a window in. They followed my advice, got their home sold, and saved $5,000 in doing so.

This is what Realtors do: We work through problems. If you’re a seller and you have a finished basement, adding a second egress is something to think about. It is certainly beneficial to have one from a safety perspective, and the presence of this feature is something I will always argue for my buyers. However, having one won’t make or break your ability to sell a home.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

What’s the dirty little secret no one else will tell you about the real estate industry? I’ll share it with you today.

As we head into spring, the weather is starting to warm up a bit. We are seeing great buyer activity, and inventory remains low. Interest rates are starting to move up, so if you’re a buyer, you may want to make your move now before they get even higher.

Now that you’ve been briefed on our current market conditions, I want to talk about the dirty little secret in real estate that no one likes to talk about.

In my opinion, the real estate industry is broken. There are 3,100 brokers in the Capitol region, and 99% of them are set up as independent contractors within a real estate firm. On average, these agents sell seven or eight homes a year. What tends to happen is that these agents do some crazy things in an unethical environment.

As a result, consumers lose tens of millions of dollars a year because of unscrupulous activities by Realtors.

This week alone, I had three Realtors ask me or say things that were an ethical violation. Whenever a Realtor says to me, “Hey Kevin, between you, me, and the lamppost . . .” I know the next words out of their mouth are going to be some sort of ethical violation.

It’s really disheartening, but when you think about the way our industry is set up, it’s not surprising. You have these very large commissions and agents that are only doing six or seven transactions a year, which means there is a huge motivation to work unethically.

I really want to stress that our firm is different. We have the saying “clients first” posted everywhere in our office. We have a fiduciary responsibility to treat your transaction like our own and put your needs before ours. That’s what we always do at our firm.

If I ever get wind that anyone at my office is doing anything unethical, I will take action. They are not going to work with our firm any longer.

“I BELIEVE THAT THE INDUSTRY WILL CHANGE.”

Just to give you an idea of what I mean, I had an agent call me from another firm and we went out for coffee. They told me that they had called up a listing agent and said, “Hey, I have an offer coming in. What’s it going to take to put this transaction together?” That listing agent responded, “Bring me an offer of $340,000.”

The thing is, the buyer was going to offer $360,000, so the listing agent just cost their seller $20,000. The seller doesn’t even know that this conversation happened. They got sold out by their listing agent for $20,000, but they are probably happy because their home sold in two weeks.

That’s just one of the many atrocities that go on in our business and it drives me nuts. Going forward, I think something needs to change. I believe the industry will change. It’s likely that going forward, Realtors will become employees with most teams. That’s why we work as a team; we do things differently at my firm.

If you have any other questions about how my team operates or if you need help buying or selling a home, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

Why hasn’t your home sold? There are usually three reasons why good homes don’t sell on the market.

“Why didn’t that home sell?”

I’ve heard this question and others like it many times in my 25 years in the business. I’ve sold thousands of homes in that time, so my experience and education in marketing have given me three reasons why I think a home won’t sell.

“YOU’VE GOT TO BE FLEXIBLE AS A SELLER.”

1. Pricing. As hard as it is for a seller to understand, I can sell a home with mold, radon, bad wells with coliform in the water, and more. When it comes to pricing, it has to reflect those issues. Often agents simply don’t do their homework on pricing correctly.

2. Marketing. I hate to see homes that are advertised with pictures taken on a cell phone. We always use professional photographers when we market for sellers. But it’s more than just that; you also need to position the home to reach the target market and promote the price. A lot of Realtors don’t understand the market that they’re trying to reach. 86% of people start their home search on the internet, so if an agent doesn’t understand how to use social media or isn’t spending enough on online marketing, it simply won’t sell.

3. Sellers. Sellers can often be their own worst enemies. They might mean really well, but sometimes they hire us and don’t take our advice or they don’t let buyers in. I recently took on a home that had been on the market for over a year with another agent—over the first week, we had five showings and my seller had five showing requests denied! Buyers that are denied showings probably won’t come back. Don’t assume that a buyer isn’t serious enough. You’ve got to be flexible as a seller.

Today, I want to answer two common questions I hear from buyers and sellers, respectively.

Today, I want to talk about two questions people ask me all the time.

The first question is one I often hear from buyers, which is: “Is buying a home the right thing for me?” And the second question, which is something sellers tend to ask me, is: “If I can’t sell my house, is renting a good option?” Let’s start with the first question.

*Contrary to what you might expect me to say as a Realtor, buying a house isn’t right for everyone. There are many situations where people are simply better off renting. The first factor you should consider if you aren’t sure whether buying is right for you is your time frame.

If you’re planning to be in a home in the Capital region for less than four years, you’re better off renting. Closing costs in New York state are the highest in the country, which means it’s very difficult to make them back in a short time frame.

Another indicator that you’re better off renting is if you are risk-averse. If you aren’t sure about your employment stability or don’t have cash reserves saved up, you may want to rethink buying a home.

“BUYING A HOME IS A GREAT OPTION FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE TIME AND MONEY TO MAKE SUCH A COMMITMENT.”

Things happen. Your boiler could blow up a week after you move into the home. If you aren’t prepared for these possibilities, renting might be the way to go. The same can be said if you are someone who travels a lot.

On the other hand, buying a home is a great option for people who have the time and money to make such a commitment.

Now, let’s move on to the second question. Should you rent a home if you’re having issues selling it?

In my experience, more people are moving out of the Capital region than are moving in. Wanting to pay down your mortgage and let the house potentially appreciate is not a good enough reason to rent out your property. This is particularly true if you’re moving out of the area.

I have seen first-hand the devastation tenants can do to a home when their landlord is long-distance. Chaos can befall you when you leave your property in the hands of another person. Renting is just prolonging the pain of the sale. Generally, you are better off just selling your home and moving on.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

After thinking about perspective lately, I wanted to share with you the ways that our agents’ experience and perspective can help you navigate real estate.

Today, I want to talk about perspective and address some questions buyers and sellers frequently ask me.

I didn’t know that we could volunteer at the Ronald McDonald House. My team was down there this week, and we thought that we were going to be helping the people staying there by cooking them breakfast, among other things. But the reality is they ended up helping us more than we help them. It really puts things into perspective when you worry about making a mortgage or car payment, but there are people out in the world fighting some really big battles.

That’s why you hire us when you have questions about real estate — you hire us for our experience and our perspective. I have an amazing team of people with ample experience. Four of our team members have graduate degrees, which is absolutely unheard of in the real estate industry. Between all of us, we probably have hundreds of years of experience.

Drawing on that experience, I want to answer a few questions I’m regularly asked by our buyers and sellers.

From buyers, I hear, “How many homes do I need to look at? What price should I offer?”

And from sellers, I get, “How do I know when I should take the offer?”

Let’s begin with the buyer’s side. The average buyer looks at seven to eight homes, though many look at more or fewer. Our goal is to narrow down your search to homes that fit your criteria to save you time and money. We don’t want to waste your time by showing you 30 homes that don’t match what you’re looking for.

“WE’RE HERE TO MAXIMIZE YOUR RETURN AND LESSEN THE INCONVENIENCE FOR YOU, WHETHER YOU’RE BUYING OR SELLING.”

In terms of what price you should offer, the answer is that it depends. On average, homes in the Capital Region area sell at 95% to 100% of the list price. But not all homes are priced correctly; there are many homes that are overpriced in the MLS, as well as homes that are underpriced and those that are spot on. We can tell you what the home is worth and what kind of offer you should make.

As an example, if you make an offer in January on a house that has been on the market for six months, we won’t let you offer 95%—that’s probably a motivated seller, so there’s an opportunity for us to get you a good deal.

For sellers, on the other hand, if your home has been on the market for two days and someone makes a full-price offer, you’ll probably ask if you could get more. That’s where our expertise in valuing homes comes into play. In my experience, the first offer is the best offer 99% of the time.

We recently had a high-profile investor receive a full-price offer on a property he was selling. This was his first offer, but his natural inclination was to wait for more exposure on the market to see if he could get more. Long story short, that first buyer didn’t want to wait around, and so three months later, he got $15,000 less than what he could have.

Scenarios like that are why we are here. We’re here to maximize your return and lessen the inconvenience for you, whether you’re buying or selling.

If you have any questions about what’s going on in the real estate market, feel free to contact me directly. I’d be glad to use my experience and perspective to guide you through your transaction.

2018 is upon us and I hope you’re having a fantastic year so far.

That being said, January is a time of change. People tend to set goals for themselves when this month rolls around only to abandon them in February. Why does this happen?

Something I want you to think about this year is the “Wheel of Life.” The Wheel of Life is basically comprised of every aspect of your life, including your finances, your health, your career, and more.

Think about this: If you had to rate each aspect of your life on a scale from one to 10, how well would those ratings turn out? Ideally, every aspect of your life should be well-balanced around this wheel.

But real life isn’t so simple. Change is not easy, nor is it comfortable. That’s exactly why successful people get comfortable being uncomfortable.

“SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE GET COMFORTABLE BEING UNCOMFORTABLE.”

The pain of changing must be less of the pain of staying stuck in something negative. It really comes down to asking yourself what you’re willing to accept in life. In 2018, I challenge you to raise your standards.

When you decide what you want and expect out of life, you have the power to take control. One way to help yourself take control is by surrounding yourself with people who build you up instead of those who tear you down.

What gets me out of bed every day is making a difference in people’s lives.

If there’s anything I can help you with, real estate or otherwise, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Whatever happens with the upcoming tax cuts may have a short-term impact on our real estate market, but it won’t be the end of the world. Here’s why.

How will President Trump’s new tax cuts affect our real estate market and you as a homebuyer or seller?

Before I give my thoughts on that question, I want to thank you for coming out to our recent Thanksgiving pie giveaway. We had a great turnout and had a lot of fun giving away so many pies. As you know, we also held a gift card raffle at the giveaway, so today I’ll announce the winners of our grand prizes.

Now, onto the news at hand. Nobody knows exactly what’s going to happen with these tax cuts, but there’s plenty of concern that the mortgage interest deduction is going away.

If you’re buying real estate just for the mortgage interest deduction, you’re buying real estate for the wrong reason. People buy real estate for many reasons, and the deduction was a great benefit, but it’s not the end of the word if it goes away. People will still buy real estate.

“DON’T BUY REAL ESTATE FOR THE TAX DEDUCTIONS.”

Many years ago, I was in a situation where I was fortunate enough to be able to pay off my home, and my financial planner told me not to pay off the home for the mortgage interest deduction because then I’d lose that deduction. I just went back and ran some quick numbers regarding what I saved with the deduction and having no mortgage, and I calculated that my savings were vastly greater by paying off the house instead of taking the mortgage interest deduction.

I liken this situation to when the state of New York banned smoking in bars. Back then, it was common to wonder if a lot of bars and restaurants would go out of business. 10 years later, the bar and restaurant industry is thriving. Everyone survived.

Change is sometimes hard, but change is generally good and positive. Whatever happens with the mortgage interest deduction may have a short-term impact on the market, but we’ll survive.

        <description>

How is my team so successful in our industry? Well, it all comes down to the behind-the-scenes work my team members do each day.

Today, I want to talk a little bit about how we sell so many homes. Most of all, I want to talk about the efforts of my team. The work they do behind the scenes is truly to thank for our success.

“THE WORK MY TEAM DOES BEHIND THE SCENES IS TRULY TO THANK FOR OUR SUCCESS.”

My team members are averaging 30 sales a piece, when the average agent in our area tends to average just seven or eight homes.

While I absolutely appreciate the credit I receive for my team’s success, I want to make it known that each and every one of my team members plays a huge role in what we do.

In 2016, we were named the No. 3 team in the state of New York in terms of sales.

Our team makes it a priority to take care of buyers and sellers in today’s market. For example, if you are a buyer and are unhappy with your home within your first year of residing there, I will sell that property for free.

Don’t just take my word for it. You can hear a testimonial from one of our past clients, Nicole Cohen, in the video above.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Our furnaces may keep us warm during the winter months, but did you know they may also be kicking off carbon monoxide? Here’s what you need to know to stay safe.

Before I delve into today’s topic, I’d like to begin with a special message. Thanksgiving is upon us and I want to take a moment to say thank you. I can’t tell you enough how much I appreciate your support, which has made us the No. 3 real estate team in New York state. Your experience and satisfaction is of the utmost importance to me.

Speaking of Thanksgiving, we’ve reached the time of year when people are beginning to turn on their heating systems. Furnaces may keep us warm, but they can also pose a hazard related to today’s subject: carbon monoxide. If a system is malfunctioning, it could be spewing carbon monoxide into your home.

Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that can be put off by gas stoves, furnaces, or any other appliances in your home that use gas or oil.

It seems like there isn’t a year that goes by that I don’t hear about an injury or death having occurred as a result of just this.

So, if you don’t already have a carbon monoxide detector, get one. They cost just about $29 and you can find them at Home Depot, Walmart, and any other similar stores. This small expense is well worth it.

“IF YOU DON’T ALREADY HAVE A CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTOR, GET ONE.”

You cannot detect carbon monoxide without a detector, and breathing in high levels can kill you or cause you to become seriously ill.

I believe in the importance of this so strongly that if you can’t afford a carbon monoxide detector, reach out to me and I will buy one for you.

I hope you have a safe and happy holiday season.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Mold is huge issue for both the buyer’s and seller’s side, but it may not as pervasive an issue as you think.

Before we begin today’s topic, I’d like to mention that we are having our annual Thanksgiving giveaway on Tuesday, November 21st, from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m.

We’ll be giving away apple pies from Lakeside Farms. If you’re a client, please watch your mail for your invitation. You will need to RSVP so we can make sure that we have enough pies on hand. Last year we gave out over 200 pies. This is just our way of saying thanks and showing our appreciation to our clients.

The topic I wanted to discuss with you today is something that’s on the forefront of my mind: mold.

Mold is one of the biggest issues we’re facing on both the buyers’ and sellers’ side.

“MOLD IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES WE’RE FACING ON BOTH THE BUYER’S AND SELLER’S SIDE.”

Two years ago in New York, lobbyists pushed for legislation requiring both assessors and mold remediation companies to come into your home under certain circumstances, which ultimately passed. This could add a tremendous cost to you as a seller.

In New York, if you have more than 10 square feet of mold, it must be addressed. If you’re a seller, check your basement and attic for the black or gray patches that indicate mold growth.

Mold is fairly cheap to remediate but buyers are really scared of it. If you’re a buyer, just be aware that mold is probably in 40% of the homes that you’re going to look at. It’s not a deal-killer; don’t be scared by what you read on the internet. Mold can be removed easily with a 30-year warranty by the company, and that should be the end of the problem.

This is how widespread the fear of mold has become.

I had a home under contract about six months ago. The garage door had one-foot squares on it, like the old ones used to. Two of those squares on the door had what I would call mildew, but the buyers called it mold.

The buyers wanted $1,500 to remove that mold, when I could have put a brand-new, single-bay, insulated aluminium door in for just $800.

I believe that it’s paranoia and absurdity, but it is something to be aware of on both sides.

If you have mold in your home, treat the area with a chemical product. After that, find the source. It will likely be an issue of moisture intrusion or a problem with ventilation.

If you have any questions at all about mold, call me. Mold is an issue we will deal with ahead of the curve before we list your home. For buyers, we will inform you of the risks and reality of mold in your home.

As always, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me with any real estate questions you might have. I look forward to hearing from you!

What is my team’s approach to real estate? That’s what I’m going to talk about today.

As we head toward the winter months, the fall real estate market continues to be strong in Albany. Our inventory is limited, which is good news for sellers. Interest rates have remained very low as well, which is good news for buyers. Instead of giving you a more detailed look at the market, I wanted to answer a question I hear all the time. People want to know, “How does your team do what it does?”

My team of 13 agents may be small, but it is also mighty. We are the No. 3 ranked time in the state of New York. The biggest reason we were able to have this accomplishment is the people on our team and our culture.

There is a wealth of knowledge and then some on my team. Over a third of our team have Master’s degrees, which is practically unheard of in the real estate business. The people on our team believe in our business and believe that we will achieve more when we work together.

I have a great story to share about how my team utilizes their wealth of knowledge to benefit our clients. We were recently working with some buyers who hit a snag during the inspection period. A radon system needed to be installed, but the contracted company wouldn’t be able to install it for three weeks. If we waited three weeks to close, this deal would fall through.

So, our agents got on the phone. One of them ended up being on the phone until 11 p.m. the night before closing. That dedication produced results, as we got everything on track by getting a system installed that only delayed closing by 24 hours.

This story speaks volumes to how we do what we do. We’re dedicated to our clients. Most agents would have given up when they heard that closing would be delayed three weeks. That’s what makes our team different.

“THIS IS WHAT SETS OUR TEAM APART.”

Finally, a quick announcement. Going forward, you won’t be seeing my face as much. Of course, I’ll still be bringing you two videos per month. You just won’t be seeing my old mug on our yard signs from now on. I’ve come to a realization that my face doesn’t need to be on there anymore because my team isn’t just me. I want something that will better represent us as a whole.

If you have any questions for me or anyone on my team or if you’re interested in buying or selling a home in Albany, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

Should you buy or sell this fall or wait until spring?

Most buyers and sellers feel that spring is the best time to buy and sell, but I couldn’t disagree more. The fall market is a great market.

“FALL IS A GREAT TIME TO SELL YOUR HOME.”

Most people assume that the majority of home buying in our market takes place during July and August because buyers need to settle in time for the start of the school year, but statistics don’t support that assumption here in the capital region. July and August are generally slower months in terms of home sales, but September and October are great months for home sales.

Over the past few years, statistics have shown that we’ve sold more homes in the fall than in the spring. Inventory is still tight, and buyers are still very active during this time period. As we approach Thanksgiving, we will see a bit of a slowdown, but we should see inventory start to pick up, so fall should be a good time to buy as well.

If you list your home well before Thanksgiving and Black Friday, you should see success. Just last week, I listed a home that received five offers in 48 hours—most of them over list price. That’s the kind of activity we’re seeing with homes that are properly marketed.

If you have any questions about buying or selling in the fall or you’re thinking about buying or selling soon in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

Today I want to share some of the most common mistakes I see buyers and sellers making in their transactions. Knowing what to avoid is important as knowing what you should be doing.

When it comes to real estate, a common topic of discussion is the things buyers and sellers should do to succeed in the market.

However, today I want to talk about something a little different. As important as it is to know what you should be doing, you should also understand there are certain things that buyers and sellers alike should avoid.

First of all, I often see buyers and sellers making the mistake of letting their egos get involved. When negotiation becomes about winning instead of the goal at hand, things can quickly go downhill. When buyers and sellers put their egos aside during negotiations, they will both be much more successful in getting what they want.

Another mistake I see from people during real estate transactions is sellers not investing in the preparation of their home. My team has the resources to help sellers make these kinds of investments, which can bring a bigger return, but ultimately, our help can only go as far as a seller’s willingness to take it.

Overpricing, too, is another thing that sellers need to avoid. “The second agent wins,” is a saying that has come as a result of just how often sellers make this mistake. What this means is that when sellers overprice their home the first time, they are unsuccessful and will ultimately hire a second agent later to try to do the job right.

“IF YOU WANT TO WIN, YOU HAVE TO BE IN IT.”

Pricing a home too high with the promise of bringing it down if need be will always be a losing strategy. A home’s price should be set correctly from the start if you want to net more than you would if your home sat on the market through a series of price reductions. Overpriced homes cost sellers millions every year.

Buyers, too, should avoid doing certain things. For example, many buyers are reluctant to get into a bidding war. If you want to win, you have to be in it. A great home in a great location at the right price is rare to come by. Letting a good opportunity pass you by could lead to a lot of regret.

Additionally, many buyers make the mistake of not wanting to go over list price. If you’re going to be in a home for a long time, going over the price by even a few thousand dollars isn’t going to be a big deal. When I bought my home in 2001 and paid $2,500 over list price, people thought I was crazy.

However, today, that home has appreciated by six figures. As a buyer, you shouldn’t hesitate to go over list price if it’s truly the right home.

These mistakes cost buyers and sellers alike a lot of money over the course of their real estate transactions.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

If you really want to get ahead in this world, you have to own real estate, and it all
starts with planning.

I read a statistic the other day that said people spend more time planning their vacations than they do planning their retirement, laying out their goals and parameters, and generally just living the lives they want to live. A half hour later, I heard a radio story about how wealthy people have similar traits in how they live their lives.

What does one have to do with the other?

Making money is not the end-all, be-all—but if you have money, it takes away a lot of stress in your life and gives you the freedom to do what you want. What are some of the traits wealthy people have? There are four that stand out:

1. They’re constantly learning. Whether it’s reading books or watching Youtube videos, they’re constantly learning. When you’re constantly learning, you’re always growing.

2. They exercise daily —not just in a physical sense, but in a mental sense as well. They’re developing ideas that lead to businesses.
They know how to win. It’s easy to get addicted to winning. Many wealthy people played competitive sports all throughout high school and college, and this allowed them to learn how to win.

3. They’re planners. They plan their lives, their investments, and retirements.
You can control all these variables, but how much do you plan for them? Did you spend more time planning your vacation than living the life you want to live?

I’m not a vacation guy, and I don’t spend a lot of time planning my vacations. I’ve been fortunate enough to travel around the world, but my trips are usually pre-planned where all I have to do is write a check and show up.

Here’s my point about planning, though. Before the Internet came along, the No. 1 creator of wealth was real estate. If you really want to get ahead in this world, you have to own real estate. You need to own the home you’re living in instead of rent it. Owning is a default investment that will make you wealthy.

“BEFORE THE INTERNET CAME ALONG, THE NO. 1 CREATOR OF WEALTH WAS REAL ESTATE.”

If you do own your own home, your next step is to buy an investment property. I’m not the smartest guy in the room, but the multi-millionaires I know all made their money in real estate. It wasn’t with stocks or some crazy, complex algorithm. It was by doing something simple like buying a multi-family property, taking care of it, renting it, and enjoying the tax benefits and cash flow it provided every single year. At the end of 15 or 30 years, you have a tremendous asset that has paid for itself.

Think about what you want in life and how you will plan for it. If you decide that buying real estate is a part of that plan, I’d love to sit down with you and show you how it can make you wealthy.

If you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <title>What You Should Know About Zillow Before Listing Your Home</title>

When pricing your home, you should only use Zillow as a starting point. An experienced Realtor or an appraiser will tell you the real value of your home and at what price
you should list it.

If you’ve never been on Zillow or Trulia, they’re two of the largest real estate websites in the world. Zillow is known for it’s Zestimate, their customized home valuation estimate.

Zillow and their Zestimate have been in the news recently because they’re being sued by an attorney in Illinois who claims her home sale was impaired because the home’s Zestimate was quite a bit below the price she listed it at.

Realtors love to hate Zillow, but I love Zillow. We do a tremendous amount of business with them, and I believe they’ll be the Amazon of real estate. I’ve met Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff and had the pleasure of sitting down with him a few times. He’s a brilliant guy who’s going to dominate the real estate industry with Zillow.

What does Zillow’s lawsuit mean for you, though?

First, it’s important you understand that Zillow is just the starting point for a home valuation. My friend Barbara Corcoran was on “Good Morning America” not too long ago talking about this lawsuit and reaffirming this opinion. You can watch her appearance in its entirety here.

Zillow should only be a starting point for pricing your home because it doesn’t know about important details you may have made to your home. If you’re interested in selling your home, it’s important to get the professional opinion of someone who’s been through your house.

“ZILLOW IS JUST THE STARTING POINT FOR A HOME VALUATION.”

I’ve been a state-certified appraiser for more than 20 years now. The appraisal process—and what it took for me to get my own appraisal license—is very different than what it takes for a real estate agent to give you a market analysis. I had to work for two years under a professional appraiser, take 150 hours of state-mandated courses, and pass several exams. Random samples of my work also had to be examined by state examiners. Only after all that was completed was I finally granted my appraiser license.

A typical Realtor, on the other hand, takes a 75-hour licensing class. Of that, only two or three hours are spent on home valuation. After that, they’re deemed “qualified” to do a home valuation. If you’re listing your home, have it valued by an experienced appraiser or at least a Realtor who’s been in the business for 25 years. If not, you could wind up in the same situation as the person suing Zillow and relying on a Zestimate that’s as far as 15% to 20% off your home’s real value.

Using an inexperienced Realtor can do the same amount of harm. For example, I received a call this week from a potential client we’ll be listing in a few short weeks whose home had been on the market for a year. It was originally listed at $165,000 and is now down to $120,000 under the guidance of this person’s current Realtor. The mistake this Realtor made was grossly overpricing the home. This client told me that they knew the Realtor had overpriced the home, but they decided to trust them because they were the professional. That mistake literally cost this person thousands of dollars in carrying costs over the past year. Additionally, the home will ultimately sell for less than what it would’ve if it was priced right from the beginning.

If you have any questions about your home’s value in this market or how you can maximize the return on your house once you decide to sell it, please don’t hesitate to call me. I’d be happy to help.

The Capital region market is hot right now. But conditions aside, the best time to buy or sell a home is when it works for you.

No matter the condition of the market, one of the most daunting aspects is figuring out when is the best time to buy or sell a home.

Fortunately, I have good news for you. First, our Capital region market is very hot right now. With more inventory than was available only a few weeks ago, low rates, and good prices for sellers, things are looking good for those seeking to buy or sell alike.

My second piece of good news, however, will help you out regardless of a fluctuating market that can be tricky to predict and time. From my experience, the best time to buy and the best time to sell is when you need to. Holding out for the perfect time because you’re looking to maximize your return in real estate simply isn’t worth it in the majority of cases.

You can expect our Capital region market to appreciate over time; so, don’t waste years waiting for small gains that may or may not happen. Trying to predict the real estate market is a lot like trying to predict the stock market—it’s very difficult.

“TRYING TO PREDICT THE REAL ESTATE MARKET IS A LOT LIKE TRYING TO PREDICT THE STOCK MARKET—IT’S VERY DIFFICULT.”

To illustrate this, I’d like to tell you a quick story. At Clancy Real Estate we’ve worked closely with Zillow, and I’ve even had the opportunity to meet their CEO Spencer Rascoff—a Harvard-educated investment banker. As someone who has a great deal of faith in Zillow, I myself own 1,000 shares. So back in February when they announced that they had missed earnings, the resulting drop in stock value cost me several thousand dollars.

But just two weeks ago, they came out with earnings again. Despite my confidence in the company, I didn’t want to take another blow. So, I tried to time the stock market by selling all my shares the day before they came out with earnings, and guess what—they blew earnings out of the water. Stocks went up to five bucks a share, and I missed out on $5,000 as a result of trying to predict the market.

In retrospect, this is a lesson learned. Trying to outsmart the stock market is nearly impossible, and it’s the same with real estate.

Whether it’s because of your family needs, your retirement, because you want to upsize, you want to downsize, or whatever else: the best time to buy or sell is when you need to. Base your decision on your personal needs instead of on potential investment.

If you have any questions or would like to talk to me about how I can help you buy or sell a home, feel free to give me a call or email. I’d love to hear from you.

Whether you’re buying or selling a home, you need an agent to represent you. Not hiring a professional can cost you a lot of time and money.

Our market is strong right now. Inventory is low, which is good news for sellers. It’s also a great time to be a buyer in certain price points because interest rates are so low.  Because of this, though, I’ve been getting a lot of questions lately from both buyers and sellers asking whether they really need an agent.

Obviously I’m a little biased, but yes I do think you need an agent to buy or sell a home in our market.

For sellers, not using an agent can cost you. For example, a seller client of mine recently pointed out that one of his neighbors sold his home all by himself inside of a week. What he didn’t know is that his neighbor only sold his house so quickly because he underpriced it by about $50,000. If he would’ve used an agent such as myself to represent him, I would’ve netted him dramatically more.

As another example, I had a client once try and represent himself as his own attorney during a closing rather than pay the $600 fee for a professional attorney. Needless to say, this was a disaster. I’ve been to hundreds of closings and I buy many properties each year, and even I hire an attorney during these transactions so I have another set of eyes on what I’m doing. $600 is money well spent when it comes to what’s probably your biggest financial asset.

If you have a Picasso, you can sell it in a day at a yard sale, but you won’t get top dollar for it unless you go to an art dealer who knows how to market it. It’s no different when you’re selling a home. Us Realtors can get you the most exposure and the biggest bang for your buck. We help you net more money overall, which makes up for our small marketing fee.

On the buyer side, I always get buyers who think they can save money by going straight to the listing agent. If a buyer comes to me directly, I will refuse to work with them. To me, that’s a huge conflict of interest. I represent the seller, so my goal as a listing agent is to get top dollar for their home.

If you’re a buyer, you won’t get a better deal by working directly with the listing agent. You need a buyer’s agent working on your behalf who has a fiduciary responsibility to you. That’s what my buyer’s agents do when working with our buyers.

“YOU WILL SAVE BOTH TIME AND MONEY.”

Even in today’s market, it’s important that you use a professional. By doing so, you will save both time and money.

If you have any questions about our market or you’re interested in buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I would be happy to help you.

Today I wanted to take a moment to talk about saving for college. To add to that, I also wanted to tell you about an opportunity to earn $1,000 easy.

I’m happy to announce that after lots agonizing, my daughter has finally decided to go to Marist in Poughkeepsie. I’m a conservative guy and I’ve been saving for her college since the day I found out my wife was pregnant. I set up a 529 plan 18 years ago. Even saving over 18 years, I still couldn’t save enough to pay for her college.

Fortunately though, I bought a small, two-family college rental property that I’ve rented out and managed for the last eight years. I just sold that house this week. Over the last eight years, it had positive cash flow and positive appreciation, as well as equity built-up from the payments I made over eight years.

Between the sale of that house and my 529 plan, I’m able to pay for my daughter’s college. I think it’s important to consider real estate for college savings because I don’t think all families today can save enough for college alone. My cash on cash return on investment for that property alone was probably 40% or 50%.

If you’re thinking about saving for college, I’d love to talk to you about how real estate can be a part of that portfolio for a reasonable down payment.

So how can you earn that $1,000? Our team is growing and the market is very hot. Our team is small, close, and functions like a family, and we’re looking to add two partners.

If you know of anyone unhappy with their job and is looking to get into sales, is honest, and has integrity, I’d love to hear from you. If we hire that person, I’ll write you a check for $1,000.

“IF WE HIRE THE PERSON YOU REFER, I’LL WRITE YOU A CHECK FOR $1,000.”

Even if you refer yourself and we hire you, we’ll give you $1,000. You can email, text, or call me with someone you think is a good fit. We’re looking for a good culture fit who wants to be part of our family.

If you have any other questions or you know someone who would be a good fit, I hope to hear from you soon!
