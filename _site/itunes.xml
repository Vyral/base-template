        <description>

The Zestimate is Zillow’s tool for calculating home values. It gives you an instant home value based on a complex algorithm, but the accuracy can be spotty.

If you’re in a neighborhood, for example, that has a lot of recent sales of similar homes, your Zestimate can be pretty accurate. However, if you’re in an area that has a new subdivision nearby or your house is a little older or a little newer than the most recently sold homes, the estimate probably isn’t very accurate.

“The accuracy can be pretty spotty.”

No matter what, you should talk to a real estate professional if you want an accurate valuation. Only an expert in the market will be able to understand what your home’s value truly is based on current market conditions and the most recent comparable sales data.

If you need a professional opinion on your home’s value or if you just have any questions, you can always give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

One question I’ve been getting a lot lately is, “When I list my home, should I do a major renovation project or am I better off doing some minor remodeling?”

“Buyers are drawn to things like curb appeal and attractive landscaping.”

The answer I give to 99% of the people I meet with is to do a minor type of remodeling or upgrade, as this will bring you a better return on your investment.Don’t get me wrong—a brand-new kitchen or bathroom will help your home sell hand over fist, but by the time you get done with that type of project, there’s usually a lot of unanticipated costs that can also cost you time and prevent you from getting top dollar for your home sale.

Research indicates you should start your upgrades outside. Buyers are drawn to things like curb appeal and attractive landscaping. Avoid getting too customized with your renovations, though. Not everybody likes a certain color or style, so you’re better off maintaining neutrality.

Lastly, do some decluttering. It’s an often-overlooked task, but it’s an easy one to accomplish. I understand if you have things you appreciate lying around the house, but clutter can become distracting to a potential buyer.

If you have any questions about which minor upgrades you can make to increase your home’s value and sale-ability, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be glad to help.
