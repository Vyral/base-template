We are very fortunate to have great families, good jobs, and warm homes to go to during the Holidays. Unfortunately, this isn’t a reality for everyone in our area.

That’s why we always help the Burbank Temporary Aid Center. Every year, they provide over 1,000 turkeys to families in need. This is our seventh year in a row, and we don’t plan on stopping anytime soon!

We need your help! If you’d like to donate your time or some turkeys, please get in touch with us.

As always, refer to us as your No. 1 resource for real estate in the LA area!

        <description>

Happy fall!

Now that the season has changed, it’s time to look back on our market and update you on what’s happening now.

In short, we had a phenomenal summer. Interest rates dropped back down to historic lows, and buyers are out there still buying away.

“Homes are still very much in demand.”

At the moment, properties are moving off the shelves in the lower and medium-priced markets. There’s a bit of a softening in the higher-end markets, but homes are still very much in demand.

If you have any questions about our LA market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

        <description>

I’ve talked to a lot of first-time homebuyers recently that are under the impression that they need to save up a lot of money for their down payment. You should know that there are plenty of down payment options out there for different loans.

You don’t need 10% or 20% to purchase a home. In fact, you can get into a home with FHA financing for just 3.5% down. Rather than saving for years to get to that level, let’s talk about getting you into a home now so you can start looking sooner rather than later and lock in a low rate with a low down payment.

“You don’t need 20%; you only need 3.5%.”

If you have any questions for me or want to hear more about the different financing options out there, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

Recently, I’ve had a couple of clients working on their property and doing things that I didn’t think were important in order to get top dollar in the market.

This got me thinking about how I could help others. Before you go and spend any time and money working on things around the house to get it fixed up and ready for sale, talk to an experienced real estate professional who knows about the buyers in your market. They can help you determine the best ways to spend your time and money when updating your home for sale.

Clients often invest money in their house before listing, which is nice for them, but they’re the seller - not the buyer. Whatever they invest in might not be what buyers are looking for in today’s market. This is why we want our sellers to be laser-focused on the best way to spend the least amount of money to get the top dollar in today’s market.

If you have more questions how to spend money wisely when improving your home, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to give you advice about preparing your home for the market.

        <description>

In our current market, many properties are getting multiple offers. So how do you handle multiple offers as a buyer or seller?

As a seller, it is very important to get multiple offers in order to drive up the price. With our pricing strategies, we can get you a great offer and promote it to other agents so they have the opportunity to bring other bids in. Drawing multiple offers is a great way to get top dollar for your home.

As a buyer, consider writing a personal letter to the seller. Warm, fuzzy letters about your family, kids, pets, and how you connected with the house or neighborhood can really appeal to sellers. It also helps if you introduce yourself to the seller and talk about how much you love the house.

Recently, one of my buyer’s agents created a fantastic letter that really won the seller’s heart. The property had 10 offers on it, but we were able to help them get their dream home!

If you have any questions about how to navigate a multiple offer situation, just give us a call or send us an email. My team and I would be happy to help you!

Happy October! We just wanted to give a quick market update today for all of the buyers out there and let them know what’s going on in the market at this moment.

We are still seeing a very strong market, and the great news for buyers is that the market has cooled off a bit from the summer. You won’t have to deal with as many multiple offer situations and bidding wars like you did a couple months ago. A lot of buyers who experienced this in the summer have come back to the market and have been able to get the home they want.

In addition to the number of options out there, interest rates remain historically low. Buying now will save you money in the long run, as a lower interest rate means you can pay off your mortgage faster.

If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you!

Hey everyone, thanks for stopping by once again. Today I just wanted to give you a quick update on how the LA real estate market is doing.

It’s now May, and the market should continue to be just as strong as it was in April. There is still a very limited supply of inventory, which is fantastic for sellers.

For buyers, this market is a little more challenging. Make sure to get your pre-approval letter and have it ready to go with your offer. Be patient; if you don’t get your first or second choice, there are still plenty of great options out there for you in this market.

If you have any questions about our market, or about anything else real estate related, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!

        <description>
There’s some exciting news for the Los Angeles real estate this January. For starters, interest rates have fallen to right around 3.7%.

This will result in buyers coming out sooner than usual. With affordability on the rise, you can expect to see a busy Los Angeles marketplace.

Sellers are also making their way onto the market and listing homes in response to the increase in buying power. There usually is not a lot of demand from buyers in January, but 2015 is different, and the market is off to an extremely hot start.

Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, it’s a good time to get in the market. Interest rates are as low as they’ve been in 20 months,  causing a flurry of activity in Los Angeles and in the rest of the nation.

If you need any assistance, whether you’re buying or selling in LA, please be sure to call or email me. My team of professionals are waiting to hear from you!

Lately, a few people have asked me whether income properties are a worthwhile investment. Without a doubt, the answer is yes. Real estate is a great way to earn an income and control your investment. Also, because you have a more active role in the success of the investment, the risk is much lower than other venues.

Welcome back. Thanks for joining me today. I wanted to talk about home inspections.

Home inspections are important for both buyers and sellers, but today I wanted to focus especially on why it’s important for sellers to get an inspection prior to listing their home.

Why?

A lot of sellers aren’t aware of the true health of their home. When was the last time you checked the foundation of your home? What shape is your roof in?

Once a seller gets the report on their home, they can make the necessary changes. That way when a buyer makes an offer, you can hand them the report. There also won’t be any surprises when a buyer has their inspector come through.

If you have any questions about how to prepare your home for the market, give me a call 818.958.5300

Thanks for watching!

Many buyers in the marketplace can’t find the home of their dreams because there’s simply not enough inventory to choose from. It’s certainly a sellers’ market. Sellers have the upper hand, especially if the home is in good condition, located in a great neighborhood and priced just right. If you’re at all on the fence about selling, now is the time because sellers are getting top dollar for their homes and they are selling faster than they could have imagined.

For years now, buyers have been able to come in fairly low and actually get away with offers that sellers would never have accepted just a few years prior to that. But now, things are shifting back to a more balanced marketplace and we are noticing some big changes in the way buyers and sellers are interacting. Here are some ways you can gain the upper hand over other buyers vying for the same (few) properties that are scarcely available in our market today.
