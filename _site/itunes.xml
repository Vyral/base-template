How do we fix America’s savings crisis?

First, we need to understand the problem. The average savings rate in America is around 5%, and the average 401(k) balance in 2016 was a little over $96,000, according to Vanguard’s recent “America Saves” report. Of course, that’s hardly enough for the average employee to generate enough income at retirement, especially when you consider taxes and inflation.

Even though these 401(k) plans have been around since 1980 and the total assets in all private retirement plans is greater than $7 trillion, there’s still not enough money in these plans to replace the average American’s income at retirement.

The U.S. government under the Obama administration took over our healthcare system. Could the government do the same for our private retirement system?

Already, individual states are establishing retirement plans for employers with fewer than 50 employees. Is that what you want? Do you want the government managing our private retirement system?

I really hope not. You don’t have to look very far to see what the government has done with social security to get your answer. It’s a pay-as-you-go system with fewer people putting in then those who are taking out.We know that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.

In addition, the Department of Labor’s new enforceable fiduciary standard of care will put an even greater spotlight on your responsibilities as a plan sponsor fiduciary and the responsibilities of all of your service providers.

Now is not the time to sit back with a “business as usual” attitude. There are significant cost-effective strategies you can implement now to protect your company and positively impact your employees. If you focus on things like savings rates, income replacement ratios, fees and expenses, and investment performance, you can make measurable improvements to your plan’s health.

Stay tuned for my next video, where I’ll cover how much an employee needs to save, how to use the Rule of 72, and how to keep the government’s hands off your 401(k) plan.

“Now is not the time to sit back with a “business as usual” attitude.”

Imagine that you’re getting ready to go on a great vacation, you’re standing at the gate at Logan Airport, and you’re ready to board. Then, all of a sudden, the gate agent announces over the PA, “Ladies and gentlemen, the captain would like me to make the following announcement: He’d like me to share with you that there’s an 85% chance that this flight will not make it to your destination safely and on time. Have a nice flight.”

Would you be getting on that plane? Of course not. Why? Because there’s an 85% chance the plane won’t get to its destination on time safely.

I ask this same question to employers sponsoring a 401(k) or 403(b) plan. Why are they boarding their employees on their company-sponsored retirement plan when there’s a possibility they won’t arrive safely at their destination?

I call it the probability question: Are you giving your employees the opportunity to make it to retirement with a high probability of success? Will they have enough money saved to replace their current paycheck and create retirement income for life?

That’s what my video series is about. Over the course of the next year, I’ll send you a series of videos talking about everything you need to know as a plan sponsor and how you can help your employees create retirement income for life.

“I will share with you everything I know.”

Basically, I’ll share with you the secrets of a successful retirement plan. Every other week, I’ll cover topics like courageous plan design, fee and expense control, retirement readiness, litigation, fiduciary responsibility, cutting-edge 401(k) solutions, financial wellness, and so much more.

I’ll share with you everything I know from my 25 years of experience as an adviser focusing on the personal and corporate retirement plan markets, helping you create retirement income for life.
