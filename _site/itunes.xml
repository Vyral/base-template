        <description>

Today I am going to answer the question about whether or not you can discriminate against somebody that holds a medical marijuana card and tests positive for cannabis in their system.

Federally, it is not protected to have a medical marijuana card because marijuana is still prohibited under federal law.

There are some states across the country, however, which have passed marijuana laws within their states. This means that if you are in a state where marijuana is legalized, from a medicinal perspective, you cannot discriminate against them if they test positive on their drug test prior to employment. 

“Federally, it is not protected to have a medical marijuana card because marijuana is still prohibited under federal law.”

This does not mean that you can’t do anything, or have any actions that you can take. If they are impaired on the job or bring any type of paraphernalia on company property, you are allowed to do something. If the job is a position in which there may be a safety issue or, as an organization, you could lose federal benefits, you can also act.

If you have any further questions, please contact me. If I am unable to answer your specific question, one of our attorneys that specializes in the area may be able to help. I look forward to speaking with you.

        <description>

Today, I have some thought-provoking points for you to consider regarding the employee shortage.

Each day, 10,000 baby boomers retire from their careers, and many millennials are starting to join the workforce. However, coaching and teaching this new generation takes time, so they aren’t a direct replacement for those who are rapidly retiring. Because of this, there is an employee shortage, and experts say that the shortage is only going to get worse before it gets better.

Some people may not realize that there are additional changes happening which also impact the workforce. We engage in thousands of conversations, and we’ve been hearing about many trends that people are looking for in their next opportunity. They’re looking for professional growth, competitive compensation and benefits, and the opportunity to be an integral part of an organization. They’re also looking for companies to help them find a work-life balance, meaning they might be looking for telecommuting or a compressed work week.

Additionally, individuals are looking for organizations that are engaging with them from the first point of contact, through the interview process, and into hiring.

What about organizations that aren’t able to accommodate this?We all know that there are positions within the industry that won’t allow telecommuting or a compressed workweek, but there are other things that people can do, like engaging from the first point of contact.

When we are out recruiting, we’re not just checking tactical boxes; we are trying to find the cultural fit. It is quite possibly the most difficult part of recruiting, but it is also the most crucial. I’m sure some of you have had experience with having the wrong cultural fit on your team or in the organization, and you know how detrimental and distracting that was to the team.

“Finding a good cultural fit is quite possibly the most difficult part of recruiting, but it is also the most crucial.”

Cultural match is extremely important, so I encourage hiring managers to spend some time considering what type of culture you want to cultivate and to put verbiage around it. Who is going to be the right fit, and why? Be able to speak to that internally and externally as well.

If you are engaged with recruiting firms to help you find talent, make sure that they are looking for cultural fits. The same goes for internal hiring; your HR team should know exactly what your culture is and what works for you, your team, and your organization.

While finding top talent isn’t easy, I hope these talking points offer a little bit of insight to you about your hiring process.

If you have any questions about this, feel free to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help you.

        <description>

Today we just wanted to speak a little bit about the numbers we’re seeing in the marketplace.

Right now, there are over 10,000 people leaving the workforce a day across all industries. That’s creating quite a challenge, especially in skilled nursing and senior housing. We have a growing demographic of seniors that will be reaching their peak (in terms of the number of the folks over age 65) by the year 2026.

According to Stojce Milosevski, one of our great Client Account Managers who recruits in the senior housing industry, it’s getting extremely difficult to find qualified talent. What makes things even more difficult in the senior housing industry is the regulation. Operators, clinical staff, etc., all have to be licensed in the specific state that they operate in. We aren’t able to move them around from state to state without having to renew their certification. It makes things a little more difficult.

“What is your talent acquisition process like?”

The question I’ve been asking a lot of my business partners about this talent shortage is, “What is your talent acquisition process like?” There are a lot of different ways to go here. Maybe you hired an outside search firm, or you have good relationships with local colleges and universities. Maybe you’ve developed an internal program to grow your own talent to help fill the void. Make sure your strategy is down pat. The more consistency you have there, the more effective you’ll be at bringing in top talent.

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <title>How Will These 2 Gaps In the Market Impact Us?</title>

        <description>

The Govig Biopharma team has recently noticed two significant gaps impacting our market.

The first is the skill gap left by baby boomers who are retiring. The market as a whole is losing professionals at a rate of approximately 10,000 a day. This is expected to continue for about the next 20 years. While the younger generation is eager to step into these roles, their experience gap is substantial.

The second gap applies a bit more specifically to the biotech and pharmaceutical industries. Two of my colleagues recently attended a CEO conference, where one of the major topics discussed was the difference between key patient advocates and key opinion leaders. The industry is finding it more prevalent that patients are educating themselves in the market so they can actively participate in their long-term health care and affect where research and health care dollars are allocated.

There are only so many times a patient, lawmaker, or health plan sponsor can listen to a medical professional aligned with a specific therapy talk about the benefits or impact of a drug before it becomes insincere. There is a gap in the balance of physician endorsement and the testimony of people who have taken or needed the drugs and can talk about how it has improved their lives, as well as how it can improve the lives of others with the same diagnosis.

“The market as a whole is losing professionals at a rate of approximately 10,000 a day.”

It is shown that key patient advocates can create demand for research dollars, can put pressure and allow for a more favorable regulatory review, and can create pressure on payers and legislators to approve and pay for these drugs.

Because of these grassroots benefits and the ability to connect with patients on a higher level, more and more companies are putting a higher emphasis on key patient advocates.

Govig has spent over 20 years building relationships with companies and clinic candidates in the market. We are in a strong position to offer market information and advice to our clients on how to fill these gaps.

If you have any questions about this topic, please feel free to reach out to us. We’d love to be a valuable resource to you.

        <description>

Today, we’ll talk about how to approach a company that has a negative reputation both from the candidate’s and client’s perspective.

If you are a candidate looking at a company that has a tougher reputation in the market, the first thing we recommend is working with a recruiter. Talk to your recruiter and call out the elephant in the room. Have a very direct conversation with the recruiter. Talk about some of the things you’ve heard in the marketplace or through your colleagues. In general, it’s always best to get that insight on your own.

As a hiring authority, if a candidate comes in and asks about something that they’ve heard in the marketplace, it’s a great chance for you to clear the air about your organization. If your past has not been great and you’ve made some changes to your organization, hit it on the head and describe the changes you’ve made to make the candidate feel comfortable.

If you are in a situation where the company faces challenges moving forward, there are a lot of opportunities that lay in those situations. When you’re able to identify them and bring your skill set to that team or company, it’s a great place for you to shine as a candidate. These can be great opportunities for your career and give you the building blocks for a success story.

“As a candidate, have a frank conversation with your recruiter about what you’ve heard in the marketplace.”

As a hiring authority, it’s important to keep in mind that businesses are run by people. The reputations of those businesses depend on the reputation of those people. This is a great opportunity for you to bring in some of the top talents out there. Bring in the players who can change that reputation, and make sure that potential candidates meet standards to help turn the reputation around.

As a candidate, remember to take everything with a grain of salt.There are so many different channels of information, and you have to be able to decipher all of that on your own. There are a lot of different avenues you can pursue to learn more about a company, such as looking at social media. There is a lot of information that you can secure on your own, so make sure that you do your homework and make your own assessment of that company.

Finally, as an organization, you have to be proactive. Make sure potential candidates are able to review your organization by having a company Facebook page, LinkedIn profile, and GlassDoor page. Have testimonials from clients, customers, and employees. Your employee testimonials should describe what a day in the life looks like for this organization.

If you have any other questions for us, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

First, look at your current career today and ask yourself: Are you challenged? Are there possibilities for promotion in the future and are you well-positioned in terms of having an advocate internally who can help you with your career opportunities?

Next, look at your compensation. Think of it like you’re doing your taxes and look to see what you’ll earn this year and whether it’s competitive within the industry. If you don’t know that, you should do enough research to understand where your compensation is in terms of the range that is possible.

After that, look at your network. You’ll need to know who your mentors are, whether you’re effectively staying in touch with your network, and whether you should add an association or change one association out for another one or attend different conferences. You need to pay strong attention to who your network is and whether you’re keeping that network well-informed and active.

“Make sure your network is strong and keep up with innovation.”

Lastly, assess current market trends and any changes and innovations occurring within your industry. Ask yourself if you’re competitive against those changes and innovations. Is there training you can do, skills you should acquire, or conferences you should attend to increase the number of skills you have? Over time, you need to remain competitive as things change.

If you have any questions about how to do your annual career inventory, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you.

        <title>The United State's Growing Mental Health Problem</title>

        <description>

Over the past year, I have noticed a few trends related to mental and behavioral health. This area of healthcare has become more highly discussed in the United States recently. Mental disorders (e.g., bipolar disorder and schizophrenia) and behavioral disorders (e.g., addiction) have been making headlines with increasing frequency.

Even President Trump’s motion to declare the opioid epidemic a public health emergency shows us clearly that these issues are on the rise, and many Americans are suffering.

Now, I’d like to share some statistics that help better outline the severity of these issues. About 45.1 million adults were identified as having a mental illness in the United States last year. Of those adults, about 11 million have a mental illness that could be categorized as “severe.”

According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration, over 8.9% of people have co-occurring disorders. This means they suffer from both mental illness and substance abuse.

Up to one in four primary care patients suffer from depression, yet primary care doctors identify less than one-third of these patients. People with psychotic and bipolar disorders are 45% and 26% less likely, respectively, to have a primary care doctor than those without a mental illness.

Studies suggest that about 25% of all adults in the US have some form of mental illness and that nearly 50% of US adults will develop at least one mental illness in their lifetime.

“It is essential that we continue to drive awareness of these issues.”

Since 2016, the accidental death rate has been climbing largely due to the surge in opioid overdoses. Over 64,000 drug overdose-related deaths were reported in 2016, and overdose-related deaths have now overtaken motor vehicle crashes as the leading cause of accidental death.

With these statistics in mind, there is one fact we cannot ignore: There is a serious mental health workforce shortage in the United States. In states with the smallest mental health workforce, there are six individuals with at least one mental health disorder for every one mental healthcare professional. These professionals include psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, counselors, psychiatric nurses, and more. Mental health disorders are now more common than both heart disease and cancer.

With the emergence of telehealth technology, there’s a big opportunity for providers to expand their reach and increase the scope of treatment for their patients. It is essential that we continue to drive awareness of these issues and seek innovative solutions to handling the multitude of issues associated with mental illness.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Today, I’d like to talk to you about three things that I recommend to hiring authorities when looking to attract and employ millennial talent in today’s workforce.

As many of you may know, the millennial generation is currently the biggest generation in today’s workforce and will continue to be for years to come. As a millennial myself, I could tell you some things that I definitely considered when looking into a job, as well as what I hear day in and day out from other millennials.

There are three trends that I see in today’s workforce that millennials really look for: culture, compensation, and career opportunity.

Culture. Culture can be anything from how your employees interact with one another to how your office operates differently from other competitors or people in your space. They’re looking to make sure that your company is a good cultural fit.

Compensation. Look at competitor’s websites PayScale.com and Glassdoor.com to see what others are offering first-time employees and be sure that your compensation package is up to scale. I also recommend marketing this to millennials; they definitely want to know what kinds of benefits they’re getting.

Career opportunity. Millennials like to know if they can stay with the company and are able to grow. That doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re expecting to be promoted every six months, but they want to be given the opportunity to show what their abilities are and what they can provide the company.

“Millennials like to know if they can stay with the company and are able to grow.”

I hope you found this information helpful. If you have any other questions about hiring millennials, please feel free to reach out to us. We would be happy to help you!

        <description>

Today, I’m here to discuss LEED certification and how it can impact your organization.

“Green building practices” is one of the most popular buzzwords in today’s market, and with good reason. Did you know that it’s estimated that over $200 billion is going to be spent on green projects in 2018? With that comes an increase in employment.

In 2014, there were two million roles that were specific to green building projects. In 2018, it’s estimated that will increase by 1.1 million, resulting in about 3.3 million roles in the green building industry. That equates to about $76 billion in wages.

Companies are looking at how they can stay competitive. One of the areas that we’re finding to be the most significant in terms of success is that they’re offering to pay for LEED certification opportunities with their current employees.

“It’s estimated that over $200 billion is going to be spent on green projects in 2018.”

In turn, it’s showing the employee that the company is loyal to their future education.It’s also helping the company by having the opportunity to win these projects or be involved in them from a product perspective.

If you would like to know more, please feel free to reach out to me directly.

I recently had a conversation with one of my clients about Can’t Ask salary laws which made me realize that many of you might not be aware of how they work.

A few areas across the country have recently passed Can’t Ask salary laws. Like any new law, it can be a little complicated, so let me simplify it for you.

Three states and one city have these laws in effect: California, Massachusetts, Delaware, and New York City. Oregon has passed a Can’t Ask salary law that will go into effect in January of 2019. Philadelphia also passed a Can’t Ask salary law, but that has been delayed due to some court actions.

Basically, the law prevents you from asking potential candidates applying for a position about their previous or current salary.When I say salary, that encompasses the entire compensation package. You are allowed to ask what their salary expectations are if they were to make a move or accept a position within your organization.

“You cannot ask potential candidates about their salary.”

Now remember, this is not just for companies headquartered in that state; if you are filling any positions for your company within that state, these laws apply.

Can’t Ask salary laws are all-encompassing for companies and agencies.

If you do not follow these laws, you will get sued.

I’ve been studying this for quite some time. If you would like more information, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you.

        <title>How to Get Through a Dramatic Career Change</title>

        <description>

In recruitment, we talk to a lot of candidates who have made dramatic career changes. Through those conversations, we’ve been able to garner a lot of tips to help others make the transition through what can be a scary time in your career.

First, figure out who you want to work with. You can do this in a variety of ways. For example, you may request another interview or ask to shadow someone who has the job you are interested in.

You end up spending more time with the people you work with than your own family, so it’s really important to get an idea of the office culture. I enjoy working at Govig because we have that family culture. Requesting to shadow someone or asking for a team panel interview will help you with your daily happiness by surrounding yourself with people you like to work with.

“Take some time to decompress between roles.”

Next, don’t just sit back and wait. Be proactive. There are tools on LinkedIn that allow you to say you are open to opportunities. You don’t need to make a change in the next day or two, but you can be proactive and leave your door cracked open a little bit.

You can do that by making contact with recruiters or talking to people you value within the industry. Talk to people who are where you aspire to be. Always be networking.

Finally, make sure that you take some time to decompress between roles. Whether that means taking a week before starting your new job or adding a couple days to a weekend, I think it’s very important that you take the time to decompress and close that chapter in your life. You can also take that time to get excited about your next chapter.

        <title>How Can Millennials Enhance Your Business and Leadership?</title>

        <description>

Today, I want to talk about millennials and leadership.

Millennials grew up with structure. I can’t speak for anyone except myself, but I can tell you that I’ve never seen someone with structure and an understanding of appropriate expectations fail, unless the business just wasn’t for them, and sometimes that happens.

Millennials grew up with structure, but they also grew up with a strong desire to work autonomously and know that they can mess up and learn. I too would like to work autonomously, and sometimes that means we as managers have to redefine what it is that we want from millennials.

I grew up in an environment where SOS (show, observe, shape) was the most effective way to coach people. I would challenge to many people that it’s still a very effective way of coaching individuals. First, you show them. Then, you observe them. Finally, you shape them.

The interesting thing about millennials, however, is that they may want you to show them and then jump straight to having you shape them. They want to be in an environment where it’s allowed and encouraged to jump in, learn, try, make mistakes, and learn from those mistakes.

I understand that won’t make sense for businesses in all industries, but if you’re in an environment where you can allow millennials to jump in and start however they see fit, it’s beneficial to both them and your business. You would be amazed at some of the questions you have to answer because of their inquisitive minds and their need to know the “why.”

Millennials need strong leaders—not just leaders who will tell them what to do, but also why and how. If you can show that to them and then allow them to jump in, you will be amazed at how quickly and how much they thrive.

“Millennials think differently, and they’ll be able to enhance your business.”

The last point I want to address concerning millennials is their creativity. This doesn’t mean that every millennial can pick up a paintbrush and paint a Monet picture, but it does mean that they think differently. They think outside the box, so I encourage you—if you’re not sure how to take your business to the next level or you’re not sure what to do in a certain situation—to ask a millennial. They think differently, and they’re able to enhance your business.

We hear so often that it’s no longer a top-down approach in business, but rather a bottom-up approach. That bottom-up approach is asking for the insights and initiatives that you want to see from your millennials as they become the new leadership generation. They have such creativity that flows through them—not necessarily from an artistic standpoint, but they’re disruptors. They want to challenge the status quo, be more efficient, and thrive and learn.

I encourage you to embrace that and allow your millennials to let you understand where we should go instead of you telling them where they need to go. It will make a world of difference, and I’m so excited to hear how it has been impactful for you for the future.

If there is anything myself or my team can do for you or you have any questions about this topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help you.

        <description>

Today, I want to speak briefly about the things you should research and take into consideration when moving to another organization.

First, ask yourself: “What is the company’s primary service or product?” Once you’ve answered this, ask yourself if it is something you have the ability to stand behind and get excited about. If it’s not, it could be a challenge for you to work with this service or product on a daily basis.

Additionally, you should think about the company’s target market. Who are they trying to serve and impact? This factor will impact the things you’ll do on a daily basis.

On top of who the company is trying to reach, another thing to think about is what the company wants to be known for. Along with considering who the company wants to impact, it’s also important to know how they want to make that impact.

The age of the company will also matter. If a company just started, you may have the opportunity to come in and give some real input on how to improve or change certain aspects of the operation.  

“Think about who the company wants to reach and how they want to make that impact.”

Well-established companies also have benefits. When a company has been around for a while, you can feel certain about their track record of success.

However long a company has been in business, leadership matters. Before moving to an organization, determine who is on the leadership team and what experience they have. When you figure this out, you may even find common ground.

Another question you should be asking is, how much revenue have they generated? Also, who is their biggest competitor? Having this information from the beginning will be greatly beneficial to you as a potential member of any organization.

You should also know what strengths and weaknesses the organization may have. This information can be found through press releases and even social media.

With all of this information in mind, the final question to ask yourself is this: Why could you see yourself working for this organization?

This question will undoubtedly be asked of you in the interview process, so it may be a good idea to have your answer prepared ahead of time.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <title>How to Decide Between 2 Job Offers</title>

        <description>

So you’ve gone through the interview process and have received multiple job offers. First off, let me say congratulations. Once the celebration is over, you’ll need to make a decision. Here are five key factors to consider when determining which choice is going to be the best for you:

1. Your long-term career goals. You not only want to focus on what the job gives you today, but also where it puts you down the road. Don’t just think about those immediate results. Think about where you’ll be five or 10 years from now if you accept the job. Ultimately, you want to find more than a job. You want to find a career.

2. Salary. The simple answer here is to take the job that pays the most, but it can be more complex than that. Salary isn’t everything. Weigh the salary with the position itself and keep in mind that you can always negotiate.

“People don’t quit companies, they quit managers.”

3. The workplace culture. If you’ve ever worked with a recruiter before, then you know about the importance of company culture in your decision. Not only is a good culture fit beneficial to you, but it’s also a benefit to the company you choose to work for.

4. Compare the prospective managers. Most of the time, people don’t quit companies – they quit managers. Is the person you’re going to be working for somebody that you can learn and grow from? This person should definitely be a factor in your decision process.

5. Trust your gut. You’ll hear a lot from outside sources that tell you to take a certain job just because it pays more or because you get X or Y benefit. At the end of the day, it’s your decision. If you feel like it’s not the right one or you’re making it for someone else, take a step back and listen to what your gut is telling you. It’s usually right.

Deciding between two job offers can be tough, but it’s a much better problem to have than no job offers at all. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

This is the second of a three-part series about millennials and how they can be beneficial to your business. Last week, I discussed misconceptions about millennials, so this week I’d like to talk about rebranding our initiatives for them.
Finding Your &ldquo;Why&rdquo;

We should all have a “why” but to be honest, before I worked with millennials, I frankly hadn’t given it much thought. I went to college, got a degree, and I wanted to be successful. But when people asked me why, all I could really give them was a blanket statement. I wanted to do well in work, make good money, be able to support myself and my future family, and that was it. It was when a millennial really challenged me that I had to change my thinking and recognize that I needed to be able to offer them more as a manager.

One millennial asked, “Why do you get up in the morning?” I hadn’t even thought about it. Millennials want to know that they have purpose, to be able to see themselves progress into a career, and to understand the “why” to what we do and how they can do it so they can be successful.

It’s part of their career journey, part of their development, which has been very, very different from my own developing years. Many of us didn’t have to answer that question and we hadn’t really given it much thought. Today, I can confidently tell anyone I work with—millennial or otherwise—that I get up in the morning because I like to help personally and professionally develop my team. I like to help them reach their goals and succeed with the goals that I set for them. I want to see them grow and achieve levels they may never have thought they could. It’s my job, my duty, and my passion to get up every morning to help them.

“Millennials want to know that they have purpose”
Fun in the Workplace

It’s often said that millennials just want to have fun. Don’t we all? We work more than we do anything else in this life, and my thought is that if people really aren’t having any fun, then they already are, or could become, pretty miserable. Really understanding what “fun” means, especially to this newer generation entering the workforce, is so extremely important.

It used to be that “happy hours” were where people would go to have fun, blow off some steam, and talk about the week and the challenges we faced. Honestly, millennials may not find happy hours fun. Yes, happy hours are great for networking and camaraderie, but millennials are looking for something different.

I challenge you to really challenge the status quo by asking them what they want to do for fun.Don’t be surprised if their answer is something like an escape room, where they have to think, or giving back to a nonprofit or volunteering. Remember that millennials want a purpose and to know that what they’re doing is making an impact in the world today. By you changing your initiatives and understanding what fun is for them, it will prove to those millennials that you care as much about the bottom line as you do about impacting and benefiting the world.

Thank you so much for your time. If you have any other questions about this or other topics, please feel free to contact me. I’d love to help.

        <title>Ace Your Next Interview With the STAR Method</title>
        <link>http://govigblog.com/ace-your-next-interview-with-the-star-method.html</link>

        <description>

In today’s marketplace, more and more employers are using behavioral-based interviews. This style of interview is designed to examine applicants based on past behavior and performances.

A behavior-based interview might start off with questions like “Tell me about a time when . . .” or “Give me an example of . . .” Sometimes, people can be tempted to ramble when answering these questions.

But, there is a way to add structure to your answers. Today, I’d like to go over something called the STAR Method. Here’s how it works:

“S” stands for “situation.” The first part of your answer should explain the context of the situation you’re describing.

“T” stands for “task.” After you explain the situation, explain your role in it.

“A” stands for “action.” Describe what you did to overcome, fix, or address the situation.

“R” stands for “results.” What was the outcome of the situation?

“Following the STAR method creates a streamlined response instead of a rambling one.”

Now that you understand the STAR Method, let’s review an example.

Imagine you’re in an interview and are asked to recount a challenge you experienced at work. You might answer by saying something like, “I was hired on as a director of sales for an assisted living center, they were at 74% occupancy.” This portion of your response constitutes the “s”—the situation.

Then, you might continue with a phrase like, “It was my role to develop their referral lead base.” Now you’ve covered the “t” portion of your answer—your task.

After that you may tell them “I went into the marketplace and developed relationships with hospital systems and physician groups. I led marketing events and really became the face of the community. I developed long-standing relationships.” With this response, you’ve established your “a”—your action.

Finally, it’s time for your “r”—your results. In this scenario, you might finish by saying, “As a result, we grew to 95% occupancy within nine months of my tenure.”

Following the STAR Method creates a streamlined response instead of a rambling one. However, you still won’t know what questions you’re going to be asked when you’re going into the interview. My advice is to pull up qualifications, pull out hot buttons, pull out some skill sets, and get with the recruiter you’re working with. Have some stories relating to your qualifications and skill sets in mind as you enter the interview.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

For the past 15 years, I’ve been lucky enough to hire, train, and engage with Millennials.

There is a lot of negativity surrounding the subject of Millennials entering the workforce, but today I want to focus on some positives. Actually, millennials can bring a lot of benefits to a work place.

First of all, Millennials speak up about questions and concerns that past generations did not. This doesn’t mean they’re entitled, it just means they understand what they need in order to perform and be successful. Many times, Millennials simply want to understand the “why” of what they’re being told to do.

When I first joined the workforce, I wasn’t given that “why.” When I was assigned tasks, I was told to just do them, often without clear reason.

Millennials won’t just “go do” things. They want to understand why a given task is being asked of them, so that they can perform towards the best result.

“Millennials challenge the status quo because they’re always seeking out better alternatives.”

The second point I’d like to make is that millennials are disruptors. But, why is this a good thing?

I once had a supervisor tell me that it’s just because something had always been done one way, it doesn’t mean that the right way. That was a game changer for me. Millennials understand this. They challenge the status quo because they’re seeking out better alternatives.

Finally, Millennials are tech-savvy. In today’s technology-driven society, this is a great thing. Embracing the knowledge and skills of Millennial employees can be greatly beneficial to any business.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

With 2017 quickly coming to a close, companies are looking at their infrastructure and deciding how they want to enter 2018 in order to meet or exceed their sales goals.

It’s common in the building products industry, both commercial and residential, for companies to have a go-to market strategy with either independent agents, direct salespeople, or a combination of both. With the companies we deal with, we’re realizing that even the smaller ones need to make the transition from independent agents to direct salespeople in a lot of markets across the country.

“Independent agents don’t fully represent your product.”

There will obviously be smaller markets where it makes more sense to have independent agents because there is a fixed cost with direct salespeople that you don’t have with independent agents—you only pay them if they sell your product. However, the downside is they don’t fully represent your product specifically in the marketplace. Your time is split between the other products they sell.

A lot of companies are looking at the major markets, but they’re also bringing their focus down into the B-level markets where they’re transitioning from independent agents to direct salespeople in order to have a bigger and stronger breakthrough in that marketplace. They believe the growth in sales in those markets will heavily outweigh the small fixed costs involved.

If you have any more questions about this topic or you’d like to discuss it further, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to speak with you.

        <title>The Dating Game: How Interviewing for a Job and Finding Love Are Similar</title>

When I began my career at Govig &amp; Associates, I was an executive recruiter on our Biopharma team. I noticed that a lot of tenured executives would compare interviewing to dating. This was a curious comparison to me, but as I learned more, I realized that they were correct.

If it’s time to make a change, whether it be in your dating life or in your career, the steps are actually rather similar.

First, you’re going to prospect. You might join an online dating service, access your network, and agree to be set up on some blind dates. Before even agreeing to these, you’ll probably research that person on social media or ask your family and friends about them. You’ll want to learn more before agreeing to the setup.

In interviews, it’s the same thing. You’ll go to online job boards to search for jobs or companies that interest you. Before applying, you’d check a site like Glassdoor, look at stock information, or read news about the company trends they’ve gone through to provide more information.

Second, once you’ve decided to go on the date, it’s time for the first meeting. Most people don’t go on a first date with the intention of a marriage proposal at the end of it. It’s just a time to get to know one another. You ask questions, learn about each other, and decide if your interests and goals are similar.

This is very similar to the interview process. I stress to a lot of candidates that agreeing to go on a first interview is not a commitment to that job; it’s just a commitment to learning more about the company and for them to learn more about you. Use this to your advantage—ask good questions that will give you more serious information about the company.

Third, if the first date or interview went well, you’ll enter into a relationship. Sometimes this could lead to meeting family and friends, which I also call the team interview.

“Most people don’t go on a first date with the intention of a marriage proposal at the end of it.”

And if that all continues to go well, it could lead to the final stages. In dating, this would mean a marriage proposal. With a marriage proposal, there are a lot of logistical aspects that need to be organized: the timing, the ring, the delivery, and so on. Typically, a lot of things have been discussed with your partner before extending this proposal, so the likelihood of acceptance is rather high.

This is the same in the interview process when you get to the point of the job offer being extended. Like the proposal, many logistical aspects need to be put together: start date, compensation, title, etc. A lot of these will have already been discussed in the interview(s), so the expectations are managed appropriately and the likelihood of having the offer be accepted is high.

As you can see, dating and interviewing can be very similar. Both can be stressful and emotional, but we do them because the outcome for our personal and professional growth is positive.

If you have any questions, please feel free to email me directly.

Today I’m going to be talking to you about seven things you ought to bring to every job interview.

1. Directions and contact information. If you’ve never been to the location of your interview before, it’s important to have directions to your interview ahead of time and also have the contact information of your interviewer. In the event that you run late, you can let them know.

2. Identification. Just in case, you should bring a form of identification to the interview.

3. Notepad and pen. During your interview, you may want to take notes, record addresses, and/or write some questions. You’ll look more prepared if you bring your own materials.

4. Resume. I would suggest bringing at least 3 copies of your most updated resume. If you’ve made any changes, you can let them know what changes you’ve made. Bring extra copies in case other interviewers decide to join the process.

5. References. Have 3 professional references to provide to your interviewer, including your relation to the reference and their contact information, such as a cell phone number or email address.

6. A portfolio. This can depend on the type of job you’re after, but it may be good to bring a portfolio of your past work. This can be in a folder, a binder, or a tablet-friendly website. It should be very organized and easily referenced during your interview. The contents will depend on the profession, but it should have quality examples of your work and accomplishments regardless.

7. Questions. After every job interview, you’re going to be asked if you have any questions. You should be prepared with at least two or three specific questions to ask, whether they’re about the culture of the company, the hiring process, expectations of the position, and so on.

        <description>

When you’re a candidate that’s going in for a full day of interviews with a company, it can be daunting to have to talk to so many different people. You want to sound as fresh in the end as you do in the beginning, but that can be tough.

One thing I advise our candidates to do is to simply write down some specific questions for the people they’re interviewing with on different pieces of paper. Write down different, specific questions for each person.

However, you should also make sure that you ask a few of the same questions in every interview. By asking a bunch of different people in the company the same questions, you’ll get a better idea of how the company operates and communicates internally with the answers you’re given.

“Make sure to ask a few of the same questions in each interview.”

There’s nothing worse than making it through to the last interview of the day only to freeze up when they ask if you have any other questions. By creating these lists, you won’t have to pick through your brain or fumble over your words. The questions will be right there with you and you can get the answers.

I hope this helps. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

Today I’m going to talk about the six reasons why employees leave their organizations, and what you can do as an employer to make sure that you’re competitive in those areas to retain those employees.

The six main reasons for which an employee will leave their organizations are: challenge, location, advancement, money, people, and stability.

1. Challenge. Most employees want to feel challenged by the job that they’re doing. If they’re doing something monotonous, be sure to have some element the company can put in that will make the employee feel successful and accomplished.2. Location.Make it as easy as possible for employees to get to work. If you have an employee who lives far from their office, consider enacting the ability to do telecommuting, while making it as streamlined as possible to get to the location.3. Advancement.Employees want to feel like they have a path to excel in an organization and also have different areas where they can grow to fill different roles and have different responsibilities.4. Money. Compensate your employees competitively in the market to ensure that they’re not looking at your competitors, who are going to pay just a little bit more.

“Toxic cultures in the workplace drive employees away.”

5. People. You’ve heard the saying before: When an employee leaves their job, they don’t leave the company. They usually are leaving their boss. Make sure that you have a cohesive culture in your organization, and that the people in that organization are all moving forward with that same foot for success. Toxic cultures in the workplace drive employees away.

6. Stability.With a lot of mergers, acquisitions, and leadership changes taking place, ensure that your workplace has a stable footprint and your employee isn’t concerned about the rug being pulled from underneath them.

As an employer, if you’re effective in those six areas, you can certainly retain your best employees.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out and contact us. Have a great day!

What is the best way to execute a day of interviews with multiple people from the client perspective?

It’s becoming common practice for companies to bring multiple people into the interviewing process so they can determine not only if someone is right technically, but that they fit culturally from each individual perspective.

We’re also noticing that it’s becoming common practice for companies to bring in multiple candidates for interviews every hour or half hour so they’re all stacked right on top of one another.

“We’ve found this method to be tremendously successful with the companies we’ve helped with implementing it.”

We’ve found it to be more effective when companies leave a five- to 10-minute buffer between those meetings. The person who just interviewed the previous candidate can then download with the next person, not necessarily with the strengths, but with any concerns they had during that meeting that that next person can dive deeper into. Then, at the download time, they have something they can discus and they each went into it with a certain sense of what they were trying to accomplish during the meeting.

We’ve found this method to be tremendously successful with the companies we’ve helped with implementing it. Their meeting days are going much more effectively to identify the right candidates.

If you have any more questions about the hiring process or you have something else you’d like to discuss with us, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you.

        <description>

Today I want to discuss some strategies which can be used to manage the stress caused by changes happening in the market and around us every single day.

This kind of rapid change creates an overarching stress which can affect us in ways we don’t even realize. Stress impacts everything we do each day. If you don’t acknowledge it up front, a lot of issues can arise. So, to address all of the stressful and rapid changes that occur around us all the time, we must work to change ourselves.

First of all, create a goal sheet. This goal sheet should cover important aspects of your personal and business life. There are many ways to compile this information, but the important thing is that you organize and write down these goals. You should spend a significant amount of time thinking about and setting up this goal sheet.

Spend at least a half a day each month looking at this goal sheet and making sure that you are actually working toward what you set out to do. Examine the steps you have taken so far, as well as what steps you plan to take in the future. The reason this is so important is that control in our environment will decrease stress.

A big part of this goal sheet should focus on your finances. This is critical, because even a small change to your personal life or business could vastly impact your financial wellness. Make sure you have a plan B. Without a plan in place for the unexpected, managing changes can become much more stressful.

“To address all of the stressful and rapid changes that occur around us all the time, we must work to change ourselves.”

Stress can take away your options. A lack of options means that you will be more likely to make bad decisions. These forces will put you into a spiral. So, make sure that you have a plan from the start before the spiral begins.

The last way to handle change is to manage your personal stress. How you achieve this is up to you. We are all different, but one thing we all have in common is the hectic nature of life. If you don’t take time to slow yourself down and do the things that give you inner harmony, you are not going to fare well in the long term.

You may not realize it, but stress can negatively impact your relationships, business, and even your health. You could combat this stress by leaving your phone at home during your morning run or by spending some time with family. You could even try yoga. Whatever you do, be conscious about your level of stress as you move forward in your daily life.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Today I’m going to talk about references—the appropriate time to ask for references, and who to ask for a reference.

References are a vital step in securing a new role. It gives prospective employers a chance to get insight into your background, your successes and shortcomings in different areas, and how you addressed those in the past.The best time to ask for references is when you’re near the end of a search process. You may have gone through several interviews and are expecting an offer here shortly. You want to reach out to the references you have listed and give them a heads up that they may get a call from either a recruiter, HR, or a hiring authority. Give them the authority to give transparent feedback about you and your character.

“References are a vital step in securing a new role.”

The best person to ask to be listed as your reference would be your most recent supervisor. As a new hiring authority, they really want to hear from a previous supervisor about the best way to manage you, how you excelled, how you acclimated yourself to a previous company, as well as your shortcomings.

If you worked in teams before and had co-workers whom you knew and trusted, those would also be a great reference for you. This would give prospective employers insight on how you worked in a team environment

Lastly, if you’re new to the workforce and you haven’t had a lot of work experience but have recently graduated, a professor would be an excellent person to reference. They can share how you performed within their class and how you fit into various projects you may have done.

If you have any other questions about when to ask for references or who you should ask to be your reference, feel free to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help.

        <description>

Whether you’re just starting out in a position or you’ve been there for a while now, there are plenty of things you can do to improve your opportunities for leadership within the company in the future.

The biggest piece of advice I can give is to be visible. One good way to do that is by attending Toastmasters. Everyone can use the training and practice to become better speakers and presenters. When you’re effective at that, it gives you many more opportunities to be visible in the future.

The next thing I would advise is to pay attention to Harvey MacKay. He’s one of the best out there when it comes to writing about leadership and leadership skills. Subscribe to any of his newsletters or read any of his books and you’ll see what I mean. The techniques and tips he offers are invaluable.

“Do the small things.”

Finally, do the small things. Come in early. Ask if you can help with a project that may be a bit outside of your wheelhouse. Make yourself visible in front of others you don’t normally work with. Putting yourself out there makes you available for opportunities you don’t even know about yet.

These are just a few tips for getting ahead and becoming a better leader. If you need any more tips or have any other questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

To hiring managers, little things truly do make a big difference. What exactly does that mean for you?

Because of the high volume of people hiring managers interview, standing out is critical. Qualifications aside, being memorable can greatly improve your chances of nailing an interview.

If you are the only one of 10 interviewees who differentiates themselves, you are already in a better position than the rest.

There are a couple things that have made a difference for us here at Govig &amp; Associates. First is having handwritten notes. In today’s technologically-inclined world, handwritten notes are not only different, but also show that you have a high level of interest.

Next, include a lot of detail in follow-up emails. Following up after an interview is essential, but going a step above by talking about what you learned and why you’re a good fit can really set you apart from other applicants.

“Being memorable can greatly improve your chances of nailing an interview.”

In any email communication, though, be very careful of your spelling, grammar, and punctuation. This not only shows the hiring manager your interest level and your writing abilities, but also your sense of email etiquette.

Subconsciously, humans tend to judge other people based on their appearances within the first 30 seconds of meeting them. This first impression is critical, so it’s important to dress for success. You don’t need an expensive outfit, but choose one that fits well and looks clean and professional.

Your first impression should also extend to your actions, too. When greeting your interviewer, have a firm handshake with eye contact. This shows confidence and control.

Last but not least, remember the hiring manager’s name. People tend to subconsciously like you more when you repeat their name at some point in the conversation. It shows that you pay attention and also gives a personal touch.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

The first 90 days are essential to ensuring a successful transition. We’ve got some tips to share that will help you make the first 30, 60, and 90 days of your transition a success.

The first 30 days is a learning stage. At this point, you want to be a sponge and absorb as much information as you can about the company, its culture, leadership, and more. This is when you should start to form relationships with coworkers. The most important part is to understand your boss’ expectations and how to meet and exceed them.

The next 30 days are when you can start making a difference by understanding problems within the company better and how you can contribute to its growth.

“The first 90 days are essential to your transition.”

The last 30 days of the first 90 days is the transformation stage. This is where you become a full-fledged member of the organization. This is a time when people join clubs or committees within an organization. The big thing to remember here is to avoid the mistakes you made in the previous 60 days.

If you have any questions for us about how to have a successful transition or anything else, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.

There are three little things that tend to separate good candidates from the rest in the interviewing process

First, make sure that you’re standing up during the phone interview. Sitting down compresses the diaphragm and naturally makes you sound as though you aren’t engaged or excited about the conversation. Phone interviews are difficult—you need to make sure you’re  concerned with engaging the other person on the phone. You should be truly invested in the conversation, as opposed to focusing on taking notes and being afraid that you’ll miss something important. That energy level is the No. 1 knockout factor in telephone interviews today.

Second, follow up with any type of correspondence within 24 hours. This includes email, voicemail, or text. Response time is absolutely indicative of someone’s excitement level—companies want to hire someone who is excited about the opportunity and the organization itself.

“Companies want to hire someone who is excited about the opportunity and the organization itself.”

Third, respond with “thank you” emails quickly, and proof them first. In today’s world, emails have become a widespread tool used in almost every capacity, but the issue is that many are being sent over the phone. There are spelling and grammatical mistakes all around. Instead, write these emails from a computer, where you’ll be able to review the email more closely and make any edits you need before you send it. Additionally, since these emails will probably be read from a phone, any email that takes longer than two swipes to read will probably be ignored or unfinished. Keep them short and concise, but customize them to the person you met with.

I hope these tips help you! Feel free to contact us for any questions you have. Thanks for watching, and have a great day!

What are the factors that lead someone to make a job change? When people seek a career change, the reason usually comes down to one of six things.


  Challenge. If they feel that their current position lacks challenge, a person may feel inclined to leave. People who seek out opportunities to learn and grow in their career are unlikely to feel satisfied in an environment that doesn’t challenge them.
  Location. Mileage isn’t the only factor that goes into this point. People may also be put off by the location of their job or the length of time they must spend during their commute to get there. This can additionally reflect a change in an employee’s life. While commuting for an hour might work for someone at first, they might change their mind at a later time.
  Opportunity. Many people seek out opportunities for advancement in their career. If a person’s current job lacks these kinds of opportunities, they aren’t likely to stay around. Clearly defined advancements being available within an organization are important to people who seek these kinds of opportunities.
  Money. Surprisingly, money is not the primary factor that people tend to change jobs. While financial security is important, people tend to care more about other factors. Money may, however, tip the scale if an employee has another reason for wanting to leave.
  Social environment. Since we spend more time working than we do at home, our work environments must be well-suited to our individual social needs. If someone feels that they don’t fit in with the culture and the people at their workplace, they are likely to leave.
  Job security.If a person sees a lot of layoffs in their organization, they might feel inclined to leave, as well.


Being aware of these reasons can actually also help you with new and future goals, as you will be able to assess these points going into the interview process.

        <title>How Does Interview Scheduling Work?</title>

        <description>

If you’re looking to hire someone in a specific time frame, the easiest way is to go through the process of interview scheduling.

First, look at what the start date needs to be and which day that is.Usually, the departing employee will put in a two-week notice, so just back that date up by two weeks. Then, consider how long it takes for you to put out an offer. Since this usually takes a couple days, back the date up two more days—that’s the day the final interview should take place. 

Next, look at your hiring process, figure out how many interviews you have during that time frame, and continue to back the date up realistically according to how long it takes to get feedback from the people involved in this process. Keep backing up those dates and mark your calendar for what day that particular part of the process must happen. 

“Don’t get caught in a holding process.”

After that, ask yourself how long it typically takes you to find a candidate. In today’s market, even though there are a lot of opportunities out there, it’s usually a 30-day process from when you launch the project to the time you have a shortlist of candidates to interview. 

Marking this final date not only puts something specific in place for you, but it also allows the people involved in the interviewing process to tentatively mark their calendars on the dates you need those interviews scheduled. This way, you don’t get caught in a situation where certain people are traveling and you can’t pin them down for a particular date and now everyone’s in a holding process. It also allows candidates to make the appropriate concessions if they have to travel for interviews. 

If you have any questions about interview scheduling, please feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We’d be happy to assist you.

As a manager, how can you be an effective interviewer?

A majority of people spend somewhere around five minutes preparing themselves for an interview. For some managers, this preparation may not even be done until right before the interview itself.

Giving a quick glance at someone’s resume before you interview them simply isn’t enough. However, taking even just 10 to 15 minutes longer to prepare yourself will make you much more effective at selecting an ideal candidate.

First of all, make sure you have a firm understanding of the job description. Whatever position you are interviewing candidates for, it is always a good idea to look back at past employees who performed well in that specific role.

Ask yourself what soft and hard skills that prior employees had that made them the best fit for that position. As a reminder, soft skills refer to things such as one’s ability to communicate well whereas hard skills are concerned with technical adeptness.

“A candidate must fit in with company culture”

Next, remember to have questions in mind that will help you determine specific attributes in a candidate. Asking a candidate about obstacles they have overcome in the past and how they were able to do so is a good way to start.

It’s important to remember, too, that a candidate must fit in with company culture. Determining how well a candidate will be able to act on a team, and how well you think they will act on your team specifically, is critical.

No matter what skills a candidate has, they will not be a good fit if they are unable to match company culture.

Finally, you should pay close attention to whether or not the candidate appears interested and motivated throughout the interview. An ideal candidate should be excited and well-prepared for the interview and should be able to express that they are enthusiastic about the position.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <title>3 Ways to Identify the Ideal Team Player</title>

        <description>

Recently, I read a book called “The Ideal Team Player” by Patrick Lencioni that really got me thinking. The book is written in a classic, parable style that really illustrates its point: what does it mean to be the ideal team player?

A question I hear a lot from people starting at our company is, “What does it take to be successful here?” In the past I told them we looked for people with great work ethic and people who fit into the company culture.

Those things are still important, but now since reading Patrick’s book I tend to follow his model. The three things he looks for are whether a potential employee is humble, hungry, and smart.

First, what does it mean to be humble? Well, we’ve all had experiences with one person or another who was simply nauseating with their ego. Ironically, this behavior is usually rooted in insecurity.

“What does it mean to be the ideal team player?”

On the other end of the spectrum, it’s also not good for an employee who is better than they realize to be too timid to lean into their talents. Striking a balance between utilizing talent but not becoming big-headed is key.

The second trait, hunger, includes not only work ethic but also a willingness to learn and grow. A person who is truly hungry for knowledge and growth will have a lot to offer for a company.

Finally, the third trait is to be smart. Here, the most important thing is to be specifically “people-smart.”  Being able to motivate and uplift the people around them is a sign of a person who will go far in their career.

These three great traits are really what defines a person as being the ideal team player.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

What types of positions are we seeing being implemented back into the marketplace today, and what types of positions do we typically work on?

When the market turned, we began to see organizations start to downsize or rightsize. Currently, they are feeling very optimistic that the market is heading back in the right direction, so we’re seeing more opportunity in individual roles in sales and product development.

Companies are realizing that their employees were spread way too thin during the economic downturn, especially salespeople. They weren’t able to be value-added employees in the marketplace because they were spread just way too thin.

“We place many types of roles.”

Companies are getting a little more sophisticated in their processes, and they are asking us to look for people who have a production process background or StageGate, or some type of formalized process that they’ve worked through from conception to implementation.

We place other roles as well. In 2016, we placed 540 people, and 114 of those were at the VP level or higher. Those higher roles aren’t going to be as common in a company, but sales and production jobs are much more plentiful.

If you have any questions about this topic or you need anything at all, please don’t hesitate to give us a call.

        <description>

Networking is an essential part of any career. However, it can also be a task which some find overwhelming. 

Like trips to the dentist, networking is something you know you’re supposed to do, but would really rather not. This is especially true for people are simply introverted by nature.

But today I have some tips that can help you become proficient at networking. First of all, make yourself the kind of person that people want to meet. There are a few ways to do this. One way is to become an expert in your field. You can also be someone who is highly aware of the changing dynamics in your industry. 

“Networking is about quality, not quantity.”

Offering your help to people who need it is going to be a great way to put yourself out there as the kind of person people want to meet and know.

This leads into our next tip, which is to be more interested in other people than you are in yourself. Many people you’ll encounter in both life and business will be happy to have the opportunity to talk about themselves. When you show genuine interest in the people around you, they’ll be much more interested in you in turn. 

Networking is about quality, not quantity.

However, with that being said, you should put yourself out there in as many ways as you can. A great way to do this is by using business cards. But merely going out and handing your business card to everyone you meet will not be effective. The best way to use your business card is to give it out as part of a trade.

When you give out your business card, it should be to someone from whom you are receiving one. When you get that business card, write down something relevant to the conversation you had with that person so that when you follow up with them it’ll be much easier to reconnect. 

Finally, joining a club can be another great way to network. Pick a club you are genuinely interested in, and you are sure to meet members with similar interests. 

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

How can you stand out against competitors in an interview?

The simple answer is research. More often than not, candidates come to an interview dressed professionally and ready to answer any questions about their background or resume, but usually fall short when asked any questions about the company or the position that they applied for. 

Coming prepared to an interview is a clear indication that you are actually interested in the company and the position you applied for. If you research the company beforehand, you will actually be more comfortable in the interview. If you know the company’s goals, you are more equipped to ask well thought-out questions, which in turn impresses the interviewer and shows that you can come prepared in any situation.

If you research the position beforehand, you can tailor your answers to help the interviewer understand that you can or cannot do the tasks that are required. If you cannot, you can either show them a close example of the task required or show them a reason why you think you can.

“Coming prepared to an interview is a great indication that you are actually interested in the company and the position you applied for.”

Another reason to research the position is that it gives you a chance to ask about the career growth or how to gain more responsibilities while you’re at that company. The answers the interviewer gives you can be a great indicator for you to determine if this is the right path for you and the next step in growing your career. 

You should also research the position so that you can explain to the interviewer what you understand about it and they have the chance to fill it any gaps or correct any information that you might have missed.

To illustrate why it’s important to do your research, I have an example of a recent interview I did. One of the two candidates had a great background and resume, but when they sat down with me, they didn’t even know what position they had applied for. 

The second candidate I interviewed didn’t have the strongest resume, but came to the interview with well prepared questions and truly was interested in and wanted to learn more about the position. The second candidate was the one who moved forward in the process as a result.

If you come to the interview dressed professionally and prepared with your research of the company and the position, it will go a long way to helping you get to the next step.

If you have any other questions about this topic, please give me a call. I would be happy to assist you!

Today I want to talk about leadership in the workplace. How can you create an autonomous group that is productive, highly creative, and engaged?

The fundamental thing that you need to learn to do effectively is how to delegate and not micromanage. It’s really difficult from a management perspective to learn this, but if you do you will see unprecedented levels of production, engagement, and retention on the teams you oversee.

Here are the baseline things to do when you are creating an autonomous group. As you delegate, give them parameters within which they can make decisions that are away from the standard. Give them authority to make those decisions and take risks. In doing so, you need to be able to create a space where they can make mistakes and you are able to back them up and help them learn from them should they happen.

“If you can delegate without micromanaging your employees, you will see great levels of growth and success.”

If a person feels like there will be significant personal ramifications for failures, then it’s difficult for them to take those risks that could be beneficial to the projects they are working on. 

What I would recommend to help you delegate to your employees without feeling completely out of control as a manager is to have them send you an outline of what they accomplished during their work day. This way you’re able to keep a record of their progress on an ongoing basis. This will help you, as well help them see what progress they’re making.

Lastly, if you can delegate without micromanaging and allow your employees to feel autonomous, what will happen is your people will feel fulfilled, creative, like they are trusted and respected, and they will be able to grow quickly in terms of their skillsets and abilities.

If you have any other questions about this or any other leadership topic, please give me a call. I would love to help you.

        <title>Why Leaders Need Feedback</title>
        <link>http://govigblog.com/why-leaders-need-feedback.html</link>

        <description>

The thing about great leaders is that they are also great followers. 

One of the biggest struggles faced by leaders is how hard it is to get constructive, positive feedback. Unsolicited, constructive feedback is something leaders desperately seek and need. 

Sure you can approach people to ask them directly for an evaluation of things like a decision you’ve made, but in those cases you run the risk that they may simply tell you what they think you want to hear. 

Unfortunately, this kind of feedback simply isn’t helpful in determining whether you’re on the right track as a leader. 

To illustrate this, I’d like to share a personal example of a time within my own organization where I was unable to get any feedback. Years ago someone mentioned to me the idea of using two monitors on a desk instead of one. While this is common today it certainly wasn’t at the time because monitors often cost between $600 and $700 a piece.  

“Opening the lines of communication between leaders and followers is essential.”

Nevertheless, we went and bought about eight monitors, put them up, and waited to see what everyone thought. 

The waiting went on for what seemed like an indefinite amount of time and it wasn’t until a couple of months later that I was able to get enough feedback to validate the decision. 

At this point, we were sitting with a budget of about $30,000 lined up to fund getting multiple monitors for the rest of the organization but were set back by three months before we were able to proceed simply because people were so unwilling to respond.

Opening the lines of communication between leaders and followers is as essential as realizing that great leaders are great followers. No matter where you are, you ought to look for ways of providing feedback to the people making decisions. 

If you want more information or have any questions, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

Over the last six months, I’ve been sending out videos answering questions that you send in. Today, I wanted to take a little bit of a different approach and update you on where our Building Products practice stands today.

Over the last six to eight months, we have been experiencing a higher hiring demand because of the growth that our clients are experiencing. We found that in order to continue to service you with the quality that we’ve had in the past, we’ve had to add to the team. As an organization, we have invested a tremendous amount back into the Building Products side. 

Recently we added seven new employees, five of which are executive recruiters and two are full-time internet researchers. These internet researchers are helping fulfil the pipeline needed in order for our clients to continue to receive high quality service from our executive recruiters, and to free up the recruiters to talk to the candidates in the marketplace.

“We specialize with manufacturers and distributors.”

Each of the executive recruiters on this team reach out to nearly 100 people each day. Our team is 13 people strong, reaching out to 100 people each every day in this industry. That’s an average of 1300 people each and every day. That enables us to continue to remain dialed in to what’s going on in this industry.

As a reminder, we do specialize with manufacturers and distributors, both in the residential and commercial sides. We also work with interior products as well as exterior products in all types of roles within the organization. 

My recommendation is to reach out with one of our consultants. Whether you’re somebody that has a need on a proactive basis or reactive basis, either from a company perspective or on a personal level, call, email, InMail, or just connect with a consultant on LinkedIn so that they can keep you up to speed on what’s happening in the market. 

If you have a hiring need that you’d like to discuss, or you’re looking to schedule a career consultation, please give us a call. We’d be happy to help!

        <description>

Many candidates have difficulty closing an interview. Here are three of the most effective ways to end the interview and impress the hiring manager:

1. Ask if there is anything else you can provide.How do you phrase that question? Simply say, “Is there any additional information I can provide to help you make this decision?” They may ask you to clarify an earlier answer, provide work samples, or give them your references.

2. Ask questions about the opportunity and the company.I cannot stress how important this is. Asking questions shows that you are interested in the opportunity and have done some research prior to the interview. Write down at least five questions before the interview. Inevitably, the hiring manager will answer the majority of your questions, so having them written ahead of time will give you something to fall back on.

“Write down at least five questions before your interview.”

3. Ask about the next steps in the interview process. Ask what the next steps are and what the timeline looks like. That way, you can manage your expectations by knowing the hiring manager’s exact process. This question also gives you a reason to follow up with the hiring manager if you have not heard back from them in the time period they promised.

These three questions will definitely help you close the interview and make a positive impression on the hiring manager. If you have any other questions about preparing for the interview process, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

What does the ideal team player look like?

I recently read a book by Patrick Lencioni called “The Ideal Team Player,” and the premise of this book is that when the author hires for his team or assesses his team, he hones in on three main traits: humble, hungry, and smart.

“Humble” is pretty self-explanatory because you don’t want a team member who is arrogant or egocentric. Someone who is humble and plays well with others will put the team before themselves. Herb Brooks said it best in “Miracle,” the name on the front of the jersey should always be more important than the name on the back.

Someone who is hungry will want more responsibility, will want to learn more, and be self-motivated. They won’t need to be micromanaged.

“Someone who is hungry will want more responsibility, to learn more, and be self-motivated.”

Finally, when he says someone is “smart,” it’s not the first thing you think of when it comes to intelligence. In this context, it refers more to being socially smart. A smart team member knows how to read people, knows how they’re perceived, and is aware of their social presence in a conversation.

With these traits, there are also three extremes to be aware of as well. Someone who is too humble could be afraid to contribute or speak up when it could benefit their team. Someone who is too hungry can be a steamroller, rolling over anyone at any cost to succeed. Someone who is too socially smart might be considered a schmoozer who tells you everything you want to hear, even when it might not be the truth.

If you’d like to talk further about how these traits affect a team dynamic or you’d like to talk more about your career, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to hear from you.

        <description>

What are the top leadership skills? There are really quite a few skills we’d like to cover, so this video is the first of a bimonthly series on this topic. The first skill I wanted to focus on is how to navigate relationships in the workplace, or conflict resolution.

Conflict resolution is not a topic that most people are eager to discuss. However, fundamentally, it is one of the most important things you can learn how to do and learn how to be effective at. This is because everything is team-oriented today. We rarely see business environments that don’t have people somehow involved in a team. Plus, it’s a management skill; how do you create teams that are effective, efficient, and that have good communication?

“Everything is team-oriented today.”

Patrick Lencioni’s book “The Five Dysfunctions of a Team” helped me significantly in learning and mastering this particular leadership skill and I recommend it highly for anyone who is interested. The process of conflict resolution is:

1. Identify the problem and decide what the end goal will be and why that outcome will be beneficial.
2. Craft your language with an objective third party.
3. Have a meeting with the person you have a concern with. Be straightforward with the issue right away.
4. Compliment the person on their good aspects to diffuse any kind of defensiveness they may have as you discuss the issue.
5. Move on to what your concern is, what your end goal is, and why that would be beneficial to both that person and the team as a whole.
6. Ask for feedback.

It sounds simple, but you need to practice this tactic. It is fundamental to not only leadership within a group, but also how effectively you can manage and navigate relationships as you progress to management.

In our next video, we’ll talk more about leadership skills. If you have any questions about this or any other topic we’ve covered, please don’t hesitate to reach out. We’d be happy to help!

        <description>

We recently had a question about how to better handle telephone interviews or virtual (Skype) interviews. I am going to elaborate a little bit on this topic today.

In both of these instances, you want to make sure you’re prepared and know your skills, your accomplishments, and how those things benefit the person you’re interviewing with. Secondly, you want to make sure you’ve done your research on the hiring authority, their background, and their accomplishments. Finally, you’ve got to do your research on the company. The more prepared you are, the more confident you will be.

“In either instance, you want to be prepared.”

For telephone interviews, the best tip I have for you is to stand up. By standing up, you will have more energy in your voice and in terms of how you bring across the information that is relevant in the interview.

When you’re doing a Skype interview, it’s not as simple. You typically have to sit down in that situation, so standing up can be difficult. The big thing to remember is to keep distractions at a minimum. That means making sure everything shown on camera is neat and anyone else in the house with you knows to keep loud noises at a minimum for the duration of your interview.

If you have any questions about this topic or want to learn more interview tips, give me a call or send me an email. I would be glad to discuss this topic further with you.

        <title>A Few Outside the Box Hiring Tips</title>

        <description>

How do companies in this industry grow faster than the industry average? The common denominator is that they think outside the box when bringing new people on board.

When you think about it, every company is basically looking to fill their roles by looking at the same criteria. You want someone with product experience, selling experience, and a proven track record. The only thing that separates the top companies from the average ones is the culture of the organization. In fact, a recent USA Today study concluded that 85% of the people that were hired only had 65% of the actual criteria they were looking for.

Companies are hiring people who fit their culture as opposed to people who have the exact skill sets they are looking for. They are thinking outside the box about what skills could be transferrable from a similar industry just by teaching the product. 

“We’ve had success recruiting pharmaceutical reps”

When we look for A&amp;D reps, we certainly would love to find someone with that experience, but we also have had a tremendous amount of success actually recruiting pharmaceutical reps. A&amp;D reps update libraries, work with a designer to influence them to specify their product on a particular project, and they do lunch and learns. Pharmaceutical reps have a very similar transactions with their doctors. They influence the doctor to write the scripts, work with the office in updating samples, and do lunch and learns. As you can see, those skills are very transferrable and this strategy has been very successful for the companies we have worked with.

When you’re thinking about hiring, thinking outside the box is important. Don’t go down that normal track because you have the same people always cycling through the industry, just with a different business card. Be different and be bold.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>
Making a better hiring decision boils down to three questions you should ask yourself when interviewing any candidate for your organization.

First, can do they do the job? Do they have the mental ability, skill set, and personality to do the job well? If they don’t have the skill set to do the job well, do you have the ability to train them and teach them the required skills to get them up to speed quickly to give you a return on investment for that hire?

“The best candidate is not always the right candidate.”

Second, can they do the job long term? Do they have the aspirations to be at the job long term? If they don’t, do you have a timeline that aligns with theirs or can you give them additional responsibilities or a promotion to keep them engaged in your organization in the long term?

Finally, are they the right fit for the team? The best candidate is not always the right candidate. The team culture is very important, so they need to fit the mold and fit to the culture while also performing.

If you have any questions about this topic, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!

        <description>

If you just finished college but you aren’t sure what you want to do or how to enter the business world, then you’re not alone. If you want a successful career, there are two things that you need to understand. 

First of all, you need to be aware of the latest demographic trends and how they will affect your career. Baby boomers are retiring at a rate of 10,000 people a day. There simply aren’t enough experienced people to replace the baby boomers, which creates an opportunity for up and comers. 

Secondly, I recommend that you read “Outliers” by Malcolm Gladwell. This is a great book and its fundamental thesis is that it takes 10,000 hours for you to become really good at any skill set. From athletics to music to software programming, you need 10,000 hours of experience to fully understand the skills needed for the job. 

“Choose a job that you can develop a passion for and stick with it.”

As a recent college graduate, you need to figure out how you can combine the demographic trends with the 10,000 hour rule. 

Rather than following what appears to be the millennial career path of having 16 different jobs with 20 different companies in three years, find something that you can develop a passion for over time. The problem with frequently changing jobs is that you are never in one place long enough to get really good at one particular job. If you spend 10,000 hours—which roughly equals five years—in one career, then you will be extremely knowledgeable about that particular area.   

It takes awhile to understand the common knowledge of the domain, and it takes even longer to know the uncommon knowledge that gives the top 1% their competitive edge. That uncommon knowledge is not a secret; you just don’t have enough knowledge to really execute the job properly until you have been there long enough to know the common knowledge. 

So, you need to go into an area where you can develop some passion for the job and learn all about it. Since baby boomers are retiring in droves, there will be plenty of opportunities for you down the line. By spending all your time on one career path, you will have a leg up on other millennials who have had a few different jobs and aren’t especially good at any one thing. 

Companies are dying to hire people who know their space and can bring value to the table. To be successful in your career, you need to become that person. 

If you have any other questions about entering the real world of business, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

The Affordable Care Act was designed to provide health care coverage for those who didn’t have insurance, so how is it affecting the nursing home industry?

Within the nursing home industry, most residents do have some form of coverage whether it’s Medicare, Medicaid, or an HMO, so the thought was that the impact the Affordable Care Act would have on the nursing home industry would be small, if any.

The unforeseen consequence is that it really exacerbates the shortage and the demand for physicians. It adds strain on the number of medical professionals available. In fact, by the year 2025, there will be a shortage of 52,000 primary care physicians for a few reasons. The first is that very few study nursing home care while in medical school. Second, regulations are often very high, and third, the pay is often lower for that type of role.

“By the year 2025, there will be a shortage of 52,000 primary care physicians.”

There are, however, a few things that management of nursing home facilities can do to make sure they are aligned strongly with a physician for their community.

First, take an executive approach to make sure your administrator and the director of nursing build a good rapport with physicians in your marketplace. If the medical community hires a new physician, your administrator should invite them out to get a feel for your community and introduce them to the care you provide.

Again, physicians want to have a rapport built with key executives, like the administrator and director of nursing. Ensuring that rapport is built will have you on your way to having a physician in your corner.

If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!

        <description>

I recently got asked a great question by a friend of mine whose son was graduating from college and looking to go into a sales career. So, today I’m answering the question, “What should you look for in a company when looking for a career in sales?”

The number No. 1 I would look for in a company when seeking a sales career is if the company is sales driven. Companies can be marketing driven, research driven, or distribution driven, but you want to make sure you’re with a sales driven company.

For example, a marketing driven company would be Visa. They are great at marketing and have great brand identity across the world. A research company would be a company like 3M, which is phenomenal with their research and development which leads to them producing fantastic products.

“If you want a lasting career in sales, make sure the company is sales driven.”

A sales driven company is a company that places a high value on salespeople, and as a result they are compensated accordingly. One question I would ask the president or CEO to find out if a company is a sales driven company is, “What do you do when your top sales rep makes more money than you?” A company that would see that as a problem is not a sales driven company, whereas a company that says they would send them on a trip, buy them a watch, reward them, or ask them to teach other reps is a sales driven company.

If you want to have a career in sales, your best earning potential and long-term potential is going to be with a company that understands and respects sales and rewards people accordingly.

If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m always happy to help!

Does your hiring process impact the brand of your company? The simple answer is yes.

Companies create marketing experiences for customers in order to drive positive engagement. They are now realizing that they need to do the same thing for the candidates that come through to interview.

Given that the candidate-driven market continues to be a reality for the executive, managerial, and professional labor levels, employers should give more consideration to the lasting impression that they leave.

Companies should really think about the interview process as a critical part of the strategy in communicating their brand and organizational culture. After all, applicants will communicate their interview experience in the marketplace through social media or conversations with their peers.

“Make sure that you have an efficient interview process.”

To make sure that your company’s hiring process is in line with its mission, values, and business goals, I recommend avoiding these two simple contradictions:

1. Having an inefficient interview process when the company claims to be cutting edge. It’s very important that when someone comes in for an interview, they know exactly who they will be interviewing with, why they are interviewing with that person, and how long the interview will take. The more buttoned-up that process is, the better impression your company will have on the candidate. The candidate will believe that the company has strong communication skills, knows what they are looking for, and has the ability to get things done in a timely manner.

2. Taking too long to hire candidates when the company claims to value speed. When a company has people in the hiring process and cannot give them feedback or takes too long to get the candidate through the process, then the candidate thinks the company may not know how to make a decision. That can scare candidates away from a company because they want to know that when they are hired, it will be easy to get things done.

These two things seem very simple but can become very difficult to execute, especially if your company is bigger. Regardless of the size of your company, just remember that your hiring process can impact your company’s brand.

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

Your employer brand is just as important (if not more important) than the product and the services you provide as an organization. Companies that attract top talent are the ones that have a proactive approach to strengthening their employer brand.

There are three specific tools you can use to strengthen your brand as an employer to attract top talent:

1. Glassdoor.com: This is a community where current employees can rate their employer. They can rate the CEO, the interview process, the CEO’s vision for the company, and the company as a whole. Good, bad, right, or wrong, employees can leave feedback, and as a prospect, this is one of the first places you want to look to see if it’s an organization you want to work for. Companies who do this well take a proactive approach to commenting on this feedback. Commenting on feedback shows that you care as an organization and that you take this feedback seriously and want to improve.

2. Utilize social media:Most companies have a website to showcase themselves as employers, but companies that do very well with branding have other avenues. To attract top talent, organizations should have a company Facebook page, Twitter handle, and YouTube channel to give updates and showcase the culture. This could include awards you’ve won or fun things going on.

3. A company LinkedIn page: This falls under social media as well, but it’s also where a lot of talent is and where they spend a lot of time. Your company LinkedIn page should always be up to date with current openings as well as company news. Keep it relevant to stay ahead of the curve.

If you have any other questions about how to boost your employer brand, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to hear from you.

        <title>How Do Telecommuters Affect a Workforce?</title>

How do telecommuters affect a workforce?

Telecommuters who work from home are healthier, happier, more loyal, and have a much better work-life balance. The regular, work-at-home, non-self-employed population has grown 103% in the last 10 years. While there is no real census bureau or government data, global workplace analytics research shows that 50% of the U.S. workforce is already compatible to work remotely. 

Furthermore, 80% to 90% of the workforce would love to do it. Their preference would be to work this way part-time (meaning generally two to three days a week), which they feel would give them a great balance of concentrative work at home and collaborative work at the office. 

Fortune 1,000 companies have already started revamping their offices globally to support the people that already work mobile. Within every company, studies have shown that employees are only at their desk 50% to 60% of the time. I know companies are worried about whether people actually work when they work from home, but we’ve found that 76% of telecommuters say they actually put in more work and work harder when companies support their position. They are also more loyal to that organization. 

On average, work-from-home programs for businesses save $2,000 per person, per year. They’ve also reduced the turnover rate by 50%. We all know that when turnover is reduced, it saves a company exponential amounts of money.

“The companies that are growing the fastest are the ones embracing telecommuters.”

This move toward telecommuting can be either a blessing or a curse to the office furniture industry. I think companies that have perfected or are moving toward being able to sell 1,000 home workstations in the same amount of time that they’re selling 1,000 workstations for an office space are going to have tremendous opportunities in the future.

The bottom line is companies who are growing the most aggressively are the ones able to make the shift and have the ability to support telecommuters. Keep in mind, though, that you still have to hire the right person with the right mindset and the right capability to work remotely and still be effective. It’s still an adjustment for many people.

If you have any questions about the emergence of telecommuters in the workforce, please don’t hesitate to give us a call. We’d be happy to speak with you!

        <description>

What’s the number one thing you can do to compete in the top 1% in terms of career progression? It’s really simple, but it takes commitment. There’s a simple saying I’d like to share in that regard: There is no such thing as luck—it’s only preparation meeting opportunity.

What do you think that means? How does that apply to you?

First, ask yourself three questions:


  Are you disciplined?
  Are you willing to commit one hour a week?
  Are you willing to do it for the rest of your career?


If the answer is yes and if you think you can compete in the top 1%, then follow these suggestions.

First, read for an hour a week. Pick 10 to 12 publications and sift through them rapidly within that hour. These publications should cover all aspects of the world and relate to whatever industry you’re focused in, whether that’s politics, economics, and/or technology. You can pick many ways to get this information—digital, hard copy, newspaper, magazines, etc. It really doesn’t matter. What matters is that you’re getting a wide range of information and getting it fast.

“There is no such thing as luck—it’s only preparation meeting opportunity.”

Next, ‘pulse-read’ through that information. What do I mean by that? Pulse reading means going through any magazine, looking at each topic, and deciding whether it’s relevant to the topic you’re interested in. If not, read only the first paragraph and move on. If the next topic you pick is of deeper interest, you might read the first paragraph, then the second paragraph, and only the last paragraph before moving on. You’ll do this with any publication you subscribe to.

In the end, after months of months (or years and years) of doing this, you’ll have a repertoire of information you can draw on that will allow you to make decisions in an expert manner because you’ll have a wealth of subject matter relevant to those decisions.

The most successful people I’ve known over the years—over a wide range of industries—have always been avid readers. If you have any questions about this topic, please feel free to reach out to us. We’d be happy to speak with you!

How can you format a resume to make it the most effective?

The first piece is the most basic but often overlooked, which is making sure all of your contact information is up to date. Make sure you don’t have an outdated email address or cell phone number on your resume.

Next, you need to keep it consistent.You might update your resume with your most recent positions, which is fine, but make sure the font size, type, and color, are the same as the rest of the resume. Also, make sure bullet points are the same size and things that need to be italicized are italicized. It needs to look uniform throughout.

“Make sure all of your contact information is up to date.”

Make sure you don’t come across as a job hopper. If you have moved up in a company or have held multiple positions, put all those under the one company header.

Finally, you need to showcase your achievements, especially in terms of numbers. Anytime you can show accomplishments using numbers on a resume is fantastic.

If you have any other questions, feel free to email us or give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

When I started here eight years ago, we were able to find qualified director of nursing candidates within 72 hours, generally, but times have changed. In January of 2017 alone, there were 7,500 postings for director of nursing candidates and only 1,200 active candidates, which shows the scarcity of these candidates out there. New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago were hit the hardest. 

So how can you combat this? There are a couple things you can do.

The first is to develop your bench strength. Look at your RNs, your MDS coordinators, your ADONs, and really put in the time and energy to mold them into someone who can step into that director of nursing role if needed. Generally speaking, the best hires you can make are people who know the organization, the culture, the leadership, and the vision of the company. 

Secondly, when you conduct interviews, interview for potential rather than just experience. I think the days of interviewing a director of nursing with 25 years of experience are coming to a close. Look at a candidate’s potential—can they step into that role two or three positions into their career? Do they have the potential to be molded and trained to be a director of nursing?

“Interview for potential rather than just experience.”

Finally, make sure that your director of nursing is engaged. As a search firm, the number one reason we hear candidates want to leave is that they’re not being supported by the subordinates that report to them, the leadership, or both. Make sure you touch base with that director of nursing periodically and that they’re engaged and happy in the role. We all know that the relationship between an administrator and director of nursing is vital, so they need to make sure they feel supported and have everything they need to feel supported.

If you have a vacancy, there a couple things you can do. 

For one, you can engage the staff you already have. Ask anybody in a clinical role who they’ve worked with in the past and respect who would be a great director of nursing. Some of the best referrals you can get come from employees you already have in the building. If you have exhausted all your resources, I really recommend engaging a search firm for the position. If you have 7,500 postings out there and only 1,200 active candidates, finding that needle in a haystack can be difficult.

If you have any other questions about this topic, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be glad to help!

        <description>

How do you define the profile of a person you are looking to hire?

Defining the type of person you want to hire may seem difficult to do. However, whenever we ask someone who they don’t want to hire, the answer comes very easily to them.

So, if you are really struggling to figure out how you want to hire, we recommend that you sit down and figure out who you don’t want to hire first. Think about the skills that you don’t need the candidate to have or personality traits that won’t align with your core values.

“Your top three qualities are non-negotiable.”

After you figure that out, you should be able to have some clarity on who you want to hire. Once that clarity hits, you need to write down your do’s and don’ts for the ideal candidate. Then, you need to highlight the top three qualities that your ideal candidate would have.

Those three qualities are non-negotiable. No candidate is perfect. Just make sure that your candidate matches with your top three, non-negotiable qualities. Those qualities should fit into where you see your company going in the future. You need to make sure that the candidate can grow with your organization, both through their role and through the culture of the company.

I hope this helps you define the right type of person that you want to hire. If you need any help in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would be happy to help you!

How do you effectively interview? How can you prepare for an interview?

Whether you are a two-year or 15-year veteran, most people are not good at interviewing for two reasons. First of all, socially, we are not really allowed to talk highly about ourselves or brag about ourselves, so we’re very bad at it.

Secondly, most people don’t prepare properly for an interview, which is really kind of silly. If you were going to present to a group of executives, you would prepare. You would practice and know exactly what you’re going to say.

Here are two ways to effectively prepare for an interview:

First, open up a Word document and then, stream of consciousness style, put together words or phrases that describe your best attributes and characteristics. You may write something like sales leadership or communication skills. Leave a space between each skill that you write down so you can go back and effectively, concisely write an example of that specific skill.

“It’s absolutely crucial to prepare for an interview.”

Using two to three sentences at the most, leave them with the idea that you absolutely can perform that skill effectively. For example, you may say that over the last five years, you’ve built two teams from scratch. You hired, fired, and trained all of the top people that worked for your team and made them some of the top 10 contenders in your business. Your team brought in $2 million of new business.

That is very concise and direct, and shows how you can impact that particular company.

Next, when you begin to interview, you don’t know what they’re going to ask you about. On your list, have 10 to 15 different skill sets prepared. As early in the interview as you can, you should say, “Tell me what you want me to accomplish for you.” They will outline that for you so you get a chance to speak directly to what they want you to do.

In a 30-minute interview, you need to speak concisely about five to 15 years of business experience and how that experience applies to the job you are being considered for. These two tips will help you do just that.

If you have any other questions about the interview process, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <description>

Today we are here to answer a question from Jennie, an HR manager in the Twin Cities who asked, “What are candidates honing in on right now when choosing an employer?”

The first big thing we are hearing from candidates is that they want to join a company that is in growth mode. Career growth for the company means career growth for the employee as well. Candidates are honing in on these growing companies so that they can create an upward trajectory for their career as well.

Benefits are a hot button topic right now as well. The cost of benefits is going up a lot, especially for families. The cost is going to be higher at your position than it was in the past as well. Can you find another way to compensate an employee, maybe in the form of a little higher salary? Being flexible like this is the key to getting the best hires.

“Focus on the person, not the title.”

Another big thing to remember about hiring is that you want to focus the search on a specific person instead of a title. If you find an exceptional candidate, but you can’t offer them as much vacation as they are already getting, I encourage you to try and find ways around the black and white HR handbook you adhere to. It’s a small sacrifice to make in order to find the perfect fit for a role.

Finally, candidates are really concerned about who they are working for. There has got to be a good rapport there. Consider bringing the hiring authority in on the process from the beginning to get candidates excited about taking a position with you.

If you have any other questions for us about hiring, career growth, retention, or anything else, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

Request a Consultation - Hire Us to Fill Your Job Openings

As you already know, there are a ton of resources available out there that show how to write a great resume. In turn, we’re often asked what not to put on a resume. So today, we wanted to provide you with a list of the top five things you shouldn’t put on your resume.

You want to make sure your resume is a reflection of yourself. A lot of people put canned things on their resume to make themselves look good, but they’re ultimately not comfortable with them.

1. Do not put your picture on your resume. There are a ton of social media sites where someone can look you up. A picture is still not appropriate to have on your resume and we don’t like to see them on there.

2. Keep the format simple. Some people like to spruce up their resume by having different fonts, colors, or margins, but remember, people will often look at your resume on their phone or a number of different programs. Extra fonts and colors can not only be distracting, they can get jumbled up when being looked at on different devices or programs. Keep it simple with clean lines, right indentation, and one font that can be bolded or italicized in certain areas.

3. No paragraphs. People in HR or recruiting look at a ton of resumes every day, so you want to make sure it’s easy to read. Use bullet points, but make sure they have quantifiable achievements. Don’t use the same bullet points for every role that you’ve had; they want to make sure that you have put some thought into it and listed exactly what you’ve done in that role even if the responsibilities were similar.

“Recruiters and HR people look at a ton of resumes every day, so make yours easy to read.”

4. Don’t use an objective. You’ll get many opinions on this since it may seem normal to put an objective on your resume, but the problem is that it becomes very canned. We all know that your objective is to get a position with a stable, well-branded company and such. It’s better to leave it off and use that space to highlight your successes or talents, or dive right into things regarding your most recent position. Don’t fill it just for the sake of filling it.

5. Keep it to two pages. Obviously, the more experience you have, the harder it is to do this. However, it’s OK to use bullets for your last two to three positions and then just summarize the positions you’ve held before that, especially if it was more than 10 years ago. Once you get up to three, four, or even five pages, nobody will read it anyway. Remember that this is a marketing brochure; it’s not going to tell the whole story. You want people to want to read it and be attracted to your resume.

I hope you found this information helpful if you’re updating your resume or getting ready to send it out. If you have any questions at all, just give us a call or send us an email. We’d be happy to answer them for you!

        <description>

The question of how to be effective at salary negotiation is a common one for us, so we wanted to cover it for all of you who have been asking the same question. As we discuss salary negotiations, there are three main topics I want to cover. Although they might sound simple at first glance, most people don’t do them. Following their lead could cost you, so here are three things you should know heading into salary negotiations:

1. Know how much compensation you are currently taking home on an annual basis. Consider your base salary in addition to any bonuses, incentives, stock benefits, or other monetary value you take home. When you understand that critically, you can make a decision on what your bottom line number is and what your ideal number is.

“Figure out what your yearly compensation is first.”

2. Look at the new opportunity you are interviewing for. You have to make the decision of if this is the right career choice for you. In the end, you want to be able to ask yourself if the job has enough challenge, opportunity, and experience. If you can see yourself making the same amount of money while also enjoying the new job more, you’re on the right track.

3. Actually negotiate the salary. There are two methods that are common in the marketplace and I like them both. The first is to present a hiring manager with what you are making now and what you would like to make in the future. Give them a mid-range and a high-range number. The other option you have is to not present any numbers at all. Just tell the person that you are very interested in the role and are confident in receiving a fair offer. This gives the hiring manager the opportunity to give you their best offer.

I hope this information has helped you out. If you have any other questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.

        <description>

What’s the number one trait we look for in a recruiter?

We look for risk takers. How do we identify risk takers? We find that the risk taking trait manifests itself in recruiters in three different ways.

The first way is how they tend to want to be paid for performance instead of having a set salary that’s oftentimes based more on tenure than anything else. Risk takers are people who want to work hard, log extra hours, spend extra energy, and are compensated accordingly.

The second way is in their relationships with people. The best recruiters tend to be themselves in the recruiting process—they don’t try to replicate somebody else’s style. They put their own personality into the process, and as a result, they’re very sincere and authentic and come across as trustworthy.

“Be yourself, but be louder.”

The third way is by being comfortable in a sales process where you don’t control everything. Our business is unlike a process that simply allows you to sell a specific product that has certain traits, features, and benefits that you can market. With our process, we’re selling a service that matches a candidate with a hiring authority. Both sides are represented by people who don’t always know exactly what they want until they see it. This means there’s a lot of human psychology involved, and our job can mimic that of a marriage broker—we help manage two people come to a conclusion to solve mutual needs and requirements.

If you have any questions about this topic, please feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to talking with you!

        <title>When Is the Right Time for a Retained Search?</title>

        <description>

Today I wanted to answer some questions I get when it comes to the difference between a retained and contingent search. When should you use each one?

The answer we hear from many other recruiters is to only use a retained search for high-level executive positions. Frankly, I’ve found that this is not always the case.

I believe you want to look at using a retained search anytime you want to exhaust a search.It’s a position that’s tough to fill and it’s imperative that you find the right person for that role, so a retained search is probably the best way to go. With our retained searches, we tap into the 21 recruiters we have working specifically in healthcare. We do a full nationwide search that allow us to identify several candidates to present.

Having an investment from our client up front allows us the time and resources to perform a strong and exhaustive search.

Another question we often get is whether candidates are better on a retained search versus a contingent search. At the end of the day, it’s the same candidates out there, but with a retained search, you will find that the candidates are vetted much better. With a retained search, you can really take the time to make sure you’re exhausting the search and identifying the candidates.

“Retained searches usually provide a more exhaustive search.”

In a contingent model, usually, the first candidate to raise his or her hand is the first candidate presented. When a contingent recruiter is working on several searches, you’ll find that they find one candidate, then move on to the next. You really don’t get an exhaustive approach.

Finally, another one of the most common questions we’re asked by candidates is whether it truly matters to them (as a candidate) if the recruiter is working on a contingent or retained search. My answer would be yes. The candidate is much more vested in presenting that candidate to their client. They want to be sure they’re doing it in all the appropriate ways.

We put together a file for a candidate, as well as perform psychometric testing, which gives you a much fuller story than a black and white resume. That way, when you meet with that client, they know who you are and have a better idea of how you can be an asset to their team. You’ll also be given much more information by the recruiter.

Hopefully that gives you a better idea of some answers to common questions regarding retained and contingent searches. If you have any questions for us about retention, hiring, or career development, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help.

        <description>

Back in the mid 90s and early 2000s, making a move was much more profitable than it is now. Back then, prospects were getting anywhere from a 15% to 20% increase in pay to make a move. During the market crash, that increase dropped to 3%. People were making a move to stay employed at that point, not for the money.

Lately, there has been an uptick in the raises that those making a move to a new company are getting.These are people who are already employed and doing well, but they are also making anywhere from 5% to 10% more to make a move.

“A 5% increase is a pretty good benchmark.”

A 5% increase in overall pay is a pretty good benchmark to have if you’re considering making a move.Moving forward, I don’t think many places will be looking at giving away more than that. We are no longer in the era where people will incentive people to make a move.

My suggestion for you or anyone you know who is looking to make a move is to look at that opportunity as a whole, not just at the money. If you like the opportunity and can also get that 5% to 10% increase in compensation, it’s something you should seriously consider.

If you have any questions for us or want to learn more about the building product industry, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.

What do people really mean when they ask about corporate culture? 

It’s nice to be able to take your dog to work or have an office softball team. Those kinds of things are important in cultivating a company’s culture. Really, though, there are only three core things people think about anytime they consider a job change:


  Transparency
  Will this new company have my back?
  Will they allow me to grow?


What is transparency? Transparency simply means that you’re open, direct, and your employees know what to do to meet or exceed expectations internally and that you’ll tell them when they are not. If there are changes, transparency means you will speak to them directly and openly. 

How can you have their back? Everybody makes mistakes; it’s part of being human. Employees need to know how you’re going to respond to that. Any employee that is allowed more autonomy and allowed to take more risks is going to be more creative and likely achieve a higher rate of production. If they make a mistake, will you use that as a coaching opportunity and help them work through their error so they can use it as a learning experience? This is critical, because employees will chafe in their role if you don’t let them make mistakes. 

How can you allow them to grow? By supporting learning by experience. Everybody wants to progress in their jobs and see variety in their day-to-day tasks. If you don’t allow those things, that employee will grow stale and be looking over their shoulder wondering whether or not this is the right opportunity for them. You need to be able to show them that you can give them the challenges and opportunities they need to grow and be willing to help them do that. 

As a hiring manager, you need to be able to know whether you have existing examples that will allow your future employees to be able to see that you can give them these three things. Can you speak to these examples clearly so that they’re willing to leave the job that they have and join your company? If you can, you’re going to do a much better job overall of attracting top talent. 

If you have any questions about how to attract and facilitate talent, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We look forward to speaking with you! 

“Can you present challenges to your employees and help them grow?”

If you’re a job candidate, what can do to make sure that you impress the hiring authorities in your interview?

First off, make a great first impression. 90% of hiring authorities make their decision within the first two minutes and spend the rest of the time justifying that decision. Being on time, being polished, and being presentable can greatly improve your odds to strike the right chord within that crucial timeframe.

Secondly, bring multiple copies of your resume. When you show up, you want to have at least three copies of your resume—one for the person interviewing you, and others for whoever else may be involved with the interview. With the resume, you want to be able to speak to each change you’ve made in your career and any quantifiable achievements you’ve made. These are the things you think would really make you shine as a candidate.

“Always ask questions.”

Third, be prepared with questions. At the end of the interview, clients always ask their candidates if they have any questions for them. The worst thing you can do at that moment is not have any. The best kinds of questions to ask are the ones that pertain to the client themselves, how they got into the business, what’s kept them there, and what their future plans are.

Lastly, close the interview. When you leave the interviewer, let them know that you want the job. Furthermore, ask them if there’s anything about your background that they still have concerns about. Tell them that you’re really interested in the next step and that you’re curious what that step looks like.

If you have any questions regarding hiring or retention, please feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We’d be happy to help!
