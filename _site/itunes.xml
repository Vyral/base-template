How much of a difference can listing videos make? A lot.

Can videos really help sell your home? The short answer is yes, and we have the statistics to back that up. In fact, 85% of clients want an agent who uses video tools as part of their marketing package. What’s more, homes presented with a video tend to receive 403% more attention.

But making a real estate video isn’t as easy as using your cellphone camera—a high-quality video requires specialized equipment. We’ve invested in a very expensive camera that will allow the consumer to virtually walk through the home and look around almost as though they were there in person. To make a really effective real estate video, you’ll also need drone footage. It adds a wow factor to the presentation, showing the home itself and the surrounding areas.

With the pandemic changing people’s habits so drastically, this kind of technology has really helped keep home sales moving along. It’s the next best thing to actually viewing a home in person.

“Not all platforms can fully capture the richness that listing videos can create.”

Apart from high-quality technology, you’ll also need a high-quality editing and production team to help put the video together. This might sound expensive, but at Colemere Realty, we’ve tailored the process down to capture listings of any price range to help them sell for more money in a shorter amount of time.

However, you can’t have all this great equipment and editing technology without having the right platform to share the videos on. Not all platforms can fully capture the richness that listing videos can create; Zillow, for example, has specific requirements in terms of video resolution that don’t really work for the process. There are many options out there, so working with an experienced real estate marketer is key to helping you find the right ones so that you can get your listing in front of as many potential buyers as possible.

If you have any questions about today’s topic or anything to do with real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.

        <description>

Here are the two statistics you need to know before entering the market.

If you’ve been sitting on the fence, now is the time to make a move in the real estate market. There are two statistics, in particular, that you need to understand before making any real estate decision that will also prove why it’s such a great time to buy or sell right now.

Our favorite stat in real estate is the absorption rate. When we discuss inventory, we talk about it in terms of time. When homes sell, they’re taken out of the inventory count, and this affects the number of houses for sale and how much time it would take to sell them. A balanced market has four to six months’ worth of inventory, meaning that if no other properties came onto the market, it would take four to six months to sell them all.

Currently, the Salt Lake City market has only two weeks of inventory—well below that equilibrium of four to six months’ worth. If all listing activity ceased today, there would be no more homes to purchase after just two weeks. We’ve never seen inventory this low. Properties are selling very, very quickly.

The second stat to know is the daily snapshot. This shows us a comparison of real estate activity today versus the same day last year. The numbers included in the snapshot are active listings, pending listings, properties under contract, and the number of properties sold.

“Currently, the Salt Lake City market has only two weeks of inventory.”

For example, there are a little over 1,200 active listings on the market right now, while that number was over 2,400 at the same time last year. Inventory has decreased by 50% in a year. Interestingly, the number of homes under contract has increased by 37%, which means demand has risen. This is the perfect storm, especially for sellers.

This is why we love stats—they equip us as real estate professionals to help you position your offer well and succeed in this hyper-competitive market. We’re seeing multiple offers on every house, sometimes more than 10! If you’re well-positioned, you get the best shot of winning the property you want.

Some would think that in this type of market a seller can price their home however they like, or just sell it themselves. However, buyers use professional real estate agents, so sellers who overprice will end up selling for less. Use a professional agent as a seller to help you maximize the value of your property and avoid mistakes, such as simply taking the highest-priced offer that may not be supported by an appraisal. An agent can help you make the best decisions.

We would love to go to work for you. If you’re sitting on the fence and unsure what to do, reach out to us via phone or email. We’ll show you how we’ll add more value to your transaction and reach or exceed your real estate goals. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

These five tips will help you sell your home during the holidays.

If you’re looking to sell your home during the holidays, which is actually a viable time to list (despite all the misconceptions to the contrary), here are five tips to help you find success:

1. Tastefully decorate your home for the holidays. What better time to accentuate the emotional appeal of your home to potential buyers than the holidays?

2. Deep clean before you decorate. Make sure that every nook and cranny is white-glove clean.

3. Keep the home warm. Don’t turn down the heat; in fact, turn it up a little bit. Turn on all your lights, and if you have a fireplace, light it or turn it on to help bring in some emotion. Another good idea is to light some holiday-scented candles to keep your home smelling fresh and cozy.

4. Price your house properly. Traditionally, real estate moves a bit slower during the holidays, so pricing your home correctly is critical.

5. Be patient during the process. Showings may come at inconvenient times, especially during the holidays, when you’ll likely have your own plans to contend with. Just try to be patient with the process. If the home doesn’t sell during the holiday season, it’ll sell eventually.

“Light some holiday-scented candles to keep your home smelling fresh.”

If you have further questions about real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out to your Colemere Realty specialists. We’d love to answer them.

Sellers: Be proactive and avoid these huge home seller mistakes!

If you want to sell quickly and for top dollar, there are seven critical mistakes you must avoid:

1. Picking the wrong agent. Pick someone who’s experienced and has sold a lot of properties. If you need heart surgery, you’ll probably want to pick a heart surgeon who’s performed a lot of surgeries, right? Your agent needs to have their finger on the pulse of your specific market and offer a solid, customized marketing plan for your home. Make sure your agent actually walks through your home; believe it or not, some agents won’t even do this, and it should be a huge red flag for you.

2. Overpricing your property. Even though it’s a seller’s market, it’s all too possible to price yourself out of the market. Consumers are well-educated these days and can find out everything they need to know online—including the price at which a given property should be listed. Today’s homebuyers won’t even bother seeing your home in person if they believe it to be overpriced, and remember: The longer your property sits on the market, the staler it becomes. If you do get an offer on your overpriced listing, appraisal problems will more than likely come back to bite you.

3. Only considering the highest priced offer. There’s more to an offer than just price, so you’ll need the help of your agent to interpret the overall strength of each offer you receive. Obsessing over price alone will cause you to neglect other key elements, like the buyer’s financing (e.g., earnest money, down payment, lender credibility).

Is money your only priority? Perhaps you’re like the many other sellers we’ve worked with who needed time to find their next property and move. If so, the strongest offer may actually be one where the buyer agrees to an ample rent-back period and throws in two additional weeks rent-free. That’s exactly the offer that one of our sellers recently accepted, and it worked out well.

“Buyers can’t make an offer on a home they can’t see.”

4. Not preparing your home for the market. We understand the temptation to leave things as they are—we are in a hot seller’s market, right? Yes, there will be a lot of buyers walking through your home, but they’ll also be seeing a ton of different homes. Yours needs to stand out from the crowd. In a previous video, we explored all of the steps for getting your home market-ready and offered advice on how to prioritize repairs; we advise you to go back and check it out!

5. Not allowing showings.  Let’s say you go on the market on a Thursday but decline showings that following Saturday. That’s a colossal mistake! Those weekend showings are critical because that’s when most buyers are off work and viewing properties with their agents. Buyers can’t make an offer on a home they can’t see. Yes, it will be inconvenient and frustrating at times, but be proactive and designate a spot where you can go at a moment’s notice should a buyer request a showing.

6. Getting too emotional. Stressed and tired sellers are more likely to decline showings, which is never in their interest. Sometimes, buyers love to come in with their guns blazing and tell you everything they think is wrong with your house to get a better deal on it. It’s easy to get offended by that, but let cooler heads prevail; the better offer may come from a buyer who is quite particular. Try to remember that, at the end of the day, your home sale is just a business transaction—the calmer and more focused you are, the better your outcome will be. Listen to the advice of your agent because they are not nearly as emotionally involved as you are.

7. Not decluttering. You’re moving anyway, so why not begin boxing up your belongings now? A clutter-free home helps buyers to better envision themselves living in that space. In a cluttered home, all buyers see is your stuff. Your agent has seen countless homes, and they will be a fresh pair of eyes for yours; listen to their feedback.

If you have further questions on how to sell your home quickly and for top dollar, or want more personalized solutions for your selling situation, don’t hesitate to reach out to us via phone or email. We’re more than happy to help!

Here are tips to help sellers prime for a swift and profitable home sale.

What goes into preparing a home for the market? First things first, you need to create a home selling plan with an emphasis on properly staging your house. Staging simply refers to the work that goes into transforming your home as you know it (comfortable, highly personalized, reflective of your specific lifestyle) into a property that’s show-ready (depersonalized, clutter-free, minimally furnished). It’s all about removing unnecessary items, finding the most aesthetically pleasing arrangement for furnishings, and maximizing your home’s space.

Statistics have shown that a staged home will sell faster and for more money than its unstaged competition. If you don’t have a professional stager on speed dial, reach out to us and we’d be glad to help you with that.

You should also start decluttering your home as soon as possible. Whether you’ve been in the home for three, five, or 30 years, you’ve likely accumulated stuff that you don’t need or seldom use. Pack up seasonal items, donate usable stuff you no longer need, and throw away junk. Again, the goal is to make your home look as clean and open as possible.

Perhaps what’s even more pressing than clearing the inside of your home is updating its curb appeal. The exterior of the home is obviously what buyers will see first, and if that first impression doesn’t reel them in, your home selling journey will be a rough one. Make sure your lawn is mowed, the flower beds are weeded (and there’s actually flowers in there), and the shrubbery is trimmed.

“If you can repair something in the home yourself before you list it, always do so.”

After you’ve cleaned your home’s siding and improved your landscaping, head back inside, roll up your sleeves, and do a deep clean of every room. This would include getting the carpets cleaned, wiping down the baseboards, tackling dust in every nook and cranny, clearing out the filter vents, and addressing any small stains or spots on walls. Make sure you also clean out the grout between your tiles, too! If your carpet is in pretty rough shape, either have it professionally cleaned or replace it altogether.

Noticing way too many little stains on the walls? The best way to make them vanish is to add a fresh coat of paint! Painting is something you should be doing anyway if your walls aren’t already neutrally colored (e.g., whites, off-whites, beiges, grays, etc.).

Lastly, it’s time to finally tackle that ever-growing to-do list that we all keep as homeowners—fixes or replacements around the house we’ve been meaning to do. If you can repair something in the home yourself before you list it, always do so; it will save you some headaches down the road when your property undergoes an inspection.

Hopefully, these tips provided a good roadmap for you to get started on your home selling journey. If you have questions about anything mentioned in this blog or other real estate topics, please feel free to reach out to us via phone or email. We’re always happy to help in any way we can!

        <description>

Writing a buyer &ldquo;love letter&rdquo; will help get your offer accepted.

When submitting an offer on a home, a great way to get an edge over any competition is to write a buyer “love letter.” There are a few reasons why.

First, it allows you to thank the seller for letting you into their home and considering your offer. It also gives you the chance to ask them to take a closer look at why you’re making an offer. Additionally, it shows genuine sincerity and enthusiasm for their home. Everyone loves to hear how great their home is, and you can tell them what you love about it.

On top of that, it allows you to personally connect with the seller. If the seller is receiving multiple offers, this connection can make all the difference because they’ll be able to see the person behind the offer.

Lastly, writing a letter lets you tell your story and talk about your family. You can elaborate on how you’ll love the home as much as they did. Everyone has a story to tell, and everyone’s situation is different. Many of our clients have entered into multiple-offer situations without being able to submit the highest offer and still won because of writing this letter.

“If the seller is receiving multiple offers, this connection can make all the difference.”

As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.

        <description>

Here are a few tips to help get your offer accepted in our competitive real estate market.

To have any chance of being a competitive homebuyer in our market, there are some key tips you should follow:

1. Write a strong offer with tight deadlines and few (if any) contingencies. One of those contingencies is the inspection contingency, which gives the buyer the right to cancel the transaction if they don’t like what they see during the inspection. We encourage you to communicate with the inspector through your agent before writing your offer so that you can have the inspection take place in a timely manner. This will give the seller peace of mind knowing that you’re not going to waste their time.

2. Communicate well with the listing agent. An open line of communication with the listing agent about the offer will show the seller that your agent is knowledgeable and experienced, as well as demonstrate that they can make the transaction move forward smoothly.

3. Ensure that all the financial aspects of your offer are strong. Your sales price, earnest money, and deposit need to be strong to entice the seller.

4. Be straightforward and don’t play games. Don’t write unrealistic offers that the home couldn’t appraise for. Unfortunately, many agents like to play games by going under contract at a high price and then trying to get a bunch of concessions from the seller later. This tactic just muddies the water and has the potential to cause the seller to pass over your offer.

5. Make sure your lender is ready to contact the seller’s agent early so they can present the pre-qualification letter with the offer before it’s accepted. If the lender contacts the seller’s agent as you submit the offer, that will make your offer stronger, since it will tell the seller that you’re ready to go and willing to move the transaction along without hassle.

If you have questions about this or any other topic, reach out to your Colemere Realty associate. We’d be happy to help.

        <description>

If you&rsquo;re thinking of buying new construction, you need to hire an agent.

When buying a new construction home, you absolutely need an agent on your side representing your interests. There are a few key reasons why.

First, while the builder’s agent may be friendly and helpful, they still represent the builder. They have a fiduciary responsibility to represent their interests, and if you enter into the transaction and give them more information about yourself, they can use it against you. Their incentive is to get you to pay more for the property so they make more money.

This leads us to our next point: Without representation, the builder’s agent will be the one helping you pick out all of your upgrades, and they’ll inevitably suggest making every upgrade possible. Having an agent working for you provides a voice of temperament when it comes to choosing upgrades. They’ll help you be smarter about where to spend your hard-earned money and avoid expensive, unnecessary upgrades.

“Having representation when building a new home doesn’t cost you anything.”

Also, having representation means having a second set of eyes to look over the builder’s purchase agreement. Most builders have their own purchase agreement, and these are usually lengthy documents. Your agent can identify any mistakes, keep the builder honest, and make sure all contractual items are in order.

Lastly, having representation when building a new home doesn’t cost you anything. Contrary to what some may think, in this market, builders usually won’t give you a discount if you don’t have your own representative.

If you’d like to know more about how an agent can help you when buying new construction or have any other real estate questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help.

        <description>

For home sellers, there&rsquo;s a new normal in the market. Here&rsquo;s what it looks like.

As a home seller, it’s wise to minimize the physical contact that potential buyers have with the stuff in your home as they walk through to view it. Leave the doors and drawers open so that buyers can visually access your home without having to touch anything.

Another thing you can do is leave hand sanitizer along with instructions at your home’s entrance. Visitors should be instructed to use the hand sanitizer before coming in and after walking through your home.

We also encourage you to discuss your comfort levels with your Colemere Realty associate regarding how many showings you want to have, how many people you want to enter your house, etc. If you’d rather keep your home’s exposure to others to a minimum, you can always pursue virtual showings and open houses instead.

Once showings are over, be sure to turn all the lights off and take disinfectant wipes to all the surfaces in your house that people are likely to touch, like light switches and doorknobs.

“If you’d rather keep your home’s exposure to others to a minimum, you can always pursue virtual showings and open houses instead.”

Finally, we’ll let buyers know that they need to stay home if they’re not feeling well to reduce the risk of spread. If you, the seller, feel like you’re coming down with something, don’t be afraid to put showings on hold. There are plenty of virtual options out there for you.

If you have any questions about what safety precautions are being implemented to keep buyers and sellers safe during the pandemic, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to provide you with more information.

        <description>

Here&rsquo;s what the new normal looks like for homebuyers.

COVID-19 clearly hasn’t gone anywhere, so how are we continuing to help buyers get into new homes safely? 

The first step that we advise is to limit the number of people in your group when you’re out searching for homes. For families, the easiest way to do this is to find a babysitter for the kids, or have another family member watch them while you tour homes. 

Common sense is our greatest weapon in times of uncertainty. Avoid touching anything while you tour a home. Most sellers and seller’s agents are preparing their homes for showings such that you don’t have to even lift a finger for anything—lights will already be flipped on, and doors already opened. The adage of ‘look, but don’t touch’ has become more important than ever now. 

Inside of the home, we’ll still be practicing social distancing, using hand sanitizer upon entry and exit, and wearing masks. We feel its best to err on the side of caution and to mitigate risks whenever possible for our clients.

“Common sense is our greatest weapon in times of uncertainty.”

The market is moving very fast, and there are a lot of buyers out there; it’s important to act quickly to compete, but it’s twice as important to act safely and smartly. 

If you have questions about what we discussed in this video, or if you’re interested in buying or selling a home soon, reach out to us by phone or email anytime. We’re here to be a resource for you, and we look forward to hearing from you.

Coverage of our market can be confusing sometimes; here are the facts.

From a local standpoint, we are in an extremely strong seller’s market. Sales are down, but this metric can be deceiving without proper context. They’re down—not because of COVID-19 or the real estate market taking a dive—but because we simply don’t have enough inventory for all of the buyers who are interested in purchasing today.

Recently, we had a listing go live on the market, and within two days, it had over 25 showings and generated 11 offers. As you can imagine, the price on that home did get bid up. Another listing of ours went on the market for $629,000 and received three offers in three days, all above list price. Ours is a healthy market, it’s just bound by low inventory.

COVID-19 has certainly impacted the market, but it’s done so in a way that only served to create more demand. Our average days on market is only 14 days now, and it’s still trending downward as we head further into summer.

“We had a listing go live on the market, and within two days, it had over 25 showings and generated 11 offers.”

A typical market, or what’s known as an equilibrium market, has four to six months’ worth of inventory; we have a 0.65-month supply, meaning that if no new homes came onto the market, it would take just around 20 days to sell all of the existing supply.

Properties are moving quickly, and we’re seeing tons of multiple-offer scenarios. The question is not whether the market’s hot, it’s about how we can ensure safety for buyers and sellers. We conduct business in our new normal very carefully. In our upcoming videos, we’ll explain exactly how we’re helping clients in the new normal, and what they can expect from a transaction today.

If you have questions about any of the stats we mentioned in this video, or if you’re thinking of buying or selling soon and don’t know where to start, give us a call or send an email. We’d love to hear from you and help in any way we can.

Find out what Utah moving from orange to yellow status means for real estate.

How has the market been doing since the outbreak of COVID-19? How does the governor’s decision to change our state’s outbreak status from orange to yellow affect real estate and how we perform our business?

In terms of the market, the big picture is that we’ve had a lot of pent-up demand in Utah, specifically in the Wasatch Front. We still have very little inventory. Due to COVID-19, we had about 700 fewer listings this April compared to April 2019, which in turn lowered the average days on market for our area.

It&rsquo;s more important than ever to stay safe if you&rsquo;re in the process of buying or selling a home. Here&rsquo;s what you can do to stay healthy.

In this time of heightened awareness and social distancing, here are a few tips to help keep you safe if you’re buying or selling a home:

1. Always keep additional hand sanitizer and alcohol wipes handy. Put them on the kitchen tables and in the bathrooms if you’re having a showing or open house. If you’re a buyer, use that sanitizer before and after you view homes.

2. If you’re not feeling well, don’t go out. Stay home and have your agent go in your place. We can conference you in via video chat to still see the home. If you’re selling and you or someone in your home is sick, put off the showing. They’ll understand and appreciate the fact that you’re taking precautions.

3. Leave your kids at home. Kids tend to wander and touch more things, and many carriers of the coronavirus are asymptomatic.

“Use sanitizer before and after viewing homes as a buyer.”

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. Stay safe and healthy. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about our new home buying program.

There’s a huge gap in the market for people facing two types of scenarios:

1. They’re new to an area and aren’t quite ready to buy a home but don’t want to fully commit to a lease (and aren’t even sure where to lease).

2. They’re a first-time homebuyer who’s nervous about the entire process. Perhaps because the market is moving fast, or they’re dealing with the fact that buying a home is a big-time commitment, or they may have credit challenges.

“A key benefit of this program is that someone else isn’t telling you which home you’ll move into.”

Well, we did our homework, and if you find yourself in this situation, we have a hybrid home buying program to introduce you to. Here are the requirements to qualify:


  You must have a job
  You must have an annual household income of at least $45,000 (the higher your income, the more you can qualify for)
  You must have no pending bankruptcies
  You can’t have a criminal history
  You must respect the 45-day move-in period


A key benefit of this program is that someone else isn’t telling you which home you’ll move into. You have your choice of where you’ll move and what you’ll move into. Essentially, you still get to shop for a home. If you work with our team, you’ll go out and search for homes with one of our agents. If you find one you like, we’ll move forward with the program.

If you have any questions about this program and what it can do for you, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to speak with you.

You don&rsquo;t need a massive down payment to afford a home. Here are a few of the different options you have.

Regardless of what you may have heard, you do not need 20% down to buy a home. There are a ton of different loan programs out there that offer a variety of down payment options and can cater to your needs as a homebuyer.

In the Salt Lake Valley, there are over 13 cities. Each of these cities may have a different grant or loan program in addition to those available through private lenders. There are so many options available besides the traditional 20% down.

The point is that you don’t need a fortune to buy a home. In fact, there are some options that don’t even require a down payment.

“Our buyer consultation will get you started on the right foot.”

Our goal is to set you up for success through our buyer consultation. If you or someone you know is thinking about buying anytime soon, we’d love to sit down with you and get you pointed in the right direction. We have trained specialists standing by to help you find the right solution.

If you have any questions for us, feel free to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

What does 2020 hold for our real estate market? Here&rsquo;s our market forecast for the year.

Now that we’re a month into the new decade, it’s time for us to share our predictions about what this year’s real estate market holds.

Inventory will likely remain low throughout the year. We saw low inventory last year as well, and this will continue — especially in the lower price ranges. Demand is still incredibly high, and competition will be fierce among first-time homebuyers.

As we head into the spring season, we anticipate that homes will spend fewer days on the market before they’re sold. In fact, the number of days on market may be as low as 10 to 15.

“Since 2020 is an election year, we’ll likely experience some hesitancy in the real estate market.”

Interest rates may rise a bit, ending up somewhere around 4%. Appreciation has been rising as well, but we believe the rate is going to slow down before the end of the year. This will likely occur because some homebuyers will be priced out of the market.

Since 2020 is an election year, we’ll likely experience some hesitancy in the real estate market. During election time, there’s bound to be a slowdown in home sales.

If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

As we head into the new year, let&rsquo;s quickly recap our 2019 real estate market to see where we are in 2020.

As we begin the new year, let’s take a look back at the end of 2019 and where our market stands now.

The first thing to know is that interest rates remained low. They went up for a bit earlier in the year but dropped back down soon after. We’ve been hearing for years now that they are going to go up and stay there, but it just hasn’t happened yet.

Next, the number of units sold in the last year was down, just like in 2018. However, this drop isn’t due to a lack of demand—it’s due to a lack of supply. There aren’t enough homes and too many buyers looking to lock in a low rate.

“Our median price rose by $28,000 in 2019.”

One metric that we use to measure our inventory is the absorption rate. It lets us know how long it would take all the homes on the market to sell if we didn’t have any new homes listed. In 2019, the absorption rate for our market was 0.69 months. This number increases to about two as we jump into the higher price points around $500,000.

Finally, home prices have continued to increase across all housing types. Our median sale price rose from $321,000 to $349,000. If you’re considering buying a home and you’re not saving at least what homes are increasing by on average, you need to consider looking to buy sooner rather than later.

If you have any questions for us about the market or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We’d be happy to help.

If you receive an offer for your home that&rsquo;s much lower than you asked for, how should you respond?

Our market has been on a great run lately. Prices are going up and some buyers are getting nervous that the market is soon to decline. That’s causing some of those buyers to churn out lowball offers for the homes they want. Today we’ll discuss some tips for home sellers that will help them navigate how to handle lowball offers.

1. Remain calm. Don’t freak out—trust your agent’s advice.

2. Respond to all your offers. We’ve seen lowball offers before and the last thing you want to do is ignore them or assume they’re not real.

3. Open the door of negotiation. Many times a buyer’s first offer isn’t their best offer, so a lowball offer can be an opportunity to negotiate. That includes the purchase price, but there’s a lot more than the price that you could negotiate on within a real estate contract.

4. Be polite and respectful. Buyers can be nervous about making an offer at all, so treat a lowball offer as a starting point—you never know where you can get them to go.

If you have any questions, always reach out to your Colemere Realty associate for answers. We’d be glad to help.

We have five successful tips to help you sell your home during the holiday season.

To successfully sell your home during the cold and often busy holiday season, here are five tips you need to keep in mind:

1. Embrace the season. Home sellers often ask if they should decorate their homes for the holidays if they plan to sell, and the answer is yes—but do it tastefully! What better time to evoke the buyer’s emotions and cause them to imagine their own family celebrating the holidays in your home when it becomes theirs?

2. Deep clean before you decorate. Make sure you get every nook and cranny so that your property is, as our stager calls it, “white-glove clean.”

3. Keep the home warm. Don’t turn down the heat, but rather turn it up a little bit. Turn on all the lights, and if you have a fireplace, be sure to light it. The light and warmth helps to bring in more emotion and opens up your spaces. Also, bring in the scent of the holidays with a nice candle; this will help the buyer get into the holiday spirit.

“Home sellers often ask if they should decorate their homes for the holidays if they plan to sell, and the answer is yes—but do it tastefully!”

4. Price your home correctly. Traditionally, real estate moves a little bit slower during the holidays, so it’s critical to correctly price your home. You don’t want your home to sit stagnant on the market because it’s overpriced!

5. Be patient. Showings may be requested at inconvenient times, and with everything else going on during the holidays, it can be a little stressful. Just be patient with the process; if the home doesn’t sell during the holidays, it will when the spring market comes. If that happens, we can always change your listing photos to match the season.

If you have any questions about real estate, please feel free to reach out to Colemere Realty Specialists. We’d love to hear from you. In the meantime, have a wonderful holiday season.

Is a recession coming? Maybe, but that might not mean what you think it does.

 

There’s a question looming in a lot of people’s minds these days: “Is a recession coming? What can we do about it?”

A key thing to remember is that a recession isn’t always a bad thing. A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, and it’s a necessary part of the market cycle. Markets expand and contract over time. During the last five recessions of our country, we’ve seen periods of expansion that lasted several quarters prior to each one.

Many people ask, “What happens to home values during a recession?”

Interestingly enough, out of the last five recessions, three of those recessions saw increases in home values. That shows that a recession doesn’t always mean that your home will lose value.



 

“A recession isn’t always a bad thing.”

Another thing to remember is that we could be going through a recession in some segments of the national market, but not in others. Real estate is always hyper-local—we could have a slowdown in one area, but other areas could stay strong. The recession rule of thumb is that if an area is experiencing growth in terms of jobs, wages, and population, then that area will typically remain economically healthy. And fortunately, we’ve had a great local economy here in Utah along the Wasatch Front.

If you have questions about the recession, your market area, or about real estate in general, please reach out to your Colemere Realty Associate. They’d be happy to answer your questions. If you’re thinking of making real estate plans in the next few years, it’s never too early to start a discussion with us.

Here are four reasons why the fall season might be your best opportunity in quite some time to buy a home.

 

Fall is just a few days away now, which is exciting for a number of reasons. Apart from the crisp autumn weather and football season, it’s also a great time to buy a home! Here are four reasons why:

1. Home prices are increasing. Price growth is showing no sign of slowing down as we get closer and closer to fall. If you plan on purchasing a home anytime soon, it’s better to make your move in our fall market rather than in the future, when it’ll be less affordable.

2. Interest rates will continue to rise. Rates have been unbelievably low for an unbelievably long time. Nevertheless, they won’t remain that way forever. And given that your interest rate will directly affect how much your mortgage payment will be, you don’t want to wait for rates to start trending upward.

3. You’re paying someone’s mortgage regardless. If you’re a renter, look at it this way: You can start paying your own mortgage while conditions are on your side or you can continue paying your landlord’s mortgage. Now, if you’re living in your parents’ basement rent-free, it’s probably safe to assume they’ll want you out sooner rather than later.

4. Now might be the time to realize your goals. A common sentiment among would-be buyers is, “We’ll just hold off until next spring or next fall.” But it’s a good idea to give deeper consideration to your reasons for wanting to buy a home. Perhaps it’s because you’d like to put down roots and have a foundation upon which you can grow with your family. Or maybe you’d like to move up and improve your circumstances and lifestyle.

“Give deeper consideration to your reasons for wanting to buy a home.”

While decisions like this can be hard to make, it’s important to get an outside opinion sometimes. One of the many resources we provide is a consultation where we help you with that very thing. So if you have any questions or would like to set up a no-obligation consultation with us, please reach out to us. We’d be happy to help!

        <description>

If you feel that your property taxes are too high, you can always appeal them. Here&rsquo;s how to do it.

 

Recently, most of you have received your property tax assessment in the mail. That’s always a fun experience—finding out how much you owe the government. But in all seriousness, if you feel that your property has been overvalued, you can protest your assessment and get it lowered.

In Salt Lake County, the main thing you’ll need is a proper evaluation of the current tax year in the form of an appraisal, a closing statement, or comparable sold properties (which we can help you with). From there, you start your appeal.

The first step of the appeal is usually an online or written form that you’ll have to fill out. You’ll send in your evaluation with it, it will be reviewed, and they’ll send back a decision.

“If you don’t like their initial response, you can appeal the process again.”

If you don’t like their initial response, you can appeal the process again. That second appeal is usually done in person.

If you still aren’t happy, the final step would be to meet with a state-appointed mediator to make a final judgment on whether you or the county has the better argument of where your property should be valued.

Here’s the most important thing to know: You only have until September 15 to file your appeal. If you need any help appealing your property’s value, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

How many homes should you look at before buying one? Find out today.

 

“How many homes should I look at before I buy?”

Before you even start counting how many homes you ought to be looking at, you should first make sure that your home search is done properly. Today, most home searches begin online. For example, visit ColemereRealty.com, where you can set up your own personalized account and start your own list of homes that you like. From there, you can reach out to your Colemere Realty specialist to have them set you up with a customized home search.

Next, be sure to consult with your agent. Tell them what areas you like and dislike, what features you need to have in a home, and what features you’d like to have in a home. Also consider whether you have a home to sell before you buy a new one and whether you’ve met with a mortgage lender. These steps need to be met before you physically observe homes you’re interested in.

“The average buyer tends to look at around five to 10 homes in person before making a decision to buy one.”

Once you’ve accomplished all that, now you can go out to look at homes. Based on our statistics, we’ve seen that the average buyer tends to look at around five to 10 homes in person before making a decision to buy one. But don’t let that stop you—if you find the perfect home on your first outing, refer to your specialist and go through the process to determine if that home is right for you, and then proceed. There’s a lot of pressure in this market to make decisions quickly, so it’s great to have a professional in your corner.

If you have any questions about today’s topic or real estate in general, reach out to us. We’re happy to serve you.

        <description>

It doesn&rsquo;t often make sense to hire an appraiser before selling, but there are a few times when it does. Here are three prime examples.

 

Hiring an appraiser before you sell your home is usually a waste of money. However, there are a few exceptions, and we’ll go over each of the most common today:

1. During a divorce or bankruptcy. Generally, a judge involved in either of these scenarios will require that some type of value be established before the case can proceed.

2. During an estate sale. This is especially true if the sale is a complicated one. If different parties involved in the estate sale live far apart from one another, for example, ordering an appraisal before you sell may be a good idea.

3. When you’re using a relocation company. These companies will often require you to order an appraisal.

“Unless you’re faced with one of the circumstances we discussed today, you’ll generally be better off speaking to a Realtor about your home value as you prepare to sell.”

Agents have all the same information at their disposal as appraisers, so unless you’re faced with one of the circumstances we discussed today, you’ll generally be better off speaking to a Realtor about your home value as you prepare to sell.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Be sure to avoid these three pitfalls created when you overprice your home.

 

Why is it a bad idea to overprice your home when you put it on the market?

First, remember that people who browse for homes online can see how long a home has been on the market. When a home is overpriced, it tends to stagnate on the market, and when buyers see that, they’ll probably think that something’s wrong with it.

Another danger of overpricing your home is getting burnt out. The longer your home is on the market, the more worn down you’ll get having to clean your house at a moment’s notice to prepare for a showing—especially if you have kids and/or pets. Your hopes may get high that each buyer who visits will be the last, but if they’re aware that your home is overpriced, you might be in for a disappointment.

“Chances are you won’t be able to fool the buyer about the value of your home.”

Lastly, it’s worth noting that buyers today have more information at their fingertips than they ever have before. They’re both astute and diligent about comparing homes to others they’ve seen in the market.  Even if they don’t have the exact data on your home, they do think about the general cleanliness of the home, what upgrades it has, and what features it has compared to homes that are priced lower than yours. Chances are you won’t be able to fool the buyer about the value of your home.

If you have any questions about this topic or real estate in general, reach out to your Colemere Realty specialists. We’d love to help you.

Today, we&rsquo;ll discuss why a home inspection is vitally important to those buying a home.

 

What makes an inspection such a necessary part of the real estate transaction for homebuyers?

Once you go under contract for the purchase of a home, included in your agreement is a timetable for any due diligence you’d like to conduct. Consider this your opportunity to inspect the property to the fullest extent.

When you hire a home inspector, they’ll come with a checklist of items, and they’ll examine those items to ensure sufficient functionality of each.

As an aside, you may get swept up in all the excitement of going under contract on your new home, only to have an inspector identify some issues. That’s why it’s so important to have a professional inspector come in—their preset checklist will be comprised of around 300 items, and they’ll document every problem area they uncover in a thorough fashion. This way, you’re not surprised by the actual condition of the home.

“The inspection is instrumental in letting you know the exact condition of the home and about anything you weren’t aware of beforehand.”

With a checklist of this length, an inspector is bound to find flaws or areas that need servicing in the home. We’ve even seen cases where inspectors have found issues in new construction properties.

If and when issues arise out of the inspection, as the buyer, you’ll need to identify the biggest concerns and ask yourself: If any issues were to go unaddressed, how would it impede my ability to move forward smoothly? From there, you’ll essentially renegotiate with the seller to either make those repairs or give you a credit toward the repairs.

All in all, the inspection is instrumental in letting you know the exact condition of the home and about anything you weren’t aware of beforehand, so you’ll be comfortable with what you’re getting into.

If you have any questions about today’s topic or anything else real estate-related, please feel free to reach out to your Colemere Realty specialist. We’d love to help you however we can!

You aren&rsquo;t doomed to pay 20% down. Here are some of the options you have.

 

We get this question a lot: Are there opportunities to buy a home with low or no money down?

Various news outlets have claimed that you need a 20% down payment in order to purchase a home, but it’s not true—you can certainly buy a home with zero down.

There are several loan programs out there, such as the Utah Housing Corporation loan or the USDA loan, that help you buy with either nothing down or a very low amount. However, each program does have requirements. These may include:


  Income
  Size of household
  Location
  Home condition


“There are many factors that go into this, and a lot of them depend on your specific situation.”

There are many factors that go into this, and a lot of them depend on your specific situation. Your best bet is to speak with a professional real estate agent, and we’d be more than happy to have a conversation and figure out what works best for you. 

If you have any questions, would like more information, or are ready to talk about loan options, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Where are things headed in our real estate market as spring begins? Keep reading to find out.

 

Today we’re going to give you a bit of a recap on the first quarter of the year and what to expect as we move into spring and summer.

We’re ready to kick off the spring selling season after a slight slowdown toward the end of the last year. Even though the number of units sold has gone down lately, that has to do more with a lack of inventory than it does with the health of our market. We’re still in a healthy, strong seller’s market.

Right now, the median price in the single-family home market is up to $355,000 and we’re seeing an appreciation rate of around 8%.

“We’re still in a healthy, strong seller’s market.”

What economic factors have led to this? One of them is a bit of a slowdown in terms of job growth. At the same time, we’re not seeing as many people move to the state of Utah, and wage growth isn’t necessarily keeping up with how fast real estate is evolving. A wage increase is not expected this year, but it’s something we’d really like to see.

What does this mean to you? Well, if you’re thinking about buying or selling this spring, you might want to jump in early and get ahead of the summer rush. If you get in now while prices are still high, inventory is still extremely low, and the rush has yet to enter the fray, you could stand to get a better deal.

If you have any questions for us about real estate in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

2019 is our 66-year anniversary of being in the real estate business, and to celebrate, we&rsquo;re hosting our very own Founder&rsquo;s Day celebration this March.

 

2019 marks the 66th year that Colemere Realty has been in business, and we’ve decided to throw a party to celebrate.

First, we’ve brought in our father (and previous owner of Colemere Realty) Tom Colemere to tell the story of how our brokerage got started.

Our grandfather founded Colemere Realty in 1953. He originally worked in the furniture and appliance business, but a fire damaged his establishment and left him in debt. To pay off that debt, he became a real estate agent. A short time after, he became his own boss. We joined the family business many years later, and a large part of our continued success is due to our father Tom being a great mentor to us.

“If you plan on attending, please RSVP.”

Now, to commemorate our 66th year in business, we want to invite you to our Founder’s Day celebration on March 8 right here at our office from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.

If you plan on attending, please RSVP here with your name, number, and what kind of pie you would like.

If you have any questions for us in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to speak with you.

        <description>

Accessory dwelling units represent a great opportunity for homeowners, but there are rules for renting them out that you need to pay attention to.

 

As you may know, Salt Lake City passed an ordinance last October that allowed all homeowners to have accessory dwelling units (ADUs) on their property. If you’re looking to make some extra money through real estate investing or you’d like to have additional family members (such as in-laws) live on your property, ADUs are a great option.

However, today we want to remind you that there are different types of legislation being considered for different cities regarding ADUs, so it’s important that you check with your local municipality before deciding to rent one.

The reason we mention this is because companies that specialize in ADUs, such as Airbnb and VRBO, were market disruptors when they first came on the scene. They gave homeowners a platform to rent their ADUs, and as more and more started doing it, state and city governments became concerned that a surplus of ADUs would become a potential neighborhood nuisance. They don’t want streets to become overcrowded with cars or households with ADUs to become disruptive, so they stepped in and established some ground rules for renting them.

“There are a lot of great opportunities to be had with ADUs, but you need to make sure that you follow these rules before adding one to your property.”

There are a lot of great opportunities to be had with ADUs, but you need to make sure that you follow these rules before adding one to your property. Also, you should consider the management aspect of renting out an ADU because that responsibility falls on you.

As always, if you have any more questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you.

        <description>

Today we&rsquo;d like to shed some light on the hot topic of accessory dwelling units.

 

If you’re interested in making some extra money through real estate investing, or simply how to have your mother-in-law (legally) live with you, then having an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) on your property may be the perfect solution.

ADUs, which can be attached or detached, allow one additional family to reside on your lot. This can be a wonderful option for those with elderly parents moving in or if you have adult children coming back to live with you temporarily.

“Our team would be happy to assist if you are curious about how to pursue this option.”

If you so choose, you can charge rent for those living in your ADU, as we mentioned earlier. So, in the light of recent legislation pertaining to this subject, our team would be happy to assist if you are curious about how to pursue this option.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Today we wanted to discuss waiting until spring to buy a home and why that might not be such a good idea in this market.

 

We hear it all the time: “I’m going to wait until spring to buy a home, rather than try to find one over the holiday season.”

Though there are typically fewer homes on the market in the fall and winter months, that doesn’t mean waiting until spring is necessarily the best idea—especially in this market. Here are a few reasons why that is:

1. Interest rates are on the rise. Increased interest rates will negatively affect a buyer’s purchasing power, meaning they won’t be able to afford the same amount of home if they wait until spring to buy.

2. Less competition. Because there are fewer buyers in the market during the fall and winter, there is less competition for the ones who are looking during that time. The spring market is a prime season for multiple-offer situations and bidding wars, meaning you’ll have to work that much harder for sellers to accept your offer over another buyer’s.

“The spring market is a prime season for multiple-offer situations and bidding wars, meaning you’ll have to work that much harder for sellers to accept your offer over another buyer’s.”

The main question you need to ask yourself is whether or not you’re ready to buy a home. Are you qualified? Are you comfortable moving forward with a transaction right now? Are you in a position where it will be feasible to move? If your answers to these questions are yes, then why wait?

Yes, people don’t typically want to move while it’s cold or while there’s snow on the ground, but the reality is that, if you prepare for it properly, moving will only take a half a day—so there shouldn’t be much of a barrier.

And to be honest, this is our favorite time of year to show homes. It’s a lot of fun to go through and see all the houses decorated for the holidays.

If you have any questions about this topic or about buying or selling a home in general, don’t be afraid to reach out to us for all your real estate needs. We’re here to help.

We lose purchasing power as interest rates rise. Let&rsquo;s talk about what this means for you.

 

As you may know, the cost of financing a home has been going up. The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates in recent months, and with more increases on the horizon, today we’ll be talking about what this means for you as a buyer or seller.

Utah’s economy is growing rapidly right now, partially due to our many great job opportunities. The Fed will take this into consideration when they increase interest rates, which subsequently affects our housing market and available opportunities for homebuyers and sellers.

As rates rise, buyers can’t qualify for the same homes they previously could. For sellers, this makes it important to sell homes quickly. Because the buyer pool for your home will begin to drain due to increased interest, you won’t be able to get as much for your home and fewer buyers will qualify to begin with.

“There’s a direct relationship where we lose purchasing power as interest rates rise.”

Similarly for buyers, the amount you can qualify for is lower. There’s a direct relationship where we lose purchasing power as interest rates rise. If rates lowered, we’d see an increase in purchasing power, but this is incredibly unlikely to happen. This is illustrated on the graph below.



Feel free to reach out to us if you’re looking to buy or sell a home, have any questions that you’d like answers, or would simply like some further information. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

The fall is a great time to sell your home, and there are a few reasons why.

 

What makes fall a great time to sell your home?

First, we saw a strong spring and summer in terms of sales volume, but sales typically drop toward the end of the year. It doesn’t mean people don’t want to buy or sell; it just means there are fewer buyers out there for a variety of reasons (colder weather, the start of the school year, etc.).

Because of this, the remaining buyers are more serious. This means less tire-kicking and more people who are ready to make a deal. In fact, most fall buyers want to get into a home before the first snowfall.

“Now’s an especially great time to sell if you’re looking to move up.”

Most times, we also see less competition in the higher price ranges from other sellers during the fall, so now’s an especially great time to sell if you’re looking to move up.

If you’d like to put your home on the market before the snow starts falling or you have any other questions about our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help you.

        <description>

In our market right now, conditions are split based on price point. And today we&rsquo;d like to explain how this will impact your goals as a buyer or seller.

 

When it comes to our market, there’s more than one story to be told. We like to explain our current conditions as being the “Tale of Two Tales.” Thankfully, though, the only Dickensian thing about this update is the name.

To give you a better idea of what we’re talking about, let’s take a look at how our market has been faring recently.

First, homes below $350,000 are still selling relatively fast. But, as the name of today’s update implies, this only tells half of the story of today’s market.

Unlike their lower-priced counterparts, homes listed above $400,000 have actually been spending longer on the market and seeing lower offers than in the recent past.

So what do these two tales of our market mean for sellers?

“The things that are happening in the market on a broad scale don’t tell the whole story.”

Well, while those with homes in lower price ranges will have an easier time achieving selling success, those listing their home at or above the $400,000 will need to exert a little more effort.

For those listed in these less active upper price ranges, staging will be key. You will need to present your home in the best possible light to attract buyer interest and earn the best possible deal.

With this in mind, today’s buyers will also need to strategize according to the price point they’re searching in. Those looking in lower price ranges, where homes are moving more quickly, shouldn’t be afraid to get a little aggressive with their offers. Don’t forget to include favorable terms. Price is not the only component to consider when making an offer on a home.

Ultimately, buyers and sellers alike should be mindful of how market conditions will impact their success. Remember: The things that are happening in the market on a broad scale don’t tell the whole story.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

To sell your home for top dollar in our market, declutter and clean the inside and make sure the outside has great curb appeal.

 

If you want to sell your home for top dollar, here are three tips that will help you do so:

First, make sure your home has great curb appeal so it gives potential buyers a good first impression. The whole exterior needs to be inviting when buyers pull up, so make sure you keep up with your lawn maintenance.

Second, give your house a deep clean—clear the cobwebs out of the corners, open the blinds, clean the baseboards and the carpets, etc. There’s nothing more inviting than stepping into a home that’s clean and fresh-smelling.

“Make sure you keep up with your lawn maintenance.”

Lastly, declutter the home and remove any personal items so buyers can feel like the home is theirs. Buyers want to see the home—not your stuff. The better the opportunity you can give them to do this, the better the opportunity you give yourself to sell for top dollar.

If you have any more questions about how to sell your home for top dollar or you have any other real estate needs, please feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.

Lorna Davis joins me today to give you a quick summer market recap.

 

Today I am joined by Lorna Davis, an agent here at Colemere Realty Team, to do a summer market recap.

This summer, we saw interest rates creep up, and they are continuing to do so. If you are thinking about applying for a loan, you should keep this in mind.

As far as market segmentation goes, the market is seeing some slowdown in the $600,000 and above price range. Buyers and sellers are seeing listings in this price range stay on the market longer and it is causing the inventory to increase.

“The market is seeing some slowdown in the above $600,000 price range.”

In the price points below $600,000, though, it is a much different story. In fact, homes priced between $200,000 and $400,000 are still selling quickly. We’re in a strong seller’s market with a low average days on market.

If you are a buyer looking at purchasing in any price range, get in contact with us right away. We can work on strategies to be successful in the lower, competitive price range as well as the upper price ranges.

If you have any questions or suggestions for topics for us, please feel free to reach out to us. We would be happy to speak with you.

        <description>

Today we want to introduce Rhett Roberts, our transaction coordinator, who works behind the scenes to help your real estate transaction go smoothly.

 

On our team, everyone has a specific role to play. This allows us to make sure all the fine details of our clients’ transactions are handled thoroughly and efficiently. Today we’d like to introduce just one of the amazing professionals on our team: our transaction coordinator, Rhett Roberts.

Rhett’s does a lot of work behind the scenes. He acts as a liaison between all the involved parties such as the lender, title company, listing agent, and buying agent. A major portion of his job is to make sure that all the fine details of a transaction are taken care of, and that all deadlines are hit. Rhett makes sure nothing is left by the wayside.

We spend a lot of time organizing and mapping out a transaction. Rhett sets up inspections, organizes appraisals, and coordinates repairs with contractors, which can take a lot of time. For a single transaction, it can take about 10 to 20 hours of behind the scenes work.

As an agent with a growing book, it can be difficult to organize all of this while still working with clients. This is why it is so valuable to have a great team and a transaction coordinator.

“Rhett makes sure nothing is left by the wayside.”

Rhett has also helped us with feedback on listings. He has helped with getting additional addendums and updating the MLS as well as making sure the marketing is getting done.

As the team grows, Rhett’s role becomes more and more important. As we gain more agents and more clients, it becomes exponentially more important to have someone reviewing and following through on the details of each transaction.

If you have any real estate questions, please feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to speaking with you soon.

The home closing process can happen quickly, or it can drag on. Here&rsquo;s how to ensure that it goes quickly and smoothly.

 

Today we are talking about how long it takes to close a loan and what you should and should not do in order to speed up the process.

First, let’s talk about the things you should not do. Poor communication is high on the list. Poor communication with your agent, or loan officer, or the seller will slow the process down. Having too many contingencies with the appraisal, the inspection, or anything else will do the same thing.

What can speed up the process? Well, making sure you get the title early and fast is key, Your agent needs to quickly ensure that there are no liens or claims against it. Negotiating a repair credit as opposed to negotiating the repairs on their own will help speed things up too. Finally, having excellent communication with your lender and agent will certainly help and lead to quicker turnaround times.

“Great communication is key to a successful home closing.”

Once you’ve found the home of your dreams, communication and cooperation are huge in ensuring that your closing process is sped up and not slowed down.

If you have any questions for us or you know anyone who is looking to buy or sell a home anytime soon, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Zillow is one of the most popular real estate websites online today, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it can replace the knowledge and experience of an agent. Here&rsquo;s what you should know.

 

Why shouldn’t you trust Zillow to help you find your next home?

Utah is a non-disclosure state, meaning we’re one of the very few states that disclose private sales of real estate. As such, Zillow has a hard time identifying the true value of a property. Also,  there are many things to consider when it comes to valuing a home, and only some of which are…

Zillow also doesn’t show 100% of what is available on the MLS; oftentimes, they’ll show homes that aren’t even on the market anymore. Many brokerages opt out of the Zillow feed, so you’re not getting the full scope of what’s actually on the market.

“You wouldn’t go on WebMD to diagnose your illness, would you? Of course not; you’d go to the doctor.”

Furthermore, Zillow cannot replace the range of services that actual agents can provide. As Realtors, we can give you an accurate view of your home not only in terms of value, but we can also give you a full diagnosis, including how to best position your home to maximize its value in the market. You wouldn’t go on WebMD to diagnose your illness, would you? Of course not; you’d go to the doctor.

So many times over the years a client has come to me saying that Zillow has valued their home a particular way. We’ve actually been able to increase home values because we have the complete picture—full data and professional experience—to back that up.

If you have any questions or would like additional information, please reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you with any of your real estate needs.

        <description>

News reports have said that the affordability index is dropping, but what does this mean to you?

 

There has been talk in the news recently about affordability. So, we decided we would explain what affordability means and address how it may impact you. We hope doing so will assuage any worries you may have.

You may have heard that the affordability index is dropping. The affordability index is a number that is measured by mortgage rates, interest rates, and pricing. The news has reported that this index has dropped by about 5%.

As a consequence, buyers in the market are now worried that their budgets will be stretched. But there is no reason to be overly concerned. We are nowhere near historic lows in terms of affordability, though we will continue to see the affordability rate drop from about 15% to 20% by year’s end.

So, what does this mean to you? If you are a seller, now is the time to prepare your home and get it on the market.

“The affordability index is a number which is measured by mortgage interest rates and pricing.”

If you are a buyer who is ready to buy, why wait any longer? There should not be any excuse because waiting until next year hoping that prices come down will be a disappointment. Prices will not come down because of the market. Now is the best time.

The key is to reach out to us right away if you would like to discuss your buying and selling plans. We would love to help you succeed.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

So, what does this mean for buyers? The first thing we would like to say is, do not panic. There are plenty of available resources out there to help you achieve your real estate goals and find the right home for your wants and needs.

“In today’s market, where prices are rising, demand is high, and inventory remains at historic lows, so it is critical to have a great agent working on your side.”

One of your most valuable resources will be professional help. And we would be happy to serve that function for you. During our 65 years of business, our team has worked hard to build a strong reputation in the industry.

In today’s market, where prices are rising, demand is high, and inventory remains at historic lows, so it is critical to have a great agent working on your side. So, please reach out and allow us to show you how we can assist you.

A lot of you may not have heard about who we are, but Colemere Realty is the oldest real estate company in the Salt Lake Valley.

Both Bryan and I are third-generation Realtors. Our grandfather started Colemere Realty back in 1953, so we’re excited to share our story of who we are and what exciting things we have to bring to the real estate industry.

Even though we’re the oldest brokerage in the state, you may not have heard of us because we were heads-down, highly effective agents, working hard to produce for ourselves. Back in 2015, Bryan and I purchased the business from our parents, who retired, and we realized that we had a great system and we wanted to bring that to other agents. We also wanted to shift and have a team focus so that not only could Realtors produce at a super high level, but they could also have a life.

“We want to build an awesome team of highly motivated agents.”

We want to build an awesome team of highly motivated agents who are productive and have a team to back them up. We’re looking for great agents who want to be a part of a great culture with solid ethics founded in high levels of production, but who also want to build their own lives.

If you want to get something more out of your business and still have a life, please feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you.

Today we wanted to have a talk about whether you should rent or buy your next home. No matter what you choose, you’re paying a mortgage.

Some people are scared of the word “mortgage” because of the commitment. Even if you don’t technically have one, you’re paying for one if you’re renting. You’re actually paying more than a mortgage would cost and making your landlord money in the process.

Renting does have some benefits, but only as a temporary solution. The goal should be to own the roof over your own head. If you don’t, you’re just paying for somebody else to own the roof over your head.

“Renting has benefits, but it’s only a temporary solution.”

Those that own homes tend to have a much higher net worth than those who don’t. A mortgage also gives you a fixed rate that you can use to predict what your payments will be now and in the future. The price and payment stay fixed in this case. If you’re renting, you’re at the mercy of the market and the landlord’s decision. Rental rates have gone up much higher than home prices in the last few years.

If you have any questions for us about this topic or anything else related to real estate, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.

Should you keep saving to purchase a home, or should you buy a home now? 

This is a great question, and it all comes down to how much you are saving and whether your savings are outpacing the rate at which the market is appreciating. For example, if you’re saving $1,000 a month and the market is appreciating at $500 a month, it makes sense to save your money to buy a house. 

Unfortunately, our market is growing at a faster rate than most people are able to save right now. 

In our last video, we mentioned that appreciation is going to be anywhere from 6% to 8% in 2018, so keep that in mind. 

If we’re at a pace of 6% appreciation and you’re not able to keep up with your savings, it’s probably wise to buy a home sooner rather than later. That way, you’ll end up ahead. 

You should also keep an eye on interest rates. We’re in an environment where they have been talking about raising interest rates for a long time, and they are starting to do that now. As rates go up, a buyer’s purchasing power is going to be greatly limited. 

“Interest rates are the single greatest factor that can influence your monthly payment.”

For every 1% increase in interest rates, your mortgage payment goes up about $200. Interest rates are the single greatest factor that can influence a monthly payment. 

The good news is that there are some really favorable loan programs right now with low down payments or no down payment at all. In a market that’s appreciating like ours, it’s a good idea to take advantage of some of these programs to buy a home. There are also some grant programs that provide money for down payments. So, there are some favorable options out there if you don’t quite have the money you think you need. 

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We are well-versed in what’s going on in the market, and we’d love to help you.

        <description>

Today we’re excited to bring you the first installment of a two-part series on what you should do when your appraisal comes in low. 

We’re in a strong seller’s market right now. Certain price ranges are generating multiple offers for the listings that are out there, so sometimes an appraiser will enter the picture and disagree with the price that is listed on the contract.  

From a buyer’s perspective, the first thing to remember is that you always have the right to cancel the contract if the appraisal comes in low. This is the easy solution, but it doesn’t get you the house.

Typically when an appraisal comes in low, most people will try to renegotiate. This may mean that the buyer will have to come up with some extra funds or get rid of some closing costs that have been previously negotiated with the seller. 

Usually, there is an attempt by both parties to make it work out for everyone. 

“Sometimes an appraiser will enter the picture and disagree with the price that is listed on the contract.”

If it was an FHA appraisal, then the appraisal stays with the property whether the deal works out or not. 

During the process of renegotiating, it’s important that everyone pays attention to the contract deadline. Buyers especially need to realize that you must negotiate within this deadline if you want to get your earnest money back in the event the deal falls through. If you negotiate outside of the deadlines, the earnest money can be lost. 

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

If you’re planning to sell your home this spring, it’s never too early to start preparing it for sale now. 

Most sellers typically take between one and two months to prepare the home. They’ve got to make repairs, declutter, stage the home, and more. If you need help with any of this stuff, we’d be glad to help. We want to help get your home as beautiful as possible for the market so that you’ll get the most bang for your buck when you decide to sell. 

Aside from preparing your home, which is important, you should also make sure your finances are in order. We have some great lenders that we can refer you to that can help you out and make sure you’re comfortable with your budget. 

“You also need to make sure your finances are in order.”

We also have the tools to help set you up with an automated home search so that you can get a better feel for the market you are buying and/or selling in.

If you have any questions for us about the current state of the market or if you have any other questions about real estate, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

What can you expect from the 2018 real estate market? We want to share our forecast with you today. 

Since the real estate market was strong in  2017 and we expect it to continue to be strong in 2018, interest rates should go up. The Fed will probably raise interest rates two or three times in 2018. 

According to what we saw in 2017, you can expect more low inventory in 2018. We will continue in a strong seller’s market because of strong buyer demand. 

As we continue to add more people to the Wasatch Front through job growth or people having children, we are going to continue to see strong demand going forward, which will also cause prices to continue to go up.  

If you plan on selling your home, you want to make sure that you justify your pricing, even if you are in a strong seller’s market. Reach out to a real estate professional like us. We can definitely help you with pricing. 

“Strong demand will cause prices to go up in 2018.”

When you sell your home, chances are your buyer will use financing to purchase the house. That means you are selling your house twice, once to the buyer and once to the appraiser. The home has to appraise, or else nobody wins. 

If you are a first-time buyer in the $200,000 to $300,000 price range, it’s especially important that you are prepared to be very competitive with your offer. You need to be able to move fast. We have a number of different tips that you can help you succeed in this market. 

This is a general forecast for our local real estate market. If you would like more specific information for your neighborhood, or if you have any other questions, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

        <description>

Since we’re fresh into the new year, we thought it would be a good idea in planning for the future to give you all a recap about what happened in the market in 2017.

In terms of the volume of sales in 2017, there were about 20,000 units sold over the past year in Salt Lake County, which, compared to 2016, was about the same.

One thing to note, however, is that the price per square foot increased from about $126 to $137. This shows that prices are going up. It is important to keep in mind that price per square foot isn’t the best way to measure value, but it is an indicator of where values are going. 

We are also seeing what you’d expect when prices per square foot go up—the median sales price is also up from $268,000 to $299,000.

“The rising price per square foot indicates that home values are on the rise.”

Inventory remains low, especially in lower price ranges. We see inventories of two months or fewer across the board. When you have lower inventory like we’ve seen, it will also reduce the days on market. On average in 2017, the days on market was 20 days. This will vary a bit based on the price point of the home or where it’s located.

This is just a snapshot of what we observed over the past year. As always, if you have any questions about the market or real estate in general, please feel free to contact your Colemere Realty team member. We are looking forward to the new year ahead and wish you all the best moving forward.

        <description>

One of the frustrations our families have encountered the last couple of years during the holiday season is waiting in long lines to see Santa at the mall and paying a lot for pictures once we got the chance. 

That’s why we’ve decided to have Santa come to us this year, and you’re invited to join us when he does. On December 11 from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., bring your kids to see Santa with us at the Gateway Condominiums at 5 S. 500 West 5th Floor here in Salt Lake City. 

We’ll be serving hot chocolate and treats, and you’ll also have the chance to snap a few photos before checking out the lights downtown. We’ll have our own camera as well, so if you don’t have one, we can take pictures for you and email them to you.

“Skip the long lines and expensive photos this year.”

We’re very excited to have all of our friends and family join us, and we’d love it if you came too. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. Until then, happy holidays!

        <description>

A lot goes into the process of selling your home. That being said, there are a lot of things you should avoid. Today, we want to go over some of the biggest mistakes people can make when selling their homes.

First off is asking too much money for your property. Even in a seller’s market, this can be a mistake people make.

Our market is experiencing a slight shift, so overpricing can become very frustrating for everyone involved in the transaction. Listing your home too high will only lead to price reduction after price reduction.

The next mistake sellers commonly make is advertising too little. There tends to be an assumption that just because you’ve hired a Realtor, you’re in the clear.

“Putting your home on the market and waiting isn’t enough to successfully sell.”

The truth is that merely putting your home on the market and waiting isn’t enough. You will need a detailed marketing strategy to expose your home to the most buyers possible.

The last mistake we’d like to talk about is not preparing your home adequately for sale. Once a home is on the market, it is no longer just a place to live in. A home that’s listed on the market needs to be ready at a moment’s notice for buyers to view it. More than just the home you once lived in, your property is a showcase for what buyers can expect.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

When buying a home, there are certain things you mustn’t overlook. Here are the eight most important ones:

1. See the neighborhood at all times of the day. Don’t just observe it when you visit the home. Check out what traffic is like during rush hour or after school.

2. Pay attention to your daily commute.

3. Know your neighborhood codes and restrictions. This is especially important in neighborhoods that have HOAs (homeowners associations).

4. Don’t overlook the bedroom/bathroom count. If you are looking at a 4-bedroom home, for example, make sure it doesn’t have just one bathroom.

5. Make note of any specialty inspections. We always recommend a general home inspection but depending on the home you’re looking at, you might want to order a radon inspection, a termite inspection, or a number of other specialty inspections.

6. Pay attention to the things that can’t be changed about the home. This includes the lot size, the location, and the floor layout. 

7. Make note of the home’s resale value. Sometimes buyers can get too excited and forget to pay attention to any barriers that would make the home harder to sell than normal.

8. Is there room to grow into the home? This depends on your individual circumstances, obviously, but should be considered no matter what those circumstances are.

“Don’t buy a 4-bedroom home with one bathroom.”

We hope this list is helpful to you. If you have any questions in the meantime or need any real estate assistance, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Whether you are thinking of selling your home in the near future or not, it never hurts to have it looking its best. If your home needs any of the repairs below, they need to be addressed sooner rather than later. Doing so will save you thousands.

1. Caulk your cracks. If there is a joint in the settling that has moved or a crack in the floor, make sure to caulk it.

2. Clean out your dryer vent. Lint buildup is a fire hazard. Use a shop vac to clean it out.

3. Roof repairs. Anytime there is a bad storm and you have roof damage, you want it to be taken care of as soon as possible.

4. Chimney sweeping. Do this once a year to make sure your chimney is free of creosote, bird nests, and other flammables.

5. Change your HVAC filters. If they get too dirty, they can shut your system down.

6. Pest problems. Bugs or rodents of any kind should be eradicated as soon as possible.

7. Plumbing leaks. Even if it’s just a small drip, attacking any plumbing issues head-on and proactively is the best move.

8. Peeling paint. We see this a lot on the exterior of homes. It’s so easy to take care of and it can be such an eyesore to buyers.

9. Drainage problems. You don’t want to have a clogged rain gutter or a negative slope grade on your home. Over time, that can cause big problems in terms of water penetration and foundation cracking.

“Bugs or rodents of any kind need to be eradicated immediately.”

If you have any questions for us or are looking to buy or sell a home, don’t hesitate to reach out. Give us a call or send us an email today.

        <description>

As we move from summer into fall, let’s pause for a quick market update. 

First of all, is the market still hot? It depends on the inventory. If you are a buyer or seller in the $300,000 and under price range, inventory is still very tight—with only two weeks of inventory available. 

If you are buying or selling in the $400,000 to $700,000 price range, there are some interesting things happening. Sellers are getting a little aggressive and price reductions are becoming more common. 

Interest rates continue to hover in the fours or just below, so there is still strong incentive for buyers to get out there and make a move.

“In the $300,000 and under price range, there are only two weeks of inventory available!”

What does all of this mean to you? 

If you’re a buyer in the $300,000 and under range, the competition is stiff. Multiple offers are common, so be prepared for that. 

If you are a buyer or seller above $400,000, price reductions are more common. If you are a seller, make sure that you are priced a bit more aggressively than the competition. If you are a buyer, there could be some room for negotiation, so be ready. 

If you have any other questions about our current market or would like to know more about your specific neighborhood, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

        <description>

Do you ever feel like you’re running the agent rat race? 

The market is good right now, so it’s easy for single agents to run themselves ragged doing business. We totally understand that—we spent a lot of time in our careers as single agents, and we believe that a team is a valuable way to get out of the agent rat race. 

One of the myths it’s easy to talk yourself into if you’re a single agent is that you can do everything and skip paying for things like transaction coordination, communicating with title companies, and other services. 

When it comes to this myth and agent activities, single agents like to believe their time isn’t worth what it should be worth. What they end up doing when they meet with a client who tries to beat them up over their commission is offer a discount—they discount themselves, their service, and their fees. They then stay in the rat race by convincing themselves they only need to work harder and put more time in. 

“We all only have 24 hours in a day.”

The reality is, we all only have 24 hours in a day. As much as some of us want to think we’re Superman, there is not enough time in the day to increase business volume to what we think we’re capable of doing. This philosophy leads to agent burnout. 

You can spend your time scurrying around, putting up signs, and hanging lock boxes if you want. On a team, though, you have someone else doing those jobs so you can focus on writing purchase agreements, getting contracts signed, and prospecting. 

You can work hard and be effective as a single agent, but you will cap out at a certain volume because you don’t have enough time in the day to do it all. 

If you have any questions about our team or are interested in attending some of our training sessions, don’t hesitate to contact us. We’d be happy to speak with you.

        <description>

Recently, Scott and I were joined by Aaron Morgan from Academy Mortgage. 

On a recent trip to Africa that Scott and I took with our family members, we gathered donations for an underprivileged school. Aaron and Academy Mortgage will soon be doing similar work, but on a much larger scale.

The Academy Mortgage Foundation is what Aaron describes as an opportunity to give back. 

From the end of August until the first part of September, he and members of his team will be in Africa doing just that: giving back.

Aaron wants to spread the word about what he’s doing and how you can help. If you’d like to donate, you can click here to do so. Anything helps.

“We appreciate your willingness to give.”

As a partner to Academy Mortgage, Colemere Realty is happy for the opportunity to promote this opportunity to make a difference. 

We also accept drop-off donations at our office. We accept anything from clothing to shoes to books, and a number of other necessary items.

Ultimately, we have seen how charitable our friends, clients, and colleagues have been in the past and continue to be today. We appreciate your willingness to give.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

With Airbnb, you have the opportunity to generate huge cash flow by buying property specifically for short-term, nightly rentals. There are, however, three items you must take into consideration first. 


  The location and zoning of the property: Some cities are disallowing short-term rentals, so you want to make sure the city you’re considering purchasing your Airbnb rental in will support that. 
  Hiring a management company to manage the property: With nightly rentals, there will be a lot of turnover with people going in and out, and many potential issues could arise from day to day. We recommend hiring a third-party management company to handle the essential maintenance tasks so that doesn’t become a full-time job for you.
  Having an exit strategy in place: Specifically, there are two strategies we want to mention. First, make sure that if short-term rentals become unavailable, the property can still generate cash flow in a long-term rental scenario. Second, if the property doesn’t work out and you need to sell quickly, make sure you buy into an area with enough appreciation that you won’t lose money during that quick sale. 


“Hire a management company so maintaining your Airbnb property doesn’t become a full-time job.”

If you have any questions about investing in real estate, please don’t hesitate to give us a call. We’d be happy to assist you.

        <description>

Inventory has been shrinking recently and a lot of buyers are turning to building new homes instead.

When buyers do this, though, they need to ensure they are being well-represented. 

Today, we’d like to share three reasons why that is. 

First of all, when a buyer enters a model home the agent they are greeted by is actually representing the builder. This agent is focused on the builder’s money and best interest as opposed to the buyer’s.  

While they are usually very friendly and don’t mean ill will toward the buyer, it is important to be represented nonetheless. 

Next, buyers should remember that many builders use their own purchase agreement. We’ve personally seen these contracts and know that they can be upwards of 30 to 40 pages long. 

“It’s nice to have someone around who is familiar with the ins and outs of the process.”

So having someone who is representing you available to read and interpret these kinds of documents will be very important to the process and your understanding of it.

Finally, the purchase of a home is an emotional decision. All else aside, a home is somewhere you are going to put down roots, make memories, and spend time with your family. It can be hard to separate yourself from this emotion, so having someone who will be able to help you do so is greatly helpful. 

Ultimately it’s nice to have someone around who is familiar with the ins and outs of the process and can help you make the many decisions associated with homeownership.

If you’d like more information or have any other questions feel free to get in touch by giving us a call or sending an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

We’ve had to deal with quite a few multiple offer situations recently. These can get tricky, but we have been able to find consistent success in getting buyers the home they want while competing against other buyers who want the same home. We are here to share some of our best tips with you today. The first important thing is to make sure your agent tells the sellers your story. Striking an emotional chord with a seller will go a long way when it comes time for them to accept an offer. A lot of sellers are interested in the buyer who will live in their home next. You want your agent to present your case to the sellers as strongly as possible.

 

“Make sure the seller knows your story.” We recently had a buyer who was a nurse at a local hospital and ended up getting her offer accepted because of the seller’s connection to the nurses at that hospital. Making sure the deadlines on the offer are nice and tight is another good strategy. Finally, you need to have a solid pre-qualification letter from a lender that your agent has a relationship with. If they have closed many transactions with that lender, you can rest assured that you won’t be led astray.  If you have any questions for us about real estate or you know anyone who is interested in buying or selling a home, feel free to give us a call or send us an email anytime. We look forward to hearing from you.

We recently did a three-part series on investing, but we’re back with a bonus round to talk about the 1031 exchange and how it can benefit you when buying an investment property. 

Click here for part 1.

Click here for part 2.

Click here for part 3. 1031 is an IRS code that allows an individual to move the gains from the sale of one asset to the purchase of a like-kind asset without paying taxes on it. The 1031 can be a little tricky, but there are some basic rules to follow:  First of all, once you close on the property that you’re using the 1031 on, you have 45 days to identify three properties of interest. From there, you have 180 days to close one one of those properties. You can also close on multiple properties.  In the meantime, you can’t have any boot. That means you cannot take any money from the sale and put it in your pocket or else you will be taxed on that.

“Remember, third parties are necessary.” 

The last thing to keep in mind is that third parties are necessary. You need to use a third-party intermediary to handle the exchange on your behalf. Remember, you cannot touch the money from the sale of the property going into the exchanged property. That has to be handled by a third-party intermediary.  We have great resources to help you find that third-party and we can answer any other questions you might have about the 1031 exchange. Please don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!

Welcome back to the third and final part of our series on real estate investing.

You can read part one here and part two here.

After you’ve determined what kind of investment you’re going to make, it’s time to figure out your financing. These three options work best:

1. Traditional financing. Most lenders will require anywhere from 10% to 25% down. You need to be able to qualify for the loan based on your credit. You also need to have cash reserves in the bank.

2. Cash financing. If you don’t have all the cash in your bank account, you can use a 1030 exchange in order to get cash as well. Ask us more about this option if you’re curious.

3. Seller financing. This is where you get a little creative. All the terms can be negotiable, from how much you want to put down on the property to how long the seller will finance the property. With this method, you really take the seller’s existing financing and wrap around that.

“You have a few different options.”

Hopefully you’re all real estate investing experts by now. If you still have any questions, we’re always here to answer them. Just give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Welcome to the second part of our three-part series on how to invest in real estate. If you missed our first entry, you can see it here. Click here to view a .pdf of investment formulas to help you out!

Now that you’ve found a property you like, what happens next? Next, you have to evaluate that property, and there are three important factors to take into consideration.

The first is location. We’ve all heard the saying “location, location, location,” and it certainly applies to real estate investment as well. For example, a busy road can be a positive thing when it comes to real estate investment. Whether the property in question is located in an affluent area or one with a high crime rate is an example of the risk versus reward issue you must deal with when considering the location of your investment property.

This leads us to the second thing you must factor in: the age and condition of the property. We always advise people in this situation to order a home inspection. From that report, you’ll be able to determine what repairs are needed. This can also be a huge negotiating point for driving the price of the property down. You also need to consider the long-term objective of the property. Will the roof need to be replaced in five years? How are the water heater and the furnace?

“The numbers in investment real estate are critical.”

The last thing you want to factor in is how to run the numbers. The numbers in investment real estate are critical. This means things like the analysis of cash on cash, your return on investment, and the cap rate analysis. In the video above, we have a link attached providing examples of these forms and information on how to calculate them.

Stay tuned for the last part in our series about investment properties. In the meantime, if you have any questions about this topic or are interested in buying an investment property, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to talk to you.

        <description>

Investing in real estate is a great way to build long-term wealth for you and future generations. If you’re thinking about buying an investment property, there are three points you need to consider before following through.

First, what’s your overall objective in buying an investment property? Most people buy them for one of four different reasons:


  They want an additional monthly cash flow.
  They want to buy a property in a very strong area that’s appreciating in value.
  They need a tax shelter for their income.
  They need something to do with their time and want one as a hobby.


Second, remember that becoming a landlord is a business, not a charity.Make sure you’re using the proper contracts and you’re following them. Tenants will definitely try to take every advantage they can if they see that you’re not running your investment property as a business. We have the proper contracts and forms and we’d be happy to supply them to you if you like.

“Becoming a landlord is a business, not a charity.”

Lastly, begin with the end in mind. What’s your overall purpose? Do you want to fix and flip and make a quick dollar on the sale or are you in a long-term, buy-and-hold strategy to create a cash flow for yourself? Worst case scenario, if something happened and you had to sell the property, how would you sell it and how would you dispose of it?

Stay tuned for part two in our series about investment properties. In the meantime, if you have any questions or are interested in buying an investment property, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you get started!

        <description>

One of the worst things that can happen during a real estate transaction is a bad appraisal. You are already under contract, things are rolling along, and suddenly, everything stops because the appraisal didn’t meet the purchase price. 

If the home does not appraise, the home will not be able to be sold for the agreed upon purchase price. This is bad news for both the buyer and the seller. However, there are a few things you can do to make it to the closing table: 

First, the buyer can come up with the money to meet the appraisal price. Most buyers don’t want to do that. However, we are in a hot seller’s market right now, and many homes are drawing multiple offers. As a buyer, you might just have to bite the bullet and come up with the money. 

“We are in a seller’s market, so buyers may just have to come up with the extra cash.”

The other option is for the seller to come down a bit on the asking price. Again, in this market, that is unlikely. 

The third option is to renegotiate the terms of the contract. As a buyer, go to the lender and see if there is any room for adjustment in the interest rate. If the seller is paying for the closing costs, offer to cover them yourself. Ultimately, you can renegotiate to try and make the deal go through in a way that works out for everyone. 

If you have any other questions about how to handle a bad appraisal or if you want to know more about our current real estate market, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

It wasn’t all just go big or go home. He actually tried to find the best fit for us. I called him several times in the evenings and on weekends and he always took my calls. If he didn’t answer he made sure to call me right back, even on a weekend. He was always able to answer any questions I had and help me think through the whole process.”

        <description>

We recently attended a conference with local and national economists, and we got some great information about the real estate market in 2017. We wanted to share some of the key points that stuck out to us today.

The first thing we talked about was mortgage interest rates. We expect them to rise slightly this year with a strengthening economy. Once they go up, we will see a slight decrease in affordability, although home values will continue to rise.

Another thing to note about the 2017 market is that we will see a lot more millennials in the market. Utah actually leads the nation in the number of millennials. We love millennials and love working with millennials. It will be great to see even more millennials buying homes this year. This will contribute to the overall health of our market.

Scarcity of listings was a big theme in 2016. We expect the supply to improve this year, but don’t expect it to go too high, as demand for homes is still very strong.

Finally, we expect to see a moderate increase in home prices. We won’t see double digit increases, but we will see a nice, healthy appreciation of home values.

“We love working with millennials.”

There is some uncertainty about the housing market on a national level. Nobody’s quite sure what the Trump administration will do to the Dodd-Frank Act, ditto for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. However, we know that Utah is very strong in housing overall and we expect to have another great year in 2017.

Click here for the full 2017 Housing Forecast.

If you have any questions about the market or are looking to buy or sell a home, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.

“We knew them as friends and they referred us to their sons, who sold our home. A year and a half later, we were ready to purchase. So, we went back to them. We explained our situation and they were there immediately. They were able to get us a buyer in a very short time. They were just on the spot when we needed help getting our home sold and then when we needed to purchase, they ran into problems and we felt like they went above and beyond because the selling agent wasn’t doing her job.”

        <description>

If you listed your home and it didn’t sell, do you know why? It’s unfortunate that your home didn’t sell, but the good news is that it can be done.

There are four reasons why a home typically doesn’t sell:


   Location. If, for example, your home is on a busy road and wasn’t priced appropriately for the location, it might not sell.
  Condition. If your home doesn’t show well in pictures or when buyers come to tour your home, they will probably be turned off by it.
  Price. It’s an easy factor for people to point to, but there’s more to it than you might think. Your home must be priced according to the condition and the location. If it is, it’ll sell. If it’s not priced properly, buyers won’t want it.
  Marketing. This is a big piece that many people don’t understand as well. There’s more to selling your home than putting it on the multiple listing service. You need to have a strong agent marketing the home for you. 


“If your home isn’t priced right, it simply will not sell.”

The good news is that we’ve got solutions to all these problems. We have an interior designer who can help stage your home, we have a comprehensive marketing plan that we can go over with you, and we can help price your home aggressively. The solution isn’t always just about lowering your price.

If you have any questions for us or you’re thinking of buying or selling in the Utah market, give us a call or send us an email. We’d be glad to help.

        <description>

In today’s market, low inventory is creating a lot of competition for homes. Multiple offer situations are becoming more commonplace because of this, so we wanted to give you some tips on how to figure out which offer to go with.

As a seller, multiple offer situations can be a little tricky, but there are three ways to handle them.

The first is to just pick one offer and stick with it. You don’t have to entertain the other offers if you don’t want to.

The second way is to call for the highest and best offers. Whether you get two offers or five offers, you can send out a notification to those buyers and tell them they are in a multiple offer situation and need to submit their highest and best final offer.

“Multiple offer situations can be sticky for a seller, but there are ways to handle them.”

The last option, which puts a little bit more control in the seller’s hands in terms of what they want, is to counter each of the offers with a clause that says the seller has the final decision. So, if two buyers come back and accept that clause, the seller decides which offer to move forward with.

If you have any questions or would like us to cover a topic in one of our videos, please don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to help!

Today we’re standing outside one of our great listings to give you a quick market update.

Inventory is still really low in our marketplace. As a matter of fact, if you’re a buyer or seller looking to make a move below the $300,000 price range, the inventory level is a little bit over a half a month. If you’re above the $300,000 price range, it’s just below two months. The market overall has about a one-month level of inventory. This means that if all listing activity were to stop today, it would take that amount of time to sell every last house that’s listed.

“It’s still a great time to buy real estate.”

This means that if you plan on selling your home under the $300,000 price range, you should act quickly. Have all the necessary steps laid out and be prepared in advance to find your next home. If you plan on to selling it above the $300,000 price range, you may be on the market a little bit longer. Be patient, though, because the offers will still come, only at a slower pace.

Not too long ago, interest rates spiked a little bit, but they’ve since come back down. All in all, it’s still a really great time to buy real estate.

If you have any real estate questions or topics you’d like to see us discuss in a future video, please don’t hesitate to contact us or a member of our team. We’d be happy to help!

If you’re getting ready to put your home on the market, we’ve got some tips for you. These are seven things that home buyers do not want to see in a potential home:


  Too much wallpaper. It’s hard for buyers to get excited about wallpaper because they will most likely tear it down anyway.
  Stay away from lavish lighting fixtures. If you have an elaborate chandelier made of glass or deer antlers, replace it with something neutral while you’re in the process of selling.
  Textured surfaces. Whether it’s your walls, ceilings, or other surfaces, buyers don’t tend to care much for them.
  Using the wrong flooring. Replacing your flooring with the cheapest option might actually hurt your value more than it will help it. 
  Too much carpet. Carpeted bedrooms and living areas are normal- carpeted bathrooms and kitchens are not. Most buyers want hardwood or tile floors in those areas.
  Bold wall colors may turn buyers off. When in doubt, go neutral with your wall colors.
  Pools and hot tubs don’t add much value. While they may add value to you while you are living there, most buyers don’t necessarily want to take on the cost of owning and maintaining these items and continuing to pay for them.​


Follow this advice, and your home will be much more attractive to potential buyers. If you have any questions for us in the meantime, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.

What are some tips for selling a home in the wintertime? This is a question we get a lot, especially when it gets cold, and we are happy to tell you there are some great ones.

The first thing you need to know is that homes will definitely sell in the winter, and there are some things you can do that will make your home more appealing in the winter market.

It’s really nice to see a wreath and some Christmas lights hanging up when you first pull up to a listing. This makes your home seem warm and inviting, and a buyer will see how that adds a special charm to your home.

“An inviting atmosphere is key to selling in the winter market.”

You also need to make sure to keep your heat up. It’s very important that your home is warm as this will make it inviting. If the home is vacant, it is even more important to make sure the heat is on, as there is nothing more unattractive than walking into a cold, empty home.

Finally, make sure that your sidewalks and driveways are cleared. You want to make sure that there won’t be a potential hazard or risk of someone slipping and falling.

If you have any other questions, please reach out with a phone call or a quick email. We are happy to help.
