<p>Dear Real Estate Agent,</p>

<p>Do you want to be a real estate expert? If you are interested in making a full-time income in real estate, you need to be able to convert at least 12 deals a year.</p>

<p>Most new agents are not trained consistently or held accountable.</p>

<p><strong>You may believe that you’ve joined an organization that offers everything you need to succeed only to realize after a few months that the brokerage is not getting you the business you need to be successful.</strong></p>

<p>The average agent in Jacksonville only sells four homes a year. <strong>The average GCI for these agents is $24,000, and that’s before splits and expenses. In other words, the average agent is living at the poverty level and earning between $10,000 and $20,000 a year.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Agents often try to solve this problem by joining a 100% company, only to realize that there is no training or support.</strong></p>

<p>Some agents try to join a big brokerage or mine their sphere to get people to work with them. Your sphere knows they’re a new agent, that won’t generate enough business to make a sustainable, full-time income.</p>

<p>You may be stressed about having to tell your family that you’ve invested all this time and money into your real estate career only to fail. <strong>You may be worried that you have to return to a job that you hate.</strong></p>

<p>The good news is that there is a solution.</p>

<p>My name is Shawn O’Neill, and I’ve been in real estate for 18 years. At <strong>Expert Home Advisors, we curate opportunities for our agents and have proven, repeatable systems in place to get you face-to-face with buyers and sellers.</strong></p>

<p>Over 10 years ago, I got an MBA in lead generation. <strong>We’ve invested over $750,000 into our database of 23,000 leads, and we have an inside sales team building qualified opportunities for you.</strong> With our team, you will also get the training you need to get face-to-face with these clients and convert them into contracts.</p>

<p>I want to offer you a position on our team.</p>

<p>We have full-time agents who have made over $80,000 in their first year, and part-time agents who have made over $45,000 in their first year. <strong>We’ll talk about your personal goals to help you chase the things you personally want to achieve... not just your real estate career but also your life.</strong></p>

<p>Other agents may bounce from brokerage to brokerage, take out a credit card to buy more leads, or join a 100% company. <strong>At the end of the day, you won’t get the support or training that you need, and 100% of zero is just zero.</strong></p>

<p>One of our new agents wanted to replace her income. She joined two other companies before us and worked her sphere and did events. She barely made enough money to pay her mortgage. She was working a full-time job for part-time income. After joining us, she made $80,000 within her first year.</p>

<p>Another one of our agents worked for different team and then went out on his own. He eventually joined our team and made over $40,000 in his first six months.</p>

<p>Finally, another agent was working 20 hours a week part-time and he made $45,000. We were able to connect with him on a deeper level about what he wants to do. This year, he is on track to do 40 or 50 transactions and make over $150,000.</p>

<p><strong>If you give us 30 (flexible) hours a week, we can get you in touch with enough clients to help you make a full-time salary and enjoy a better life.</strong></p>

<p>Our team likes to have fun. We always do what we say we’re going to do, and we always do the right thing.</p>

<p>If you join our team, we will schedule a time to meet face to face and learn about your goals, what problems you’ve been having, and what you are looking for. This conversation helps you know if we’re a good culture fit. Then, we’ll go over our business plan and enroll you in the coaching and training program.</p>

<p><strong>If you join as a full-time agent and follow our training and systems, we guarantee that you will make at least $60,000 your first year.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We provide all the training, support, infrastructure, and leads that you need.</strong></p>

<p>The revenue split on our team is 50/50. Once you prove that you can do two deals a month, you will have the opportunity to become a partner and build your own business and team.</p>

<p>We are just signing up our first class of agents to get access to that database with 23,000 leads. If you apply now, you get the rare chance to get first access to that database. Send us your application today.</p>

<p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
