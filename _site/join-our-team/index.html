<h1>Join One of the Fastest Growing Real Estate Teams in Utah!</h1>
<h5>How would your life change if you consistently earned $60,000, $75,000, $100,000 or more as a full-time real estate agent?</h5>

<p>Dear real estate agent or frustrated employee:</p>

<p>I understand you’re likely working at a real estate brokerage, you may be a new agent who just got licensed, or you’re currently employed in a traditional corporate job. </p>

<p>If this is the case for you, you’re likely experiencing some challenges and frustration.   </p>

<p>At most brokerages, agents act as  independent contractors with little support, accountability, or training. In these situations, you probably don’t have a predictable source of consistent clients. </p>

<p>Perhaps you’re employed somewhere where you’re not happy because you’re not growing, you have little freedom, or you simply aren’t earning the money that you need and deserve. You may also be stuck in a negative work environment. </p>

<p>For most, the idea of a successful career in real estate is exciting, but the reality is that eight out of 10 agents leave the business within two years. What most don’t realize is that real estate can be a very challenging industry to break into without the right systems and support. </p>

<p>You can spend months or even years trying to figure things out, and spend thousands of dollars making very costly mistakes.</p>

<p>Worse still, you may end up working tirelessly without ever seeing the fruits of your labor, only to find yourself in a situation that’s worse than you were in before you started. </p>

<p>Whether you’re looking for a rewarding career change with unlimited potential or you’re an agent who is ready to take your real estate business to another level, we can help. Together we can make something great happen for you! </p>

<p>My name is David Robinson. I’ve been in the real estate business for almost 15 years and have sold over $90 million worth of real estate. Together, my team and I are doing something very special with our business and our team. </p>

<p>Our mission is:  “Change Lives Through Real Estate.”  This includes changing the lives of our clients, but it starts with changing the lives of our agents.</p>

<p>Let me tell you about Brandon. He was a police officer for five years, but was frustrated with the environment, the hours he was forced to work, and the negative nature of his role working with some of society's most difficult people. His life seemed to be filled with negativity and he knew he needed a change. </p>

<p>He had an interest in real estate. He wanted unlimited income potential, flexibility in his work schedule, and a positive work environment. So, Brandon made the career change and joined our team. </p>

<p>Today, after roughly 18 months, Brandon sets his own schedule, has closed over $6 million in real estate sales, has doubled his previous income, and is much more fulfilled in his career. In fact, he’s now on track to double his production from last year. </p>

<p>However, it wasn’t easy. Brandon works very hard and is committed to creating a new life for himself and his family. He was also willing to dive in, learn, and follow the proven models and systems we’ve developed. </p>

<p>I’d also like to tell you about Amber.</p>

<p>Amber has a degree in Engineering Design and loves real estate. She worked in the Engineering/Architecture field for 10 years until she became a mom. After that, she was looking for something with more flexible hours. It also needed to be a position where she could utilize her education and skills. </p>

<p>Ultimately she decided to get into real estate. She quickly obtained her license and joined a brokerage. Unfortunately, it was challenging to get started. She couldn’t figure out how to get lead generation going. She would contact a few friends and family on a daily basis, but didn’t have any successful leads for a few months. She tried cold calling, but didn’t know how to do it effectively. She tried open houses, but none of her leads turned into much. She knew she needed to work on scripts and objection handlers, but didn’t have anyone experienced to help her. She wasn’t holding herself as accountable as she needed to really get things going. She started thinking that joining a team may be the right move for her. </p>

<p>In her words, this is what happened after that:</p>

<p><em>“I didn’t know enough about teams. I decided to interview with three other teams to see where I fit in. No other team had the systems, organization, accountability, or offered nearly as much to help my business. Some felt more like I had to do all the work and they would offer very little in return. Only the Canovo Group provided every one of the systems I was looking for. Only the Canovo Group helped me get warm leads and teach me the scripts to turn them. Their operations manager had the most experience of any team I checked. I went to their team meeting and knew this was the team for me.Ever since joining the team, I have never regretted that decision. I closed five deals in my first four months, none of which I had before joining the team. I could not have provided those clients with anywhere near the level of service I did on my own. The Canovo Group helps me and my clients make the best transactions I can manage. It’s the best decision I’ve made for my career.”</em></p>

<p>We’ve developed a business model that makes good agents great, and great agents extraordinary! Agents who are willing to adopt our systems and models will enjoy a high level of success with a predictable and sustainable income and career. </p>

<p>When you join our team you’ll enjoy the benefits of: 
<ul>
<li>A career in an industry that provides a flexible schedule and unlimited income potential. </li>
<li>Done-For-You marketing that generates a consistent stream of buyers and sellers who want to work with you. </li>
<li>Industry leading technology and tools to help you do more in less time.</li>
<li>World-class administrative support so you can stay focused on working with clients, and not get bogged down in paperwork. </li>
<li>High-level coaching, training, and accountability to help you maintain a positive mindset, focus on the activities that generate results, and master the right skills so you can achieve more with less effort. </li>
<li>Be a part of a team that works together to help everyone achieve their personal goals, and have a lot of fun doing it. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Take action today and schedule a time to meet with me to talk about your goals and answer any questions you may have. Together we’ll decide if we’re the right fit.</p>

<p>As a gift, once you schedule your appointment, I’ll send you a free copy of our <em>“90 Day New Agent Game Plan for Massive Results!”</em> It’ll show you all the steps top agents take to enjoy enormous success in their first 90 days and set a foundation of success in the future.</p>

<p>Give us a call or send us an email today to set your appointment and we’ll make sure you get taken care of.</p>

<p>Until next time,</p>

<p>David Robinson</p>
