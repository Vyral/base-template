		            <p class="testimonial">Jody Donaldson was a tremendous help in selling our home. He had excellent suggestions for how to prepare our home for sale to get the maximum return on our investment. We worked with his recommended staging designer and followed both Jody's and her directions. Our house was listed for two days when we received three offers at or above asking price. We sold our home above the comps for our neighborhood. Jody was professional and friendly throughout the entire process. He was available whenever we had questions. It was a very pleasant experience and we will definitely talk to Jody if we need a real estate agent in the future. We highly recommend him and his team to anyone looking to buy or sell a home.</p>

He contacted us within an hour of that search and was able to find the perfect house for our purposes within 1 hour of our inquiry, simply fantastic! We came back to him 2 years later in our search for our first home purchase. An email in the dark and he not only remembered me, my wife, my 2 year old son (only 3 months old during the rental search) but he remembered everyone's name and personal tidbits about all of us. This may seem like an insignificant detail, but it's level of personal dedication that Jody will commit to you that makes you feel like he really cares about helping you.</p>
