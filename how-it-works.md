<h1>We'll Make Up to 1,000 Calls a Day to Generate Leads For You</h1>

<h3>Done-For-You Outbound Teleprospecting</h3>

<p>We offer done-for-you calling of your database or cold list, up to 1,000 attempts a day, to identify new, missed or unconverted opportunities for your sales team. You'll enjoy a dedicated calling assistant who is property hired, trained, and lead so there's no work required of you to oversee your calling assistant.  </p>

<p>We do all the calling work for you. The calling program includes 40 hours a week of calling by a trained agent, triple line dialer (when applicable), call monitoring/whisper/barge, premium speed internet, a computer, a noise reduction headset and backup internet service in case of disruption. Sales management includes daily group huddle, weekly one-on-one coaching sessions, 8 hours of daily supervision, daily script and role play practice, team building exercises, "gamification", daily sales reports, and instant notification of leads generated with live transfer option to a salesperson.  </p>

<p>We make 100% DNC compliant phone calls. All client provided phone numbers are scrubbed against national and state DNC lists. Cell numbers are also called on a regular phone line (not using automated dialer technology) to comply with new national laws.</p>
