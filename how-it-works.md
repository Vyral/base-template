<h1>We'll Make Up to 1,000 Calls a Day to Generate Leads For You</h1>

<h3>Done-For-You Outbound Teleprospecting</h3>

<p>We offer done-for-you calling of your database or cold list, up to 1,000 attempts a day, to identify new, missed or unconverted opportunities for your sales team. You'll enjoy a dedicated calling assistant who is property hired, trained, and lead so there's no work required of you to oversee your calling assistant.  </p>

<p>We do all the calling work for you. The calling program includes 40 hours a week of calling by a trained agent, triple line dialer (when applicable), call monitoring/whisper/barge, premium speed internet, a computer, a noise reduction headset and backup internet service in case of disruption. Sales management includes daily group huddle, weekly one-on-one coaching sessions, 8 hours of daily supervision, daily script and role play practice, team building exercises, "gamification", daily sales reports, and instant notification of leads generated with live transfer option to a salesperson.  </p>

<p>We make 100% DNC compliant phone calls. All client provided phone numbers are scrubbed against national and state DNC lists. Cell numbers are also called on a regular phone line (not using automated dialer technology) to comply with new national laws.</p>

<p>Why hire 1000 Calls A Day vs. Hiring your own in-house VA directly?<p> 

<p>Many of our clients have tried to hire in-house ISA’s or directly hire VA’s that are virtual.  This is an extremely time consuming, frustrating, and tedious process that is not the best use of your time.  Let us take this off of your plate once and for all!<p>

<p>Is 1000 Calls A Day the right company for you?<p> 

<p>We are a great solution for experienced real estate teams, investors, and several other types of businesses.  We offer a great solution to the business owner who has hired ISA’s and OSA’s in the past and is sick and tired of managing this process.  If this is you, we can offer you a great solution that saves you time and money.<p>  

<p>However, our program is usually not a great fit for single agents and smaller businesses who have never hired ISA’s and OSA’s. Here is a video that explains who we can help and how you can achieve a great ROI with our service!<p>
