You’ve got your sights set on buying a new home, but where do you begin? Your first priority should be to get pre-approved with a mortgage professional. That way, you’ll know the extent of your purchasing power. Once you know how much house you can afford, bring this information to a real estate professional who will then show you homes that are within your means. From there, you can begin to narrow down your search and reach a decision.
