<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Are you making any of these 10 common but costly homeownership mistakes? If so, we’ll explain how you can mitigate them.</em></p>

In real estate, people often talk about how much it costs to buy a home, but what about the cost associated with simply living in a home? As most homeowners already realize, owning a property can be an expensive ordeal.&nbsp;

Today, we’ll cover 10 expensive homeownership mistakes. For each point, we’ll also discuss a money-saving alternative. Let’s dive right in:

**1. Using incandescent light bulbs.** These bulbs can cost about $180 per year. Using LED bulbs instead will cost you 87% less, making these bulbs the far more cost-effective option.&nbsp;

**2. Ignoring leaky faucets.** A leaky faucet can waste up to 3,000 gallons of water in a year, racking up a hefty water bill all the while. Fixing leaks as soon as you notice them is essential.&nbsp;

**3. Using dirty or incorrectly sized filters.** To keep your heating and air conditioning units working smoothly, you will need to regularly replace filters—making sure that, when you do, you use the correct size.&nbsp;

**4. Excessively adjusting your thermostat.** Programmable thermostats can save you a lot of money.&nbsp;

**5. Not adjusting your vents.** There’s no sense in leaving vents open to empty rooms. You should only heat and cool the areas you actually plan to be in.&nbsp;

**6. Overwatering your lawn.** If you have a sprinkler or irrigation system, you need to make sure it’s working properly.&nbsp;

**7. Setting a water heater’s temperature too high.** Adjusting the temperature of your hot water heater according to the season can save you a lot of money on your utility bill.&nbsp;

**8. Ignoring leaky windows.** If you feel any air coming into your home on windy days, it may be time to recaulk around your windows to ensure that they’re properly sealed and are not leaking air.

**9. Paying a handyman to take care of small projects.** In the age of the internet, almost anyone can tackle most minor repairs without the help of a professional.&nbsp;

**10. Neglecting your roof.** If you have any curling or cracked shingles, your roof may leak and cause costly damage.
