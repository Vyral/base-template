Before you can ask when you should list your house, you need to ask yourself why you are listing it in the first place.

Then you should ask yourself about your home’s condition. What do you need to do to get your home in tip-top shape? You can sell as-is, or for peak and maximum profit. **For peak and maximum profit, we need to pay special attention to a few areas, including the front yard and the front door.**

Next, take a look at timing. The peak time to list is March, April, and May. The peak time of that peak time is from the end of March to the middle of May. **Listing during that time will get you maximum exposure and maximum price.**

Pay special attention to any anomalies in the market. In the last three or four years, we’ve been seeing that in Portland. If it’s a low inventory situation, you can list your home anytime.

It’s going to be an incredible 2018. We’ve already doubled our business from March  of last year so I predict a steaming spring market. If you have any questions for me or need help buying or selling a home, give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you.
