Many people enter real estate thinking they're prepared for the demanding seven-day-a-week nature of the business, only to realize how intense it truly is.

However, the truth is that it’s an around-the-clock commitment, which can be quite challenging. Interestingly, individuals with a background in the service industry tend to excel because they're accustomed to evening and weekend work. Surprisingly, the hours in real estate can be more manageable than those in the service industry.

However, anyone can find it tough to navigate. **Those who thrive are those who focus on the positive aspects of the schedule.** They appreciate the flexibility to attend their children's activities and run errands during quieter times of the day. It's all about being intentional, organizing, and prioritizing family and business in your schedule. This doesn't mean you have to sacrifice things; it just means you need to find a way that works for you. By being intentional, you can succeed in the demanding real estate world.
