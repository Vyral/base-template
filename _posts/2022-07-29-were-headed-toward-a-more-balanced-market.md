We’ve spotted some amazing opportunities for all those buyers who got beat out in the previous market. If you’re one of the buyers who got outbid so much that you decided to wait—don’t\! There are a few great reasons why now is an excellent time to buy.

The sticker shock that buyers had about home prices is gone. Rates might be a bit higher, but they’re not at 9% or 10%. **Today’s rates are still great**, and they have come down a bit since their first increase.

Now is the time to look at your financial portfolio and see if it’s time to get back out there. **If you’re waiting for the sky to fall on our housing market, stop.** We don’t think that will happen, and if you keep renting in the meantime, you’re paying for your landlord’s mortgage instead of your own.

If you want to build your wealth over time, there’s no better time to strike than now. We went from a hyper seller’s market to a more normal seller’s market. However, we’re headed toward a more balanced market, which means you’ll have a lot of room to negotiate.

**You still need to be careful of who you work with.** Make sure your agent has the experience to get you what you want. Rates are a little high right now, but some experts think they will drop next year.

If you have any questions, feel free to call or email us. We’d love to talk about what’s going on in our market.
