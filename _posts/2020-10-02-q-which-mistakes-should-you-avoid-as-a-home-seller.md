If you’re thinking about selling your home anytime in the near future, today I want to offer some advice. Here are seven critical home-selling mistakes that you should avoid if you want a smooth, less stressful home sale:

**1\. Picking the wrong agent.** Pick someone with experience who knows the market and has comprehensive marketing knowledge to highlight your property in the right light. You also want someone who is a great communicator, not only with you but also with other agents.

**2\. Overpricing the property.** Consumers are more savvy these days than ever. They can get all of their information online to get a much better idea of what your home is actually worth. If it’s overpriced, they will know and many may not even come and look at the home. That will lead to a stale listing and a price adjustment.

**3\. Only considering the highest offer.** There are many terms that make up an offer. Price is important, but it’s not the only thing you should consider. Don’t just automatically go for the highest price, look for the offer that offers the most value to you.

**4\. Failing to prepare your home.** If there are simple fixes we can make, like painting or power washing, we want to do that before you start showing the home and put it on the market. You don’t have to remodel anything, but you do need to make your home shine.

**5\. Falling to declutter the home.** Depersonalize the home so that a buyer can envision their family in the home. You’re going to be moving anyway, so why not get a headstart on moving by packing away those personal items.

**6\. Getting too emotional.** A real estate transaction is a business transaction, but it’s one of the largest purchases you’ll ever make. You’ve got to be level-headed and detached emotionally with what’s going on in order to get the best deal.&nbsp;

**7\. Not being flexible with showings.** The easier it is to show the home, the better your opportunity to sell it, especially right here on Kauai.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me about selling your home or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
