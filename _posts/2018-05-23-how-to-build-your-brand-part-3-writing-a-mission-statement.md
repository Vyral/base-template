Today we are going to continue our series about building your brand as a real estate professional. Specifically, we are going to re-emphasize the importance of core values and further break down the importance of defining your mission statement.

When you define the brand, **you must start living those core values.** Clients will expect you to cover each of these values when you first meet with them.

You must also have a mission statement, which is an element of building your brand we haven’t previously discussed.

**Ask yourself: What is your mission in doing real estate?** All of us want to make an income. But who are you, what do you represent, and what do you want to be?

If you want to be good at this, or great at this, you need to be defined, you need to have core values, and you need to have a mission statement. All of these things will allow you to convey your brand to clients in a way they can understand.

If you have any questions about writing your own mission statement, please feel free to reach out to me. I would be happy to help.
