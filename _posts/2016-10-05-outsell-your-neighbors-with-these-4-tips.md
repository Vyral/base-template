If you’re selling your home, there are four things that you can do to sell your home faster than anybody else in your neighborhood.

1.    Update the landscaping. Curb appeal is huge. If buyers don’t like what they see on the outside, they may never come in and see the inside. Trim your shrubs, pick your weeds, and put a layer of fresh mulch down to make your landscape look new again.

2.    Paint. Nothing will make a home feel brand new like new paint on the walls. In the grand scheme of things, paint is relatively inexpensive but can pay huge dividends when it’s time for buyers to make an offer.

3.    Move out of the house. Make it appear as though you’ve moved out. If you’re still living in your home, get rid of as much as you can. Like we always say, “Clutter eats equity.” Clutter can make buyers think that the house is smaller than it is or has less storage than it does. The more you can get rid of, the easier it will be to get the home ready for showings, and homes that show well tend to get more offers.

4.    Price your home correctly the first time. We analyze price changes and days on market for homes that have sold recently, and most of the time we’ve found that the homes that were priced right the first time sold quicker and for more money than the homes that reduced their price. Even if you’re not in a hurry to sell your home, a home that is priced correctly will net you more money on the bottom line in the end, so it’s important to get out onto the market with the right price the first time.
