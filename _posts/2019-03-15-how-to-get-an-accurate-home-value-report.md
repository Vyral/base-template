Home value reports are offered nearly everywhere, but where can you get the best one? Let me explain to you how we do it.

**We do the entire report by hand.** You can try Zillow’s Zestimates, but they use an algorithm that utilizes public records and MLS information, and it’s often inaccurate. Zestimates find the ballpark value about 80% of the time, but that means it’s nowhere near the correct value the other 20% of the time.&nbsp;

I had a client who believed his home was worth $275,000 because of the Zestimate, but in reality, it was worth about $100,000 less. Of course he wanted to believe his estimate was true, **but you simply can’t trust an algorithm.** So when I’m asked about a home value report, I use the same records, but I also use my experience and knowledge about the marketplace to find out what a home is worth. **I ask questions before I even set foot in the house, and the answers matter when it comes to value.**

Online calculators simply ask about the number of bathrooms and bedrooms, square footage, and the address. **There is so much more that goes into finding a home’s value than these four things.** Here are some examples:

* Bathroom renovations, colors, etc.
* Type of roof
* Garage utilities
* Electrical lines
* Nearby road traffic
* Number of stories in the home
* AC units
* Type of flooring
* Age of windows

I can get a pretty accurate idea of your home’s worth through a simple phone conversation, and I’m happy to do so. If our ideas of what your home is worth match up, **then it’s time for me to take a visit and really lock down the right price.** There’s just too much that goes into the value of a home for you to leave it up to online calculators.
