  Another successful sale by Casey Cooke! The sellers of this home originally
  interviewed me nearly 2 years ago. At that time they decided to hire a big
  name broker out of San Diego who came in and promised a lot but did not know
  the area and the home did not sell. They then hired an acquaintance out of
  Carmel Valley and again, the home did not sell. They then called me back,
  hired me, and we sold it for full price in 5 days. That is the power of
  Coldwell Banker marketing mixed with my local expertise!

Welcome home to the peace and quiet of rural Vista. This custom single story home measures 3,123 square feet with 3 bedrooms and an optional 4th, 3 full bathrooms and a 3 car garage. The home is set on ~1.4 flat, usable acres with a seasonal creek behind the large entertainer's back patio and plenty of room to add a guest house/ADU or detached shop/garage. The home is also located outside of city limits which means there are fewer restrictions on what you can do with the property. Inside is move in ready with travertine floors, granite countertops, cherry wood cabinets, stainless steel appliances and more.

The layout is outstanding, the spacious master bedroom and bath are located on the far end of the home away from the kitchen and main living areas which adds to the peace and quiet. The 2 spare bedrooms share a jack and jill style dual access bathroom and are located across the hall from the master. In addition, there is an optional 4th bedroom that is currently being used as a home office.

Head down the hall from the bedrooms and there is a spacious living room (~16'x18') just off the entry and a formal dining room. The kitchen is well appointed with travertine flooring, granite counter tops, loads of cherry wood cabinetry, stainless steel appliances, custom crown moulding and recessed lighting. The kitchen leads right into the family/great room with views of the backyard. The home is ideal for entertaining and the sellers have hosted huge gatherings. With a large back patio, kitchen, plus separate family/dining/living rooms there are plenty of spaces for guests to gather.

The home is located in a rural area of Vista so you feel like you are living in the country yet everything you need is within just a few minutes. The location has great proximity to local schools, shopping, entertainment, the downtown area and more. The world-famous beaches of Carlsbad are just a few minutes to the West, Downtown San Diego is roughly 45 minutes to the South and everything else people love about San Diego is not far away. Vista is also known for having some of the very best weather in the state and country. Summers are warm but not extreme, winters are chilly but not too cold, humidity is low, and it is just far enough inland to avoid most of the marine layer. The owners love the tranquility of the location, hearing the birds chirping and enjoying long hikes through all the wide open spaces right out the front door. If you have dogs they will love all the walking and hiking nearby.
