Today we'll talk to you about marketing. Clients often ask if there’s a separate charge on our property management fees for marketing. No, there are no additional fees—marketing is free with Hawaii Pacific.

**We send out materials to 32 websites, market locally, and use social media.** Photos are a large part of our marketing. We usually take about 30 photos of your home and get a walkthrough video. There’s no charge to the owners, and we send these marketing materials out frequently. Each time your unit goes vacant, we do a new marketing campaign to show and record the current condition of the house before a new tenant moves in. That’s why it's really important to get good photos.

If you have any questions, visit our website or give us a call at (808) 445-9223. We look forward to hearing from you.
