Today I'll give you a quick update on what's going on in the real estate market.

Thankfully, COVID now seems to be somewhat tamed for the near future. This has caused a resurgence of pre-COVID market conditions like pricing and interest rates. With that said, rates have gone up, but because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, rates dropped again by 0.5%.&nbsp;

**This drop has created a short window of opportunity** to refinance for those with a mortgage in the 4% range. I don't think this rate drop will last long because it was artificially created by macroeconomic factors like the war and the sanctions imposed on Russia.

Let's talk through your situation and see if it makes sense for you to refinance. Just because rates went up, it doesn't mean that you lost your opportunity. Give me a call at (619) 948-2996. I look forward to hearing from you.
