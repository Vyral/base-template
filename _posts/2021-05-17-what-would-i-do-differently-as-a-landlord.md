I used to be a landlord back in the day and it was a pretty good experience overall. If I had to do it over again, though, there’s one thing I would do differently:

**I would seek out more mentorship.** I tried to do it all on my own without any help, and I made some mistakes as a result. Despite my mistakes, it was a profitable venture and I really enjoyed it.&nbsp;

For any investor, it’s important to build your own in-house team to manage your properties. If you have any questions for me about being a landlord or getting involved with real estate investing, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
