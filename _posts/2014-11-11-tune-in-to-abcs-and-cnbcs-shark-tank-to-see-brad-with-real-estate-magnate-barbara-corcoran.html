{% include youtube.html %}Tune in to ABC's and CNBC’s Shark Tank to see Brad side-by-side with real estate magnate Barbara Corcoran.

Corcoran is Shark Tank’s resident real estate mogul and a prominent self-made multi-millionaire. She is now endorsing a select few of the best real estate minds in the country, Brad being included. Brad will appear in a commercial airing in several episodes throughout the season.

Brad's company, The Brad Korb Real Estate Group, is a dominant leader in the real estate industry, providing phenomenal service and expertise to a wide base of clientele in the Los Angeles area.

“To sell your home on time for the most money, you need a sharp agent with a marketing strategy that creates the most demand,” Corcoran said. “Bottom line, you need a partner willing to put their own money on the line for you …. Brad Korb knows how to attract the right kind of buyers and create so much demand that if your home doesn’t sell at a price and deadline you agree to, Brad will buy it!”

Corcoran is an iconic figure in the New York real estate scene and nationally known as the real estate contributor to the NBC TODAY show. She has invested in more than two dozen businesses to date on Shark Tank, and has written several well-received books including Shark Tales: How I turned $1,000 into a Billion Dollar Business.

“It’s very gratifying to be among the handful of real estate agents endorsed by Barbara. I’ve always admired her because she understands small businesses and the importance of investing money to help others achieve success. That’s exactly what I do for my clients,” Korb said. “I hope everyone tunes in to Shark Tank to see the endorsement of Barbara Corcoran. I’m proud to be affiliated with it!”
