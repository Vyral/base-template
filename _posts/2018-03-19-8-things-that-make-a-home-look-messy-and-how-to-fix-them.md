Today, I’ll be going over eight things that can make your home appear messy, as well as what you can do to fix them. Simple cleaning projects will make a big difference, especially if you’re going to list your home.

**1. Cluttered shelving.** Make sure the shelving in your home is clean and free of clutter.

**2. Tangled wires and cords.**Cleaning up tangled cords can be as simple as using a wire tie. This will be especially important around computers and home entertainment systems.

**3. Too much wallpaper.** If you’ve got a lot of patterned wallpaper in your home, you’ll want to get rid of it. Your walls should look fresh and neutral.

**4. Sloppy entryways.** If you’re putting your home on the market, a tidy entryway will be critical. This space provides the first impression of your home for buyers and guests alike, so make sure it’s clean and well-maintained.

**5. Unmade beds.** Making the beds, and perhaps even adding some decorative pillows, is a small task that can really make a difference in the way a bedroom looks.

**6. Cluttered floors.** There shouldn’t be anything left out on the floors of your home if you want it to look clean. Make sure everything is picked up for a tidier appearance.

**7. Dirty laundry.** Your home will look much messier if you’ve got laundry sitting out, so make sure everything is washed and put away.

**8. Crowded countertops.** This is especially problematic in kitchens. If you’re trying to show off counter space, make sure the surfaces are clean and free of clutter.
