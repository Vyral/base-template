Buying and selling a home is a stressful process and lots of different things can go wrong. However, a home warranty can solve a lot of these problems. Here are a few reasons why I believe that a home warranty is a good option.

{% include pullquote.html %}

- **Base plans protect systems and appliances:** This is always a good thing to have, and it should provide a lot of peace of mind for you. You can also upgrade your package so that more of your belongings are protected.

- **Products are tailored to your geographic area:** Maybe you live on a flood plain, or in an area that's prone to fires. Wherever you are, the warranty will cover your specific area's needs.

- **Service guarantee:** Warranty companies provide great vendors that always do their best to provide excellent customer service. I've also seen that most claims made on warranties are handled quickly and efficiently. Sometimes, if they cannot respond fast enough, they'll allow you to hire a local contractor.

- **Peace of mind:** The biggest advantage of a home warranty is the peace of mind it allows you to have when you move into a new home. On average, every homeowner goes through two mechanical failures every year. If you have a warranty when something goes wrong, all you have to do is give them a call, pay your deductible, and you're set.

Even if you're selling your home, you can purchase a home warranty during the period of time that it's on the market. This way, if something goes wrong, you can get it fixed quickly and not spend your time worrying when you're just trying to sell your home. You can also use it as a valuable marketing tool when you sell, because buyers like to see homes that are under warranty, and it's easy to transfer the coverage to buyers.


**Overall, getting a home warranty is a great way to secure peace of mind.** Please don't hesitate to ask me about any of this information, I'd be happy to help you!
