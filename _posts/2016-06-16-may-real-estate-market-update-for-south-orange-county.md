Today we’ll provide an in-depth look at what’s happening in the South Orange County market as of May 2016.

**Everyone will be pleased to hear that year-over-year home prices have risen by 7-9% depending on what neighborhood you live in.** These numbers are based on detached single family homes in South Orange County, and homes in the range of $600k to $900k seem to have appreciated in value the most. Homes in this price bracket have been selling quickly and for 97% of their original asking price.

The average days on market is 50 days right now, which has risen a little since last year, but that’s still a very good time frame. **Now, 50 days may seem like a long time, but this market is extremely hot right now.** We recently had a home that drew in five offers and we sold it for more than the asking price.

If you’re looking for homes in the $1 million range, we have seen a little bit of a slowdown in the market. **This is nothing alarming, as luxury homes typically take longer to sell.** However, the luxury markets are shifting more towards a buyer’s market, so now may be a good time to purchase a luxury property in South Orange County.
