What do the numbers say about our market? Let’s find out.

The latest numbers are in, so today we’ll be taking a look at how our real estate market has fared in 2019 so far.

We currently have 666 properties on the market, and 240 of those are currently under contract. We have 2.8 months’ worth of inventory, which is pretty low—**anything under three months is considered to be a seller’s market.** Fortunately, buyers and sellers are still negotiating and finding deals that make both parties happy.

If you’re a seller, it’s a great time to jump into the market. We’ve sold about 1,000 homes in the last six months, and the average price point has been around $392,000. The actual sale price has ended up around $374,000, however. Sellers are getting about 98% of their original list price. **But now that inventory is tight, you’re more likely to successfully get your asking price.**

The average days on market for sold homes is 59 days, and for currently active units, the average number of days is 111. **This means that homes that were priced correctly and in good condition sold fairly quickly.** Otherwise, it takes much longer.

If you have any questions or need further information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
