With Hurricane Florence causing destruction along the Carolina Coast, I want to take a moment to bring you a couple of important messages. First: Stay safe out there. I wish you and your loved ones well in this difficult time.

Next, I wanted to also let you know that, because of the storm, we will be rescheduling our golf tournament. **We will be postponing the event (originally scheduled for September 14) until Friday, October 12**. Other than that, all of the details of the event will be the same.

We’ll be hosting a lunch before the tournament starts, as well as a prime rib dinner with all the fixings after the day is done, so make sure to come hungry. With that in mind, we do ask that everyone arrives between 11:00 a.m. and 11:30 a.m.

This event is going to be a great time, so we sincerely hope you’ll join us for food, fun, and the chance to win great prizes, including jewelry, tech gadgets, and more.

Best of all, **100% of the proceeds from this event will go toward providing enrichment opportunities and college scholarships for kids between sixth through 12th grade.**

We look forward to seeing you on the course, but until then, feel free to give us a call or send us an email if you have any questions or would like more information. See you at the tournament!

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to seeing you soon.
