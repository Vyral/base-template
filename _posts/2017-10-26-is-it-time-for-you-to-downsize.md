Today I want to go over the subject of downsizing. Ask yourself this: What is the right size for the next 10 years of your life?

There are many people in our country reaching retirement each day. A significant number of these people have homes that are much larger than they need.

To help people determine whether it’s time to downsize or not, I like to ask the question, **“What is the right size for the next 10 years of your life?”**

There is a lot to think about and discuss on the subject of rightsizing, which is why I’d like for you to join us for our next seminar.

**This upcoming event will take place on November 15th at the Arrowhead Country Club,** and I hope to see you there.

One thing to think about when you’re considering downsizing is the size of your current home and how that size affects its maintenance. Once the kids are out of the house, is all that extra space truly necessary?

My team and I can help you determine what your options are moving into the future. Whether you choose to live in an active adult community or simply wish to move into a smaller home, you can learn more about your options at our seminar.

**An attorney, title person, stager, professional photographer, and myself will all be present and ready to help.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
