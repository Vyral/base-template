Today I have a message for the buyers in the Tucson area. Most of you are aware, if you’ve been listening to the news, that the market here in Tucson is heating up. By that I mean that private properties are selling quickly and inventory is getting considerably lower. **This means that we’re in a pretty good seller’s market at this time.**

Most price points under $300,000 in Tucson are experiencing a seller’s market. What this means is that we have more buyers than houses available. If you’re a buyer and you’re looking for a new home, you need to be prepared to put down a strong offer very quickly in order to compete in this market.&nbsp;

A strong offer means that you’re pre-qualified by a lender or have proof that you can pay cash. That offer also includes a purchase contract, proof of funds, and a copy of the earnest money check.

Many of the homes listed at $300,000 or under are selling in the first six days on the market. With such incredible buyer interest, it isn’t likely that a seller will consider any offers that are less than list price. **So again, the key here is a strong offer that’s made quickly.**

If you have any other questions about this topic or you’re looking to buy or sell your home, please give me a call. I’d be happy to help!
