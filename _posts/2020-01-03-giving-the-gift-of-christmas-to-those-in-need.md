&nbsp;

When a family in need reached out to Jeff Cook Real Estate, we banded together with the community to help them enjoy the Christmas holiday without the burden of financial heartache. Today I’ll share that story and how our team brought the spirit of the season to a family that didn’t expect it.

**Rebecca West, real estate agent with Jeff Cook Real Estate, made the initial phone call that brought us together to act:**“*Jeff sent out an email and asked for us to let him know of any families that were in need. The very next day, I was calling and following up with clients who had indicated they might want to purchase a home. I ran across Tameka, who said, ‘This is somewhat embarrassing, but I’m going through a really hard time right now. You guys help families who are in need?*’“*I told her, ‘We definitely do\! Jeff was just asking us about this.*’

“*Tameka then opened up to me and told me what she and her family had gone through. She has seven children and just needs a leg up in life. She just wanted to make Christmas be somewhat of a light for her children, and I think it was very selfless for her to reach out to us for help and put her children’s needs in front of her own*.”**Sean West, shared his part in the story:**

“*It was pretty amazing; Rebecca told me about the family she had spoken to and mentioned their needs and wants for this Christmas season. When the family decided that they wanted lipgloss, scrunchies, socks, body wash, and the like, it touched my heart to hear that they weren’t asking for what they really wanted, but what they really needed.*”

When we found out that there was a family in need, we decided to partner with our agents and with the community. We used some of the money we had set aside from commissions from our Jeff Cook Cares Program to help this family to get the bare essentials they needed.

Ms. Pinkey and her kids were just getting ready to come into the office. We already had our gifts to the family ready. In addition to shoes for the kids, we gave her a check for her and her family to be able to celebrate the holiday and to start the new year off on the right foot.

**Tameka had this to say about her holiday surprise:**“*I am so thankful for what just happened. As soon as we came into the parking lot, you could feel the love. From the bottom of my heart, we just thank you all so much. There aren’t too many people out there who would open up and help a whole family. I have a lot of kids, and I’m lost for words, but I feel blessed, and the kids are very excited*.”

We are truly happy to help any family who needs a leg up during the holiday season. It warms our hearts to know that we helped to give a struggling family a new lease on the holiday season, and we’re happy that Tameka and her family got to enjoy the holidays without financial barriers this season.

If you know of any family that would benefit from our help, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to contribute to the community however we can. In the meantime, give us a call or send us an email anytime you have questions about real estate. We’re here to help you achieve your goals.
