If you want to ensure your new home is in a neighborhood you will absolutely love, I’ve got just the checklist for you.
<br>
<br>**1. Check the list!** Google the best places to live in the Triangle or a specific city in the Triangle that’s of interest to you. You’ll get pages of options to sift through. The websites and news outlets have done a lot of the legwork for you, and they will provide you with data and statistics that will help you quickly see where you might want to concentrate your search. At the very least, they will provide you with a good starting point that will allow you to do further research.
<br>
<br>**2. Consider the value.** There are countless ways to look at the value of an area, but one of the strongest indicators of growth in neighborhoods today is what can be found around it. For example, a popular coffee shop. Proximity to a coffee shop has a very real and positive effect on home values. In fact, in the 17 years leading up to 2014, homes adjacent to a Starbucks almost doubled in value up to 96%. Those further out appreciated by 65% over the same period.

**3. Make the drive.** Commuting is a big deal for everyone, and if you have a limit to how much time you want to spend in the car, it makes sense to drive from any of the neighborhoods you like to work and back during rush hour. You might find that the drive from one of those neighborhoods is too long, so you can eliminate it as an option.
<br>
<br>**4. Spend as much time as possible in the area.** This will tell you if it’s a good fit. Make a list of your needs and figure out if that area will meet them.
<br>
