This time of year, home sellers commonly ask us if it’s better to sell a home in the fall or if waiting until spring is the right move.

In response, we tend to bring up inventory levels. Inventory levels are typically highest in the spring, whereas in the fall, they tend to decline. That means that sellers will have a lot less competition in the fall than they will in the spring.

Sellers also ask if their house will show well in the fall. Many people who wait until spring do so because it's a beautiful time of year when the grass and leaves are green again, which makes for attractive home photos. But **peak photographing time doesn’t really hit until the summer,** and in the fall, we still have green grass and leaves on the trees; you can still take beautiful exterior photos in the autumn.

People also express their concerns about moving in the wintertime. Few people really want to pack up all their belongings and move to a new home when it’s cold out, and that’s a valid point. However, most sellers hire a moving company to assist them—**movers are a year-round industry and would be happy to serve you no matter the season.**

If you have any further questions about whether or not it’s a good idea to sell your home in the fall or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to speak with you.<br>&nbsp;
