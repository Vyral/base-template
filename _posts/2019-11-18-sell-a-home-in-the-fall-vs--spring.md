This time of year, home sellers commonly ask us if it’s better to sell a home in the fall or if waiting until spring is the right move.

In response, a lot depends on inventory levels. Inventory levels are typically highest in the spring, whereas in the fall, they tend to be much lower. This equates to less seller competition in the fall than the spring.

Sellers also ask if their house will show well in the fall. Many people who wait until spring do so because it's a beautiful time of year, when the grass and leaves are green again, which makes for attractive home photos. But **peak photography (i.e. GREEN) time doesn’t really happen until the summer.&nbsp;** In the fall, we still have green grass and leaves on the trees, therefore you can still take beautiful exterior photos in the autumn.

People also express concerns about moving in the winter months. Few people really want to pack up all their belongings and move to a new home when it’s cold out, and that’s a valid point. However, most sellers hire a moving company to assist them—**movers are a year-round industry and are happy to serve you no matter the season.**
