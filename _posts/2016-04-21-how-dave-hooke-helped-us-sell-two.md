*"We had a couple, course everybody knows the great recession we just came out of, and we had some problem houses that took a long time on the market and we asked Dave  to come in and try to market them and sell them he accomplished that on two different occasions achieving full-price offers in a very reasonable amount of time and it was just really helpful for our business. Would you Recommend him to someone else? Oh Absolutely, absolutely. Just did that today in fact."*
