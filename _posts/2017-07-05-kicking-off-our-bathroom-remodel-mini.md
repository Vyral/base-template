Today we're kicking off a mini series giving you a real-life look at the process of remodeling a bathroom. First stop: counters and tile.

Today marks the starting point of a new video series about the process of a basic bathroom remodel. To start, I wanted to focus on the color selection process here at Arizona Tile.

In the video above, I'm standing in the slab yardâ€™s granite section to pick out a countertop slab for my friend Kiku. We need to pick out some granite for the counters in three different bathrooms.

Our friend and contractor **Ross Jorgensen from Rosco Construction** sent us here for the first of many tasks in this remodel job. We're here to pick out tile for the bathrooms in addition to the countertops.

As you can see in our video, there's an immense selection of granite here at the amazing showroom at Arizona Tile. They also have marble and quartz slabs. The best part is that their prices are very competitive as well.

Stay tuned for our next video where we'll tackle another step in this bathroom remodel. In the meantime, give me a call if you have any questions about remodeling or you need a reference for a great contractor or vendor. We're always happy to help!
