Internet leads are a dime a dozen. Many of them lead nowhere, but if you know how to handle them properly, you can sift through the masses and find the best ones.

**Once you make contact with an internet lead, the first thing you need to do is engage them.** They’re coming to your website for a purpose, so you’ve got to find out what that purpose is. Then you need to decide how much time you want to invest in them.

The end goal is to meet with someone face-to-face, but you only want to meet face-to-face with people who are most likely to buy or sell a home. I only want to meet with a lead if they are considering buying or selling now.

**Once you’ve made a connection, it’s time to introduce yourself.** Ask them if they’re just looking for homes in a specific area or if they have more in mind. An open-ended question is a great place to start. Yes/no questions aren’t horrible, but your goal is to get them talking about their situation.

After you’ve figured out what their situation is, then it’s time to start figuring out their goals and motivation. Who else is involved in the decision and how can you be of service to them? That’s the next step in your questions. Let them know the best neighborhoods and best areas, and any other information that might be useful to them.

**When you’re answering their questions, it’s important to provide answers with value.** Set them up with a home search and offer to help them. If they accept the offer, it’s a great time to set a face-to-face meeting. If they’re not from the area, ask them when they are visiting the area next. That's the perfect time to meet.

One way we provide value is with our “coming soon” listings. These are homes that aren’t on the market yet, and we can give access to those properties for eager buyers.

You’ll have to handle objections, to be sure. Authentically acknowledge each of their objections, bridge the gap to something else that’s compelling to them and explain why it’s so important to meet them in person.

It doesn't have to be a long meeting either. It could just be a quick 15 or 20 minutes.

In summary, here’s how the process should work. Ask two or three open-ended questions until you are able to figure out if this is a good prospect or not. If they are, the next step is to figure out their goals and offer value so that they will agree to meet face-to-face.

In essence, remember this if you get lost. Woodward and Bernstein, the Washington Post reporters who uncovered watergate, simply stuck to the 5 Ws. **That’s what you want to know about your prospect: who, what, where, when, and why.** When you ask those questions, you’ll better understand what they want and you’ll have some great conversations with serious buyers.

If you have any questions for me about how to handle internet leads or what the anatomy of a call should look like, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
