*Jake Bernhard of United Heritage Credit Union joined me recently to discuss the many different down payment options that first-time homebuyers have.*

Jake Bernhard of United Heritage Credit Union joined us recently to answer a great question from one of you: What options are there for borrowers who don’t have 20% down to put on a home? **Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need 20% to buy a home.** You can put down as little as 5% with a conventional mortgage, 3.5% with an FHA mortgage, or 0% down with a VA or USDA loan.

If you have any questions for Jake about what programs you would be able to qualify for, give him a call at (512) 435-4545 and he’d be happy to walk you through them.

If you have any additional questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. We would love to hear from you.
