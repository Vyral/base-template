Toward the end of the year, I always notice that many agents are scrambling to get their continuing education requirements in for their license renewal.

**In the state of Iowa, agents are required to take 36 hours of continuing education every three years,** with those hours due by December 31 of the year your license expires.

This education includes eight hours of law updates, four hours of ethics, and 24 hours of electives.

Real estate is a complex industry, so continuing education is extremely important. Knowing industry standards, new laws, and other information helps us, as agents, be the best professionals we can.

But let’s be honest: it can be difficult to find time for that education when you’re keeping such a busy schedule yourself.

As real estate professionals, we’ve got very unpredictable schedules. Fortunately, there is an alternative in Iowa to in-classroom learning. **In Iowa, up to 24 hours of your continuing education can be done online.**

This is why I’ve found [www.RealEstateCE.com](https://realestatece.com/a/misty-soldwisch) to be an amazing resource. It’s very easy to sign up and is full of informational classes relevant to things I experience in my business. Also, it’s inexpensive.

The best part of taking classes through this website, though, is that it helped me control my time. I was able to schedule my continuing education around my life, instead of scheduling my life around my continuing education.

Additionally, there is an amazing **discount available to Iowa licensees through [RealEstateCE.com/a/Misty-Soldwisch](https://realestatece.com/a/misty-soldwisch) that you can find [here.](https://realestatece.com/a/misty-soldwisch)**

So if you’re busy, want to learn, and would like to save money, I definitely recommend checking it out.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
