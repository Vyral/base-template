I recently had the chance to speak with Harold Keeter of Aye Aye Bookkeeping and Tax Services, and I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to share this conversation with you today.

Harold spent a good portion of his career working for the IRS, and also as an accountant elsewhere. Eventually, though, he grew tired of the shifting professional landscape that came with working for someone else, so he decided to start a business of his own. Thus, Aye Aye Bookkeeping and Tax Services came to be.

Through his business, **Harold has made it his mission to serve and educate people on their tax-related, financial, and business planning needs.** Their goal is to help save you both time and money.

Right now, Aye Aye Bookkeeping and Tax Services primarily works with individuals and businesses as their main base of clients, but Harold says he would love to branch out.

Whoever he and his team are serving, though, Harold is passionate about easing the stress of managing finances for his clients. He understands that many people simply don’t have the requisite time, knowledge, or energy to implement effective systems, so he is more than happy to do so for them.

Best of all, Aye Aye Bookkeeping’s services help create a ripple effect in the community. By helping their clients to effectively manage their finances, Harold and his team ensure that they can continue in spreading the wealth—take Soul Outreach Ministries, for example. Soul Outreach was just getting started when its founder came to Harold for help. He wanted to serve the community by uplifting its underserved citizens, but was held back by the financial aspect of this goal. **When Harold stepped in to help, Soul Outreach was quickly transformed from a simple idea to a thriving business.**

In turn, this opened Harold’s eyes to the true potential of his own business. Now, Aye Aye Bookkeeping and Tax Services has accrued many success stories just like this, and Harold and his team would be happy to help you write your own.
