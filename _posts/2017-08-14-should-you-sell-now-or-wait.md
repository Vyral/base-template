Should you sell now or wait to see where our market is headed?

In real estate, timing can be a critical factor to any transaction.

Something on the minds of many people who are thinking about listing is whether they should do so now or wait to see what happens in our market.

Because the market is currently appreciating, this can be a tough question to answer. In fact, there is no one-size-fits-all answer.

The answer to this question depends on your personal circumstances. To determine what is right for you, you should consider two main factors.

{% include pullquote.html %}

**First of all, think about your own motivation and need to sell.** Why do you want to sell? Do you need to sell first to buy another property?

Next, consider price. Pricing a home correctly is absolutely critical to getting top dollar. Future appreciation aside, you can still get a great price now if you understand how to properly price your home.

Another thing you might want to consider is the option of renting your property out. If youâ€™re waiting to see where the market goes, **why not rent out the property and make some money in the meantime?**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
