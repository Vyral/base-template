Decluttering is so important in getting your home ready to sell as well as just cleaning up for spring. Whatever your motivation, thinning out your home is a great way to feel good. Today let’s go through the seven steps it takes to declutter your home.

**1. Make sure the front of your home is welcoming and encourages buyers to come inside.** First impressions are everything. Buyers are probably going to find your home online first, and then they might even drive around the neighborhood to check it out. You’ll want to clear out any dead leaves and put some fresh mulch down. Be sure that there are no mud daubers or bird’s nests in your eaves. Pretend you’re a buyer and walk up to your front porch. What would you think?&nbsp;

**2. Take it one room at a time.** Decluttering can be really overwhelming, so just start small. Thin out the things in your room and closet; think about what your room would look like in a photograph. What isn’t needed? Pictures will amplify those extra things on countertops and other areas.&nbsp;

**3. Decide what furniture you really need in the home.** To make your property look like a model home, get rid of extra furniture and end tables.

**4. Clean off countertops.** These are common places for us to pile things up, but kitchens are very important rooms to make a good impression with. Put your toaster, blender, and other similar appliances away in a cabinet, and clear away other extraneous papers and tidbits.

**5. Clean your shower.** When we come to preview your home, we’re going to pull back the shower curtain. Be sure the grout is clean and that tiles or paint aren’t peeling. Your shower will tell buyers a lot about how you take care of your home.

**6. Take away your collectibles.** It’s great that you care about and collect things that are dear to your heart, but that can become a distraction to buyers. Go ahead and box it up and put it away.

**7. Declutter the garage and storage sheds.** If there are things in there that you need to keep on hand, put them in boxes or storage bins that are neat and organized.

All these things sound crazy, however, they make a lot of difference. A decluttered home will help you get the most money for your home in the shortest amount of time.
