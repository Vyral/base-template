We’d like to extend an offer to you to be a part of our $100K Club.

**This club is an intentional strategy that Abby Realty uses to enable agents to add $100,000 of gross commission income to their business in just 12 months.**

There are several components to this strategy. It starts with a six-week sprint where we'll train you to reach out and market to your database, allowing you opportunities to consistently reinforce the message that you’re a caring, competent real estate professional. Once you establish that sphere of influence marketing plan, you’re well on your way to your next $100,000.

Next, we do another six-week training course on how to establish a geographic or demographic farm where you become the preferred agent in a particular neighborhood or with an affinity group.

After that, we guide you through a Facebook marketing course that allows you to create expensive leads less expensively than any other available methods.

**If you add all three initiatives together, we guarantee you’ll add an additional $100,000 within a 12-month period.** We’re tired of good agents not making a good living in this business. We work too hard not to make a great living. At Abby Realty, we have the tools and the proven strategies to get you there. Let’s go there together.

If you’d like to know more about how to be a part of our $100K Club or you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to speak with you.
