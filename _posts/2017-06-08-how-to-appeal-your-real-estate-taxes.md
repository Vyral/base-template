One of the questions I get asked quite often by sellers when giving their home a valuation is why their real estate taxes are different from their neighbor’s when their neighbor’s home is similar to theirs or is located in the same development.

Your real estate taxes can affect the value of your home when you sell it because they’re added to the buyer’s monthly payment in purchasing the home. Your real estate taxes may differ from your neighbor’s because&nbsp;**they’re determined by your home’s assessed value.** In Bucks and Montgomery counties, they don’t do an assessment every year. Your neighbor, for example, could’ve appealed their real estate taxes two years ago and had them reduced.

**The deadline to appeal your real estate taxes is August 1st of every year.** If you wish to do so, you can visit the Board of Assessment’s website where they’ll have forms available for you to fill out and notify you of what fee you have to pay. You can include comparable properties when submitting your appeal, but we usually recommend getting an appraisal done on your property. Getting a valuation from an independent third party may help get your taxes in line with your neighbor’s.

If you have any questions about appealing your taxes or any other real estate topic, please feel free to give me a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
