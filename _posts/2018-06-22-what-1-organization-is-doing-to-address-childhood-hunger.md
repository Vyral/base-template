Today I am excited to bring you some important information about a great local organization: the Community Food Bank of Eastern Oklahoma.&nbsp;

Eileen Bradshaw, the executive director of the Community Food Bank, joined me to explain a little bit about what they do.&nbsp;

With approximately 450 partner programs, this organization helps to distribute food throughout the state. According to Eileen, about one in every four children goes to bed hungry at night. And, as we can all agree, this is unacceptable.&nbsp;

**“It’s part of our job just to make sure [these children] get what they need,” says Eileen.**

It was truly amazing to get a behind-the-scenes look at operations here at the Community Food Bank. Especially because at the time of my visit, they were preparing for “Summer Feeding.” The Summer Feeding program is one way that they are able to continue providing for kids who rely on school meals at other times of the year. On day one of this program, they fed an estimated 1,100 children.

The workers at the Food Bank are also delegating more resources to their partner programs, as they know that their lines grow longer in the summer months, as well.&nbsp;

So, with as much as this organization does for our community, how can we give back and help them make a difference? Well, for every dollar donated, the Food Bank is able to produce four meals. Obviously, financial gifts are always welcomed.&nbsp;

Of course, volunteering your time and donating food are also great ways to help.

So, if you want to get in touch with Eileen, you can give her a call at (918) 585-2800, or visit [**www.okfoodbank.org.&nbsp;**](https://okfoodbank.org/){: target="_blank"}
