When most people decide to buy a home, they want to go the traditional route of buying an older, previously lived-in home. What a lot of people don't realize is that you have another option with new construction, and it's not as expensive as you may have been led to believe. **If you are looking to purchase a new home, you have some exciting opportunities here in North Central Washington in which to do so.**

Most new construction homes have great designs, with modern layouts, open concepts, and larger rooms. **When you buy a new home, you don't have to have anything repaired or remodeled** because you get to choose what is built, and the builder will often give you a warranty to fix anything if it pops up. With a new home, you also have new appliances and new systems throughout the home.

When people buy older homes, they don't realize the difference between price and cost. With older homes, the initial price is lower, yes. However, **the cost of maintaining the home is much greater than the cost associated with new homes.** Conversely, the price on a newly built home is going to be higher than an old home, but the cost is still going to likely be around the same.

Also, **if you build a new home in our market, it is going to appreciate greatly.** If you were to build one now and pay for it, in 4 months when you are ready to move in, it's going to be worth more than you paid. Just another advantage of a high-appreciating market.

**New construction does have some costs associated with it you should be wary of.** Some new homes don't include landscaping or blinds, among other things.

Building a new home is a great option in today's market. One of our new favorite neighborhoods out there with some freshly built homes is Cherry Meadows. The builder is incredible and they have some beautiful properties, ranging from $269,000-$319,000 in value.
