At 1000 Calls A Day, we have an entire team of people who can help you with your outbound calls. **We have experience running outbound campaigns and looking at the numbers to help you understand how to get better results.**

Many people do not understand how this works, though, so I thought that I would show you with the help of my colleague, Amber. I have included timestamps to make it easier for you to jump around to the parts you are most curious about.
