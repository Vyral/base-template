It’s time for another market update for the North Houston area. I’ve been looking at the data from our office, as well as the data for Houston as a whole, to figure out what’s going on.

**As you may or may not know, our market is very dependant on oil**. Oil prices have been going up since last year. Right now, we’re around $65 a barrel, which means we’re seeing new rigs, new jobs, and new people coming to town to rent or buy a home.

In 2013 and 2014 when we were doing really good, there were a lot more jobs. The job numbers we’re seeing now aren’t nearly that high, so something wasn’t adding up. Then it occurred to me that technology in the oil industry is moving really fast. **They don’t need as many employees or as many rigs to do the same job as they did in 2013 and 2014**.

Our economy is doing much better than what we are seeing from normal job growth. From all that I’ve seen, 2018 and 2019 are going to be fantastic for sellers in Houston. What do you need to know as a buyer or seller right now though?

If you’re a homebuyer, I would advise you to buy as soon as possible. If you’re thinking about selling, I would consider waiting until next year. **However, if you have to do both, there is more to consider**.

If you’re moving up from a smaller home to a larger one, I would advise making the move now while you can get the new home for cheaper. If you’re downsizing from a larger home to a smaller one, I would wait until next year, when you’ll be able to get more for your home.

Finally, let’s talk about interest rates. They’ve been fluctuating slightly, but haven’t gone as high as some were thinking. I don’t know whether they will go up or down in the coming year, so you shouldn’t base your decision on what they might do. You should base your decision on where they are at now, which is quite low. However, Houston home values have gone up by 4.3% this year and I predict they may reach a 10% increase next year.

If you have any questions for me about the current market or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
