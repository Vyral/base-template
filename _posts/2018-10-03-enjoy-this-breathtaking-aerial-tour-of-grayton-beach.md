Grayton Beach is one of my all-time favorite places—as one of the top-rated beach destinations, it’s truly in a league of its own. The shores here are wide and surrounded by beautiful coastal dune lakes, including Western Lake, which is a great place to explore by paddleboard or kayak. The neighboring Grayton Beach State Park is one of the most beautiful places you’ll ever see, with rich history and homes that date back to the 1900s. It’s a laid-back community where all you truly need is a pair of flip-flops and a swimsuit in order to enjoy everything it has to offer. To enjoy an aerial tour of Grayton Beach, watch this short video.&nbsp;
