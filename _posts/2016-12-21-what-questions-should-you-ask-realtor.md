You shouldn’t just hire the first Realtor you meet off the street. You must take time to interview them and ask them specific questions to get an idea of what your results will look like.

**Want to sell your home?** <a href="http://www.clarksville-ftcampbell-homes.com/a/tlx/search?landing=1&rgu=0" target="_blank">Get a FREE home value report</a>
**Want to buy a home?** <a href="http://www.valeriehunterkelly.com/search/residentialadvancedsearch.aspx" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale</a>

Most people just hire the first Realtor they talk to. A lot of them don’t take the time to ask important questions that will impact the success of your transaction. Today we wanted to answer the question of “How do I choose a Realtor?” **We’ll go over some tips and talk you through some questions that you should be asking before you hire someone.**

**1. How long have you been in the business?** This is an important thing to know because you’d be surprised at how big of a role experience plays. Even after 30 years in the business, there are still situations that pop up that I’ve never seen before. The more experience you have, the better you can negotiate, and the quicker you can get to the closing table.

**2. How many homes did you sell last year?** If an agent has been in the business their whole life but only sells a few homes per year, they don’t have as much experience as someone who has only been in the business 10 years but works in real estate full-time. Experience is important, but so is the level of activity an agent has in the market on a regular basis.

**3. How close are your list prices to your final sale prices?** The final sale price is the most important piece of information, but the closer an agent can get you to your initial asking price, the better.
