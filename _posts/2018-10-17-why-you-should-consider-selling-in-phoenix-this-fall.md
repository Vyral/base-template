<center><em>Selling a home during the fall is common practice in Arizona. Here are a few reasons why.</em></center>

 

Why would you consider listing your house during the fall as opposed to waiting until after the holidays? There are a few reasons why you should:

**1. Arizona has a seasonal market**. During the spring and summer, we see local residents with families who need to move while school is out, and that’s more of a normal market cycle. In addition, we have seasonal residents who come from colder climates to feel the sunshine here in Phoenix. This means that there are a couple different waves of buyers that come into town during different times of years. Those buyers who are looking at a second home or coming here to retire, are coming to the market now and they are searching.

**2. If you wait until January, you’ll be competing against many other home sellers**. If you wait, you’ll see an increase of inventor of about 20% when you list. Here’s my question for you: Would you rather have your house on the market now to capture the serious seasonal buyers now as opposed to competing against 20% more buyers after the first of the year?

As you can see, the answer is clear that it’s better to be on the market now as opposed to later. If you have any questions or are thinking of selling your house any time in the near future, I’d love to hear from you so we can discuss your options moving forward.
