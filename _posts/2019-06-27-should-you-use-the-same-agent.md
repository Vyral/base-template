**Should you use the same agent to buy and sell a home?&nbsp;**

As tempting and convenient as this approach may seem, it’s seldom in your best interest. There are certainly some instances when this makes sense, like if you’re moving between homes in the same neighborhood, but hiring a new agent is the better option in most other scenarios.

If you, like most people, are moving to an entirely new area, for example, it’s best to work with an agent who has a strong understanding of that particular market.

With all of this said, most transactions are too much for an agent to take on alone, which is why, **on our team, Rosie serves as our dedicated listing specialist and Brittany is our dedicated buyer’s specialist.&nbsp;**

That means while Rosie is negotiating on your behalf to help you earn top dollar, Brittany is showing you different listings in different neighborhoods to help you pin down your next home. **Because we each dedicate our efforts to one specific area, we’re able to communicate constantly and clearly to help you and your family realize success on both ends of the transaction.&nbsp;** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now, you don’t necessarily need to hire two agents from the same team. If you’re looking at hiring two unaligned agents, **we recommend interviewing both for the purpose of ensuring that their standards of business and communication match.** If one agent is ill-equipped to carry out a smooth transaction and the other is responsive and deeply knowledgeable of the market, it could derail the success of your transaction.&nbsp;

**We hold ourselves to the same standard both in terms of business and communication, and we take a lot of pride in that.** When you work with us, you can rest assured that you’ll notice no difference in our market knowledge, strategies, negotiation, and availability.&nbsp;

If you’re looking to buy or sell a home anytime soon, please reach out to us. We’d be happy to help put you in a position to succeed. We look forward to hearing from you\!
