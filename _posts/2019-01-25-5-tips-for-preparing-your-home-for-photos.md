Today we’re going to give you some tips on how to get your home ready to be photographed when you’re preparing it for sale.

**This can be a daunting and nerve-wracking process, so here are a few tips to help ease that stress:**

**1. Ensure your yard is neat and tidy.** The outside of the home should look great. All cars should be out of the driveway.

**2. Make sure that all trash cans and other items have been removed from your curb,** especially in the city.

**3. Have all of your blinds up.** Don’t just have them twisted open—have them fully open so more light comes into the home.

**4. Turn all your lights on and all of your fans off.** All the lightbulbs should be double checked as well.

**5. Declutter.**&nbsp;Do this in your kitchen, bathrooms, living room, and more. Also, make sure that all of your beds are made.
