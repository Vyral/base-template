2019 is right around the corner, and if you’re looking to sell your home after the new year begins, you may want to think about getting a pre-inspection. **Here are three reasons why:**

**1. You’ll find out what may scare buyers away.** Most homeowners already know what needs to be repaired, but they may not know about health and safety issues or other things invisible to an untrained eye. A home inspector will uncover anything that needs to be fixed, and with their report, you’ll be able to disclose any issues (and repairs) to potential buyers.

**2. Buyers will have more confidence in buying.** Because you’ve had your home inspected and have fixed any major issues, buyers will know they’re buying a property that’s in good condition. As the market softens and demand for homes decreases, you need to be sure your listing stands out. The way you compete is by guaranteeing buyers a professionally inspected, worry-free purchase.

**3. Negotiations will be minimized.** Because you’ve put everything about your inspection and subsequent repairs on the table, buyers know exactly what they’re getting. If you didn’t have pre-inspections, buyers would be leery of making a purchase and often offer a low-end price. Your transparency is key in giving buyers a sense of what they’re getting into. Once you have a contract with the buyer, it’s less likely they’ll be able to ask for a price reduction or repairs (if you’ve fixed major issues noted in inspections).

At a minimum, get a home inspection and a pest inspection. We’ll then comb through these inspections and find out the major issues that need to be taken care of, such as health and safety-related items. You don’t necessarily need to do chimney, pool, or roof inspections **unless your inspector suspects you need one.**
