The current market presents unique challenges compared to the thriving markets of the past. Therefore, many agents are struggling to find leads and sustain their businesses. If you find yourself in a declining business year, weâ€™re here to help. Here are three crucial elements that can help you boost your business and overcome challenges:&nbsp;

**1\. Leads.** A steady stream of leads is vital for fueling your business growth. Fortunately, many leads can be obtained for free if you know where to look and how to engage with potential clients. Utilize various channels such as social media, networking events, and online directories to identify potential leads. Craft a compelling message and develop effective communication skills to engage with these prospects.&nbsp;

**2\. A communication system.** Once your business starts to expand, it becomes increasingly important to have a system in place to consistently follow up and communicate with your clients. A comprehensive customer relationship management (CRM) tool can help you organize and automate your communication efforts. By leveraging a CRM system, you can ensure that no potential clients fall through the cracks. Plus, regular follow-ups demonstrate your commitment and professionalism, ultimately fostering stronger relationships and increasing the likelihood of closing deals.

**3\. Accountability.** Numerous studies have shown that accountability is a critical factor in achieving successful results. As an agent looking to grow your business, it is crucial to hold yourself accountable for your actions and outcomes. Therefore, establish clear goals and create a plan to achieve them, then set benchmarks and track your progress regularly. Find an accountability partner or mentor, or join a mastermind group to stay motivated and receive constructive feedback.&nbsp;
