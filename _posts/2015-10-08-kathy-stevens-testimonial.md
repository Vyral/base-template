I worked with Caralee Angell, and she is just amazing!

We bought our new home, moved, and sold our previous home. In buying our new home, we knew what we were trying to find, but Caralee really listened to our unspoken needs. She could tell when we were in love with a house and when we weren't. We almost talked ourselves into buying a house that we wouldn't of been as great as the one we eventually found. We ended up spending less money for a better house, in a better location, because Caralee really listened to us. She was always in our corner and acted as an advocate for us! In selling our previous home, Caralee provided great advise for what we should and shouldn't fix before selling.  In fact, there was one repair that needed to be done in our garage, and Caralee's dad actually came over to fix it! She gave us great advice on how to price our home and it sold in no time!"<br /><b>-Kathy Stevens, Home Seller and Buyer</b>
