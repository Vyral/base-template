{% include youtube.html %}Hey everyone, thanks for stopping by once again. Today I just wanted to give you a quick update on how the LA real estate market is doing.

It's now May, and the market should continue to be just as strong as it was in April. There is still a very limited supply of inventory, which is fantastic for sellers.

For buyers, this market is a little more challenging. Make sure to get your pre-approval letter and have it ready to go with your offer. Be patient; if you don't get your first or second choice, there are still plenty of great options out there for you in this market.

If you have any questions about our market, or about anything else real estate related, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!
