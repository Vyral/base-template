It’s no secret that recent flooding has devastated homes in the Houston area. Flood insurance has become a hot topic as of late, so we invited Mr. Li-Hsi “Leash” Yu, the president of Agency Yu, Inc., to come and talk to us about some benefits of having flood insurance that you may not even know you have.

It’s easy to say everyone should buy flood insurance, so today we’re going to discuss the severe repetitive loss database. If your home has flooded multiple times in the past, it may be on this database. It sounds bad, but it was created by FEMA to watch your claim activity and has some great benefits. If your home has flooded more than four times since 1978 and two of those floods were within 10 years of each other and repairs costed more than $5,000, your house is more than likely already on the list.

If your home is on the list, FEMA may provide funds to raise your home, buy it back, or make it less susceptible to floods in general. It would behoove a homeowner or a person that’s about to buy a home to see if the address is on the severe repetitive loss database. It could be very beneficial in the decision-making process.

If you are on the list, you should have gotten notice at renewal of your flood insurance. If you haven’t received one or you’re curious if your home may be on the list, ask your insurance agent. If you’re buying a home and getting a flood insurance quote, it should disclose whether or not the home is on the database.

This isn’t a new program, it’s been around for quite a while. However, with the recent multiple floods, we think it’s a good thing for you to keep on your mind. One important note about the severe repetitive loss database is that if two floods happened within 10 days of each other, FEMA only considers that as one claim.

If you or someone you know has had to deal with repetitive flooding, you should give Leash a call. He can be reached at (713)-688-8881 or Leash@AgencyYu.com

If you have any other questions for us or if you’re looking to buy or sell a home in Houston, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
