Team Lally has exciting news: We’ve gained a new member, and we’re going to introduce him to you today. Meet JT Smith.

JT and Adrienne have known each other for more than a decade, with him having worked as her broker through RE/MAX Paradise. After seeing her thrive with Team Lally, JT knew it was time to join himself. He now works as a dedicated listing agent with the team and couldn’t be happier.

Joining Team Lally, according to JT, has not only afforded him more opportunity within his career, but it has also given him more time to spend with family and friends.

JT is excited to start helping you with your real estate needs. He’s always eager to help our clients sell quickly and for top dollar.
