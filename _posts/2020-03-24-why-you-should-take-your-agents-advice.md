<center>I&rsquo;m explaining why you need to listen to your agent during real estate transactions.</center>

&nbsp;

Why should you take your real estate agent’s advice during real estate transactions? On the buyer’s side, **most agents will tell you to get a pre-approval letter** since, without one, you’ll be at a disadvantage when making an offer.&nbsp;

Many Realtors also advise against taking on more credit during the process of buying a home. For example, don’t go out and buy a car or new furniture. This can create issues as you go through the loan process. Taking your real estate agent’s advice can save you a ton of trouble.&nbsp;

For sellers, agents will encourage you to stage, declutter, and otherwise get the property in ideal selling condition. Your home will sell faster if you do just those two things. Sellers will also want to make repairs on their house instead of an alternative such as offering credit to the buyer.&nbsp;

Buyers these days are looking for properties that are move-in ready. **Listening to your Realtor will help your home sell faster and for more money.&nbsp;**
