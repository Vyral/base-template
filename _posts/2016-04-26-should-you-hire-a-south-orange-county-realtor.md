Many homeowners think selling a home is a piece of cake. However, there are so many things to do and keep track of during this process. If you’re thinking of buying and selling a South Orange County house on your own, we’ve compiled a quick to-do list just for you! Check it out below.

<br>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Decide how much to list the house for.<br>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;**Prepare the house for sale.**<br>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Create the marketing materials.<br>4. &nbsp; &nbsp;Hold the open house.<br>5. &nbsp; &nbsp;Knock on doors in your neighborhood.<br>6. &nbsp; &nbsp;Mark the home for sale.<br>7. &nbsp; &nbsp;Coordinate 10 different showings.<br>8. &nbsp; &nbsp;Research neighborhood statistics.<br>9. &nbsp; &nbsp;Check school ratings.<br>10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Review incoming offers. **Is there a pre-approval letter attached to that offer?**<br>11. &nbsp; &nbsp;How much is the down payment?<br>12. &nbsp; &nbsp;Professionally negotiate the offer.<br>13. &nbsp; &nbsp;**Verify that the buyer is qualified.**<br>14. &nbsp; &nbsp;Check the property taxes.<br>15. &nbsp; &nbsp;Review the title report.<br>16. &nbsp; &nbsp;Get the CC&Rs from the Homeowners Association.<br>17. &nbsp; &nbsp;Research the local amenities.<br>18. &nbsp; &nbsp;**Hire an escrow company.**<br>19. &nbsp; &nbsp;Arrange inspections and the appraisal.<br>20. &nbsp; &nbsp;Research home improvement permits.<br>21. &nbsp; &nbsp;Negotiate all the repairs.<br>22. &nbsp; &nbsp;**Verify that all the disclosures have been signed.** Be careful, there are a lot of those.<br>23. &nbsp; &nbsp;Order a natural hazard report.<br>24. &nbsp; &nbsp;Order the homeowner’s and flood insurance.<br>25. &nbsp; &nbsp;Order the title insurance.<br>26. &nbsp; &nbsp;If it’s a new construction property, obtain a certificate of occupancy.<br>27. &nbsp; &nbsp;Calculate the closing costs.<br>28. &nbsp; &nbsp;Coordinate the final walk through.&nbsp;

**That’s a lot to take care of independently, and its far from everything!** Who you work with matters, and Realtors can take care of everything on this list, and more. If that list looks overwhelming to you as a prospective seller, consider hiring a professional.
