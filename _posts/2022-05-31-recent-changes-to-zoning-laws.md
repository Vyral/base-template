Have you ever seen or heard the term ADU? It stands for **accessory dwelling unit**, and to help you better understand what they are, I’m coming to you from an ADU that’s in the process of being built right now.

If you search for ADUs on Google, you’ll see that California has many options to let you build a second unit on your property. That can be helpful if you’re looking to have family come stay with you, or it can serve as a source of income if you rent out the extra unit.

**SB-9, a bill that was recently passed in California, eliminated single-family zoning restrictions**, opening up the way for duplexes and many other options. This change will ultimately allow for more housing options here in the area.

If you’re interested in building an ADU on your property or have any questions about them, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’d love to hear from you.
