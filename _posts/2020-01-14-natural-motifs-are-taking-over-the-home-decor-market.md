Today Max Wilker from Better Homes & Gardens is here to talk about the trends and decorating motifs that are sweeping the housing industry.

Today’s guest Max Wilker is the style director at Better Homes & Gardens, so he definitely has his finger on the pulse of the hottest trends in home decorating. He’s here today to share some insight about what’s in and what’s out in terms of home decor.

Max informs me that **butterflies, bugs, and insects are increasingly popular decorating motifs.** This includes things like stylized dragonflies on dinnerware and/or butterflies on pillows.

Additionally, **textures are a huge trend** right now, and manufacturers are coming up with unique ways to tap into it. For example, Max showed me a butterfly pillow where the butterfly itself was printed onto the fabric, but then an embroidery overlay was added to give the image some texture and depth.

Next, **realistic bird motifs are gaining popularity**. In the past, more whimsical bird motifs were popular, but the market has circled back around to realism, including things such as lifelike illustrations of native birds on dinnerware, fabric patterns, clocks, and more.

Continuing in the vein of bringing the outdoors into the home, **botanical prints are also coming back to the market**. Whether they’re stylized and monochrome or they’re detailed and lifelike, these motifs are a classic, beautiful addition to a home that can give it an upscale feel. They would look great in a modern loft or an industrial farmhouse.

Finally, given how bold, natural motifs are surging forward in the market, it follows that furniture, light fixtures, accessories, and decorative pieces made from **rattan, bamboo, and reeds are becoming popular, too.**

Especially here in Iowa, where the winter gets bitter and everything outside is buried in snow, having a decorative motif that brings the outdoors inward can definitely give your home a warm, inviting, and comfortable feel.
