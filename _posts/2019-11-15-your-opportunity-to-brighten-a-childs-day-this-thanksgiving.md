The Thanksgiving season is here, which means it’s time for a quick announcement and a word on happiness.&nbsp;

First, **our annual Thanksgiving Pie Giveaway is happening on November 26 (you should have gotten an invite in the mail if you’re a client), as is our Toys for Tots drop-off.** That’s right—we’re an official drop-off site for Toys for Tots.

As you may know, this is a wonderful organization that’s run by the United States Marine Corp. Last year, I got the chance to ride the Toys for Tots train from Binghamton to Delance and hand out thousands of toys and other items to families in need. It was an enlightening experience because it’s easy to forget how much poverty we have in our own backyard. When you see families wearing flip flops in snowy weather, it’s heartbreaking.

This brings me to my next point. I was reading an article today in The Times Union about happiness, and it listed a variety of factors related to happiness, but I want to bring to light just a couple. The first is being grateful. What better time to be grateful for what you have than Thanksgiving? Also, what better time to give back to the community and drop off a toy at my office?

In the same article, they mentioned a study where a group of people were each given $5, and those who spent the money on themselves were measurably less happy than those who spent their money on someone else or gave it away. Again, what better way to be happy than to buy a gift for a child you don’t know and brighten their day? **Take it from me: It’s an amazing experience to hand a gift to a child and watch their face light up.**&nbsp;
