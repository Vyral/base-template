Many people ask me if they should list their home for sale during the holiday season. **My answer is always yes, and there are a few reasons why.**

Most people don’t want traffic through their houses during the holidays. This means there are fewer properties on the market and the number of showings decrease. However, the quality of the showings that do occur goes up. Typically, **the people looking at homes during the holidays are motivated to make a purchase**—you won’t find any tire kickers in this season.
