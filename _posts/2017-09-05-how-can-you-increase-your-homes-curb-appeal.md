{% include youtube.html %} The first impression people have of your home will be based on its curb appeal. Today, I’ve got some easy ways to add some vibrancy to the exterior of your property.

When people see your home, their first impression will be based on the exterior. For this reason, curb appeal is incredibly important. Today, I’ve got some quick fixes and simple tips that you can use to boost the curb appeal of your property.

If your home is looking a little drab, you should focus on ways to make a quick impact on the home. To do this, you should determine if the exterior of the home needs a fresh coat of paint or be power washed.

Paint can actually go a long way in improving the appearance of a home. However, take your time. Don’t merely throw on a coat of paint.

Before you do, **make sure to scrape off the old paint in places where it might cause unsightly texture beneath the fresh coat.** Take your time when power washing, too.

But what if it’s your yard that is lacking luster? If you have an upcoming home showing and lack the time to mulch, you still have options. Getting already potted plants to put outside your home can add a lot of vibrancy to your home’s curb appeal.

Also remember not to neglect the appearance of your front door. As the entrance to your home, your front door is the focal point of your home. **Repainting can go a long way, but sometimes a total replacement is a better option.** It all depends on the condition of your home and the door itself.

The final way to boost your curb appeal is something many people forget: your mailbox. Your mailbox is a feature of your home that people see easily as they drive past or approach your home.

While most people tend not to notice a mailbox, they will certainly pay attention to one that is especially attractive. **For a quick, easy impact on your front yard—update your mailbox.**
