{% include youtube.html %}Today I want to give you an update about the recent Red Day charity event our team participated in, alongside our other office associates and agents here at Keller Williams.<br> <br>In short, it was a complete success. Our team alone collected over 25 banker boxes full of food for kids in need in Loudoun County.  Between our office and our team, **we collected over 16,000 meals.** This is enough to feed over 400 children for at least four months!

Thank you so much for your participation. We really appreciate your contributions, and we know the kids you’ve helped really appreciate it as well. Next year, we hope to make it an even bigger success. 

On behalf of the hungry children in Loudon County—thank you!
