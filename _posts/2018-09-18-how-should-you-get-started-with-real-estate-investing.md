In terms of real estate, most young people’s first purchases are primary residences. But what about investing in real estate at a young age? What is it like to own rental properties in your 20s or 30s? I can speak from experience because that’s what I did. Building a large portfolio of rentals is no easy task, but there are ways to get started on a small scale. What are some entry-level strategies?

**1. House Hacking**. One of the easiest ways to dip your toe into real estate investing is by “house hacking.” The basic concept is that you purchase a property and rent out parts of it to collect income and help offset your housing expenses. This strategy kills two birds with one stone by providing you with a primary residence and an opportunity to make money. Examples of house hacking include purchasing a two-bedroom condo and renting out one of the rooms or buying a multi-family and living in one unit and leasing the others. If you’re looking to build your real estate portfolio, house hacking is a great way to gain experience with landlording and property management.

<br>**2. Short-Term Rentals**. Purchasing a property in an area that attracts tourists or receives an influx of seasonal visitors can be quite profitable. If you buy in a vacation town like Ocean City, you can get a premium rental rate during peak season. As long as you’re willing to stay on top of the high rental turnover, you can make a pretty penny.

**3. Investing in REITs**. If being a landlord doesn’t seem like a good fit, another more passive approach to get some skin in the game is to purchase REITs. A REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-producing properties such as apartment complexes, offices, shopping centers, hotels, etc. Modeled after mutual funds, REITs allow individuals to tap real estate the same way they would other industries — by investing in stock. As a REIT stockholder, you earn a share of the income produced through the real estate investment without actually having to go out and buy and manage property.

**With any of these strategies, you need to ask yourself:**

* Are you comfortable taking on risk?
* Are you comfortable tying up cash in a house?
* Will you be willing to ride out the low points?
* Are you willing to make some sacrifices?
* Do you have financial reserves?
