If you’re looking for a restaurant recommendation for Valentine’s Day, you’re in luck. Here are my top three recommendations for the Phoenix area:

[**1\. Pomo Pizzeria.**](https://pomopizzeria.com/) It’s an authentic Neapolitan pizza shop. It reminds me of the places I’ve visited in Naples.

[**2\. The Mission.**](https://www.themissionaz.com/)&nbsp;It’s a gourmet Mexican restaurant. Get your reservation in now before it’s too late.

[**3\. A Different Pointe of View.**](https://tapatiocliffshilton.com/dining/different-pointe-of-view/) It’s on top of a mountain at the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort, and the food is just as good as the views. It’s an A+ experience.

If you need any more dinner recommendations or have a quick real estate question, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
