I’m here at The Fun Park in Middletown to let you know why right now is the best time to sell your home.

If you are looking for something to do during the cold winter days in the Louisville area, the Fun Park in Middletown might be the place for you. I’ll go over what’s going on here at the Fun Park in a second, but for now let’s turn our attention to what’s happening with our real estate market.

In the Louisville and southern Indiana area it’s apparent that right now is the best time to list and sell your home. **Waiting until spring could be a huge mistake.**

Part of the reason demand is so high right now is the fact that the housing supply is incredibly low not only in our area, but across the country. Additionally, interest rates are still historically low even after the increase a couple months ago. Rent is also continuing to increase, so people are looking to step into the role of homeownership.

The absorption rate is talked about pretty often and includes the amount of inventory on the market, the number of new listings coming on the market, and buyers. Anything more than a six-month supply of homes is said to be a buyer’s market, a five- to six-month supply is a normal market, and anything less than a five-month supply of homes is a seller’s market.

**If you take a look at the Louisville market, the absorption rate is at a 2.93-month supply, so we are in a very strong seller’s market.** If you break down the absorption rate by price range, the majority of homes between $100,000 and $500,000 are in a 1.4 to 2.9 months supply, which is incredible. These numbers are likely sprouting as a result of growing consumer confidence. In fact, according to Bloomberg News, consumer confidence jumped to the highest level since 2004. Additionally, CNBC reported that the percentage of Americans who believe the economy will get better in the next year jumped an unprecedented 17 points to 42%.

We are finding an amazing amount of buyers who are sitting and waiting for homes to come on the market. When we list a home, we schedule showings within a matter of hours because there are so many people looking for homes. So if you want to maximize the amount of money you can get for you home and sell it quickly, now is the time to give us a call.

Now, let’s shift back to where I am, The Fun Park in Middletown. **It doesn’t matter if you’re a kid or a kid at heart, there is something here for everyone.** There are lots of games for kids, but adults can look forward to laser tag and a number of other things to do while spending a cold day inside.
