  The costs of homeownership add up. You may be paying too much for certain
  things in your home without even realizing it. For example, using cheaper,
  incandescent light bulbs might look like a good way to save some money.
  However, you’re paying far more in electricity costs than you ever could with
  an LED bulb. To learn more about this and nine other costly mistakes that we
  see homeowners making all the time, watch this short video.

Homes cost a lot of money to maintain, but are you spending unnecessary money? **Here are the ten most expensive mistakes sellers make and how to solve them:**

**1. Using traditional light bulbs.** If you still have incandescent light bulbs in your home, you’re throwing away money every month on your electric bill. Even though the initial cost is lower, the total cost is certainly not. Over its lifespan, an incandescent light bulb can use up to $180 in electricity. In comparison, an LED light bulb only uses $30 in electricity in the same lifetime. Think about how this could change your home’s bottom line.

**2. Ignoring a leaky faucet.** One drop per second can waste over 3,000 gallons per year. That’s enough to take over 180 showers. Your water bill will get expensive. Take a look at your toilets too. If you hear water running constantly, get that fixed as well.

**3. Using the wrong air filter size.** Using the wrong filter (or a dirty one) can increase your power bill and cause expensive damages for your furnace down the road. If it’s dirty or clogged, replace it. I recommend changing it every two to three months.

**4. Not customizing your thermostat temperature.** This is a big one. Keep the temperature around 19 to 20 degrees Celsius. You can lower your bills further with a programmable thermostat.

**5. Not adjusting your air vents properly.** Is one room hot while the others are cold? A lot of times, homeowners will crank up the A/C to combat the hot temperatures in one area. Instead, keep all your vents open to all the air to flow evenly throughout the home. Don’t put furniture in front of or on top of your vents. Have at least a foot of space so the air can circulate properly.

**6. Overwatering your lawn.** Everybody loves green grass, but you don’t need as much water as you think. Watering about every 4 days is enough. Avoid watering more often because it can kill your grass.

**7. Water temperature is set too high.** Home inspectors tell you to keep the temperature on medium especially if you have young children to avoid them getting hurt from the heat. Keeping it too high makes your bills higher because the water heater continues to run.

**8. Leaky windows and doors.** If there is too much condensation on your windows, make sure you dry it up. Ask family and friends when they visit if your home’s temperature and humidity level feel comfortable.

**9. Paying a handyman.** Don’t pay a handyman for a job that’s simple enough to do yourself. The information is out there. If you’re unsure how to do something, watch tutorials on YouTube or take a class at Home Depot or Lowe’s. Doing these simple tasks on your own could save you time and money and also give you some useful real-world knowledge.

**10. Ignoring curled roof shingles.** When you start to see them form, it’s definitely best not to ignore the problem. Have a roofer come out every few years to inspect and replace those curled shingles.
