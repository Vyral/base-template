One thing I like to emphasize in my life is living every day with passion. I’ve passed this lesson down to my son, and we recently discussed the impact of having passion on the field, in the office, and everywhere in your life. It’s important to understand that **although things won’t always go your way, your passion will carry you through.**

I compare business to sports a lot. The goal of playing sports is to win a championship. To do that, you have to prepare and train the right way. You need to learn the fundamentals, stay healthy, and get stuff done.&nbsp;

The same thing goes for business. Sometimes you have to stay late and study up on the playbook. If you do that, you’ll put yourself in a position to go to the next level.&nbsp;

**It’s all about showing up and putting in the work.** You need to understand what you’re doing, why you're doing it, and do it consistently. The client is No. 1 in this business, and it’s always good to underpromise and overdeliver. That’s going to give you the raving fans that will allow you to grow.

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
