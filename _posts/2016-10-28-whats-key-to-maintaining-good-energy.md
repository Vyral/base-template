In previous videos we talked about time blocking and time management as a way to organize your day, but today we want to talk about a different kind of management: energy management.

We are all different, both physically and psychologically. **Knowing what gives us energy is very important to maximizing your productivity.** Think about it- what gives you energy?

For some of us, a great morning workout helps us get our day on track. We feel energized, awake, and enlivened by the activities. For others, perhaps it’s a diet rich in fresh ingredients and protein. Others rely on caffeine. **Keep an eye on what gives you energy, as well as what takes it away.** I don’t eat bread or pasta for lunch because it brings my energy down. Others don’t feel that same effect. Knowing where your energy comes from is important in maximizing your productivity.

If you have any questions about energy management, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you!
