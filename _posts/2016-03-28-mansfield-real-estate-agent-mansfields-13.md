Today we are going to be discussing the current market here in Mansfield. A lot of people have been asking us about the market’s current stats, and we’re here to share an update with you.

Right now, we have roughly 130 active homes on the market and 160 pending listings. That gives us less than a one-month supply of homes! This low-inventory is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.

Coming out of the holiday and winter months, we have seen a huge rise in activity, going from 77 sold properties over the last 30 days, to the current 160 pending sales. This is typical of a normal yearly cycle. But what does it mean for buyers, sellers, and investors?

For buyers, there are still homes on the market, but you’re going to have to compete for the best homes. For every good home, we have 10 to 20 buyers looking at it. If you’re buying, you need to be pre-approved, have a real estate agent working hard for you, and be ready to act quickly when the right property comes up.

For sellers, you have to get the condition of your home right and price it right. If you do these things, you are in great position to sell your home for more money than you could in the past.

For investors, there is a lot of competition out there, just as there is for regular buyers. If you’re investing in this market, you need to align yourself with a great agent who understands your goals and can work with you to help you achieve them.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to hear from you!
