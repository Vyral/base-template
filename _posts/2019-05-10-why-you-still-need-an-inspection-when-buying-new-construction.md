&nbsp;

People often assume that you don’t need an inspection when buying new construction, but this isn’t at all the case. When you order an inspection for a new construction property, the process should occur in two phases. **First, there’s the construction phase**. Before you purchase the home, it’s important that an inspector visits the property to verify that it’s in good condition. **The second half of this process is the move-in phase**. After you’ve closed on a new construction home, you should ask the inspector to return within your warranty period to check for any undiscovered problems. If they find any, you can then take the report to the builder and ask that they resolve all issues. Following these steps will ensure that your new construction home is safe and sound. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
