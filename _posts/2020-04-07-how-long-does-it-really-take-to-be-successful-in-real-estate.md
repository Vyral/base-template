<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s the truth about why some firms stress certain timelines for their new agents’ success.</em></p>

Why do some firms tell you it could take six to 12 months for you to close your first house? The answer is, **there’s no structure there—no guidance, no leads, no support.** Those firms lack the deep level of training necessary to set you up for success as soon as possible.&nbsp;

In addition to a big network of agents here in the Charlotte area, I speak to a ton of agents around the country, and personally coach several. The No. 1 thing I hear from new agents is that dreaded timeline: “The firm I looked at told me it could take six to 12 months before I close.”

My question in response is always: “How do you put bread on the table then?”

**If you’re looking for structure, accountability, and a team that can take you to the next level of selling** 30 to 40+ deals every single year, let’s get together for a confidential conversation about your goals and expectations.&nbsp;

Don’t be confused by firms who hang the ‘six to 12 months’ timeline over your head; give us a call or shoot us an email. I’d love to hear from you and show you just how much you can achieve in real estate.
