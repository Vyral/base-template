Today, I want to talk to you about charitable contributions.

Over the past 25 years, I’ve had the great pleasure being able to donate a portion of our team’s earned commissions to the Phoenix Children’s Hospital. Our office is involved in a lot of different charities—each agent has their own pet charity, if you will.

In addition to the Phoenix Children’s Hospital, we’ve gotten involved in the last year with a group called One Life Fully Lived, which is a group that reaches out to young adults and high school-aged kids in an effort to give them some guidance on their futures. We’re also a contributor to the Singleton Moms Foundation.

One of our initiatives in 2017 is to give back. My goal is to donate $100,000 to charities. Instead of us picking a charity that we think is good to donate to, we will ask our sellers which charities they’re fond of and make donations to those charities in our clients’ names.  

If you have any questions or you know some worthwhile charities that could use some help, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. We’d love to speak with you.
