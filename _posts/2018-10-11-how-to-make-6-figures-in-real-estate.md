Lead generation is the key to a successful career in the real estate industry. Here’s why.
{: .present-before-paste}

Today we’re answering the question, “How many hours of lead generation do I need to do to make six figures?”
{: .present-before-paste}

**What we’ve learned is that lead generation is an essential daily practice** in order to have success as a salesperson in any industry, including real estate. In order to build your business and start getting referrals, you have to start somewhere.

Numerous studies have concluded that **an agent needs to spend two to three hours per day on nothing else but lead generation** and new business development in order to get to the point where you’re making a six-figure income.

On our team, every morning from 8:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. is set aside for calling potential leads and asking whether they need any real estate help or know someone else who does. Then we spend about an hour following up with people who have indicated that they have a real estate need. **When we practice that five days a week, you’d be surprised at the amount of business that comes in for us.**

Sales has always been this way. It comes down to talking to a lot of people about the industry you're in, identifying their needs, and serving those needs. The thing is that today we have additional technology to collaborate and integrate with those people. **Technology will help, but lead generation requires your daily effort and voice to find the needs of the people around you.**

If you have any business-building questions or suggestions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
