{% include youtube.html %}If you want to sell in the springtime, what are the first steps that you need to take? When do you need to take them?

The very first thing you need to do is determine when the spring market begins. A lot of people operate under the misconception that the spring market starts in April and continues from there. The reality is that the spring market starts right after the Super Bowl weekend. So after the Redskins win the Super Bowl on February 5th, you want your house to be on the market on February 12th.

Why do you want to be on the market so early? Most people put their house on the market later in the spring, which means you will have a lot of competition. In February, buyers have already started searching. They are looking to buy a house and inventory is low, which puts you in a great position to sell more quickly and for more money.

Now that you know when the market begins, what do you do? The first thing you should do is call your Realtor. We’ll go through your exact timeline, give you an overview of the process, and figure out what your goals are.

Ideally, we’ll meet two months before you put your home on the market. There are 83 steps in our sales process from the initial phone call to putting your house on the market. We want to start taking you through this process as soon as possible so that it’s not stressful and overwhelming. We want to have a plan in place so that you know exactly what to do and when to do it.

After that initial call, we’ll meet with you, put together a market analysis, and get a stager out to your house. We’ll put together a detailed report of items that need to be addressed before you go on the market. There are things that you can do to maximize your return on the sale of your home. You may need to paint, update the flooring, clean, and declutter in order to get the most money from your home sale.

Once those things have been taken care of, a professional photographer will come in and take photos. We even do a 3-D scan for some of our listings. From there, we will execute our pre-listing marketing program.

If you’re in a crunch, we can get a house on the market in three days. However, we’d rather not do that. We want enough time to do all the steps properly to maximize the amount of money you’ll get for the home, and we want you to have a stress-free experience.

So, if you are thinking of putting your home on the market, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you get started!
