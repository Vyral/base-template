{% include youtube.html %}<br>When you’re searching for a home to buy, there are a few things that we notice people are more worried about than others. **These include the location of the neighborhood and the home’s proximity to certain schools.**

As for location, the things you want to think about are the things that may be a concern for the resale value later on. **When we’re helping homebuyers, we’re always thinking about the resale value.** Are there railroad tracks nearby? A water tower? Vacant fields? All of these things could impact the value of the home negatively in the future. 

The other thing that people think about during their house hunting search is schools. Everyone has a different opinion on what matters most in a school, so I encourage people to go to the [Texas education site,](https://tea.texas.gov/) Here there are statistics, rankings, and much more information about all of the schools in the area.

There is also a site called [neighborhoodscout.com](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/) that can give you information about the district

**These are two really important factors when it comes to buying a home and reselling it in the future.** If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
