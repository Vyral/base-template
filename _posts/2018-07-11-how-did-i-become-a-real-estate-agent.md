**I entered the real estate industry back in 2006 while I was still on active duty in the military**; I had just been stationed at Fort Hood. I knew a good Realtor who explained the whole home buying process to me, and that piqued my curiosity. After I bought my house, I stayed in contact with that Realtor.

Eventually, I became a licensed real estate agent. I discovered that I enjoy the old army NCO in me—**I like helping people.** I enjoy sitting down at that first consultation with people, explaining to them the homebuying process, and taking them under my wing and offering guided protection for their first large purchase.

As an agent, I stand out from others because I really listen to what clients want. It’s not about pushing them into a home that they don’t want. **I listen to the needs of my clients and go above and beyond to make sure they get them.**

After spending 20 years in the military, I now understand the fear of settling down and feeling stuck. **I can put myself in the shoes of people** who feel that way since I have been there, and I can help them develop perspective.

I love many things about my job: I love meeting new people and helping them, especially younger, first-time homebuyers, since that is such a critical event in someone’s life.

If you have any questions about my career or about buying or selling a home, please feel free to reach out to me. I would be glad to help.
