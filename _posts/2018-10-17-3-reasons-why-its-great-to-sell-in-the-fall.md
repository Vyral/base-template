Most people assume that once the summer is over and the school year has kicked off that our market slows down, but here in San Diego that couldn’t be further from the truth. September and October have proven to be some of the most advantageous months for real estate in our area.

There are three main reasons why fall is such a great time to sell:

**1. There’s less competition.** In spring and summer, there are a ton of buyers and sellers on the market. Putting your property on the market during these seasons, therefore, means setting yourself up against a high level of competition. By listing in the fall, you’ll have a much better shot at making your property stand out. This will give you more leverage and help you sell quickly and for top dollar.

**2. Buyers are more motivated.** Conventional wisdom once told us that most buyers want to make their move before the school year begins, but this is no longer the case. These days, buyers tend to be far more motivated by the desire to get into their new home before the holidays. Buyers in spring and summer have more time to look around, but buyers in the fall will see the coming holidays as somewhat of a deadline.<br>&nbsp;

**3. Autumn listing photos look great.** These days, your first showings really happen online. Therefore, having great photos is key. Right now, yards are still green but the leaves are beginning to turn, and this combination is sure to make your listing look fantastic.
