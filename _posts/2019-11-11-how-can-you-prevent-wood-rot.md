I recently had a sit-down with one of my great contractors, Lucas, to talk about one of the most common problems we see in homes.

**One of the most costly and most common things Lucas helps us with is wood rot.** With the Georgia weather, this usually happens around windows. Through the years, the caulking and water sealing around your windows wears away, but you can maintain it by checking them every few years.&nbsp;

The rot usually happens right around the brick molding near the windows and can be prevented with fresh pain and re-caulking.

**Most people don’t call until they’re selling, because they don’t realize they have wood rot until then.** Take a look at your home and notice any discoloration or flaking paint near your windows. That’s a good sign that there is some kind of rot going on. As soon as you see that, light painting and caulking will help you fix it.

If you have any other questions for us in the meantime about something that’s going on in your home, we’d be happy to connect you with Lucas or one of our other great contactors.&nbsp;

If you have any other real estate-related questions, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
