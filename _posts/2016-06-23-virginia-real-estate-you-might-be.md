Today I have some exciting news to share with you - the Wicker Homes Group is looking to expand!

We have two positions open on our team, and we wanted to reach out to you first.

We’re looking to add another buyer agent to our team; someone who can work with our clients who are looking to buy a home, and take great care of them.

We’re also looking for a listing coordinator. This person would work closely with me and with the systems we have in place to help me take great care of our clients who are looking to sell their home. This would include from the start of the transaction all the way through to settling and closing the transaction.

If you or anyone you know might be interested in these positions, please contact our operations manager Tad Wicker! His email is TadWicker@WickerHomes, or you can call Tad on his cell phone at 571-338-3883. You can also visit this website for the job details.

 We hope to hear from you soon!
