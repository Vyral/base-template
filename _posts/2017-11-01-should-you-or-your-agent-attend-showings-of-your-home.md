I’m out at one of my newest listings in the Buena Creek area of Vista (756 Valley Crest Drive) to meet with a few agents who will be showing the property. I thought it would be a good time for me to answer a common question I’ve been getting: “Who should be present when my home is being shown?”

**If you’re a homeowner, I recommend that you find something else to do while your home is being shown.** From my own experience, when sellers are present at showings it makes buyers feel uncomfortable. They don’t explore as much, they don’t ask as many questions, and they aren’t as honest with their feedback.

While the homeowner shouldn’t be present at the showing, their listing agent should be whenever possible. They are going to be the best possible advocate for the home. They know all about it and its features. The buyer’s agent probably won’t know much about the home other than what’s on the listing. **If the listing agent is there, they can let the buyer know all about the home, the surrounding area, and why it’s worth the price you're asking.**

I hope this is helpful. If you have any questions for me in the meantime or you’re looking to buy or sell, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
