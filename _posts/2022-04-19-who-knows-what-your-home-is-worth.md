What is your home really worth? You don’t know, Zillow doesn’t know, and nobody on the internet does.&nbsp;

**The real value of your property is determined by the market based on three main factors:**

* Location
* Condition
* Your comparative market analysis

If you want to find the true value of your home, you need to do a CMA. Your real estate agent should be more than happy to find your true value for you.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me or want to know what your home is worth in today’s market, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
