Here are three mistakes to avoid when listing your home in Hoboken this year:&nbsp;

The first common seller mistake is **not taking time to prep your home.** For our part, we’ll have an interior designer come out to your home to determine where we should focus our preparation efforts. Using their feedback, we’ll have your home looking like a model property before we introduce it to the market.&nbsp;

We all know that exciting, warm feeling that stems from walking through a model home, and our goal is to elicit the same response from the buyers who see your home. When a buyer gets excited about your home, it means more money in your pocket at closing and a quicker sale.

Secondly, **overpricing your home** can have major consequences. I understand if you feel that your home is special and unique, and it is, but we need to make sure we price it based on what the market says it’s worth—not what we think it’s worth. We in the real estate business rely heavily on comps, or comparables, to help us determine a home’s value. Comparables are properties that have been on the market for a short time and are similar to yours.&nbsp;

They’re an important tool in keeping us from doing what no seller should do: price their home above market value. Your home will have the most buyer exposure in its first two to three weeks on the market, and we want to be sure to take advantage of that momentum.&nbsp;

If we overprice right from the start, three weeks or a month could go by with little to no buyer interest, forcing us to reduce your home’s price. Price reductions tend to attract the sharks (i.e., lowball offers)—something we wanted to avoid in the first place. It’s very important to look at similar homes and stay in line with current market conditions.

It’s last on the list, but **hiring a bad agent** is just as big a mistake as the others. Everywhere you look, you see marketing and ads from other agents battling to be the cheapest agent in the area. As the old saying goes, “You get what you pay for,” and that’s no less true in real estate.&nbsp;

Now, I’m not suggesting you shouldn’t give a discount agent a chance. Feel free to meet with them to see what they have to offer, but also interview a few others like the Riolo Residential Group. Who you work with matters; we have a proven strategy that will achieve the results you are looking for with the sale of your home.&nbsp;

If you have any questions or you’re curious about your home’s value in today’s market, please feel free to give us a call at 201-253-5594 or email me at [Brian@RioloResidentialGroup.com](Brian@RioloResidentialGroup.com){: target="_blank"}. We hope to hear from you soon\!
