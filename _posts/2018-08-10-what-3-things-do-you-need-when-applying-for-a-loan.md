I work with homebuyers every day. Some of them are experienced, while others are first-time buyers. No matter the case, I hear many misconceptions about qualifying for a home loan, whether it is the amount of a down payment required or credit score needed.

**There are three things you’ll need in order to get a home loan:**

**1. Down payment**. In some cases, your down payment can be as low as 3%.

**2. Income.** In order to verify your income, you’ll need to provide your W-2 forms, tax returns, and pay stubs.

**3. Credit.** Even if you don’t have perfect credit, you may already qualify for a loan.

I can help you navigate through the home buying process and can connect you with some great lenders who can help you through the mortgage application and underwriting processes, giving you advice tailored just for you. You may be surprised to find out just what you qualify for, so let’s get started today!
