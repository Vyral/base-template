  to expect from the real estate market this year. Here’s what I learned.

It’s springtime here in Baltimore and I just got back from a conference where we talked about the expectations of the real estate market this year. I heard from the oracle of real estate, who has been giving his predictions, and it sounds like we’re going to have a great year from what he’s saying.

**He showed a couple slides that proved his point, which you can see in the video above.** Over the last 18 years, you can see the growth of the U.S. existing home median sale price. He said that if we figured in a normal appreciation of 3.6% per year, you can see that we’re about right on track with where we should be right now, historically speaking.

Another thing we talked about was recessions. A common misconception about recessions is that they are always followed by a drop in home values. **However, a recession doesn’t mean depreciation.** Three of the last five recessions led to an increase in home prices. The only one that bucked the trend was the 2008 recession, where the market dropped 20% on average.

**Today’s market is different.** We are starting to see a slow, steady appreciation which shows that we’re going to continue to see this over the next few years. If we do hit a recession in 2020, in most cases, we won’t even see depreciation. Long-term real estate is still a great investment and will be in the coming years. With low interest rates and steady appreciation, it’s a great time to buy.

If you have any questions for me about the past, present, or future of our real estate market, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
