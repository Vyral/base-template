If you’re a home seller, you don’t want to miss out on our hot summer market.&nbsp;

Why? **The answer lies in supply and demand.** Supply is lower than it has been in the last few years, which means there are far more buyers looking for homes than there are available homes to sell.&nbsp;

However, some sellers still prefer to wait because they’d rather look for their next home before putting their current one on the market. If you haven’t found your next home yet, I understand this line of thinking.

Maybe you should consider putting your home on the market and opening its doors to potential buyers, though. **If someone wants it, you still have time to find your next home.** I have three well-qualified buyers who are looking in a hefty price range in a market where there’s absolutely nothing for sale—every time a home becomes available, multiple buyers pounce on it. That’s why I’m knocking on doors on their behalf looking for anyone who wants to sell.

Knowing this, why not put your home on the market now? Why wait until January or March when more people will be putting their homes on the market and there will be more competition?&nbsp;

By putting your home on the market now, you can find serious, well-qualified buyers who’d be willing to wait for you to find your next home. The best buyers are the ones myself and other agents are knocking on doors for, so **list your home now and take advantage of the lack of supply.&nbsp;**

If you’d like to get started with the home selling process, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I can help you get your house on the market while it’s hot and buyers are out there fighting over houses.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any other questions about our market or real estate needs, feel free to reach out to me as well. I’d love to help you.
