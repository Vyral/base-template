If you’re a homebuyer in our area and you don’t want the general public to know where you live, there are ways you can buy a property anonymously.

Most people who want to buy a home simply write an offer for it in their name. After that, the title company records that offer in their name. The problem with this, though, is that anyone who has access to your tax records has access to your address.

If you want to buy a property anonymously, you can still write an offer for it in your name. All you have to do is **fill out a vesting document with that offer once it’s in escrow**. The two most common ways to hold title is as a family trust or an LLC. The unique thing about having an LLC is you can call it whatever you want and nobody will know that your name is attached to it. Once the transaction is complete and all the information is officially recorded, nobody will know you own the home.

If you’re a celebrity and you’re still worried that your escrow information could leak out, **you can attach a non-disclosure agreement to your offer.** This agreement requires everyone involved in the transaction to not expose who you are and where you live.
