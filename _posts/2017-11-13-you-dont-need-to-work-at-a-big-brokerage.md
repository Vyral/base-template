One of the big questions a lot of people get when they’re entering into the business is, “**Do I need to be with a big brokerage to be successful?**”<br><br>Everyone has a different opinion on this. My answer is going to be no.

What’s my experience? Well, I’ve been at most of those brokerages, and I’ll tell you a little bit about each one and why I didn’t feel like I needed to be there.

I’ve been at two Keller Williams agencies, and most of the reasons why I left came down to two things.

**The first is recruiting.**If you own a team at a brokerage or if you’re an independent agent, a lot of the Keller Williams agencies have a cap system where you have to pay in $21,000, and as a buyer’s agent, you have a cap of around $8,500. In my experience at those brokerages, that sets up a system that makes it tough to recruit from within the brokerage.

I’m at Key Realty, and everyone here has the same split—**I pay the same as everyone on my team**, which is just a few thousand dollars, a sixth of the cost at Keller Williams.

One of the big trade-offs is if I take a capping agent at Keller Williams (someone that takes $21,000 a year in commissions), and bring them onto my team where they only take $8,500, that loses Keller Williams $13,000 in company money.

One of the things I heard from them was that they were going to help me build up my team, but in my time at two different Keller Williams agencies, I was never sent one person to interview. Most of that was done on my own, and I couldn’t let other people know that I was looking to recruit.<br><br>I’ve also been with smaller companies like List Realty and other brokerages. When I started, I had a 419 phone number and I made thousands of calls in my first few years. A lot of the time, people would ask where I was calling from. I would tell them I’m calling from central Ohio, and they’d ask why I had a 419 number.

I got more objections from that than I ever did from the brokerage I was with. They’d say, “Oh, List Realty? I’ve never heard of that” or “I have heard of that; I know who Re/MAX is.” But that, in my experience, never opened up the door. My sales experience and objection handlers did.

When someone comes to you and asks why they would ever go with a smaller company, that’s just an objection, and I can overcome that. I would say that it’s not the brokerage you’re working with, it’s the independent agents. Whether I’m with Keller Williams, Re/MAX, or Key Realty, my experience, professionalism, and processes are the same.

The last reason I have for why you don’t need to be at larger brokerages like Keller Williams, Re/MAX, et al., is that **there’s not a lot of value.**

As a team leader, I’m providing leads, office space, training, etc. At Keller Williams’ BOLD, sometimes they’ll pay for these things for you, but you’ll have to pay them back. All of our trainings and coachings are covered by the team leader.

At the other brokerages I’ve been to, you have to pay for an office. We have 1,200 square feet, whereas at most traditional offices, you get 300 to 400 square feet, at a cost of between $500 and $600. Where we’re at right now, you don’t have to pay for that. It doesn’t cost money to work, to ask questions, to train, or to get leads.

Keller Williams never gave me leads, and neither did Re/MAX. They gave me opportunities like connections, but when I wanted training and to talk to the team leaders, every team leader I approached told me that I needed to join those teams if I wanted those things.

At Key Realty, we love our brokerage. To me, the most important thing is what you put in your pocket, what you net, and the habits that you create. A lot of these other organizations never taught me the habits I needed. No one went out of their way to do that.

Again, this is just my own experience—it may be different for different brokerages. &nbsp;But of the brokerages I’ve been with, I got the most training from the smallest brokerage.<br><br>It’s not the brand that really makes a difference. A lot of great organizations are independent companies that have branded their own names.<br><br>In my opinion, you can be at a small brokerage with a small team and really do well. Just remember to ask what value you’re getting when you’re joining a team.
