There are three big reasons why now is a great time to sell your house here in northeast Ohio.

1. Consumer confidence: The election's finally over, and we're seeing record stock prices and a lot of homebuyers flooding the market.

2. Interest rates are on the rise: After the recent rise, people are flocking to the market to buy a home before rates go up again. By the end of the year, rates are anticipated to go up quite a bit more, so even more buyers will want to lock in a low interest rate on their mortgage before this happens.

3. Inventory is extremely low: A ton of houses came off the market in the winter, and now I see a lot of houses listed again this year. Many of these sellers are pricing their homes to sell, meaning you can get as good of a deal or better than you could have last year.

If you're considering selling your property this year, give me a call or send me an email soon before these favorable conditions expire. I look forward to hearing from you!
