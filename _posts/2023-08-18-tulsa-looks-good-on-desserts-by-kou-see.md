**Jennie recently stopped by Iron Gate Tulsa to connect with Executive Director, Carrie Henderson to hear about all the great work they are doing for the Tulsa community!**

**Iron Gate’s mission is simple….feed the hungry of Tulsa, every day. Providing three options to feed people, Iron Gate offers a soup kitchen, grocery pantry and Kids Pantry.**

**Located at 501 W Archer in downtown Tulsa, Iron Gate became a 501(c) 3 in 1984. Since opening, Iron Gate has never turned anyone away who was hungry.**

**Iron Gate offers a variety of volunteer opportunities and resources. For more information visit,** [www.irongatetulsa.org](http://www.irongatetulsa.org)
