Today, let’s talk about the questions you should be asking when you’re interviewing an agent.

When you’re evaluating an agent to see if they’re the right fit for you and your real estate needs, these are some of the top questions I believe you should ask:

1. **Is this their full-time job?** Do they have another career that they’re trying to balance in addition to real estate? Will you be a priority for them? Will they have time for showings throughout the day? It’s essential when picking an agent that they be available when you need them. Also, find out how many homes they’ve closed on in the last year. This will touch on how much experience they have and how up to date they are on the local market.
2. **What type of support staff and resources do they have?** Managing a transaction is a big task. Do they have access to an in-house attorney? Do they have other trustworthy professionals that they can recommend you to, like a lender, an inspector, painters, landscapers, etc.?<br>{% include pullquote.html %}
3. **How are they going to keep you informed during the transaction?&nbsp;**It’s good to know what you can expect from them as far as communication goes throughout the whole transaction. You don’t want to be left wondering where your agent is!
4. **Do they require a pre-approval before going out to look at homes?** More seasoned agents will make sure you have your ducks in a row. They’ll be more than happy to help you get in touch with a great lender, and to make sure that you’re only looking at houses that work just for your budget.
5. Ultimately, you’ll be signing a buyer agency agreement with them.&nbsp;**Is your agent willing to go over the entire agreement with you?**&nbsp;What happens if they’re not working as hard as they can for you? Can you get out of it, or are you stuck with them?

Before you come to a final decision about choosing an agent, see what their past clients say about them. You can look on Zillow, Google, Yelp, and you can even ask them for references. They may have testimonials on their website or past clients you can call and speak to.
