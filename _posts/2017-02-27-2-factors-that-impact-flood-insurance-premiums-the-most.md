I get a lot of questions from folks looking to buy a home here in Florida that don't want to live in a flood zone. It can be tough since our state is a peninsula surrounded by water on three sides, so today I wanted to talk a little bit about flood insurance.

Let me tell you that flood insurance is overblown and is not a deal-breaker.&nbsp;

You should start out by trying to find a house that you like and can afford and then have your Realtor hook you up with an insurance professional that will give you a flood quote.&nbsp;

**When looking at homes, you should be aware of the elevation and age of the home.&nbsp;**

The home's elevation is a big determinant of your flood insurance premium. Age matters because after building codes changed in 1975, newer homes would have the lot built up first, then have the home built on top of it. Code changes in the mid-90s and in 2002 meant new changes in the structural requirements of homes as well. This can make as much as a 50% difference in premiums. If you look at homes on the newer end of that scale, the insurance premiums will be very manageable.

In short, **looking at homes built after the benchmark year of 1975 is good, after 1995 is better**, and after 2002 is much better when it comes to flood insurance premiums. Don't overthink it!

I hope this eases any anxiety you have about flood insurance. If you have any other questions or you're looking to make a move to Florida, give me a call or send me an email. I'd be glad to help.
