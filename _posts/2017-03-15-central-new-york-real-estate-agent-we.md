Our team is not only dedicated to our clients, we’re also dedicated to our community and we are always looking for ways to improve it and the lives of those who share it with us.

This is why we are here today with Kate Houck of David’s Refuge. This nonprofit is all about caring for the caregivers. They are able to serve parents who have a child with special needs or a life-threatening illness with their support. **They send the families on beautiful two-night getaways in order to refresh them, show appreciation for them, and remind them they are not alone.**

We couldn’t be more happy to participate in a worthwhile cause like this. In the month of April, we are donating an amount equal to 12% of our commissions to David’s Refuge. The more people we are able to help buy and sell homes, the more families we’ll be able to help. We are aiming to help 60 different families in the next year with the help of David’s Refuge.
