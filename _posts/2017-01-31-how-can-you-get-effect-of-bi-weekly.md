<div style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Today you'll learn about an alternative to making bi-weekly mortgage payments that will save you money and achieve the same effect of making an extra payment every year.*<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">We often get questions from clients asking about bi-weekly payment options. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The fact is, once you close on a transaction, you're going to get inundated with junk mail, much of which will be requests for you to sign up for a bi-weekly payment option. This means that instead of paying your mortgage once a month, you'd pay twice a month. 

<div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">With this plan, you get the same effect as bi-weekly payments without the middle man and their fee. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">**The reality of working with these companies, though, is that you'll pay them a month in advance. **Then, you'll pay every two weeks, and in turn, they will pay your lender once a month. This will continue until they've built up enough reserves in the escrow account they've set up for you to make that 13th payment a year. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">**I advise my clients to take that monthly payment you're paying to your lender each month, divide it by 12, and add that amount to what you pay every single month. **This results in a 13th payment being made every year. It's exactly the same as the bi-weekly payment plan, with the only difference being that by doing it yourself, you cut out the middlemanand their fee. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">If you have any questions about this payment plan, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I'd be honored to help!
