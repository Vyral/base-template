{% include youtube.html %}It was a crazy busy summer here in the Burbank area, but the fall is here and the market has cooled off a bit. Because of this slight slowdown, many people are asking whether they should wait until the busy spring season to sell their home. This is a great question - to answer it, let's take a look at interest rates because they have the biggest impact on your spending power.

Say you get a $600,000 mortgage with the current interest rate of about 4.25%. Your monthly payments will only be $2,900 a month. Local lenders predict those low interest rates to rise next year. If you wait to buy, interest rates may be as high as 5.5%. If you lock

in a 5.25% rate next year, you will have lost 10% of your purchasing power! This means you will have to pay the same price for less home - you'll have to pass on that $600,000 mortgage for a more affordable $540,000 one.

It's really quite simple: If you are ready to buy, it's probably not wise to wait. Now is the time to take advantage of fantastic rates and find your dream home.
