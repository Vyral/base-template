If you’re tempted to hire one agent to help you sell your current home and buy your new one, listen up. There are a few things you should take into consideration first.

When thinking about using the same agent to help you sell your current home and buy a new one, there are some very important questions to consider. **Although it seems like the easier option, you need to know about a few things beforehand.**

First, you need to know if they specialize in both the area where you sell your home and the area where you’re buying your new one. You’ll also want to know whether the agent focuses primarily on home sales or home purchases. **You want to make sure they have experience with both.** The agent you hire will also need systems and support staff to handle both transactions.

If you’re moving out of the area, the agent may not even be able to help you because they aren’t licensed there, but they should be able to refer you to someone who can.

**Make sure you take all of this into consideration when thinking about using the same agent to help you buy and sell a home.** If you have any questions for me in the meantime or want to know how our team can help you with both transactions at once, watch this short video.
