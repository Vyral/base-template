With the holiday season coming up, a lot of people are wondering if it’s a good time to buy or sell. The answer is that it may or may not be.

The answer to whether or not it is time to get in the market depends on your individual situation. **Different price points and different parts of town have different factors involved that affect home values.**

What I will say is that there are fewer homes available for buyers during the holiday season. This means reduced competition for you as a seller. **If you have a great property, you’ll be able to sell it quickly in this market.** You probably won’t have to have a lot of showings either, but that’s a good thing. The showings you do have will be with serious, motivated buyers.

However, there is something about listing during the holidays that most people won’t tell you. If you look at the average sale price in January of homes that went under contract in December, you’ll see that it’s actually lower than the other months of the year.

I won’t sit here and say you should absolutely sell your home now or in the next few months. However, I am saying that we should sit down together, analyze your specific situation, and figure out what the best plan of action should be for you.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions at all, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
