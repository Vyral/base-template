Planning to sell your house this spring? I’d say you couldn’t have chosen a better time to sell. With more buyers looking for new homes to settle into before the holiday season kicks in, you are in a good position in the market. To make your property stand out to potential buyers, you should first prepare your home for sale. Here are three things that you do now if you’re considering selling your home in spring:

**1\. Declutter the interior.** Inside your house is the best place to start decluttering. Go through your drawers, cabinets, tubs, and basement, and ask yourself, *“What items do I want to bring to my next home?”* Evaluate whether it’s essential for your move. If not, it’s time to get it out of the house. Don’t forget to sort out your painting projects before listing your house to avoid last-minute stress.

**2\. Tune up major mechanicals.** Perform a regular tune-up for systems like your furnace, air conditioner, and water heater to know if they are working properly and safe to use. This is important when you’re selling in the spring and it’s cold outside. Buyers will do their own inspections, so keep records of all maintenance and repair jobs to show that you recently tuned up your system and are taking good care of your home.

**3\. Clean up the exterior.** Even though the snow will eventually cover up your driveway or yard, it’s still better to keep it clean. Start with your garage or storage shed and patiently remove any unwanted items that won’t be moving with you. Next, trim overgrown plants and remove any dead or yellow leaves to improve your landscape and create a healthier environment for your plants. Lastly, rake up fallen leaves to keep them from piling up, making your yard look messy in February, March, and April.

If you get those things done as early as now, you won’t have to stress yourself out when spring comes around. **If you have any questions,** **you can contact us at** [**(952) 212-3597**](tel:9522123597) **or** [**chad@chadandsara.com**](mailto:chad@chadandsara.com)**.** Let us know how we can help.
