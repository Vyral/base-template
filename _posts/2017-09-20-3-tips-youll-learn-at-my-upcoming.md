Today I want to go over the three things you need to do to get top dollar for your home. Low inventory means that homes are selling quickly and sellers have the advantage, but why not aim for getting even more money in your pocket?

When you’re thinking of selling one, two, or even three years from now, there are three things you can do to ensure your success down the line.

**1. Start way earlier than you think.** Consider Noah when he was building the arc. When he was building the boat and gathering the animals, he did so well in advance. This is exactly the mindset you need to apply to selling your home. Come to one of my home seller seminars, where we’ll teach you eight secret strategies to getting you top dollar. This will guarantee you a quick sale and more money in your pocket. People who come to our seminars are getting their homes off the market in just seven days and for at or above list price.

**2. Crush the competition.** Imagine a sports game where the final score ended up being something like 101 to three. This would make for an amazing win and an amazing story, and that’s exactly what you should aim for in your transaction. Having a competitive mentality will help put you far ahead of the competition. There are other homes out there that want to sell too; you need to make sure that your home is better than the rest.

**3. Have buyers lined up outside of your door.** This is something that happens at every one of our open houses. If you follow these first two steps, this is going to be the result. If you have this vision and follow through, it can come true for you too.
