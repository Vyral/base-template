Today I want to talk to you about how to properly choose a home inspector. I think we can all agree that **a home inspection is essential when you buy a house.** It’s a small investment that lets you know everything you need to know about the house—the good, the bad, and the ugly. We always recommend one. **However, how do you choose the right inspector?**

Over the last few years, we’ve seen a lot of new home inspectors enter the business. Just like real estate agents, some of those inspectors are going to have more experience than others. Some will do a better report, or have better systems for finding problems. It’s important that you have a home inspector that is going to shoot you straight, give you the detailed facts, and be professional. You don’t want an inspector that will be too critical or too soft. **It’s about finding a good balance.**

When you’re looking for an inspector to hire, my recommendation is to lean on your real estate agent for advice. They will know who is a good inspector and who isn’t. **Agents work with these inspectors day in and day out and they know who the best option is.**

If you have any questions for me about home inspections or anything else, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
