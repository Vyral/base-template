According to the July issue of Psychological Science magazine, it takes just one-tenth of a second for a stranger to decide whether they trust you or not. With that being said, it’s clear to see that the way you dress will have a significant impact on how others perceive you.

This is why when we meet with clients, we dress to instill confidence in them. Dressing for comfort simply doesn’t send the right message. **Clients are more likely to trust someone who looks confident than to trust someone who simply looks comfortable,** especially if being comfortable means sporting their favorite tank-top and flip-flop combo.&nbsp;

Therefore, our team keeps a simple, effective dress code in place. Men are to wear collared shirts, dress pants, and dress shoes. For women, it’s about balance. Professional attire, rather than clothes you might wear to social events, is best.&nbsp;

So make that one-tenth of a second count by dressing to impress. A little wardrobe tune-up could dramatically improve your business.&nbsp;
