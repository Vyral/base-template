What does it mean to serve our clients?

It means that whatever we told them we were going to do, we must do. People conduct business with people they trust, and it’s our job to make sure we live up to the way we present ourselves in our listing consultations or buyer presentations.&nbsp;

In other words, **we must be the person we promised we would be.** If we don’t do something we said we would do, people lose trust in us.&nbsp;

There are standards when it comes to building and maintaining communication, and these standards apply to our teams as well as our clients. What are your communication standards in terms of how often you reach out to your clients? It has to at least be weekly, right?

We also have to communicate with our clients in other ways, and this will be leveraged through technology. This can include your CRM and other client management systems that allow you to touch base with them.

Additionally, you’ll leverage through people. Perhaps you have people on your team who’ll be in touch with your clients, so you want to make sure they’re properly set up and introduced to them.&nbsp;

Lastly, you’ll leverage though your vendor partners. During the home buying or selling process, you’re working with other people who are actually a part of your team as well.&nbsp;

With that being said, **there are four tips you need to remember to facilitate great communication with your clients:**

1. Tell them what you’re going to do.
2. Ask lots of questions and listen intently.
3. Communicate with them weekly—I encourage this to be at least a phone call attempt. If they don’t answer, follow up with a text or email reiterating your message.
4. Never put off bad news. No matter how bad it is, you have to get it over with, and if you have any part in this bad news, you have to own up to it and move forward.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this aspect of the Five-S &nbsp;model of the customer experience, don’t hesitate to call or email me. In the meantime, stay tuned for future videos where I’ll spotlight the other S’s so that you can have a better understanding of how to boost the quality of your customer experience.
