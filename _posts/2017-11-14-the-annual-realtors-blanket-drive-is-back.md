It’s starting to get really cold out there. So this year, Realtors across Vancouver are continuing the annual tradition of collecting blankets for those in need.

**Since this tradition started over 23 years ago, it has helped over 300,000 families.**

This year, the Annual Realtor’s Blanket Drive began on November 14 and will continue through December 21. Let’s all do our best to keep the homeless and working poor dry and warm this winter.

Our network of Realtors is gearing up for another productive year of collecting clothes and blankets. But this success depends on your donations.

**Blankets, winter clothes for people of all ages, hats, and gloves are all acceptable donations.** But of course, remember not to donate any used undergarments or socks.

[You can drop off your donations at your closest participating office. You can find that location here.](http://www.rebgv.org/blanket-drive-drop-locations-0)

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
