<p style="text-align: center;"><em>There are three specific reasons why so many people love calling Florida home that I’ll share with you today.</em></p>

Whether you want to make Florida your permanent home or you just want to visit for the winter, there are three reasons you’ll end up falling in love with it:

The first is our Florida lifestyle. Here, there’s truly something for everyone. You can enjoy a great day at the beach, play golf, or enjoy nature by doing some kayaking or paddle boarding. You can also enjoy all of our great restaurants—imagine being able to dine alfresco all year long.

The second reason is the weather. We have great weather year-round, so there’s something to enjoy outside all the time. Imagine wearing shorts in January. You might be saying right right now, “But Florida’s hot!” It is hot, but it’s hot almost everywhere during the summer, right? We get great ocean breezes that keep us comfortable. It’s hot a little longer during the year, but that’s okay—you can just jump into your pool and enjoy the heat.

The third reason is the money (now I’ve got your attention, right?). By this I mean we have lower taxes. The state of Florida doesn’t have an income tax. It’s actually quite affordable to live here, especially if you’re used to living in the Northeast, which places exceptionally high taxes on your property and your income.&nbsp;

By the way, Florida is the No. 1 location for international buyers. Roughly 19% of all international buyers have purchased a home in Florida.

Whether you’re looking for your winter home or your permanent home, we’re here to help you find the right lifestyle. If you have any questions for us or you want to get started on your home buying journey, give us a call or shoot us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
