Are you on track with the big goals you set at the beginning of the year?

Now that we’re into the second half of 2018, **it’s time to check in, reset, readjust, get real, and get right. **

Sometimes at the beginning of a year, we set a really big goal and aim high (as Gary Keller advises) so we have a better chance of hitting that goal. Did you aim so high that you need to adjust, come back to reality, and ensure you actually hit that goal, though?

If so, now’s the time to do it. Get with yourself, your coach, your team, or whoever’s holding you accountable and **make sure your actions and activities match your goal(s).** We’ve talked about the 15th protocol before, and if you’re off track with any of your goals, then you’re always in the 15th protocol. You don’t get to sit back and relax. If, for example, you’re off track with your “listing appointments taken” goal, then that’s all you should focus on right now. 

Everything I just said applies to my team as well. In fact, we just had a mid-year team meeting where we readjusted and reevaluated our GPS and our goals. Now it’s all hands on deck—we’re all focused on doing what we have to do to reach our goals. 

I’d love to know how you’re coming along with your goals, so if you have any questions or would like to talk more, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I look forward to speaking with you.
