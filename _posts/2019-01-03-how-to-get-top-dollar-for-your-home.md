Recently, I’ve seen a few homes that were in top condition to sell for the most money possible, so today I want to give you some pointers about how to get your home in that same, highly saleable condition:

1. **Make sure the outside of the house looks clean.** I recommend buying a home-washing kit; they’re available at most home department stores like Home Depot. With it, you can make sure that the exterior of your home is completely spotless, including your garage door, any stucco on your home, the window screens, and so on. You only get one chance to make a good first impression, and a clean-looking home is key to catching a buyer’s eye.
2. **The front door needs to look nice, clean, and inviting**. Aside from just cleaning that area, try buying a nice, new door mat and giving the front door a fresh coat of paint.
3. **Make sure to eliminate any odors.** If a potential buyer walks into your home to meet a wall of stink, they’ll probably be disgusted and think less of your listing. Start by cleaning the home, then add a room deodorizer to leave a pleasant scent. Use your air fresheners often.
4. **Pack up spare belongings and declutter.** If the house is cluttered when a buyer walks in, it’ll likely make them uncomfortable. Buyers are looking for a nice flow and a feeling of openness and welcoming. Pack up your sundry belongings to free up your space, and also be sure to organize your closets and drawers; if you think that buyers won’t look inside those, you’d be wrong.
5. **Make sure all minor repairs are done prior to putting the house on the market.** Whether it be a new coat of paint, fixing holes in the walls, or other small repair projects, buyers don’t want to have to add much to their mental list of things that will cost them money if they decide to buy your home.
6. **Rearrange the furniture.** You want your space to appear as open and comfortable as possible, so rearrange your furniture to give your home a nice flow such that it looks nice and allows for buyers to walk around your entire space.
7. **Make sure the inside of your house is spotless.** Scrub, scrub, scrub: Whatever you need to do, a sparkling clean home equals huge points in buyers’ eyes. They’ll look at things like dust on the ceiling fans down to the grime on your baseboards
8. **Depersonalize the bedrooms.** Take down photos and memorabilia that will detract from a buyer’s ability to imagine themselves living in your home. Additionally, if you have unique bed covers, it might be a good idea to swap those out with more of a neutral set. Add accent pillows to bring out the colors of your home.
9. **Clean up after your pets**. It drives me crazy when I’m walking a client through a house and they step in a landmine, so be sure to clean up any messes, toys, litter boxes, etc. before clients come to view your home. That also includes tackling pet-related odors.

If you want to get top dollar for your home, be sure to adhere to these tips—failing to properly prepare your property could cost you tens of thousands of dollars on your home sale.
