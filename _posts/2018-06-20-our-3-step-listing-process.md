When I train a new Home Selling Specialist on the process of working with a seller, we work through a three-step listing process. Today I would like to share this process with you.

**1. The Pre-Listing Package.**&nbsp;This package includes a seller questionnaire, a sample seller’s disclosure, and the assessor’s records for the home, which we ask the seller to go through. When they do, we ask them to write down any pertinent information, such as that about family, pets, neighborhood, and anything else that may be helpful to know. We also mark up any errors on the assessor’s records and use all of the information to help prepare their home for market.

**2. The “PCW.”&nbsp;**This is a Pre-Consultation Walkthrough. We take about 15 to 30 minutes to do a walkthrough of a home and have them explain the improvements that they have done. This gives us a chance to get to know exactly what they have in their home as opposed to just looking at the assessor’s records and MLS information.

**3. The “HSC.”**&nbsp;This is our Home Selling Consultation. We prefer to do our consultations in our office with a PowerPoint presentation. We even have a video you can watch that talks about our history and our branding testimonials from clients.

At the home selling consultation, we ask questions about the client’s needs and expectations. We also talk about our unique selling proposition and what we do to market homes differently. Finally, we talk about the valuation of their home and which strategy will help them successfully meet their goals.

We have found that this process shows professionalism as well as preparation. It helps get clients excited about making the large investment of hiring us as their seller.

If you have any questions about our process, please feel free to contact us. We would be happy to speak with you.
