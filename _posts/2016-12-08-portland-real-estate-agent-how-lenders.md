Today I’m here with Pete Wease, our preferred lender, to discuss job satisfaction on the lending side of things.

One of the best parts of Pete’s job is when a client gets to the closing table and signs the dotted line. “They’re smiling ear to ear,” Pete says. “That is the biggest sign of job satisfaction for me.” He knows that his clients are feeling a sense of pride and ownership when they close on their home.

Unfortunately, there are situations where a transaction shows signs of trouble. When it looks like a deal might fall apart, Pete just takes a step back, reflects, and communicates with the client to find a solution. “Any time we close a transaction, that’s a home run,” Pete says. “The bottom line is, I am here to help you close on your loan.”

There are times when a transaction may not be able to close. Pete says, “If I can’t help you now, I will help you in the future.” Pete believes that preparation and communication are crucial to making it to the closing table.
