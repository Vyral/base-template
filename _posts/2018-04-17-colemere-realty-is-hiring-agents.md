<center>*We’re looking to expand our team with highly motivated agents. Are you interested?*</center>

A lot of you may not have heard about who we are, but **Colemere Realty is the oldest real estate company in the Salt Lake Valley**.

Both Brian and I are third-generation Realtors. Our grandfather started Colemere Realty back in 1953, so **we’re excited to share our story of who we are and what exciting things we have to bring to the real estate industry**.

Even though we’re the oldest brokerage in the state, you may not have heard of us because we were heads-down, highly effective agents, working hard to produce for ourselves. Back in 2015, Brian and I purchased the business from our parents, who retired, and we realized that we had a great system and we wanted to bring that to other agents. We also wanted to shift and have a team focus **so that not only could Realtors produce at a super high level, but they could also have a life**.

We want to build an awesome team of highly motivated agents who are productive and have a team to back them up. **We’re looking for great agents** who want to be a part of a great culture with solid ethics founded in high levels of production, but who also want to build their own lives.

If you want to get something more out of your business and still have a life, please feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you.
