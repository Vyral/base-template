When interviewing agents before you list your home for sale, there are a few key questions you should ask. Doing so will make sure you end up working with someone you can trust to get you the best results possible.

First, ask the agent **how many sellers they successfully represented last year.** In this case, success means the agent actually got the seller to the closing table. The higher the number of sellers the agent has successfully represented, the more experienced they will be in helping you with your listing.

Another question you should be asking is **whether the agent has a dedicated team or assistant.** To give top notch results, agents need a support system. One person can’t do everything themselves. For example, our team has transaction coordinators, client care coordinators, and other professionals who are all trained to make sure a client gets the best service possible.

A home is the biggest financial investment you will likely ever make, so you want to make sure your needs are going to be taken care of to the highest level.

The third, and probably most important, question, is **whether the agent hires a professional photographer.&nbsp;**Photographs of your home are the very first impression that buyers get, since most people search first online. Don’t accept anything less than professional photography. It is going to make a world of difference in getting buyers in your door and eventually to the closing table.

Finally, ask how many repeat clients and referrals an agent gets. When a high number of past clients are generating new referrals, this means they likely had a very positive experience with the agent.
