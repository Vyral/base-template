Today we’re going to be talking about what’s been going on in the Wasatch Front market since this time last year. **There’s been a lot of changes, and a lot of positive changes at that.**

The first thing we want to mention is the days on market, a measurement of how long it takes a home to sell. Last year at this time, it was around 30 days. Since then, we’ve seen a 48% drop and the average now sits at 20 days. **Homes that are priced right for their condition are continuing to sell extremely fast.**

The number of home sales has dropped a little bit from last year, by about 6%. However, inventory has dropped as well, by almost 8%. **Even though sales are down, inventory is down even lower.** That’s causing homes to continue to increase in price while selling quickly.

Finally, we wanted to mention appreciation, or median sales price. We went from $233,000 last year to $250,000 this year, a 6% jump.

There you have it. **As you can see, we’re in a great market for buyers or sellers right now.** The big question in the industry is whether or not we are in a bubble. There’s currently a debate going on and there’s a pretty good argument that in the future, a shift will take place in the market. **However, we don’t see anything happening this year, as there’s still a lot of growth taking place right now in the Wasatch Front.**

If you have any questions for us, or you’re thinking about buying or selling, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you!
