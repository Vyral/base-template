You’re probably aware of the commission you pay an agent during a home sale, but are you aware of what the commission gets you? Here are four things to keep in mind when you hire us for your real estate needs:

**1\. Real estate agents are marketing specialists.** We specialize in marketing your property and getting it seen by the most buyers possible. We put it in the MLS, take professional pictures of your home, send out mailers and ads, create emails, call potential buyers, and much more. There’s a lot that goes into getting your home prepared, and agents handle all of it for you.

<br>**2\. Agents bring qualified buyers to your home.** When we consult a buyer, we go over their wants and needs in order to find out your home is the right fit for them. We also make sure they’ve spoken with a lender already. We handle showings, scheduling, and appointments on your time.

<br>**3\. Agents are expert negotiators.** There is a lot of skill involved in negotiating the purchase price, terms, and the contract. We don’t only negotiate with buyers—we deal with appraisers, inspectors, attorneys, and title companies as well.

<br>**4\. Agents understand contracts.** Contracts have a lot of legal writing, and many things may be unclear. We’re here to clarify everything and ensure that important dates are met. Though we’re not allowed to give legal advice, we do make sure that contracts are written correctly.

Research shows that homes sold by the owner typically stay on the market longer and sell for less. If you’d like to ensure a quick sale that nets you top dollar, it’s in your best interest to use an agent’s expertise. Whether you’re buying, selling, or looking for more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
