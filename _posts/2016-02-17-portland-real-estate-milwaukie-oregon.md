Today we are excited to give you a tour of one of our favorite areas in Portland, Milwaukie. Milwaukie offers a small-town charm, but is just a few minutes away from downtown. It was recently voted one of the top 50 places in the country to raise a family. Milwaukie is close to the river, and there are over 100 parks in the area, offering great hiking, backpacking, and cycling options. Today we are going to highlight some of the great things about Milwaukie, from the food to the real estate. Let’s get started.

Bob’s Red Mill Natural Foods was started by local resident Bob Moore, who founded the company in 1978. Today, they produce over 400 different products and are known as the leaders for grain production in the United States.

Another great local spot is Wine:30 wine bar. It’s a great, cozy neighborhood bar, with an open-air atmosphere and complete with comfy furniture. They have a great patio area, which is built on top of a few parking spots in the street. They offer local music throughout the week and a daily happy hour from 4-6 p.m.

Milwaukie is also home to one of the largest farmers’ markets in Portland. You’ll find over 75 local vendors with organic meats, produce, baked goods, garden crafts, and more. There are also local artists there every Sunday.

 Milwaukie’s Riverfront Park is an 8.5 acre park spanning along the Willamette River. It was recently renovated to include a new boat launch, parking, restrooms, a public lawn, and a riverside path.

 The orange light rail system connects Milwaukie to the city of Portland and travels across the Tilikum Crossing Bridge, which you usually don’t get to go through in a car.

 If you have any questions for us about this area, or anything else real estate related, we would love to hear from you. Give us a call or send us an email today!
