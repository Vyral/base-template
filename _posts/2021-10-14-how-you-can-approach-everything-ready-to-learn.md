We’re right in the middle of our “six personal perspectives” series. We believe that these six practices are the key to our success. This week we’re on No. 4, so without further ado:

**Be learning-based.**

A learning-based individual is someone who has made the decision to constantly try and acquire knowledge so that they can achieve better outcomes. This can be done in business, athletics, in your relationships, and really any other area.&nbsp;

**Being learning-based means coming from the place where you realize that you don’t know everything** and that there is still more to learn for you to get to that next level. Think about what you can do this week to level up in your knowledge base and learning practices.

If you have questions about how to do this or anything else related to real estate, feel free to give us a call. We’d love to hear from you.
