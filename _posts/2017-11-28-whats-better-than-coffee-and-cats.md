Today I’m visiting Tinker’s Cat Cafe, which just opened last week. Let’s take a look.

Today I’m visiting Tinker’s Cat Cafe, which just opened last week.

**The cafe has coffee, tea, cat-themed treats, and, of course, feline friends to keep you company during your visit.**

The walls were covered in places for them to climb and the floors had plenty of comfy beds and rugs for the cats to relax in while we humans enjoy our food and drink.

Whether you want to snuggle and play with the cats or simply watch them explore, Tinker’s is so much fun.

The best part is that each and every cat at Tinker’s is up for adoption. **When you visit, you could be leaving with a new friend.**

Even if you don’t plan to adopt, though, you can still enjoy the therapeutic benefits of spending time with these sweet felines.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
