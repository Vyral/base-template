If you need to find a good mortgage lender, it’s always a good idea to have your Realtor help you. **If you have a good Realtor, they’ll be surrounded by good lenders.&nbsp;**

We know the good, the bad, and the ugly when it comes to mortgage lenders. We personally like to use local lenders. Internet lenders spend a lot of money on marketing, but their processing typically isn’t as good. Also, they’re not sitting at a desk somewhere in case you want to talk to them because they left your file sitting somewhere, and you’re ready to close two weeks from now and they haven’t even ordered the appraisal yet.

**Local lenders are well established, and I have a list of my favorites which you can visit under the ‘Becky’s Favorites’ tab on <u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.beckyivins.com/">my website.</a></u>** Nobody buys their way onto that website, by the way. You have to have done business with me for a very long time and established yourself as a good lender.&nbsp;

We have three lenders in particular whom we rely on locally to take care of our clients. What makes them good? They get the loans closed. I find it incredible that so many lenders spend time getting someone qualified, and then a week before closing, they suddenly don’t qualify. That’s something my lenders would’ve told me about the first day they sat down with that client. That way, we could wait to show them homes until we did get them qualified.&nbsp;

If you’ve got a good Realtor, they’ll know the good lenders. If you have any questions about this topic or you’re looking to buy or sell a home in our Oklahoma City market, don’t hesitate to give me a call or email me. I’d be glad to help you.
