With buyer and seller activity still strong, the Boise market continues to be hot. It’s truly an exciting time to be in real estate.

Many people are taking these current circumstances as a chance to make a transition. But with that being the case, some homeowners are unsure of how to proceed. This is because whenever a person needs to buy and sell simultaneously, the same question inevitably arises: “Which should I do first?”

The truth is that there’s no one correct answer. It all comes down to personal circumstances. But **one option I’ve seen work well for several people is to convert your current home into a rental property.** Part of the reason people are so successful with this option is that it allows you to generate positive cash flow.

When you rent out your old property after moving to a new home, you’ve essentially got someone else paying for your mortgage. And any extra money you earn beyond the funds allocated to your mortgage can be applied toward whatever you wish.

**Another benefit of converting your property into a rental is that doing so allows you to keep your investment as it grows in value.** With homes currently appreciating at record rates, this makes for a great move.
