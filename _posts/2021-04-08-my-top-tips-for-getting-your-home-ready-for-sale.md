If you’re getting ready to sell in this hot market, there are three things you absolutely need to do to increase your chances of selling quickly and for top dollar:

**1\. Cleaning is critical.** You have to have a clean home. The most important rooms to have clean are the kitchen and bathrooms. The home needs to look clean, smell clean, and be attractive to buyers who walk through the home with a discerning eye.

**2\. Declutter and clear.** Get rid of all your personal items around the house and put them in storage. You’re moving anyway, so this will help you get a jump on that.

**3\. Don’t wait for paint.** I recommend painting your home in a neutral color. Alabaster white from Sherwin Williams is a great tone that will appeal to a wide range of homebuyers. A fresh coat of paint in the home isn’t super expensive, but it can have a huge impact on buyers’ perception of your property.

If you have any questions for me about selling your home or the real estate market in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
