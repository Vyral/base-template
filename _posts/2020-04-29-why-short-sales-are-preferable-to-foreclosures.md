<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s why homeowners are better off doing a short sale instead of a foreclosure.</em></p>

How can a short sale help you avoid foreclosure?

A short sale is a process where the bank allows the homeowner to pay less than their current mortgage to sell their home. This benefits both sides: The bank saves money on legal fees and the homeowner doesn’t have to go through foreclosure.

**Opting for a short sale and avoiding foreclosure carries three big advantages:**

**1\. You won’t have a foreclosure on your record for seven years.** The only thing that will show up on your credit is an account settled for less.&nbsp;

**2\. Your credit recovers much faster.** With a year or so of good payment history, you’ll be able to attain your previous credit score.&nbsp;

**3\. The bank provides relocation assistance.** They like short sales, and they’ll encourage you to go through with them. They’ll offer you $3,000 to $10,000 just to relocate and sell your property before it enters foreclosure.&nbsp;

That being said, a short sale is a complicated process involving many loopholes you need to be aware of to do it successfully. If you’re facing foreclosure or know someone who could benefit from a short sale, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m here to help.&nbsp;
