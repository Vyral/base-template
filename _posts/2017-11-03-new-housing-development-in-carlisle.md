You may have noticed, there are fewer homes available on the market this year compared to last year, and buyer demand is still very strong.&nbsp;

As a result, new construction housing is beginning to accelerate. If you are unable to find an existing home, new construction may be an option.&nbsp;

I was recently featured in an article by the Central Penn Business Journal that explores new housing developments in the Carlisle area. **You can find the article [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/Andrew+Kronenberg+/Westward+Homes+Final.pdf).**

Cumberland Valley School District boasts some of the highest home prices in the county, causing buyers to look elsewhere. Large-scale projects in areas like Silver Spring and Hampden are also winding down. Land in those municipalities are at a premium. Developers and builders are finding opportunities in the greater Carlisle area.

New construction properties won’t satisfy all of the housing demand that we’re seeing right now, but it will provide new options for frustrated homebuyers.&nbsp;

Builders who historically haven’t explored Carlisle are now looking at the area to find projects, potentially helping boost our inventory over the next few years.&nbsp;

In fact, I am currently working on a residential subdivision off Meeting House Road in Carlisle to develop 18 single-family lots. These 18 lots will be available for construction in early 2018.&nbsp;

If you have any questions or are interested in a new construction property, just give me a call at (717) 609-8265 or &nbsp;email me at AndrewK@HHandE.com. I would be happy to help you.&nbsp;
