What can you do to prepare your home for a great open house? Today, I have four steps that you can follow to ensure that your home presents in optimal condition for sale.

**1. Depersonalize your home.** It’s great that you’re really political and passionate about a particular candidate, but when it comes to showing your home, it’s a good idea to remove paraphernalia that’s politically or religiously charged. Similarly, take down your family photos so that your viewers can imagine themselves living there. You don’t want to turn away potential clients because they’re turned off by your personal beliefs.

**2. Declutter.&nbsp;**Put away your excess collectibles, artwork, decorations, and personal effects. You don’t want people to associate you with any kind of clutter; it might send the message that you haven’t been taking care of the home.

**3. Make a good first impression.** Clean up your yard and make it look ready for spring.

**4. Be careful of what you leave out in your home.&nbsp;**Err on the side of caution and put away your valuables and anything that has your personal information on it.
