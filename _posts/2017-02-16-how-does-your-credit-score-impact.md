A credit score needs to be high enough to qualify for the loan program they are trying to get approved for.   So can you buy a home in Portland with a low credit score? The answer is yes.   From about 2000 to 2007, basically all you would need to do to get a stated income loan was tell your lender what you made without having to prove it and they wouldnt do a credit check. Luckily, those are no longer available. **People now have to be qualified for a home, and credit scores are key in getting that done.**<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span id="docs-internal-guid-e24f7f6c-17d3-44b6-3720-da8f83b6aa58">

If your score is low, he will help you figure out a strategy to bring it up and in turn get you a better interest rate. To reach Pete, you can call (503-267-6391) or email him at [petew@fairwaymc.com](mailto:petew@fairwaymc.com).   **There are so many different loan programs that you can take advantage of as well.** There are low money down programs, some grant programs with no money down, and conventional loans with still historically low interest rates.   Your credit score plays a huge role in if and how you qualify for those loan programs, and Pete and I want to make sure we can get you prepared to take action in the spring market.   If you have any other questions please feel free to call me or send me a quick email.
