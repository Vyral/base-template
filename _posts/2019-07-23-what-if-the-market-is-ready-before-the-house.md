There are two moments in the home selling process when a seller has the best chance of adding value to their property. The first is when they’re preparing the property and the second is when the listing goes live on the MLS (the multiple listing service).&nbsp;

**But what if you were to (temporarily) skip this first step?** Sometimes, if the market is “ready” before the home is, opening your home up for showings as soon as possible is best. Of course, I don’t mean that you should simply stick a sign in the yard and hope for a sale. I simply mean that if you have the opportunity to sell before you’ve staged and given the home a fresh coat of paint, why not go for it?

I recently worked with a client in my own neighborhood who followed such a strategy. Despite what one of my fellow agents believed would be the case, my client was able to secure a contingency-free offer at a very high price.&nbsp;

This isn’t the right route for everyone, but it’s certainly a viable option for some. So if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
