Today’s message is directed toward those thinking of buying their first home—often referred to as a “starter home.” We’ll address whether you should go through with that purchase or skip it and buy your forever home right away, instead.&nbsp;

If you’re already out house-hunting, you might be fixated on that four-bedroom, colonial-style home with a beautifully glistening pool in the backyard. But let’s think for a second: Sure, the idea of planting some permanent roots and settling into a forever home sounds good, but your lifestyle (and bank account) may beg to differ. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

When you begin thinking it through, the first question to ask yourself is, **“Can I afford a forever home?**” It’s important to take an honest look at your financial situation and consider whether you’re willing to give up some simple pleasures, like your weekend brunches, in order to finance such a major purchase.

Next, **consider whether you’re settled down enough to invest in your forever home.** If you’re fairly new to your job, you have plans to move in a few years, or you’ve yet to start a family, you’ll need to seriously assess if putting down your roots is a sound decision.&nbsp;

**You also need to think about whether you know what you want in a home.** Without having owned your own home before, it’s likely that your ideas about what you want may not hold true when put into practice.&nbsp;

Further to that, your preferences may change over time with regard to your home and its surroundings. After a few years, you might decide you’d rather live somewhere with a community pool or on an acreage without any neighbors nearby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Whether you opt to move into a starter or into your forever home right away, though, you’ll be able to enjoy the benefits of homeownership, either way.&nbsp; **When you make that first-time purchase, your days of worrying about the struggles of renting are over.** You’ll no longer have to move from one complex to the next due to rising rates, and you’ll be able to start growing equity and making memories in a home.&nbsp;

On top of that, **homeownership offers the luxury of being able to decorate however you see fit and make upgrades to your heart’s content.** &nbsp;&nbsp;
