There seems to be a lot of misinformation out there when it comes to buying a home with low credit. A lot of people who comes to us and tell us they have bad credit are all but certain they won’t qualify for a loan. However, as our friend JJ Mazzo of Summit Funding puts it, there are types of loan programs out there for every kind of buyer, even one with a low credit score.

<br>**JJ can get you a loan with a score as low as 550.** However, he can also get you connected with a credit repair company to help you raise your score. The higher your score, the better rate and better loan terms you’ll be able to qualify for.

<br>What if your spouse has a low score? That could be a problem, depending on the type of loan you’re trying to get. Both spouse’s incomes aren’t always needed. If they only need the higher of the two scores to qualify, we’ll just take the higher score. However, there are some loans out there that require us to take the lower of the two scores. If you have a score of 750 but your spouse has a score of 550, we’ll have to take the 550.

<br>Does pulling your credit make a difference to your score? Yes and no. When a lender like JJ pulls your credit, it’s called a “hard pull.” A hard pull may affect your credit score for a temporary period of time. However, you can do what’s called a “soft pull” on your own. That’s where you go to one of the three major credit bureaus and have your score pulled. You can do this for free once per year with each of the bureaus. **If you do plan on buying a home, a hard pull is worth it to get a better picture of your affordability.**
