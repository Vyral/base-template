Here are five tips you as a pet owner should heed during your home search to ensure that your new home works out for both you and your pet.

**1. Make sure you know the laws.&nbsp;**Pet restrictions are town-wide, and zoning restrictions need to be looked at because each zone in each town has different requirements and regulations. For example, the town I live in doesn’t allow chickens in certain areas of it. You may not consider a chicken a pet, but a lot of people have them, and they’re considered a domestic pet in certain towns and locations.

**2. Understand your yard use and fencing ability.** If you’re buying in a single-family home area or a condo area, there will be different regulations concerning what you can do with your yard. Even with single-family homes, you need to make sure you understand where you can put a fence and how you can construct that fence. With condos and duplexes, you may not have the ability to put up a fence, or if you do, you might only be in a certain area.

**3. Choose the right location.** Obviously, neighborhoods with sidewalks are very desirable for pet owners. Living next to a busy road with a pet who needs to go out a lot, however, can be difficult and potentially dangerous for that pet. Living by a forest or a natural habitat can also be dangerous if you own a smaller pet because wild animals may live in close proximity.

**4. Make sure your house has a pet-friendly floor plan.** Condos and townhomes can have smaller, tighter floor plans, which can be inconvenient if you have a large pet. Even floor plans for single-family homes can be tight for larger animals. Your pet should have enough room to move around, and you shouldn’t have to worry about tripping over them.

**5. Ask yourself if your pet can handle your home’s stairs,** especially if your pet is older or doesn’t have healthy legs. If you buy a home that has a drive-under garage that forces you to walk up a flight of stairs just to get to the first floor, that might be difficult for your pet.
