We’re heading into fall, and whether you plan to buy or sell a home in our seasonal market, there are a few points you’ll want to know first.

If you’re looking to sell this fall, you’ll be pleased to know that **inventory is still low, but don’t let that keep you from staying on top of your home’s curb appeal.** That means rounding up the leaves in your yard, maintaining your lawn’s appearance, and embracing the season by putting up your seasonal decor. Why not take advantage of all the pleasant aromas associated with fall?

Conversely, if you’re looking to buy this season, **you can benefit tremendously from our still-low interest rates and some newly introduced loan products.** Make the most of our market by getting with your mortgage professional to explore your options.&nbsp;

All in all, a ton of homes are currently coming on the market and a ton of eager buyers are out searching for the one they want every day.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about the opportunities that await you in our fall market or about anything else real estate-related, please don’t hesitate to contact us. We’ll be happy to help\!
