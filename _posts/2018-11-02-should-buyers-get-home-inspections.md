Should homebuyers in our market be getting a home inspection?

The answer is simple: **Yes, they should**. Allow me to tie in a personal experience from years ago to explain:<br><br>When I bought the home I currently live in a while back, I purchased it as-is, which is to say, I bought in the condition it was listed in. There was no inspection done to get the seller to make certain repairs on anything before we closed.

Within two weeks of moving into the home with my newborn child, the gas stove began giving off the error code F01. I came to find out that that particular code meant that **the stove was emitting carbon monoxide**. Similarly, the pool pump was in poor shape.

**If I would have gotten a home inspection, those issues would have been discovered before I purchased the house.**

When you’re buying a new home, even if you’re purchasing it as-is and the seller doesn’t intend to make any repairs, should you still get a home inspection? The answer is still yes. You need to know what it is you’re buying so that you can be sure the home will be safe for you, your family, and any guests you have over.

If you have any questions about home inspections or other real estate topics, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to speak with you.
