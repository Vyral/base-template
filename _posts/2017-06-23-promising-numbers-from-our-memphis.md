How do the numbers from our current market compare to where we were at this time last year?

**The number of units sold has risen 9% from 1,625 to 1,771, which is good.** Home values have been increasing year by year in the Memphis area as a whole, and the median sale price is up to $165,000. The number of home sales above $500,000 has increased 32%.

On a related note, I’d like to remind you that we’re donating the commission of our 100th home sale to a local charity, and you have the opportunity to vote on this website for who wins. The candidates are HopeWorks, Youth Villages, and the Bartlett Animal Shelter.

If you have any questions about our market, you’d like to know what your home is worth, or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to assist you.
