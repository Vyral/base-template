Today, I’d like to share some information about an organization I truly believe in: the Genesis Dream Foundation.

I’m joined by special guests Linda Olson, who helps support the foundation by helping our second guest, Connie Magruder record her story. Connie is currently writing a powerful book about her experiences. I was also joined by one of the foundation’s newest board members, Jessica.

**The Genesis Dream Foundation is a non-profit organization that helps and advocates for orphaned and abandoned children in Tijuana, Mexico.** A major goal of the foundation is to build a home that will shelter approximately 100 children. Tijuana has an extraordinary number of children in immediate need of shelter.

**There are a number of children living in the streets of Tijuana who have been exposed to abuse, neglect, trafficking, and extreme hunger.**

Currently, the foundation is sponsoring a home with about 20 children from the ages of two to 17.

This is an incredibly important cause. The work my three guests do to better the lives of children in need is absolutely touching. But, they can’t do it alone. If you would like to get involved, I would encourage you to visit the Genesis Dream Foundation’s website at <a href="www.GenesisDream.org"target="_blank">www.GenesisDream.org</a>

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
