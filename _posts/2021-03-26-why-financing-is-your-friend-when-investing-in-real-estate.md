One of the secrets to successfully investing in real estate is to never pay cash for a property. Always use leverage and financing. I was recently a guest on a podcast where this topic came up, so I wanted to share my thoughts with you today.

You don’t have to use your own money—use leverage. **I would never advise anybody to buy with cash.&nbsp;**

Let’s say you and I invest in real estate and we each have $100,000 cash. You buy one property in cash and rent it out to tenants. I take the $100,000 and put a $25,000 down payment on four different properties, then rent them all out to tenants.&nbsp;

In 20 years, the value of all these properties will easily double. While your property is worth $200,000, my four properties are worth $800,000, and the tenants have been paying off my mortgages the entire time. **I made four times the money by spreading the risk four different ways.** Even if you have the cash, don’t buy real estate at full price. Go get financing instead.

If you have any questions for me about investing in real estate, buying/selling, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I look forward to hearing from you.
