Abby Realty is the fastest-growing real estate brokerage here in the Houston metro area. Because we’re so new, many of you might not have heard of us before. I’m Frank Gray, and today, I want to explain where we came from, where we’re at, and where we’re going.

I spent over 20 years in the real estate industry with a large Houston area home builder and then an internationally recognized franchise organization as a business coach and consultant. On November 15, 2017, myself and four courageous agents left to form Abby Realty.

**Since then, we have continued to grow at the rate of two to three agents a week.** Here we are in mid-February with 30+ agents, but we are in a race to get to 100 as soon as we can.

Why? Once we reach 100 agents, we’re going to get our first brick-and-mortar office so that we have a place to land whenever we need to. Right now, we are utilizing the brick-and-mortar spaces of our mortgage and title partners.

We do offer a live family reunion training event every Monday at 10 a.m. at our mortgage partner, SWBC Mortgage. You are welcome to join us at 26503 Oakridge Drive. This training is a great opportunity to test-drive the type of culture we’re building at Abby Realty.

In case you haven’t heard, it’s a productivity culture, where we help agents achieve their aspirations, and a camaraderie culture, where we know, like, and support each other along the journey.

As of January 30, we had 25 agents. **Our goal is to be at 50 agents by April 30.** As a way of saying thank you to the agents who are coming along in these early days of Abby Realty, all agents who join us in that 90-day period are eligible for a drawing. The winner will get a cruise for two, anywhere you want to go, up to a $2,000 value.

Also, whoever referred that winning agent to Abby Realty will also get a cruise for two up to a $2,000 value! Whether you are a mortgage professional, title professional, or client who knows a great agent, send them our way for a chance to win.

Obviously, you’re not going to join a real estate company just because of the chance to win a cruise. This is just my way of sharing the excitement of what we’re doing at Abby Realty.

You’re probably wondering about our compensation plan. It’s very simple: Our agents get a 90/10 split that caps at $10,000, and there’s a $100 transaction fee. That’s it. There’s no monthly fees, annual dues, or hidden charges. I even pay for CSS and BackAgent.

**My intent is to make Abby Realty a company where agents can join without the fear of high monthly fees.** When you do have a closing, you get to keep the bulk of your commission (90%).

If you are at all intrigued by our company, just give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
