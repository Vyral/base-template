Jennie caught up with Lauren Corbitt with the Juneteenth Inc. to hear all about this years festival.

The Tulsa Juneteenth Festival held June 15th-17th, is a community funded festival, created, supported and operated by Tulsa Juneteenth Inc. and the Tulsa community.

Located at 700 North Greenwood Ave on the OSU lawn, this family friendly event is free to enter and offers attraction that will appeal to the entire family!

In addition to the weekend long festivities, there will also be a 5K and family fun run on Saturday, June 16th.

Juneteenth (short for â€œJune Nineteenth) marks the day when federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas in 1865 to take control of the state and ensure that all enslaved people be freed. Juneteenth honors the end to slavery in the United States and is considered the longest running African American holiday.
