&nbsp;

Here are three important tips to keep in mind about negotiating your next home sale:

**1\. Move out of your home emotionally once it hits the market**. By that, I mean you need to reserve your opinions and personal feelings about the property, including the memories you’ve made and shared there. If your goal is to maximize the amount of money you receive from the sale, think about your home as an asset and try not to get easily offended by an offer you don’t like.

**2\. Learn as much as you can about the buyer**. This will allow you to understand their motivations and why this purchase is important to them. If the buyer’s offer isn’t acceptable, you may be able to send a counteroffer back to them, possibly allowing you to get additional net proceeds on your bottom line. Further, you might not know what that buyer’s highest and best offer looks like; typically, the first offer isn’t the highest and best.

**3\. Take all offers seriously**. Whenever an offer comes in, you need to respond to it. Each offer will be considered on a case-by-case basis, but each should be taken seriously and given a response.
