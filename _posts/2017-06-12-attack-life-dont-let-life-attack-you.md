How many times have you felt like life is choking you out? Maybe your health isn't where it should be, your wealth isn't where it should be, and life feels like it's just sitting on top of you suffocating you?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>**We encourage you to stick with it, be persistent and patient, and before you know it, you'll have a reversal and a breakthrough.** Life's a grind and it can be a battle, but we're here to tell you to keep grinding it out and to attack life—don't let life attack you!
<br>&nbsp;
<br>**Our big tip is to find a morning routine.** I start my day with a jog and then sit in the sauna. I also read and meditate as well. That's when I have the most energy and confidence to attack the day, and those small victories in the morning will set the tone for the day. Don't just roll out of bed! Spend half an hour or an hour before work to invest in your mind and body to start your day right.

Another idea we like is starting the day by writing your goals each morning. Write the exact same thing over and over because if you're having a bad day, it will remind you of why you do what you do. It will keep you motivated and pushing forward, because like it or not, life happens.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Before you know it, you'll hit that breakthrough and get to the next level you're trying to accomplish in life. Accumulate health in your life so you're not suffocating for it.
