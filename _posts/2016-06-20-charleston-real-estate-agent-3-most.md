Today I'm happy to be joined by Tommy Welch of <a href="http://www.1stclasscharleston.com/" target="_blank">**1st Class Painting & Restoration**</a> to talk about the top three things you can do to get the most value for your home.

 It's a great question, Tommy said, and provided a contractor's perspective. First and foremost, (and yes, Tommy says he's a bit biased) you've got to **make sure your paint is solid and neutral.** He loves a good hot pink or your daughter's bright blue bathroom, but not when you're selling your home. It's not just important to be neutral, it's important that the quality of the work is good, so hire a professional.

 Secondly, Tommy said, know that **buyers go straight to kitchens and bathrooms** when they view a house. You want the kitchen to be functional, clean, and open. If your flooring is up to date, you're probably ahead of the curve. Take a few minutes and take a non-biased look at your kitchen and bathrooms to look for what stands out as needing to be fixed or updated.

 Lastly, don't forget the outdoors. We live here in Charleston so we can spend 365 days a year outside, so spruce up your yard. Keep the lawn cut, get rid of overgrowth, and make sure fences and decks are properly sealed, clean, and safe. **You want people viewing your home to walk outside and think "Wow! I can hang out here!"**

 All these things aren't just cost-effective, they're game-changers when it comes to listing your house and making a move. Tommy would love to come out and give you a totally free estimate on any of these things.
