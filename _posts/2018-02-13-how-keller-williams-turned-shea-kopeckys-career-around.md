When Shea Kopecky chose Keller Williams **when he first got into real estate, he didn’t have much of an idea of what to do.** His father had been in the real estate industry for a long time and had talked to him about working in real estate so that he could help him with some of his land and commercial deals.

“I went to work with a small broker for, legitimately, six days,” he says. “They told me nothing; they just sat me down and gave me some paperwork to fill out, gave me some fees that I was supposed to pay, and that’s about it.”

He worked there full-time while his wife stayed at home, taking care of his two children. From there, **he went online and searched for the No. 1 real estate company in the United States for new agents.**

“Keller Williams popped up, so I looked up KW and Utah on the maps and pulled up the South Ogden location. I called them up and told them that I was an agent trying to move. We met with the team lead and they got me in from that day.”

He had no idea what to do beyond cold calling, door knocking, and marketing himself. He didn’t know about the systems or what one is supposed to say and expect.

“This was the first thing I expressed to them,” Shea says. “I didn’t have the funds to be able to go into all these classes at first. They gave me the chance to get into a class called BOLD, an eight-week course that teaches you to get down and dirty, to do everything that you’re supposed to do to create your business.”

From then on, **KW helped him grow no matter what.** He knew right off the bat that he didn’t like paperwork, so he hired a transaction coordinator. From there, his goal was to be present in other states. Then the expansion team came up; KW was one of the only brokerages who were doing that.<br><br>“The whole point of KW is to show agents that real estate doesn’t have to be a self-employed business anymore. KW gives you tools, free trainings, mastermind events, and support.”<br><br>**Shea learned that instead of always needing his broker to be nearby to answer questions, he could simply walk next door and ask a fellow agent.** “They’re more than willing to help you,” he says.

The biggest reason that Shea chose KW was that his goals were to dream big, to get to the biggest point he can. “I know that they are the ones who have shown and proven that you can do it, and they helped me do it.”

What sets Shea apart as an agent now?<br><br>“I’ve created a team with multiple people who are able to help you no matter what. You don’t have an obligation to call just one person. All of my team is going to be communicating with you, making sure that the whole process is smooth. I also have knowledge of commercial, land development, industrial, and residential. We can help you with anything.”

Shea still has friends in other brokerages, so he hears about the problems they face.<br><br>“The biggest thing that they’re probably afraid of is change. They’re top-producing agents who have created a business at their brokerage; having to move everything they’ve created scares them, I think,” he says of these other agents outside of KW.<br><br>**KW gives you the tools to get ahead of the market and change when it changes.&nbsp;**Quarterly market reports and statistics give the agents the ability to gauge how best to serve their clients in the current market.<br><br>“Our goal is to give what knowledge we have to our clients so that they can make the best decision for themselves,” says Shea.
