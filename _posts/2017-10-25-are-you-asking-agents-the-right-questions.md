Today I’d like to go over the five things you need to ask when interviewing a potential listing agent.

1. How long have they been in business?
2. What experience do they have in your neighborhood?
3. How are they going to price your home?
4. What is their marketing strategy?
5. Do they have a team? If they’re an individual agent, how will they cover all the tasks?

Selling homes is a complex job. **This is one instance where numbers really do matter.**

The following example is one way I like to explain what I mean by this.

Imagine that you needed to get your appendix out. Who would you trust? Would you trust a surgeon who successfully performed 150 appendectomies a year? Or, would you trust a surgeon who only did one or two per year?

The answer is obvious, and this is the same way you should approach your real estate needs. **Someone like myself who sells 150 homes per year and other agents who sell far less may have close to the same commission rate.** So, the only real way to determine which agent will provide you with the best service is by asking key questions.

An agent should be able to show you their experience and results. You need proof of their success and references to confirm their claims.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
