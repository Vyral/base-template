I would like to invite you the Limbird Real Estate Group’s kickoff party.

But the party isn’t for Limbird Real Estate Group, though—it’s for Kiss A Pig.<br><br>**The Kiss A Pig Gala is the biggest charity event in Arkansas and helps the American Diabetes Association.**

I’m going to be a candidate helping to raise money and awareness for diabetes from now until March 10th.

Diabetes affects almost 30 million people in our country, so we need your help and your support.

The American Diabetes Association Kiss A Pig Gala will be held **Thursday, October 19th, from 5 to 7 p.m. at Landers Toyota in Rogers, Arkansas.**

I have never done anything like this before, and I’m so out of my element, but I really need your support.

Bring a friend with you and show us some love and support. We really appreciate it.

We’ll have drinks, hors d’oeuvres, and door prizes. It’s sure to be a lot of fun!

Hope to see you October 19th!
