Here are the top four reasons why fall is a great time to list your home:

**1. There’s a more serious buyer pool**. The spring housing market is sure to bring out plenty of buyers, but a lot of them may hold off on making an offer. With more homes to choose from, they can afford to be picky and extend their search for months. Come September, those same buyers will feel the pressure to move into their new home before the holidays start or the weather takes a turn for the worse.

That’s where you come in. To prepare your house for the market during the fall, amp up the curb appeal–fix up the front porch, rake the leaves, and clean the gutters. If everything’s well-maintained, your home will be ready when the buyers are.

**2. There’s less competition**. Fall buyers not only have the stress of the holidays looming over their heads, but their options are also shrinking. Since many sellers rush to close by September, you’ll be competing in a much smaller market. That could be a very powerful bargaining chip to help you close by the end of the year.

Fall and winter photos run the risk of making your home look a little drab, so take some bright, clean photos of it during the summer and use those to showcase it. That will really make it stand out to serious buyers.

**3. There are different buyer demographics**. While families are more likely to make their move during the spring, millennials and empty-nesters are more likely to make a decision later in the year in order to avoid the higher level of competition and the higher real estate grades. Employers who have to relocate their employees out of state also typically wait until fall to do so. When the market cools down, these out-of-towners will probably need to get through the buying process as quickly as possible, which can mean a speedy sale for you.

To prepare for this demographic, it’s important to stage your home. For example, empty-nesters aren’t looking for 3-bedroom homes, so if your home has three bedrooms, try converting one of them into an exercise room or a work space. Millennial couples, on the other had, might want a nursery or a space for their future baby. Let each buyer see how your home fits their needs.

**4. There’s more flexibility for improvements**. Depending on where you live, spring and summer can be a much-needed break from a harsh winter, and your home could potentially use some TLC. Use those warmer months to make some improvements.

You can schedule these improvements in between weekend getaways. Small renovations done from time to time can really cut down on the effort required to get your house ready. Before the winter months hit and the temperature drops drastically, it may be a good idea to get your HVAC unit checked.
