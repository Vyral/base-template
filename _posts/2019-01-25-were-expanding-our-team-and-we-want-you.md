As our goal for 2019 is to achieve a 50% growth in our business, **we need to find some great, motivated agents and staff to help bolster our ranks.**

Agents have reached out to us, speaking of how they were unable to reach their goals in 2018. No matter how experienced in real estate you are, you can always use a helping hand. We’d like to offer one to you through a variety of new positions we have open.

We’re looking for:

* **A listing agent.** The listing agent’s primary role is to go out into the market and meet with sellers.
* **A licensed closing coordinator.** The closing coordinator helps agents from contract to close. We prefer our coordinators to be licensed so they can help with repair negotiations, post-occupancy agreements, and more.
* **Four inside sales staff.** In this new role that we’re currently developing, we’re looking to coach four individuals into becoming professional sales consultants who can help to further grow our business.
* **A director of lead generation.** We’re looking for someone to replace me in this role so I can better focus on coaching the new department.

If you or anyone you know would be interested in any of these positions, feel free to reach out to us to learn more. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
