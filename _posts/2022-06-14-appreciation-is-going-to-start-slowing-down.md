Today we'll talk about how interest rates are affecting the real estate market. Things shifted quickly when rates recently went up. We expected them to rise, just not so quickly. In the past few years, we've seen a 20% increase in home prices. However, **economists are now expecting to see a 5% to 6% increase this year**. What does that mean to you as a seller or buyer?

First, we will see longer days on market. Unless you have an exceptional property, it likely won’t sell in a weekend. Buyers will now have more negotiating power. However, the price of money will only increase from here on out.

**If you're thinking about selling, there’s no reason to panic.** The sky isn’t falling; this is just a different market. The craziness of houses going for $100,000 over asking is past us, but that doesn’t mean you can’t get a good price for your home. We would love to have a consultation with you to tell you how you can navigate this market and succeed whether you’re buying or selling. If you have any questions, reach out to us by phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
