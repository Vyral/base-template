Our newest team member, Veronika Edwards, was born and raised in Russia and came to the U.S. at age 19. Her life took her all over the country until she settled in Clarksville, Tennessee, where she got her real estate license in 2007. **Even though she entered the business at the worst possible time, her passion, determination, and persistence helped her assist over 150 families in making their American Dream come true.**

The housing crisis helped Veronika master her skills quickly to be able to help her best assist her clients’ needs. In 2016, her husband’s military job relocated her family to Hawaii. Veronika has two beautiful kids, ages four and nine months. She’s worked with many families with different life situations and understands how to provide her clients with “Raving Fan” level customer service. **Her number one priority is exceeding her clients’ expectations.** Today, we want you to get to know her a little better. We sat down and asked her a few questions recently—here’s what she had to say:

**How did you hear about us?** I heard about Team Lally from my previous team leader, who thought I would be a great fit. I did my own research as well to find the best in Hawaii.

**What motivated you to join our team?**&nbsp;Team Lally's track record and reputation. Team Lally has the proper systems and tools in place to keep me organized and professional.

**What is your role on the team?** I’m going to be a buyer specialist who helps families find their dream home.

**What do you enjoy most about working on the team?&nbsp;**Team Lally is a place that is jam-packed with motivation, ambition, success, and inspiration. Not only do they want you to grow as a businessperson, they want you to grow as a person in general. The environment is so warm and welcome. I feel like I’m part of a big family.

If you want to learn more about Veronika or if she can help you with any of your real estate needs, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
