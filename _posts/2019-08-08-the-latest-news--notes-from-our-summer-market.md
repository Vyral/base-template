*If the latest stats are any indication, now’s a good time to buy or sell in our market.*

What’s the latest news from our summer market? **Let’s take a look at the month-over-month statistics from the end of June for detached homes across North San Diego County.**

* The median home price rose $30,000 to $760,000, which means more homes are selling at a higher dollar amount than a lower one, and homes values, in general, are trending upward.
* The average days on market was 32 days, which was a one day drop from the previous month. This means homes are selling quicker.
* The housing supply was at three months—a rise of 0.1 months.
* There were 1,022 total homes sales—a decrease of 66 homes.&nbsp;
* The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed conventional loan dropped from 0.2% to 3.82%.

What do these stats mean? **The drop in interest rates is a big reason home values have risen, fewer homes have sold, and they’re doing so at a quicker rate.** More people are entering the market, which makes now a good time to sell. Because interest rates are so low, it’s also a good time to buy.&nbsp;

If you have any more questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me any way you can. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
