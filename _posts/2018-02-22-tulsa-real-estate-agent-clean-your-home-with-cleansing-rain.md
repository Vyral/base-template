Today, I want to talk about an incredible home cleaning business here in our town: Cleansing Rain.

When I asked how she got the idea to begin her business, owner Lacie Partney told me she wasn’t always such a neat and organized person.

According to Lacie, it all began when she returned to Tulsa after two years on the mission field. At that point in time, she was searching for something to do.

Since then, she’s found cleaning homes to be very fulfilling. She says it really helps her build relationships. On top of that, **Lacie herself makes all of the natural cleaning products she uses.**

This is just one of the things that help her stand out from other cleaning companies in town. She also loves to help people get more organized. From your attic to your junk drawer, Lacie is happy to help anyone declutter.

But, it doesn’t stop there. Once she helps her clients declutter their spaces, **Lacie also helps them develop an organizational system that can be implemented into their specific lifestyle.**

One thing Lacie highly recommends is to make use of vertical space. Instead of buying new furniture that takes up floor space, she suggests that people try to utilize their walls for storage, instead.

To learn more about Lacie and her business, you can visit her website at www.CleansingRain918.com.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
