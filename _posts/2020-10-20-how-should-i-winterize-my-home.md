<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are our 15 valuable tips for winterizing your Alaskan home.</em></p>

Here in Alaska, it’s the time of year when we need to start thinking about winter. We have a few recommendations for how to winterize your home to prepare it for the long freezing months.

First, your indoor checklist:

**1\. Insulate pipes.** If you have indoor water pipes that are next to an exterior wall, make sure you have foam insulation around them. When temperatures drop, it’s normal for those pipes to freeze.&nbsp;

**2\. Block off unused fireplaces.** If you aren’t using a fireplace, put insulation inside to block it off because not only do you lose a ton of warmth through the fireplace, but a lot of cold air will come in too.&nbsp;

**3\. Get a digital thermostat.** If you don’t have one, I highly suggest purchasing a digital and programmable thermostat. This will save you a bunch of money when you’re away from home.&nbsp;

**4\. Check garage doors.** Take a look at both the large garage door and the one that leads to the house and ensure all the gaskets and insulation foam are tight. Quite a bit of air will leak through that part of your home.&nbsp;

**5\. Check the water heater.** Ensure it’s working efficiently and that the temperature setting is right.

**6\. Change the direction of ceiling fans.** This is one many people forget about, but switching the fan’s direction will blow warm air downward instead of pushing it up.

**7\. Clean out dryer vents.&nbsp;**

**8\. Service the furnace.** Have this professionally checked and cleaned before winter begins, and put on new filters. This is crucial; in Alaska, you should have your furnace cleaned every year. It will almost double the life of the furnace.&nbsp;

**9\. Change batteries in detectors.** Both carbon monoxide and smoke detectors need to be in working order, and while you’re checking off all the other things on this list is a great time to do this too.&nbsp;

Now we’ll move on to the outdoor checklist:&nbsp;

**1\. Clean out gutters.** Get all the debris out of the gutters so when spring comes and everything melts, you don’t have a huge water issue.&nbsp;

**2\. Caulk cracks.** Caulk any needed areas on the outside of doors and windows so frigid air doesn’t leak inside.&nbsp;

**3\. Bring in outdoor furniture.&nbsp;**

**4\. Disconnect water hoses.** Sometimes people forget to do this, then don’t realize it’s a problem until spring when they see it’s fractured a pipe.

**5\. Blow out the sprinkler system.** Again, freezing water left inside will damage the system.

**6\. Put stakes around the driveway.** This is especially key if you have snow plows coming through in the winter; it will keep them from hitting things.&nbsp;
