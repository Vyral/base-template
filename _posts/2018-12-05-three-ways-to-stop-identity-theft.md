* ### One – Freeze Your Credit

This is easily done by contacting the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experion, and TransUnion).  There is a fairly new law that says that credit bureaus must freeze your credit within 24 hours, and unfreeze it (when you request to do so) within one hour of your request.  This is the best way to stop identity thieves from opening accounts in your name.

* ### Two – Monitor Your Accounts

Mark your calendar to check your bank account, credit card charges and balances, your retirement and stock accounts weekly.   You may even be able to get an email or text alert from them if something changes.

* ### Three – Use a Password Manager

These are digital/cloud services that allow you to either store your own passwords or create complex ones that are difficult for hackers to break into.  You will never lose a password.  They can notify you of a data breach so you can quickly change the password to protect your information.
