Sylvia Dunn, the best professional stager in town, is here to explain why staging is so important.&nbsp;

Sylvia has staged all of our listings for the past two years and has helped us sell our listings above asking price in less than a week.&nbsp;

According to Sylvia, **that’s why it’s so important to stage your home: so you can sell faster and for more money.** This is a really good market, so you probably could sell your house for something eventually, but don’t you want to make the most money possible for your investment?&nbsp;

Most of the time, a home is someone’s most valuable asset. Sylvia says that staging can help you retain as much money as possible so that you can invest it in your next home, rather than just taking whatever you can get. When you stage your home, you can make money on your home sale.&nbsp;

For example, the condo unit we’re filming at was staged. Because of that, we were able to get $30,000 above asking price in less than two days. We’ve seen this happen again and again with the listings that Sylvia stages for us.&nbsp;

If you do plan on selling your home, what can you do to improve the condition of your property?&nbsp;

**Sylvia says that it’s mostly about decluttering.** Most of us have way too much stuff, and you want the buyer to see themselves living in the house. Pack things away; you’ll have to pack anyway, so why not do it earlier? You should also get a storage unit rather than storing boxes in the garage or spare room. You might spend a couple hundred dollars on the storage unit, but it’s worth it in the end to get a good price on your home.

You should also depersonalize your home. Everyone has pictures of their family up in their homes, which is fine when you’re living there. When you’re selling your home, though, you need to make it appeal to someone else and their family. Take personal photos down, especially in main living areas. It may be okay to leave some small photos or black and white photos to show your family happy in the home. That way, you tell potential buyers, “This is the lifestyle that you can have.”&nbsp;

You can even swap out furniture for more luxurious items, update the bedspread, or change other things to show buyers how they could live in the home, even if you’re not necessarily living that way.&nbsp;

Taking big pieces of furniture out of your house can make your home feel more spacious. It’s important that the furniture in your home points toward the focal point of the room, whether that is a great fireplace or a beautiful view. Sylvia also recommends moving the TV out of the living room and downstairs into the family room; the TV is not a great focal point.&nbsp;

Ultimately, it’s important to create a flow throughout the house. Keep the colors light so the house feels airy and appeals to a broader market. Always be thinking about what most people will like, and keep up on trends that appeal to the broadest market.&nbsp;

Identify amenities that you want to highlight and market that to buyers.&nbsp;

Staging has changed. Sylvia said that they used to put out place settings on the dining room table to make everything look perfect, but people don’t want to be tricked anymore. They want the home to feel natural. You may leave a book and some glasses on the table as if you were reading and just got up. If you have a pool table, take the cover off and rack up the balls so it looks like you are about to play a game.

**Natural things are important, but hide away everyday thing****s,**like the soap on the sink or the shampoo bottles in your updated shower. Will your colorful shampoo bottles distract from the tile you paid all that money for? Accentuate what you want buyers to look at.&nbsp;

Finally, Sylvia says that organization is one of the most important things for the master bedroom and master closet. Just because the door is closed doesn’t mean you shouldn’t pay attention to it. Take some clothes out and make sure there is 20% empty space to put things in. Get hangers that are the same color to make your closet feel more upscale. Pay extra attention to that space.&nbsp;
