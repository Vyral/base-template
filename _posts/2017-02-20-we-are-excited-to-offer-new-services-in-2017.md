We have some exciting announcements about new services we have to offer you in 2017.

First of all, we just purchased our first moving truck. We have a 14-foot box truck to help offset some of your moving costs. If you are thinking about moving, we would be happy to help you. We have two guys to drive the truck and move heavy furniture for you.

**We also added a licensed contractor to our staff.** Whether you want to fix up your home before it hits the market or you need someone to handle repairs after the inspection, we now have someone on our team who can help you out.

Finally, Rose Bennett, a very talented designer and home stager, has joined our team. Rose has an extensive background in staging model homes. She can certainly help get your listing ready. A lot of the time, people want to sell their homes but aren’t sure how to prepare their house for the market. Rose can help you figure out exactly where to invest in your home in order to make it more appealing to buyers.

I also wanted to take a minute to **invite you to our client appreciation event**on February 25th at the Columbia AMC Theater. Join us to watch “The Lego Batman Movie” at 1 p.m.

In the meantime, if you have any questions or if you are interested in using any of our new services, give us a call or send us an email. My team and I would be happy to help you!
