If you’re thinking about renovating, when should you do it? Here’s what we recommend.

**Want to Sell Your Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.com/list/" target="_blank">Get the Value of Your Central or Southwest Virginia Home</a>
**Looking to Buy a Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.net/" target="_blank">Search All Homes on the MLS</a>

Many people think they need to renovate their house. How do you know if that’s the right choice or when the right time to do it is?

My suggestion is that if you are going to renovate, **do it when you buy the house.** Contrary to what you see on TV or read in magazines, you don’t get your $10,000 you spend on the kitchen back. You might get it back five or 10 years from now as the house appreciates, but renovations won’t bring you an instant dollar-for-dollar return.

We also recommend renovating when you move in rather than when you move out because you at least get to enjoy your renovations. It also makes the house much more sellable for a Realtor when the time comes.

If you have any questions about renovations or homes in general here in the Roanoke market, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help!
