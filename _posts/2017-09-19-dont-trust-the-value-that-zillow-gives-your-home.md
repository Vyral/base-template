Why can’t you trust Zillow’s Zestimates to give your home an accurate valuation?

**Because Zestimates are often inaccurate and can cause tension between the buyer and the seller.** Zillow’s own CEO stated that the Zestimate’s error rate is about 8%.

If you apply that 8% error rate to the average home value in Palm Beach County, it equates to $30,000 plus or minus. Zillow understands this inaccuracy, and they’re now offering $1 million to anyone who helps them create a more accurate algorithm to provide estimated values.
