What’s been going on in our summertime market lately?

We have very limited inventory, and the good news for sellers is homes are selling with multiple bids and for more than their listed price—sometimes even above their appraised value.

{% include pullquote.html %}

Our average days on market is fewer than 30 days, home prices are 5% to 7% higher compared to this time last year, and **this momentum doesn’t seem like it will slow down for the rest of the summer or the foreseeable future.**

If you have any other questions about the state of our current market or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to assist you.
