This month, I want to talk to you about some of the things we do to protect our property owners.

We have two reasons to be in your house: **to protect your home and to put money in your account.**

I live by those models, and I make all my decisions based on those two reasons to be in your home and manage your home.

If you do decide to use us, **one of the things we do is a walkthrough.**&nbsp;If we allow pets in your home, we will walk through the house every four months. We’ll get a picture of the pet and send it to you and get your approval before we even consider putting the pet in your home. If there is no pet (or a pet like a fish that won’t affect the flooring), we’ll come through every six months.

Walkthroughs are so important, for a couple of reasons:

**1. They let the tenant know that we are looking out for the owners.**

**2. We’ll send the owners pictures of anything that’s affected by the tenant**—if there is any damage in the house that we find on our walkthroughs, we will give the tenant a 10-day warning. If they don’t correct the issues within 10 days, then we’ll terminate the lease. This is listed on the lease agreement with the tenant, and they’ll sign their move-in addendum up front, as well as a pet addendum, even if they don’t have one.

Owners, we’re looking out for you. You are our first and only concern because you pay our bills, and I appreciate that. Please feel free to call me if you have any questions. Aloha!
