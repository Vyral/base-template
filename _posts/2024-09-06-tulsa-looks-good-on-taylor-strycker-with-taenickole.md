## Tulsa Looks Good on You: An Interview with Taylor Strycker with Taenickole

**Taylor Strycker** is a Tulsa-based entrepreneur and jewelry maker behind the brand **Taenickole**. With her vibrant polymer clay earrings and unique designs, Taenickole has become a favorite among locals and beyond.

In this interview, we chat with Taylor about her journey from teacher to entrepreneur, the inspiration behind her designs, and the exciting launch of her new earring bar experience.

### From Teacher to Entrepreneur

Taylor's love for creativity was evident from a young age, but it wasn't until she started experimenting with polymer clay during her teaching career that she discovered her passion for jewelry making. Initially, she began creating earrings as a hobby, but the positive response from her friends and family encouraged her to take the leap and turn her passion into a business.

Despite the challenges of balancing a full-time job with her growing business, Taylor's dedication and hard work paid off. Eventually, she made the difficult decision to leave her teaching career and pursue Taenickole full-time.

### The Inspiration Behind Taenickole

Taenickole's designs are known for their bold colors, unique shapes, and playful personalities. Taylor draws inspiration from her love of nature, her appreciation for vintage aesthetics, and her desire to create pieces that are both stylish and fun.

One of the most exciting aspects of Taenickole is the brand's commitment to personalization. Taylor offers customers the opportunity to create their own custom earrings using a variety of materials and components. This interactive experience allows customers to express their individuality and create one-of-a-kind pieces.

### The Bauble Bar: A New Experience

In addition to her existing product line, Taenickole is launching a new concept called the **Bauble bar**. This interactive experience allows customers to create their own custom earrings in a fun and social setting.

Whether you're hosting a corporate event, a girls' night out, or simply looking for a unique experience, the **Bauble bar** offers a fun and creative way to spend time with friends and family.
