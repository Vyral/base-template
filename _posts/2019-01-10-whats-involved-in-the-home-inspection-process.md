Home inspections are a critical step in the real estate process, but many people don’t understand exactly how or why these inspections are conducted.

First of all, **it’s important to realize that inspections and appraisals are not the same.** Appraisals are designed to discern a home’s value, while an inspection is meant to assess its condition.

The job of a home inspector is to identify and record any structural, safety, or mechanical issues that it may have. Without the inspection process, many such issues could easily go undetected—leaving them to transform into a far worse problem down the line.

An appraiser might lift the attic door to check that adequate insulation is present, but a home inspector will actually crawl through the attic and thoroughly investigate its condition.

Of course, **you want to make sure to hire an experienced, licensed inspector for the job.** Our team would happy to refer you to such a professional.

After the inspection is complete, the inspector will provide you with a list of their findings. You can present this list to the seller and request that they make repairs. Realize, though, that the seller may not agree to fix everything. They may handle large repairs, but they might ask that you take care of small problems on your own.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
