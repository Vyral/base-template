The temperature is dropping, the leaves are changing colors, and pumpkin spice is everywhere right now. With fall in full swing and winter coming up, I thought I’d share some of my top tips for getting your home sold this season.

With fall colors and produce so abundant this time of year, you may be tempted to load your home up with both, but I will caution you that if you’re trying to sell your home right now, that could be a bad thing.

With that in mind, my first tip is to pay really close attention to your curb appeal. Rake the leaves in your yard, clear the driveway, and don’t load up your front porch with pumpkins and gourds. Leaves are falling every day, so you might have to rake your yard every day as well. This also makes for a safer environment for buyers in case it rains—you don’t want wet, slippery leaves coating your front walkway.

Second, go easy on the holiday displays. Regardless of what holiday you celebrate, keep the displays to a minimum. Some lights and decorations along your front door and porch are fine, but don’t go overboard.

With the days getting shorter and the sun setting earlier, you also want to let in as much natural light as possible. If you have curtains and balances that are covering up parts of some of your windows, take them down for showings. Nobody’s buying that stuff anyway, and you want to simplify your window fixings to maximize natural light. Take a look around your house and ask your agent or stager to take down any window treatments darkening your house.

Next, make the inside of your home inviting. Consider using decorative pillows, bowls of seasonal fruit, and some pumpkins (a minimal amount). The way you’d decorate your house for company is the same way you should decorate it for buyers.

If you have a fireplace in your home, make sure you clean it. If it’s not clean, keep the doors closed. If it is clean, stack some wood neatly inside it or try lighting some candles and placing them inside so you create the visual appeal without any of the overwhelming smell.

Finally, consider adding fall scents to the inside of your home, but keep them to a minimum as well. One candle in your kitchen and one in your bathroom is enough.

If you have any more questions about this topic or need more tips on how to sell your home this fall or winter, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help.
