<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s why refinancing in today’s market is such a great idea.</em></p>

If you’re considering a refinance of your home, you’re not alone. I’ve already refinanced twice in the past year.&nbsp;

Why? **One reason is that the conforming limit has increased from $756,000 to $822,000.** If your home is between that value, refinancing to a conforming rate may be in your best interest.&nbsp;

Maybe your home’s value is at $900,000, but you want to buy down your debt in order to drop your rate drastically. **I was actually able to save $800 per month on my last refinance with this method.**

It’s a great time to look at refinancing,&nbsp; but if you have any questions for me about the process or your specific situation, I’d be happy to answer them or connect you to an expert lender who can.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
