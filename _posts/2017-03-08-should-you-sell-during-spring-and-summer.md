When is the best time of year to sell your home?

 Redfin, which is the largest real estate portal, has stated that homes sold in the spring and summer sell 9% faster and for 1.2% more money. There are a couple of reasons for that.

{% include pullquote.html %}

 First, families that are looking to move want to wait until their kids are out of school. They don’t want to deal with the hassle of having to change school districts in the middle of the year, so selling during the spring and summer is ideal.

 Second, interest rates are beginning to rise. Buyers are getting off the fence because they want to lock in the low interest rates that we have right now.

If you’re looking to buy or sell a home or if you have any other questions, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
