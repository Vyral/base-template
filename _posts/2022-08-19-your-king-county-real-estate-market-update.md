Lately, a lot of people are asking us about the state of our market, whether it’s a good time to sell in Kirkland 98033, and if the market is going to crash. The constant changes in the market can make it difficult to know what's best for your family.

If you find that relatable, I totally understand. I’ve been in the industry for over 10 years, and I’m here to help you navigate the market. I’ve closed hundreds of real estate transactions during my career, and I always use data to show clients what’s happening in the market. Hard numbers empower them to make educated decisions for their futures.

**So is it a good time to sell a home in Kirkland 98033 and 98034? Yes\!** As of the recording of this video, we have 153 active homes in our market. They spend an average of 16 days on the market, and only 54 homes sold in July. We have relatively low inventory, but buyer demand remains strong.&nbsp;

Even still, **the market is pretty volatile right now**. We currently have more homes on the market than in recent months, and the average number of offers homes receive has dropped over the past few weeks. Buyers aren’t bidding as high to out-compete each other, and they’re less willing to remove contingencies than conditions forced them to be in the past.&nbsp;

Since interest rates are expected to continue rising throughout the year, now is an excellent time to sell. The longer you wait, the higher they’ll get, and buyers’ purchasing power will be reduced.

If you’re planning to sell your home, I’d love to schedule a hassle-free, no-obligation strategy session with you. Don’t hesitate to give me a call or send an email. I hope to hear from you soon\!
