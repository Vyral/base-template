Today I’m bringing you episode four of our series on the 10 actions every new agent should take. As always, these tips are aimed at new agents, but I think even experienced agents could learn a lot from them. In this episode, I’ll be going over tips seven and eight.&nbsp;

**The seventh action you should take as a new agent is probably my favorite: hosting open houses.** This is a great way of finding buyers. My challenge is to look for people holding open houses and offer to host the open house for them. I’ve been doing this for six years, and this is still a huge part of how I run my business.&nbsp;

**The eighth action you should take as a new agent is to choose a farm.** I’ve recently moved, and this is a great opportunity to build a new database. Even going door to door can be a great way to introduce yourself to a community. The key takeaway is that you want to offer people value upfront. For me, this usually means a complimentary market analysis. By keeping in touch with my database (or ‘farm’), I can have a constant stream of potential clients at the ready.&nbsp;

**Hosting open houses and farming for your database are perhaps two of the most important actions you can take as a new agent.** They are relatively cheap or even free, and they can bring in a huge return on your investment.&nbsp;

I look forward to seeing you next week when I finish up my series on the top actions every new agent should take. If you have any questions in the meantime, do not hesitate to reach out to me. I am always willing to help.
