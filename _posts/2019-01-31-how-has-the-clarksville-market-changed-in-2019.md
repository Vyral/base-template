It’s been over a month since we’ve discussed the latest market statistics, so I have an update for you today on the latest in Clarksville real estate.

First of all, inventory is still down. There are currently about 872 homes on the market right now. Last year at this time, we had about 945.

**Although the year has just started, we’ve already seen 175 home sales, which is about on par with what we saw last year.** The average price, however, is up about 3% from last year to $186,000.

The average days on market has increased slightly, from 51 days last year to 56 this year. The list-to-sale price ratio also remains at about 99%.

The area of the market that’s really hot is the $100,000 to $180,000 price range, which only has 53 homes on the market. That’s just one month worth of inventory. **This is a great price range to be in if you’re a home seller or investor.** The $140,000 to $180,000 is even stronger than that.

In the $240,000 to $300,000 price range, things are starting to slow down a bit. The price range has five months' worth of inventory, and each range above $300,000 is technically in a buyer's market. **If you’re in one of these price ranges, your home’s condition is important, as is meeting the price that the market sets.**

If you have any questions about the real estate market or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
