What kind of wildlife do we have in Montana? Today I’ll share a few of the common and rare animals that we see in our area.&nbsp;

At the top of my head, some of the typical wildlife you’ll spot here are deers, elk, turkeys, geese, ducks, and coyotes. On rare occasions, you can also find bears locally. Just the other morning, as I sat at my desk and looked out over the frozen Echo Lake, **I saw a grizzly bear walking across the ice**, which you can see at 1:06 in the video above. He followed my tracks from before when I took a stroll and then wandered off into the forest.

I'd never seen a grizzly bear around the lake until that day\! He was not headed toward the mountains to hibernate, which was interesting, considering this was shot two days before Thanksgiving. Two days after that, I saw something odd again that was out on the lake. I pulled up my binoculars and spotted a bobcat that I'd never seen here. You can see a picture of it at 1:59 in the video.&nbsp;

Both grizzly bears and bobcats are elusive animals, and those rare sightings just added to the thrill of watching deers and coyotes walk and run across the ice during winter. I hope you enjoyed the videos and pictures I showed in the video above. If you have any other questions about today’s topic or anything real estate related, call or email me. I’m always happy to help\!
