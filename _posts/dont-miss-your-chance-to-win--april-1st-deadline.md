{% include youtube.html %}Even the desert gets cold sometimes. Here’s how to keep your energy costs low when it does.

We’re fortunate that it doesn’t ever get too cold here in the desert, but we all know that it does get chilly at night around this time of year. Here are three tips to help you save some money on energy costs in your home during this time:

**1. Get a draft snake.** You can get these in a ton of different designs, and they fit right under your door to help keep warm air in and cool air out.

**2. Reverse the ceiling fans.** Most of us don’t do this, but it’s a really good tip. Cold air tends to hang around your feet. By reversing the fan, you bring that cold air up and make the home warmer. The best part is that it’s so easy. There’s a switch on your fan that will reverse it.

**3. Flush your water heater.** By simply draining this, you can get rid of a lot of sediment and particles that tend to build up and cause the system to run less efficiently

I hope these tips help out. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
