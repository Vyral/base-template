There are a few key questions you should be asking any potential agent before you hire them. Here are just three of them.

If you want to hire the best agent to help you with your real estate transaction, there are a few questions you need to be asking before you hire one.

**1. Ask how many homes they’ve sold this year.** It’s good to be even more specific by asking how many homes they sold in a particular area, or how many homes they didn’t sell. If you hire someone with a track record of 10 listings in which only three sold, that’s a problem.<br>**2. Ask about their list-to-sales ratio.** If an agent is consistently selling houses for less than what they’re listed for, you may want to reconsider hiring that agent. You want to get the most money that you can for your house, don’t you?<br>**3. Ask about their marketing plan.** The average agent in the area spends a maximum of $300 per month on true marketing systems to get homes sold. However, $300 doesn’t get you very much exposure for your listing—the Dan Jones Group spends over $20,000 a month in marketing to generate buyers for our listings.
