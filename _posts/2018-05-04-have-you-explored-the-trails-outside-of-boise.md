Have you tried running or walking the trails outside of Boise lately?

Recently I was out on the trails doing some volunteer work when I met Holly Finch of Pulse Running and Fitness Shop in Meridian. Holly and I got to talking and we decided it would be fun to join me for a video, talk about a recreation activity we both enjoy, and answer some questions you may have.

Whenever people ask Holly about trail running, two questions in particular come to light.

**1. What sort of wildlife do you encounter?**

According to Holly, a lot of people ask this question because they’re concerned about bears or coyotes. She says that while there are bears and coyotes, it’s rare that you’ll see them. If you do, they’re mostly harmless, and part of the fun of being out on the trails in the first place is the chance you’ll see them.

If that kind of thing is on your mind, here’s what I have to say: Don’t worry about it. Embrace nature (not the bears, coyotes, or snakes—that would be bad), have fun, and enjoy your time on the trails. Your heart and soul will thank you for it.

**2.  Do I really need trail shoes?**

While trail shoes aren’t required, the more you get into trail running, the more you might appreciate them. Trail running shoes have a stiffer sole that can better protect your feet from rocks. They’re also a bit more waterproof, which can come in handy if you have to cross a stream or you’re out in the snow. If you don’t have a pair of trail running shoes, I recommend you give Holly a visit at her shop in Meridian.

On that note, I want to announce a contest we’re holding. **If you post a picture of yourself out on the trails on our [Ridge to Rivers Realty Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/R2Rrealty) between now and May 31, you’ll have a chance to win a free pair of trail running shoes.** The winner of this contest will be selected at random and announced on May 31.

In the meantime, if you’d like to know more about the trail network in the Boise foothills, visit [www.ridgetorivers.org.](http://www.ridgetorivers.org/) You can also give Holly a call at (208) 884-1141 or look her up at [www.pulserunning.com.](http://www.pulserunning.com/)

As always, if you have any other questions for me—trail running, real estate, or otherwise—don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help you.
