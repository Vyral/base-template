Today, we have a few tips and tricks for buying a brand new home from a builder.

**First of all, hire an agent to represent you to make sure that your interests are protected.** When you go out to a new construction site, the builder has agents there to represent them. They will ask you to register before you can actually walk through the model homes.

Please talk to your agent about getting pre-registered to view model homes and take a stack of your agent’s business cards with you. Better yet, bring your agent along in person. A lot of builders require your agent to be present; otherwise, they may not allow you to work with your agent later on.

Next, make sure you read the fine print. When you enter a purchase agreement on a new home, it is not the standard California Association of Realtors form; it’s actually a builder’s form. The builder has to get this form approved by the Bureau of Real Estate as part of their development process.

The form protects the builder and includes a lot of additional disclosures you may not be familiar with. Have a Realtor decipher those disclosures and figure out what they really mean. Your agent can even write additional addendums if need be.

When you walk through the model home, you will see all kinds of upgrades and fall in love with all those decorator details. **Please make sure you understand what is standard and included in the purchase price and which features are actually upgrades.** If you want any upgrades, decide on them early to keep costs in check and prevent delays in construction and closing.

You should also decide if you want a home inspection. Even though it’s a brand-new home, builders are still people and people can make mistakes. As the market heats up, demand for new homes goes up, and contractors are pushed to work longer hours to meet those demands. When that happens, mistakes can be made. We definitely recommend getting the home inspection.

Another thing you should do is get pre-qualified by your lender before you walk through a model home. The builder will ask you to be pre-qualified with their in-house lender, but we always recommend comparing rates.

Don’t skip the final walkthrough. Check out the condition of the home. Look for nicks in the paint and chipped tiles. If anything doesn’t look right and the builder needs to fix it, that is much easier for the builder to do before you close escrow. That’s why the final walkthrough is so important.

Finally, understand the warranty. New builds come with a one-year fit and finish warranty, and you will also receive a 10-year structural warranty. Understand what fit and finish includes; you may think windows would be covered by the 10-year structural inventory, but they may actually fall under the one-year fit and finish warranty.

As you can see, buying a new home is a very complex process. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
