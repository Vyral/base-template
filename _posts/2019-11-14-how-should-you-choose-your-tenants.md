Here are some tips that you should follow to ensure you choose the right tenant for your rental property:

**1\. They should be making 3x the rent of the property.** Having a good income will make it much easier for the tenant to pay rent on time.

**2\. Verify the tenant’s income.**

**3\. Determine the tenant's credit score.** The average score is around 660, so they should be near that number. If you have a property in better condition than normal, you should be looking for higher credit scores than the average.

**4\. Talk to the tenant’s previous landlord.** Make sure you ask them, “Would you rent to this tenant again?”

**5\. Ask the tenant about themselves and what they do.&nbsp;**

**6\. Meet the tenant in person before deciding.**
