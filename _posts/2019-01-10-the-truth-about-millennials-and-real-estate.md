**[Check out Tara's recent interview on the topic](https://www.nwahomepage.com/news/millennials-delay-homeownership-compared-to-other-generations/1687089361){: target="_blank"}**

We all know that millennials are crazy, lazy, and want to live with their parents forever, right? Wrong! **Studies are coming out that show millennials aren’t buying homes as quickly as their predecessors, but that doesn’t mean they don’t want a home.**

Millennials are the most educated generation that our country has ever seen, but with that education comes a cost. That cost is student loan debt. A lot of millennials are waiting until they finish college, get their feet underneath them, and start paying off that debt before they decide to buy their first home.

**Most are waiting until around the age of 30 to purchase a home as opposed to the previous generation purchasing homes right when they get out of school.**

Another factor at play is the fact that millennials are getting married and having children at a later age, which are two huge life events that trigger the purchase of a home. **In NW Arkansas, around 34% of millennials are homeowners.** This is around the middle of the road as far as home cost, but it’s much harder for millennials to purchase a home on the coasts because of the higher cost.

If you have any questions about buying a home or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
