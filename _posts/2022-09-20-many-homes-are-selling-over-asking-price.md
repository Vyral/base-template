Buyer confidence is still strong in New Haven and Fairfield County heading into the fall market. Our **homes are still selling; most are selling at full price**, with many still being sold for over the asking price. Some buyers in the marketplace may have noticed a slight fluctuation in the interest rates, but rest assured that rates are still very low.

The alternative to not buying a home is renting rather than building equity and owning a house for yourself. Currently, New Haven County’s average monthly rent is about $2,550.&nbsp;

Many frustrated homebuyers have remained in the marketplace for three months, six months, or even a year and have been losing out on properties in multiple-offer situations. Luckily, I’m pleased to share that one of our buyer’s agents got their last three clients offers accepted, even in multiple-offer situations.

If you’re a frustrated buyer in the marketplace, **we would love to share some strategies that our agents are using to get our client’s offers accepted**. Reach out to us via phone or visit our website if you have any questions or want to speak with us. We look forward to hearing from you.
