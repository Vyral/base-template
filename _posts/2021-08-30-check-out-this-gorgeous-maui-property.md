If you’ve ever wondered what kind of home $8 million can buy you in Maui, today’s your lucky day. Marcus Springs, the representative of the team that listed this home, took us on a tour of a $7.9 million home to give us some insight into what luxury real estate looks like here on this beautiful island.

**The very first thing you’ll notice about this property is the wild view** it has overlooking the bay. You can enjoy that view from the studio-style pool house, which comes with a full bathroom and outdoor shower. You can use that to wash off after a day on the beach or swimming in the infinity pool or hot tub.

With 4,670 square feet, this 4-bed, 4.5-bath home sits on 35+ acres of land. It is a masterpiece\! All of the art here is just exquisite. The floors are all monkeypod, and the accents and trims are all African mahogany. The four posts in the back and front yards are native Hawaiian ohia. Venetian plaster adorns every wall as well as the ceilings; no expense was spared on this amazing home.

Inside, **the kitchen is stocked with state-of-the-art appliances** including a full-range gas burner stove, Kitchenaid appliances, and a huge pantry. The home has two primary suites with huge bathrooms. The one highlighted in the video above has an enormous walk-in shower and a Whirlpool jacuzzi tub. With all its amazing amenities, this is one of my favorite bathrooms I’ve ever seen.

All in all, the $7.9 million pays for the land and the excellent view, which you just can’t beat. The owner pays $3,000 a month for landscaping, so if you’re interested in purchasing it, be sure that you have the budget to keep it up.

**If you’re interested in making this property** your own or would like more information about it, reach out to Marcus Springs at (808) 707-9001. If you have any other real estate needs here in the Louisville/Southern Indiana area, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send an email. Hope to hear from you soon\!
