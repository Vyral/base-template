A question I’ve been hearing a lot recently is, “How can I get full price on my home sale?” Well, the first thing you should do is give us a call, but here’s where we’ll go from there.

**The key to getting a full price offer is in the preparation and presentation of your home.** Most buyers today are looking for something that’s move-in ready, so cleaning and decluttering are two of the most important things you can do.

I also have the luxury of going through 30 to 100 homes every week, which gives me a great opportunity to see what buyers like, what they don’t like, and ultimately, what’s going to get you that full price offer you want.

The initial showing for a home today is online, so it must be represented well there. **Professional photography and great curb appeal are the most important things here.** When you’re home’s presented well online, it will create interest among buyers and start to generate showings.

By getting your home prepared properly and setting things up the right way, we can help you have the most successful sale possible in St. Cloud. If you have any questions for us or you’re looking to sell your home this fall, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
