If you’ve never purchased a condo before, you may not realize that there are some key differences between condo financing and financing a home.&nbsp;

Not only do you have to qualify for underwriting, but the property itself needs to do so, as well.

This is quite a bit different from what many are used to. Qualifying for this kind of underwriting will involve looking at finances, documents, and the property’s management team.&nbsp;

Another difference is that getting VA or FHA financing for condos will be difficult. **With a condo, a conventional mortgage loan will probably be your best option**.

Though Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have lightened up slightly on mortgage requirements, there are still certain condos that simply will not qualify for FHA or VA financing.

If you’re working with an experienced loan originator, they will be able to walk you through some options, though.&nbsp;

Even if you are paying cash, it is critical that you **pay attention to the HOA and financing documents**. Your Realtor should give you all of these items for you to review.
