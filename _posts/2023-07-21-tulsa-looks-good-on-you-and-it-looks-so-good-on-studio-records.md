Vinyl is BACK so Jennie connected with owner, Mike Nobles to hear about what Studio Records is all about!

Whether you are a collector, living out your younger years, or just getting into it for the first time…Studio Records is the place to shop for all things vinyl.

Located on Studio Row, a block south of Church Studio, Studio Records is open 7 days a week.

Owner Mike Nobles, has been in the record business his whole life. After working for Warner Music for 30 years, Mike decided in 2019 to retire and open up the shop.

Mike’s longtime music business connections have paid off, helping him stay in-the-know with the latest and greatest tunes, allowing him to often have them available in his shop.

Mike says his greatest joy is just watching people come in and discover a record in the bin they have been looking for and couldn’t find anywhere else. “People get so excited,” Mike shared.
