First impressions are incredibly important in real estate. We’re hardwired to start evaluating our surroundings as soon as we step foot in them, and this is especially true when looking for homes. Further, homebuyers are on the verge of making the biggest financial investment of their lives, so they’re paying even more attention to the properties they see.&nbsp;

**To make sure your home makes a great first impression on potential buyers, there are a few things you want to do:**

1. Make sure that your home smells pleasant
2. Try to dampen unpleasant noises like trains, highways, etc.
3. Think about what people will see when they walk through your home

These are all things that we get used to when we live in a home for a while, but your agent can help you figure out what you should address. You may be nose blind to a pet odor, the sound of trains is background noise to you, or the dings and scratches on the doorway seem to blend in now. When a buyer walks into your property, though, all of these things are immediately apparent and can cause them to walk right back out.

**Think about what might stand out to you if you were seeing your home for the first time.** From there, work to address any issues that might scare off would-be buyers. If you have any questions or would like more information about preparing your home, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
