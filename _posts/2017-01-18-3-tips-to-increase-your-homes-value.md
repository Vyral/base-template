When preparing your house for sale, what can you do to it that brings the best return on your investment?

I put together a list of the best things you can do in our market here in the Bay Area.

1. **Declutter the house.** Your personal ornaments might not be things that buyers are looking at or place value in. Decluttering and making the house as bright as possible will make it look larger.

2. **Paint is gold.** Think neutral colors on your interior walls for a clean look to increase the value of your home. At the end of the day, it will return more money on your investment.

3. **Flooring.** New carpet might be one of the cheapest and most effective ways to get more money out of your sale. If you have hardwood flooring, be sure to clean it up and polish it. We have great vendors for these resources that give our clients special pricing on things like flooring. We’d be happy to put you in touch with them.
