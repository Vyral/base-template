Recently, our buyer team has put together a coat drive to collect jackets and coats for the Road Home Shelter here in Salt Lake City. The goal is to collect as many coats as possible for those less fortunate than ourselves. It's going to be a cold winter, and we don't want anyone to be without the proper protection.

If you have any old coats you don't use anymore, you can either drop them off at our office at [2121 McClelland Street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Joshua+Stern+Team/@40.725029,-111.861256,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x43291c09189a3836), or give us a call at our office and we'll come by and pick them up. The deadline is December 12, so don't wait! Reach out to us today so we can start making a difference in the community today!

Once we've collected the coats, we'll drop them off at the Road Home Shelter and make a video for you to view. Stay tuned for that and more from the Stern Team!
