It’s an exciting time to be selling your home, especially if you have waited it out for the last few years because your equity was down.

The real estate industry experts are predicting one of the busiest spring markets in years. **Here are just a few of the most recent projections we’ve seen for the market in 2018:**

* Home prices are projected to hit their highest levels in 11 years
* New housing starts are projected to hit their highest levels in 8 years.
* Purchase volume is expected to increase by $80 Billion.
* First-time homebuyers are projected to make up 40% of the market.

With so many first-time homebuyers entering the market, it can only mean increased competition, which is going to drive some prices up this spring.
