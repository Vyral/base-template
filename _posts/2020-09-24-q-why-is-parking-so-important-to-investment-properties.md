<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Here’s why bad parking is a detriment to your property.</em></p>

A common question I hear is, “How important is parking?” In Hawaii, it’s pretty much the most important thing.&nbsp;

<div style="width: 80%; border: solid 1px #C9C9C9; padding: 20px 10px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

<span style="color: #5c6e96; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 50px; font-size: 100px; display: block; float: left; position: absolute;">“</span>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; padding: 0 10px; margin: 0 auto; font-weight: bold; color: #000;"> Parking should be a key factor in your search.</p>

If you have a home that has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and one parking spot or a condo with no parking, I can not manage it for you. They are just too difficult to rent out.

In Hawaii, one of the biggest assets to a home is adequate parking. I can’t emphasize that enough. When you’re buying a home or looking for an investment property, parking should be a key factor because it’s so important on the island. Inadequate parking means longer wait times on the market and for tenants.

If you have any questions for me about this or property management in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I look forward to hearing from you.<br>&nbsp;
