<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Here’s why insufficient parking is a detriment to your property.</em></p>

A common question I hear is, “How important is parking?” In Hawaii, it’s pretty much the most important thing.

**If you have a home that has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and one parking spot, or it's a condo with no parking, I cannot manage it for you.** They are just too difficult to rent out.

In Hawaii, one of the biggest assets to a home is adequate parking. I can’t emphasize that enough. When you’re buying a home or looking for an investment property, parking should be a key factor because it’s so important on the island. **Inadequate parking means longer wait times on the market and for tenants.**

If you have any questions for me about this or property management in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I look forward to hearing from you.<br>&nbsp;
