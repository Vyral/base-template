Today, we’ve got three essential tips that will help you win in a hot seller’s market.&nbsp;

First of all, it’s incredibly important that you work with a local lender. In multiple offer situations, sellers are always going to choose an offer where the buyer is working with a local lender.&nbsp;

A lot of buyers are in the market right now. However, inventory is low, which means demand is very high. **This has led to over-bidding and several multiple offer situations**.

A recent statistic reports that every listing at $250,000 has more than 79 buyers.&nbsp;

Therefore, buyers should be prepared to bid above asking price. Thankfully, we’ve got some tricks up our sleeve to help you compete.&nbsp;

Outside of having a local lender, the next best tip is to not be defeated. We often tell people to plan on missing out on three homes.

&nbsp;**Be prepared to miss out for a while, but eventually things will work out**.

The market is tough but great professionals can help you navigate this hot seller’s market.
