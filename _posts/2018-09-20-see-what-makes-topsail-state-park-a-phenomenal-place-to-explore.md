Topsail State Park is one of the staples of Miramar Beach and Santa Rosa Beach, and I have a quick aerial tour of the area to show you today. With many lakes and walking trails to choose from, it’s a phenomenal place to explore. The Gulf frontage is untouched, and is surrounded by some of the most incredible resorts along our coastline.

Grand Boulevard is also close by, and it offers a variety of entertainment options. As a local, my own office building is located just five minutes away, and I can tell you that it’s easy to avoid the traffic most times of the year. Overall, it’s a great place to enjoy everything our coastline has to offer. To get the full aerial tour, watch this short video.
