Here’s what satisfied buyer client Charlene had to say about us.&nbsp;

Charlene is yet another wonderful client who took advantage of our expertise and services to buy a home in North Branford back in July 2020. **Sally Andrews was the Carbutti & Co. agent who worked hard to help Charlene get out of her old house and into her next one quickly;** Charlene, who was navigating a divorce at the time, joked that she drove Sally crazy because she didn’t know where she wanted to move when she began the process. Nonetheless, Sally helped her keep focused, and together they covered a lot of ground. Finally, Charlene was able to settle on a winner.&nbsp;

*“When I first realized I needed to purchase a home I started looking online and got very overwhelmed,”* Charlene said. *“I spoke to Sally… who is also a friend of mine, and it was the best decision I could’ve made because it made things very easy.****She brought up a lot of things that I didn’t even know to ask, or a lot of the processes that I wasn’t sure on,*** *and made suggestions or \[offered\] connections when I needed them.”&nbsp;*

In total, it took Charlene six weeks to find her perfect house in North Branford. During these uncertain times, she was naturally apprehensive about going into other people’s homes, but Sally and the rest of our team made things easy; for in-person tours or meetings, **everyone wore a mask, sanitized themselves, practiced social distancing, and handled things virtually whenever possible.&nbsp;**

*“I would feel extremely comfortable recommending Carbutti & Co. to anybody. I actually recommended them to my daughter very recently.”&nbsp;*
