We had our best year ever in 2018, and because of that, we’d like to thank all of the clients we’ve worked with over the years. We sold more than 435 homes, which came to $135 million in real estate sales. With such a large number of clients we help and homes we sell, we need people to join our team.

**Our goal in 2019 is to reach 650 units sold with about $250 million in sales.** We want to help more families, and as a result, we need help ourselves.

**We’re looking for six more agents and two assistants to join the team.**

Do you feel like you’ve capped out at 15 to 20 deals a year, even though you know you’re capable of doing much more? A member came to our team after selling around 22 units a year on his own; he’s sold 52 with us in this last year alone. We can help you accomplish this.

We want people who can do high-quality work and provide excellent customer service. It’s not just about selling homes—**the small things we do set us apart from the competition and provide clients with an unforgettable experience.**

We offer a list of concierge services for our team members to use with clients, such as moving trucks, box packing, housewarming parties, photography, staging, and many other things that are done for you and your clients.

<br>If you want to ramp up your production and have a fantastic time doing so, give me a call at **410-638-9555** or email **Lee@LeeTessier.com**. I’d be happy to set up a one-on-one appointment with you and see where we can take your career in 2019. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
