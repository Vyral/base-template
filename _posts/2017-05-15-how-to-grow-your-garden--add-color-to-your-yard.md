What does your yard look like this spring?

I’ve once again enlisted the advice from Mike of Mike’s Custom Lawn Care to give you some pointers on gardening and lawn care. This is the prime season to plant your vegetable garden and add some color around the exterior of your property with flowers. We had a great winter that produced lots of water, so if you haven’t done so already, now is the time to get started on these items.

Ideally, you want to **prepare your soil with fertilizers and mulches.** It’s also a great time to plant your annuals so your summer color can go into effect. Pansies, primroses, primulas, and snapdragons are all great at adding color to small areas with bare spots.

It’s also a good idea to **check your sprinklers** and readjust your timers to prevent overwatering and make sure they’re watering the areas they’re intended for and not producing any runoff that might go into the street or a neighboring property.

If you have any questions about gardening and/or maintaining your yard this time of year, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. You can also reach Mike at (818) 842-2660. We’d be happy to help you!
