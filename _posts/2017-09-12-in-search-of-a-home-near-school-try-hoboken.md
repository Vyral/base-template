When people buy a home, a number of factors will influence their decision, **including the home’s look, the number of bedrooms, the style of building, and what amenities come with the building.** Child-related amenities are also important factors—is the school within walking distance, as well as any parks or similar facilities?

A lot of people may not realize this as they look through the history of Hoboken being a popular spot for pub-crawling students out of college, **but the community has become much more family-friendly in recent times.**

New construction and Quality Public and Charter Schools have encouraged families with kids to move to the area—here, schools for younger children are free. Additionally, **Hoboken receives high scores for walkability, restaurants, and nightlife.**

People come from the New York area to take advantage of the city’s schools to save money— **private schools can cost thousands of dollars elsewhere.**
