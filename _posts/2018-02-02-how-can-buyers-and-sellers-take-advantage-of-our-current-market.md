If you want your home to actually be sold in the spring, you’ll need to get a head start on the market. This is something I recommend to my clients each and every year.

Actually, February is a great time to list a home. **Interest rates are beginning to creep up, and this trend will likely continue through the spring and summer.** In other words, now is the right time to get on the market, whether you are a buyer or a seller.

January was also a great month to list. Now that we’ve entered February, we’ve already seen a very significant number of homes sell so far this year.

In fact, I recently helped someone list and sell a home in a matter of just two weeks. That same home had previously sat on the market for about nine months. Once we implemented my techniques, we were able to get it quickly off the market.

If a home search is in your future for this year, I recommend you start looking now. You could wait until more homes go on the market, but **when inventory rises, so does the level of competition.**

Going on the market now will help you avoid getting tied up in a multiple-offer situation.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
