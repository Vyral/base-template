{% include youtube.html %}Does your listing agent do any sort of pre-marketing of your home prior to putting it on the market?

This is an important step that can make a big difference in getting your home sold quickly AND for top dollar. **We specialize in doing just that for our clients. We have a list of carefully chosen national and regional sites that we use to showcase our clients’ homes and create a “buzz” to drive showings.**

This also gives our clients a little bit of time between when we pre-market their home and when it goes live for sale. It’s all about maximizing exposure to potential buyers to generate the highest price in the shortest amount of time. The result is more equity for our clients with less stress and inconvenience.

We recently had an example of this with one of our clients moving out-of-state later this month. Prior to going live on the market, we helped them get their home ready for the camera and did a lot of pre-marketing of their property on social media.

As a result, we had a buyer contact their agent to see the home on Thursday BEFORE it went live on the market. They came back for a second showing the next day and the home went under contract before the open house on Sunday.

My sellers were thrilled that they didn’t have to have their home on the market for a long time, managing weeks of showings. The buyers were also thrilled that they were able to buy the home they really wanted.

The next time you’re selecting an agent to help you market your home for sale, remember some carefully thought out pre-marketing can make a big difference.
