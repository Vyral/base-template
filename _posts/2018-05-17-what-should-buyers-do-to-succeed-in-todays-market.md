<center><em>The spring selling season is well underway, but where does this leave buyers in our market? Let&rsquo;s discuss this important question today.</em></center>

 

Back in January, we predicted that our market was about to heat up. Well, now that we are further into the year, it has become clear that these projections have come true.

**We are well into the thick of the spring selling season**, with homes today spending an average of just 11 days on the market.

So, what does this mean for buyers? The first thing we would like to say is, do not panic. There are plenty of available resources out there to help you achieve your real estate goals and find the right home for your wants and needs.
