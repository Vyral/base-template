Today I’m here to answer the question of what you’re supposed to ask potential listing agents.

This is a topic I’m very passionate about because not all agents are the same. I really want you to know the difference so that you can have the right representation, and also help your home sell for the most money as quickly as possible.

**“What is the selling price to listing price?”**

Ask your agent this question because some agents overprice their houses to make clients feel better for getting more for the house. In reality, you’ll probably sit on the market for a while and end up reducing the price. Ultimately, you’ll be disappointed that your walk-away money was less than you expected.

Right now, our average is 101%, so we’re selling homes for more money than what we’re listing them for. The market average on the MLS is now 98%, so with our methods, we’re getting you 3% more for your home.

**“How will you market my home?”**

Marketing is a huge aspect of the sale, so be sure to ask this question to any potential listing agent. Does the agent stage your home or help you do so? Do they use professional photography? I’ve seen many agents just taking pictures with their iPhones. That’s not acceptable. Buyers look for homes online so they’ll want to see quality photos.

**“Do you market around the neighborhood?”**

Do the agent postcard the neighborhood? Do they door-knock the neighborhood? Do they call around to your neighbors and introduce your house to them and let them know that it’s for sale?

Also, do they reach out to other agents, or do they simply put your home on the MLS, and that’s it?

You’ll also want to ask about their success rates. **How many homes do they sell in a year?**

**Do they know the average listing price to selling price?&nbsp;**These are all important for you to determine before settling with a particular agent.

We’d love to sit down with you or someone you know and discuss what we do to get homes sold for the most money in the fastest time. Give us a call!
