Today I want to give you a market recap on how the first quarter of 2018 did compared to 2017 and discuss what that means moving forward in the market this year.

For the first quarter of this year, 387 home sold in the Buda-Kyle area, compared to the 350 we saw in Q1 2017. That is a little more than a **10% increase from this time last year**. We also saw our sales price go from $242,000 in 2017 to $252,000 in 2018.

Going into the next quarter of our seller season, we will see more homes come on the market, but **we do have a very low inventory right now**—we only have 408 homes on the market. With a demand of 130 homes being sold every month, that means we are still firmly in a seller’s market.<br><br>**Buyers should be thinking about what is going on with interest rates**. We are still at historic lows, with the average of 4.75% for a 30-year conventional loan. Rates are expected to increase again before the end of the year, so buying now before it becomes more expensive is a great idea. There are still deals to be had, so if you have a good agent, make use of that resource and put them to work for you.
