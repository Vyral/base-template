It’s time for another look at our New Jersey real estate market.

The first question that comes to mind is: Are we in a buyer’s market or a seller’s market?

By definition, a buyer’s market is one where the supply of homes is more than six months. A seller’s market is one with a supply that is less than six months.

With that being said, we’re still in a healthy seller’s market. **Currently, we have about 3.3 months of supply.**&nbsp;

Housing inventory for the month of October amounted to just 657 homes on the market. Because inventory is so low, there has been a 10% increase in home values since this time last year. Additionally, interest rates are still at historic lows.&nbsp;

So, what does all of this information mean?&nbsp;

Actually, it indicates that now is a great time to sell. **There are a lot of multiple-bid scenarios still occurring in our market.**

If you’re interested in purchasing in today’s market, you should know that there are also currently some benefits for buyers.

My team and I would be happy to help you, as a buyer, locate off-market properties that might suit your needs.&nbsp;

As always, my team and I appreciate your questions. If you send us a question and we feature it in a video, you’ll receive a $25 Starbucks gift card.&nbsp;

So, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
