**As your processor, my job is to package your loan for the underwriting.** I'll reveal all the documents you've already sent to your loan officer and I'll request anything else we might be missing so we can be sure we have all necessary documents.

Next, I'll order all of our third party things like verification of employment, tax transcripts, title, appraisal, and insurance. It's very important that you know who your insurance agent is early on! We can help with that if you need some referrals.


The next step is to send it to underwriting, which only takes a couple of days. Sometimes that review goes perfectly and we don't need anything else, but there may be follow-up questions or more documents that we need.

I'm always here to help! If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.
