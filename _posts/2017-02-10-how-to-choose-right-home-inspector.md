If you need to order a home inspection, it’s important you pick the right home inspector. Here’s how.

**Want to Sell Your Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.com/list/" target="_blank">Get the Value of Your Central or Southwest Virginia Home</a>
**Looking to Buy a Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.net/" target="_blank">Search All Homes on the MLS</a>

A home inspection is an essential part of any home sale, so I want to go over some things you should be aware of when ordering one.

Many people are curious as to who chooses the home inspector. The answer is you. I would recommend, before hiring the inspector, that you **call them and ask them questions about what they check and what their process is like when inspecting a home.**

Do they actually get on the roof? Do they have a septic or sewer camera? Do they do thermal imaging? If there is anything that you are concerned about or want to know if they can do, you need to ask them if they do it. **Never just assume they can and will do something for you.**

Not all home inspectors are created equal. **Just make sure you pick the one that works best for you.**

If you have any questions please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m always happy to help!
