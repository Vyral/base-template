How many times do you find yourself going through the grind of life wanting to be healthy, trying to be healthy, but not having any motivation to do so?

If so, we encourage you to **get together with a group of friends and share your fitness plans with them**. Your group doesn’t have to be in your general vicinity; it can be from all over the place. In our own fitness group chat, we have friends from Dallas, New Orleans, Minnesota, and Oklahoma. Each and every day, we share our workout plans with each other. We also take pictures of our food and share our daily weight so we can keep each other accountable.&nbsp;

At the end of the day, as human beings, we’re not meant to be on an island all by ourselves. We’re meant for communities and interaction. **Finding like-minded people with the same fitness goals will help motivate you**.&nbsp;

So join a boot camp. Join a CrossFit gym. Find a workout partner you can exercise with. Doing this kind of thing will push you toward your goal and make it easier to obtain. Get together with some friends and start building your fitness community. You deserve to be healthy.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help you.
