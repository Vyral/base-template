Today I wanted to talk about five things that you should never compromise on as a buyer:

**1. The floor plan.** Make sure that it fits your needs now and in the future.

**2. The school district.** Even if your kids are out of the house, this matters for resale value. Â You can find out about the different municipalities online to see what school system the home you are looking at is in.

**3. The neighbors.** If you are interested in a house in a neighborhood you are unfamiliar with, drive around during different times during the day to make sure you will be happy and comfortable there.

**4. Your budget.** It is important not to overextend yourself financially. You want to be comfortable with what you are buying.

**5. The commute.** Maybe take a test drive of the commute before you decide to pull the trigger. This is another important factor.
