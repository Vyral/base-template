Meet Shelby Cocke—team Lally’s newest buyer’s agent. Shelby was first drawn to our team after noticing our powerful online presence. She also cites our great culture and commitment to the community here on the island of Oahu as motivating factors behind her decision to join. Having been born and raised here on the Hawaiin Islands, Shelby feels excited to now be part of a team that helps buyers, sellers, and homeowners in our community. We look forward to having her aboard and can’t wait for you to meet her in person soon. To learn more, watch this short video. If you have any other questions or would like to learn more about Shelby (or about any of our great team members), feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
