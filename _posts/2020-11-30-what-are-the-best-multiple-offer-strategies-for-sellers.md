On this episode, we’re focusing on multiple-offer strategies for sellers.

Heather Burnside and I are back once again to give you the latest in Central Iowa real estate news. During this episode, we covered a lot, from multiple-offer strategies that can help sellers in this market to an interview with brand-new homeowner Emory Songer. Most of these strategies are things your agent should know about already, but if they don’t, we’re happy that we’re able to share them with you today. For example, feedback is extremely important from buyers, especially those who have made offers.
