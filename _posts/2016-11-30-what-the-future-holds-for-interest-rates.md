Are Fed Rates going up?

Over the past few months, we've been hearing about a possible rate increase from the Federal Reserve. First, experts were predicting that the Fed would raise interest rates in September.

That didn't happen. Now we're being told rates will go up in mid-December… we just don't know by how much.

**All this uncertainty is making people very uncomfortable**.

Because of the uncertainty, news outlets are parsing every word Fed members are saying, and everyone is wondering: Will there be a rate increase? Will mortgage rates increase as well? What will happen to the real estate market?

My personal opinion is this: the moves by the Fed are nothing to worry about. I think it’s simply another case of people getting nervous while waiting for the test results.

**In fact, I believe that an increase in the Fed Rate will have minimal impact on the real estate market in Mansfield for three reasons**.

First, mortgage rates often move independently of the Fed Rate. An increase in the Fed Rate might actually lead to a decrease in mortgage rates — this is exactly what happened the last time the Fed increased rates, back in December of 2015.

Second, the likely rate increase will be small, probably 0.25%. If mortgage rates were to increase by the same amount, they would still would be at historically low levels.

Third, we know the members of the Fed are concerned with the shortage of new housing right now — it’s right there in their September meeting notes. Because of this, any actions they take will keep the real estate market in mind. &nbsp;

**In short: the real estate market is doing great right now—and it's likely to stay that way, with or without a Fed Rate increase**.&nbsp;
