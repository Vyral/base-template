The real estate market has gone through some big changes this year. I was visiting a friend recently, and I found out that in his mind, the bubble had burst and the market had crashed. Let's talk about what truly happened to the housing market in Utah.

From 2007 to 2011, Utah home values dropped by 22% and people thought it was the worst thing in the world. From 2012 to 2019, the average home value went up by 69%. That was record appreciation at the time. A real estate cycle is typically five to seven high years and then five to seven low years. However, **from 2020 to 2022, home values rose by 62%.** The historic average home appreciation rate in the United States is 4% to 5% annually, so going up 62% in less than three years is crazy.

Recently, home values have come down by about 10%. However, the media has created a public perception that the market crashed. **Home values have gone up 131% since 2012, so the recent 10%&nbsp; dip is not a big deal.** People are still buying and selling real estate.

If you have a need or desire to move right now, let’s have a conversation. Don’t believe the sensationalist news articles. Reach out to my team and I at any time by phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
