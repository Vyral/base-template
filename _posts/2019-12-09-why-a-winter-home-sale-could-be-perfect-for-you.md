Today I wanted to debunk a myth I hear a lot around this time of year. It goes something like this: *“If you want to sell your home for the most money, you need to wait until spring and summer.”*

This statement is simply not accurate. **In fact, some of the strongest times to sell your home occur in the fall and winter.** As we get into January and February, that’s when we see homes start to sell more quickly and for more money.

One reason for this is that there is simply less competition on the market. **This makes it easier to attract buyers to your home and helps it stand out.** Additionally, there’s a sense of urgency for buyers that isn’t there in the spring and summer.

In a perfect world, everyone would buy and sell in the summer because it’s more convenient with the weather, schedules, etc. But life happens. Those who decide to sell in the winter usually decide to do so for a specific reason, whether it’s a job transfer, change in familial status, or some other reason.

**Don’t buy into the hype that you have to wait until late spring or early summer.** You can sell earlier in the year and possibly get more money and a faster sale. If you have any questions about your particular situation or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. Happy holidays to you all.
