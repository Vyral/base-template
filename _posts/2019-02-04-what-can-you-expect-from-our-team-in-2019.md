Today I’m excited to give you a market update and let you know what you can expect from the real estate market (and from our team) in 2019.

2018 ended with an extreme surge in real estate activity. **I believe this is largely due to the fall slowdown we saw from Hurricane Michael.** Vacation travel was down and there was a lot of recovery involved. I’m happy to report that they are rebuilding in Panama City and they'll rebuild stronger than ever before.

As a native of the area, I’ve only evacuated from one storm during my time, and we were able to recover and protect our families. **It’s very rare for a hurricane to hit the same place more than once.**

I think the 2019 market is going to be very active. At the same time, it’s important to price competitively. There are a lot of buyers in the marketplace right now looking for homes, and you have a better shot at catching their eye if you price yours correctly.

For example, a friend of mine was looking for a coastal destination to move to and I convinced him to take a visit. It was amazing to see him and his family fall in love with the Emerald Coast, and six months later, they‘re now full-time residents of the area. We’re seeing more and more people do this because of their ability to work remotely.

**For spots along the Gulf Coast, our area has gained exposure as a place to be, and I’m so honored to share that with people and see their lives be improved because of it.**

As far as our team is concerned, there’s a lot to catch you up on. We just went live with a new concierge website, [enjoyemeraldcoast.com](https://www.enjoyemeraldcoast.com/){: target="_blank"}. We’ll be featuring our favorite entertainment, dining, and activity companies. We want to make this a destination website to show people how much there is to do here.

Our team is becoming ultra-specialized in our roles. We have a buyer’s specialist team, seller’s specialist team, marketing department, closing department, and more. Everyone is laser-focused in their roles and aren’t distracted from other areas of the business. Our agents will always give you our full, undivided attention before, during, and after the transaction.

If you have any questions about the Emerald Coast or about real estate, in general, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
