I’ve got some important information to share today with those of you who have been curious about when an economic recovery might happen. The first thing they’re expecting is a “v” shaped recovery, which means that because we saw a rapid and quick decline, we’ll see a sharp and quick rebound. Compared to other recessions we’ve had in the past, it has taken much longer to recover. Another thing you should know is that our unemployment rate will drop significantly in just the next year.
