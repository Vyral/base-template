Are you looking for a trusted real estate agent who can be your resource wherever you may be in and out of the country? You may know me as your Portland home real estate resource, but I also spend some time in other cities. We spend time in Bend, New York, and I’m originally from Michigan.

Being in these places and attending conferences helped me pick up content and knowledge on the latest trends in the industry and translate that to something that makes sense for you. It also allows me to network with other agents across the country and around the world.

Many people overlook that if you’re moving from Portland to another city, you might reach out to me to sell your home but then feel lost about what to do next. I want you to reframe your thinking and call me for everything you need.

**I’m really proud of the relationships I’ve built in the industry over the last 21 years.** I attend conferences regularly, participate in masterminds with top agents at my company, and have connections beyond that. When you let me know where you’re headed, whether buying or selling, I can match you with the right agent for your needs.

It’s important that if I’m going to put my name on a referral, that you have an amazing experience. That means I’ll talk with the agent and ensure they clearly understand your real estate experiences here. I want you to receive the same level of service in the city you’re moving to.

This is just a reminder that whether you have questions about real estate in Portland or anywhere else, give me a shout.
