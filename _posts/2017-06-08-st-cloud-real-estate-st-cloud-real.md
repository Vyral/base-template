When it comes to the state of the St. Cloud real estate market, I'm happy to report that it's continuing to be very strong like it has been in recent months.

The inventory of homes for sale is a bit low, but has gone up since the first of the year. We have about 864 homes on the market, and interestingly enough, we also have 498 pending sales in our market.

Compared to last year at this time, we had about 380 pending sales, so sales are strong currently. Inventory last year was about 1,200 homes.

Inventory is good, but it's a little bit tight. **As a result, homes are moving quickly.** We see quite a few homes sell as fast as a week to eight weeks. The great news in real estate is that interest rates are right around 4% or even better on some days.

If you're thinking about making a move, it's a great time due to low interest rates and good home prices with a decent selection.

If you have any questions, you can always give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to helping you with your move!
