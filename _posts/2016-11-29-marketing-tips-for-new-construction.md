We are excited to be joined today by Heather Feldman, who is going to talk to us about marketing as it relates to new construction and new home sales. Heather has been doing new home sales since 1998 and she has a lot of knowledge and experience in this market. She knows how homes are built and what to expect through the process.

There has been a spike in new construction in our area recently, which opens the door to a lot of fabulous properties and a lot of fabulous opportunities. Here are the top three things agents should consider when they go down the new construction road:

1. **Find a great general contractor.** It’s important to find one who has subcontractors that they have worked with and vetted as well.

2. **Know the numbers that are in front of you in regard to the new build and know what they mean.**

3. **Be ahead of schedule.** Things will sneak up on you and you don’t want your build to fall apart because you haven’t made the necessary decisions to proceed.

**This is a stressful process, and when buyers have someone like Heather who can keep them on track and keep things manageable, it’s a lot easier. The build process is also very complex. Things will come up and buyers will have to decide if they want one option over another.

You also want to have a good idea of what the budget will be ahead of time. You can build a really nice home for around $300 per square foot. Work with your architect during the process and ask them what you can control during the process.

I hope you all enjoyed hearing from Heather today. If you have any questions for her or me, give us a call, send us an email, or fill out the form below and we’ll follow up with you. We look forward to hearing from you!
