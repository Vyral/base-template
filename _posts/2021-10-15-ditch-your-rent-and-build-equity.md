Should you rent, or should you own? It’s a common question, so today, we want to go over a case study to give you a better understanding of the situation.&nbsp;

Let’s take a look at a pretty average property. It’s a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment on the north side of Chicago with parking included. If you check out the video at 0:55, you can get a more specific picture of where the apartment is located.&nbsp;

If you want to rent this property, your average rent per month will be around $2,869. That’s a pretty big amount, and over the course of a year, you’ll be coughing up $34,428 in payments per year. **Over five years, that amount will be $172,140.** That’s a lot of dough, but the worst part is that you aren’t even building any equity over this five-year period.&nbsp;

In contrast, that same rental payment of $2,869 would have bought you a $344,400 condo. This is based on a 5% down payment, our current interest rates, and average taxes. In five years, even in the unlikely event that your home doesn’t appreciate at all, you’ll have built up $42,693 in equity. When it comes time to sell your home, **that money will go right back in your pocket.&nbsp;**

Hopefully, this example made it clear why ownership is better than renting. If you are looking to become a homeowner or invest in real estate, please give us a call. We are always willing to help.
