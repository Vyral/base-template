For all of our friends and clients who bought or sold homes with us, we’d like to say thank you. Bob Sokoler here, from the Sokoler Team of Remax Properties East. You may know that we recently had our pie giveaway, and it was a roaring success. Even in the rain, it was delightful getting to see so many of our treasured clients.

**This year, we gave away 275 pies with the help of our valued sponsors.** We had the weighty apple pies, delicious pecan pies, and, of course, the traditional pumpkin pies. Many of you wondered about the secret behind the amazing flavors of those pies. Well, we can reveal to you that after a lengthy series of taste tests, we actually settled on Costco to provide the pies for us. So, if you’re looking for a second helping, now you know where to find them.

Again, thank you so much for all of your business and referrals this year. Our pie giveaway is always a treat, and we’re happy to share it with you. Remember, if you have any questions about real estate, please feel free to reach out to us by phone or email. We’re always proud to be your resource for all of your real estate needs.
