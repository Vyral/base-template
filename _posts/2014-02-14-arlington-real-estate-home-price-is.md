Today we wanted to talk about the importance of pricing but before I go into that, I wanted to point out a few features of my blog. If you’re looking to buy a home, follow the link on our blog that will give you the most up to date information about the available properties. We also have a home valuation tool if you’re interested in the current value of your home.

**What Determines Whether and Propery Sells or Not **

There are three things that will determine whether or not a property will sell: how it is priced, the condition and how it shows and the marketing. If you’re working with a great realtor, they will team up with you to decide on the price and on the condition. The profession, proactive realtors know how to maximize your exposure in terms of marketing.

**What is the Most Important Factor **

Out of all of these determining factors, pricing makes for 80% of its success. When pricing your home, realize that you’re in a competition and at some point you have to win first place. When buyers choose properties, they narrow down their top 5-8 choices. After those choices are made, buyers drive to these properties to view them in person. If you or someone you know has listed a home and it never showed, usually that means that they were very far out of the price bracket they would have sold in.

If you price your home and it shows consistently but you never get an offer, you become the home that sells the other houses. Buyers look at your house but compare it to a reasonably priced home and make an offer on it. Only when your home is priced right where the home should sell is where you will maximize your opportunity. When you make it to that point, buyers who have to buy that day will converge on your home and create a multiple offer scenario.

When our clients are able to listen to us, analyze market data realistically and we price the home right where it should sell, we generate multiple offers. This is a very consistent trend and we have even been selling homes for more than what they’re listed for. A professional realtor understands how important price is and studies the market on a daily basis.

If you or someone you know needs help selling a property, I would be honored to sit down with them and analyze their situation. Thanks and have a great day!
