Today I want to talk to you about what could be the most important decision of your real estate career. I am of course talking about how to choose the right real estate brokerage.

Success comes from the alignment between the internal factors of motivation and desire on your part and the external factors of the type of support your office environment provides. True success comes when those factors are in alignment, or when your values match the values of a company that you are working for.

When I talk about values, I do not mean what is good and what is bad. I'm talking about your wants and needs. Where are you headed? What is your ambition? And, how do you want to get there?

When you find an office environment with other people who share those same values and commitments, then you have aligned yourself for breakthrough success.

Here at Abby Realty, we have built our company culture on two primary values. First of all, **we encourage a productive culture.** We want to provide an environment that supports success at the highest levels. Our agents have different levels of aspirations and we do not judge those. Whether you want to make a little bit or knock it out of the park, we support all our agents to achieve their goals.

**We also have a camaraderie culture** because we do not just want Lone Rangers. A long time ago, I heard someone say that the only thing better than getting rich is getting rich with your friends.

While getting rich does not have to be your aspiration, would it not be nice to share your successes and challenges while on your journey to your aspirations? That is the commitment we have to each other here. We have encapsulated this productivity and camaraderie culture into a slogan about sharing the joys and the sorrows of the journey together.

If this sounds like the type of environment that you may excel, please feel free to give me a call. I would love to meet you so that we can go over this together.
