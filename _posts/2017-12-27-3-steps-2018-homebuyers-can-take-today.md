What can you do now to prepare for your 2018 home search? I have three steps to help you be a strong buyer in the new year.

As we head into the new year, people are talking about resolutions and their future plans. Some of you may be planning on buying your first home or selling your current home to move into a new one.

As we look forward to your 2018 real estate goals, there are a few things you can do now in order to get your home search off to a great start.

**1. Get connected with a local lender.** They will help you find out what your credit score is and what your buying power will be. They’ll also help you better position yourself in the market and start the pre-approval process. Being pre-approved makes you a strong buyer.

**2. Sit down with a real estate consultant** who’s going to take the time to identify your needs and match you with the right mortgage consultant. They will make sure that you don’t miss out on any opportunities in the market. It’s a great time to purchase a home. It’s a little busy because of the holidays, but sellers who are on the market now are highly motivated to sell. They are taking advantage of the low inventory to make their house jump out to you, and there are a lot of ways to approach that.

**3. Make sure that you don’t do anything to negatively affect your purchasing power,** especially during the holidays. Don’t take out new credit lines or new credit cards. Be careful how much you spend on frivolous things, and try not to overspend on gifts. Don’t do anything that would affect your ability to purchase a home.

These three steps will put you in a strong position to purchase a home. If you have any other questions about buying a home in 2018, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
