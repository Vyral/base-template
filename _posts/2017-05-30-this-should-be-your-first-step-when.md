The first step of the home buying process isn’t looking at homes. It’s figuring out which homes you can actually afford.

I know that there are many people who think you should start the home buying process by taking a look at homes online. However, that’s not what your first step should be.

The first step when buying a home should be to speak with a mortgage professional. They will look at your credit score, let you know if there is anything you need to fix, and issue that all-important pre-approval letter once they have gone through all of your financial information. **You need that pre-approval letter when you make an offer on a home. Sellers likely won’t entertain an offer without one.**
