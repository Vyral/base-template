Hi folks, and welcome back to my video blog.

Today I wanted to go over the topsy-turvy topic of interest rates in the housing market. I've had a lot of people ask me about the state of interest rates; what happened to them previously, what's happening now, and what I think will happen in the future? I'd like to take the time now to basically give you the quick overall of what I tell clients face-to-face.

First off, about 6 months ago interest rates were hovering around 3.5%. This unprecedented low rate for the buyers was like taking candy from a baby. Buyers were buying in force and sellers were enjoying the vast number of buyers. This caused an increase in bidding wars, houses shot above list price, and buyers were pulling out all the stops to buy property. But once the government decided the market was getting overheated, they began buying mortgage-backed securities (spending around $85 billion a month). This is important, because the government will most likely stop purchasing mortgage-backed securities early next year, so buyers need to be aware that the rates will go up soon!

Right now, we are sitting around 4.5%. But we feel, given the decision by the government, that interest rates will go up soon. Based on our knowledge of the situation, it looks like interest rates will jump into the 5 percentile next year. Once again, now is the time to buy! Get that cheap mortgage plan while the interest rates are still down in the 4 percentile and reap the benefits of a buyer's market!

Any other questions or comments? Let me know.
