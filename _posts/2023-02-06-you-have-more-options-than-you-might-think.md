One of the things that we do differently is we present all the options to you, and your job is to choose which option works best for you and your family. Letâ€™s talk about your options when you're looking to sell your home.&nbsp;

Many people have either taken a forbearance or are having trouble getting caught up on their payments. However, there's still a lot of equity in their homes. What we want to help you understand is that there are ways to preserve your equity and not need to give it up. We can walk you through the steps of how to do that.

**We've partnered with other companies like HomeLight that can provide more options for you.** We can do instant offers. We can sell homes as-is. We can put money into a home. We have bridge loan options. There are so many different options that we bring to the table. Our job is to explore the available options because it will give you a lot more flexibility.

If you have any questions or would like to set up a consultation, don't hesitate to call or email us. We look forward to hearing from you.
