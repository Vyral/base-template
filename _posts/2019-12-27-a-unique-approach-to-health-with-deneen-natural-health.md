I am so excited to introduce you to Dr. Shana Deneen with Deneen Natural Health. I wanted to talk to her because she does something quite special that I think everyone should know about.

**At Deneen Natural Health, Shana brings a more natural approach to health, wellness, and disease prevention by practicing naturopathic medicine and acupuncture.**

People come in for a variety of reasons. Maybe they’re trying to get pregnant, going through side effects of cancer treatment, or simply have some back or neck pain. **What makes Deneen Natural Health different is that they offer supplemental solutions to improving the health of their patients.** There are a lot of natural ways to promote health through nutrition, acupuncture, and herbal medicine.

As far as diet and nutrition go, she’s a big promoter of eating legumes like lentils, split peas, and beans. **These foods are really healthy and can help prevent heart disease, promote gut health, and help with the prevention of many different kinds of cancer.**

For those with cancer undergoing treatments with a lot of side effects, acupuncture is a great way to mitigate those effects and improve their overall quality of life.
