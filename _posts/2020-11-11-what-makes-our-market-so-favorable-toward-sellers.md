Due to low inventory, Charleston is in a very strong seller’s market.

The current state of our Charleston real estate market is heavily dependent on inventory. Over the last few months, inventory has continued to drop. In a steady market, there are usually around 5,000 homes for sale. As of the recording of this video, there are 3,010 homes for sale—we’ve been hovering around the 3,000 mark lately.&nbsp;

**What we need are home sellers who are motivated to list right now.** The good news for sellers is that interest rates are still low, which means buyers are motivated to buy. Therefore, your home stands a great chance of selling if you price it correctly and optimize its condition. You’re already in one of the best seller’s markets Charleston has ever seen.&nbsp;

If you’re a buyer, the situation is tricky due to our lack of inventory. Make sure you’re serious about buying, organized, have enough money saved up, and have a pre-approval letter ready before moving forward.&nbsp;

If you have questions about our Charleston market or any part of the home buying or selling process, don’t hesitate to call or email me today. I’d love to help you.
