Welcome to the latest episode of *What’s Working Now!*

Today, I’ll discuss why you should sell now instead of waiting. Many people want to wait until after the election or after the holidays; others want to wait for the spring market.

Let’s talk about why you might not want to wait.

Most agents tell their clients, “Let’s wait until after the holidays.” I wonder if they say that because they are on vacation and don’t want to be bothered. I am in town during the holidays, and so are many well-qualified buyers that are ready to pounce. These buyers (and other agents that stay in town) call me daily and ask, “Marjorie, what’s on the market right now? What’s coming up?”

**There is so much demand right now, but there is no supply.** January is the beginning of our spring market, so that is when we’ll start to see more houses coming on the market. By listing now, you will avoid all of that competition and attract those highly motivated buyers.

Other people are worried about what's going to happen now that the election is over. So we have a new president—I have been doing this since 1980, so I have been through many elections. I can’t think of one single time that the election has ever affected my business. People are always moving in and out. If they are moving in from another state for a short period of time, they are usually renters, which won’t affect you if you’re not in the rental market.

Some sellers just want to wait until spring. Sellers will say, “Marjorie, my house will look so nice once my azaleas bloom,” or, “Wait until my tulip garden comes up.” They don’t want to list right now. However, this December, there are many buyers who cannot find a house because of multiple offers. Do you want to wait until spring? Do you think these buyers care about your azaleas or your tulips?

When buyers look for a home in the winter, none of the houses that they look at have azaleas. Those houses are still going to sell and they are going to sell for top dollar because there is high demand and low supply. **If you wait until spring, you will miss out on good buyers who are willing to pay top dollar.**

In short, you don’t have to wait to put your home on the market. Now is a great time to sell your home.
