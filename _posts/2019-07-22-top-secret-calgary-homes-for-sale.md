Today I am going to share with you, not one but three of our top coming soon listings before they are out on the MLS and available for purchase to anyone else.

Have you been, or do you know someone who is, frustrated because you keep just missing out on the best deals? You find a place you love and go to the open house or call the agent and it’s already gone. This can feel like a waste of time and be heartbreaking.

Would you be surprised to know that you are probably missing places that were actually perfect for you because they were gone so fast? **It happens to people every day, particularly in the styles, communities, and price ranges with the highest demand**.

Often this happens because somebody else heard about it either before it hit the market or the instant it came on. Our coming soon inventory is constantly changing, so make sure you let us know if you are looking for anything in particular, and we can keep you updated.

We have access to a number of other agents and their coming soon listings. **This not only gives you a secret advantage over other buyers, but it also makes sure you don’t miss out on some of the best places**. All three of these properties are in desirable areas in the fastest moving price range of $375,000 to $475,000. As you’ll see, these homes are going to see a lot of action.

**Our first property is a bungalow in the SW neighbourhood Westgate**. It is currently being painted, so it’s going to look even better than it does now. People just love the mature trees and the easy access to bow trail and downtown.

**The next property is a 1,400 square foot bungalow with hardwood floors in the NW neighbourhood Dalhousie**. This is located on a great crescent and close to sought-after schools. This really has some great potential for somebody that is willing to do a little bit of work and updating. Do you want to build some sweat equity? This is an opportunity to do so.

**The third secret deal is a nearly 1,600 square foot two-story with a double-attached garage and a fully developed basement for under $375,000**. It is currently being painted inside and the huge back decks are being stained. This one will get scooped up quickly. It’s also close to schools, shopping, transit, and the Stoney and Deerfoot trails.

If you want more information on these, other properties, or our other unique home marketing systems and strategies, give us a call or send us an email today. We’d be happy to put our particular set of skills to work for you.
