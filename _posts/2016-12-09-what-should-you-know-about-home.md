We’ve got some great info for you today on home inspections: what they are, who does them, and what they accomplish.

If you are getting ready to purchase a home, I always recommend a home inspection during the due diligence period, after your offer is accepted but before closing. I can recommend several reputable inspectors that I have used in the past that will do a good job for you.

**Home inspections are intended to point out adverse conditions in a home, not cosmetic flaws.** At the end of the inspection, you should meet with the inspector so they can review a summary of their findings in the home. There will be flaws in every home, but it’s important to pay special attention to health and safety issues.

A home inspection report just includes the basics. **During an average inspection, the inspector will consider hundreds of items in and around the interior and exterior of the home.** The foundation, purchases, deck, chimney, and roof will all be inspected. So will the electrical, plumbing, heating and air, attic, and garage inside the home. Having a detailed report will help make you more comfortable with the home you’re buying.

The buyer hires and pays for the home inspection because you want the inspector to be working for you and alerting you to any potential problems in the home.

If you have any questions about home inspections or are looking to buy or sell a home, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.
