There are a lot of serious buyers out in the market right now. Here’s why listing now will help you capture this segment of buyers.

There are some great benefits to be had by getting your home on the market during this time of year. **A lot of people tell us they are waiting until next month to get their home on the market, but we have been advising them to move up their timeline.** Why?

Well, if you look at the numbers and how many homes are on the market versus what actually sells and closes, the percentage is ridiculously high. In February and March, the same number of buyers are out there, but inventory doubles or triples.

**Right now, the only buyers out there are serious ones.** This is because they may have had a shift in income or a job change. Whatever their reason, they need to close on a home quickly. You might not get as many showings right now as you would during the rest of the year, but the people looking will always be serious buyers.

If you’ve been thinking about selling, **get a time set up with one of our listing specialists to get a full equity evaluation on your property** to see what’s going on in the market in your area and what your competition is trying to sell for. Then we can determine whether it makes sense for you to sell your home now or if you should wait.

As always, if you have any questions, we would be glad to answer them. Just give us a call or send us an email. We can’t wait to hear from you!
