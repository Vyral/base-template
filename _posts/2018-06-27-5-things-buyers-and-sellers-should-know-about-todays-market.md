Now that we’ve reached the middle of the year, it’s time for a market update. I was looking at some statistics from our MLS recently and discovered five things I think you should all be aware of:

**1. The number of listings is down.** This is true for all the various counties in our local market. Milwaukee County is down 8%, Waukesha County is down 10%, Ozaukee County is down 8.6%, Washington County is down 11.1%, Walworth County is down 11.5%, and Racine County is down 8.3%. So, as you can see, there are fewer options available these days for buyers.

**2. Sales are still up****.** Despite the lack of listings, sales are up across our market with the exception of Waukesha and Walworth County.

**3. The average days on market are down.** The average days on market for all of the counties I mentioned earlier is approximately 39. A year ago, the average days on market was around 10 to 15 days higher than this.

**4. Median sale prices are up.** In Milwaukee County, prices have risen about 5%, for a median sales price of $160,000. In Waukesha County, prices are up over 5%. There, the median sales price is $295,000. Ozaukee County’s median sales price is up to $300,000, having risen 7% over last year. In Washington County, the median sales price is nearly $250,000, which represents a whopping 17% increase over last year. Walworth County’s median sales price rose 12% to $213,000, and Racine County is up an astounding 26%, for a current median sales price of $170,000.

**5. Interest rates are on the rise.** This is something you’ve probably already heard. Yet, you should note that it’s still affordable to purchase a home. Right now, you can still get a 30-year fixed mortgage for about 4.5% or 4.75%. With that in mind, though, the Feds are set to raise rates a few more times by the end of the year. Whether you’re thinking of buying or selling, now is a great time to do so.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
