Compared to 2018, this year, you’ll be seeing a few interesting twists in design trends. Let’s jump right in:

**1. The color palette is expected to change.** On our Facebook page, we just released some of the new colors that paint companies are expecting to be the hot, new trends this year. Among these, you’ll see some Southwest-themed colors, including clay, black, green, and natural earth tones. That really coincides with other design trends, like pastels and jewel tones like baby blues, mint greens, blushing pinks, and rose golds. These colors are for wall colors and furnishings alike.

**2. Brass is coming back into style.** I don’t mean the brass you’d have found in the 1980s, but more of a modern bend. Other colors like gold and black are coming back, especially for hardware.

**3. Burnt yellow and 70s chic are returning.**  Additionally, bold florals and wallpapers are resurging in the marketplace.

These are some fun design tips to keep in mind if you are thinking of doing any changes to your decor in 2019. If you have any questions about other upcoming design trends, please reach out to us. We would love to have a conversation about what colors and patterns would fit in your home.
