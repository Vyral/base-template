Do you think succeeding in real estate is mostly luck? Sherrie Chris, the CEO of Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate said it best: “Luck is a form of intelligence. It’s the ability to identify opportunity and act upon it.” Getting lucky is one of the most important skills you can develop to be successful in real estate.

**Too many new agents get into the business with preconceived ideas of how things should be, leaving them to navigate difficult situations with blinders on.** In order to succeed in this business, it’s essential that we don’t form preconceived notions about our clients or the circumstances in which we may find ourselves.

Instead of looking at what could go wrong, I encourage you to look for what could go right. Treat every lead like it’s gold, and you are bound to get lucky.

Remember, if you have any questions about luck and skill or the business of real estate in general, please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I would be happy to serve as your resource for all of your business needs.
