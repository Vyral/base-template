I’m here at Foxfield Park in Westlake Village with Heather Case, the Radke Agency's Buyers Agent who is very near and dear to me. Heather has been really busy these past two months, and now she has a new addition to her family! Today I wanted to let Heather introduce her new bundle of joy to you all.

**Isabelle Michaela Case was born on May 1, and she is doing really well.** Her big sisters are with us as well—Violet and Caroline are being the best big sisters to baby Isabelle! Caroline especially loves to give Isabelle kisses and hugs.

We are so excited for Heather and her growing family, and **we can’t wait to watch baby Isabelle grow into a beautiful person.**
