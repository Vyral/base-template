What’s the latest design trend that homebuyers are looking for today? This year, we’re seeing exciting changes in how people decorate their living spaces, from adding tranquil spaces to embracing bold colors and unique styles. Here are seven trending style inspirations to elevate your summer home vibe.

1. **Organic, modern styles.** This style features sleek lines and crisp white or neutral-colored surfaces contrasted with natural materials or textures. Searches for “organic modern bedrooms” have tripled this year, and it makes sense because this style is a perfect way to create a calming and sophisticated atmosphere in your home.
2. **Dark and moody.** People are exploring bolder choices with dark paint colors, both inside and outside of the home, and are trending more than they’ve ever been. Think mossy greens, rich blues, and even black accents. Moody kitchens are also gaining popularity, and searches for dark ceiling styles increased by 60% compared to last year.
3. **Reading rooms.** The dark academia aesthetic is inspiring homeowners to create cozy and intimate spaces for reading and studying. In the first quarter of the year, searches for dark academia home styles tripled, while searches for library walls, reading corners, and book nooks were rising. This is great for bookworms with enough books to fill the shelves without looking cluttered.

4. **“Japandi” style.** Japandi is a blend of Japanese minimalism and Scandinavian functionality. This design is inspiring home interiors in the United States. It is about simplicity, natural elements, and creating harmony in your living space. Features like “wabi-sabi” and zen gardens where you can do yoga poses are also becoming more popular.
5. **Wellness.** Homeowners continue to prioritize wellness, and it goes beyond just having a home gym. More and more people are adding cold plunge pools, indoor saunas, and home spas to their remodeling plans.
6. **Leisure spaces.** Searches for listening rooms have more than doubled. It is also interesting that living room pianos, indoor bowling alleys, and game rooms are trending.
7. **Kids’ zones.** This year, race car beds are making a comeback, along with Jack-and-Jill bathrooms. A separate space for younger ones to hang out is also a great idea. Teen lounges and an individual gaming room for kids are suitable for separating play time from rest time.

These trends highlight homeowners' changing needs and desires. Whether you want a peaceful area, a space to bond with your family, or a stylish space that reflects your personality, there’s something for everyone. **If you have any questions about real estate, please call me at (515) 575-9950.** We’d love to talk!
