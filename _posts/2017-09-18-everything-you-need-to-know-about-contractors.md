Today’s subject is one we’ve covered in the past, but we recently had a situation that reminded us of its importance. I want to take a few moments to talk to you about contractors and what you need to know about them.

In this particular situation, we had a client buying a house where there was a heated tile floor in the master bathroom. Because the tile was cracked, the seller agreed to have their own contractor replace it.

The contractor came and broke up four tiles only to break the heating mat underneath. **Thinking they had repaired the issue, the contractor retiled over the top of the now broken heating mat.**

Because they didn’t remove all of the mortar that held the tile down, the new tile they put in ended up sitting about an eighth to a quarter of an inch higher than the rest of the tile. This became a tripping hazard, and was truly a horrifying repair.

At this point, we negotiated with the seller to have them pay for one of our own contractors. We wanted to make sure that this time things would be done correctly. When our contractors came out, they had to replace not only the entire floor, but the heating mat as well.

Now, the floor looks beautiful. If you are a seller and need to make repairs, be sure the job is going to be done right.

My team and I have spent years building a network of contractors who we know to do excellent work. **Real estate professionals like us will be a great source for finding recommended vendors.**

This is one of the things we like to offer you as an added value. Connecting you with quality vendors is something we’d be happy to do.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
