Sam Murzea, from MP Heating and Air Conditioning in Portland, is our go-to vendor when our clients have issues with HVAC systems. When Sam checks on these units, he often finds they aren’t maintained properly. Typically, people forget about their HVAC units and don’t know anything is wrong until they’re hot in the summer or cold in the winter. This is exactly why Sam suggests an annual checkup.

In an annual checkup, Sam’s team will check out all the electrical components, mechanical components, filters, coils, and everything else. This inspection will eliminate your stresses and worries about your HVAC system, all year long. If you have an AC unit, they can clean it in addition to checking the condenser and other components. Their goal is to prevent breakdowns and future repairs.

In between these annual checkups, Sam recommends changing air filters regularly. Different systems require different change intervals. He also recommends changing filters every 30 days in order to ensure the best performance.

If you ignore all of these things, you may end up with no heat on the coldest day of the year or no air conditioning on the hottest day of the year! Additionally, carbon monoxide can leak. To keep your family comfortable and safe, perform regular maintenance on your HVAC units. Pay attention to it, and definitely don’t forget about it!

If you have any further questions, please don’t hesitate to contact Sam or myself. We look forward to working with you!
