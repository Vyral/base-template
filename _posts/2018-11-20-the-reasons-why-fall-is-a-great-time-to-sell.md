There’s a misconception that when the fall season rolls around, it’s better to wait until to spring to put homes on the market. Since our climate in the Portland area is fairly mild and we don’t see a drastic drop in temperature, we actually sell about as many homes in the fall as we do in the spring. There are a few reasons why you might want to consider fall for listing your home.

**There’s less competition.** A majority of homeowners still hold on to the idea of spring being a better time to sell. This means a decrease in our fall listings, **and homes that are on the market will be competing with fewer sellers.** This may cause your home to sell for more money because your home is part of the smaller range of options buyers have.

Who are the people braving the cold, rainy days in search of a home? They are **motivated buyers** who want a home as soon as possible for a variety of different reasons. They’ll be more willing to compromise and negotiate on the selling price of a home. By dealing with these motivated buyers, you may be able to sell your home at a higher price. **Buyers aren’t as motivated in spring and also have a wider selection of homes to choose from.**

If you like the idea of dealing with less competition and more motivated buyers, fall is a great time for you to sell. If you’re looking to buy or sell a home, have any questions, or need further information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you.
