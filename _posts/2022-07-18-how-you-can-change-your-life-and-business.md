What are the three main things you can do to change your life and business tomorrow? These steps have altered my life more than anything else I’ve tried, and I think they could do the same for you:

{% include pullquote.html %}

1. **Clarify your personal mission.** Ask yourself some questions about exactly where you visualize yourself being to have the personal and financial freedom you want in the next five years. Write that down, and use it as your North Star. If you don’t know where you’re going, you’ll never get there.
2. **Hire a coach.** They will provide public accountability so you can create habits around the six key areas that are important to your life: fitness, health, finance, spirituality, your work life, and your personal life. These are some of the things that are important to most people. Whatever those key areas are for you, having a habit-stacking process that will change the way you approach each day is the next step. You can do it yourself, but it is supercharged when you work with a coach.
3. **Surround yourself with the right people.** Find five people who are already where you want to be in five years and meet with them regularly. I promise that you will become the average of the five people you connect with most often.

If you want to go deeper on these topics or get some recommendations for coaches, just email me. I’d be happy to talk with you.
