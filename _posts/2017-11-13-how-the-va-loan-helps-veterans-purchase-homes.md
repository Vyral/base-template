We can never truly thank our veterans enough for the sacrifices they make. These sacrifices are what allow us to enjoy the liberties and lifestyle we do in this country.

One way we can and do thank our veterans, though, is with the VA loan. VA loans allow veterans to buy property for nothing down. To help me cover this topic, I’m joined by a special guest: Charley Farley from Merrimack Mortgage.

To qualify for this loan, you must have been in the armed forces for a period of time that will vary depending on whether you were active duty or in the reserves, and whether you served during a time of war or a time of peace.

<br>**The first step is to apply for a Certificate of Eligibility (or CoE) from the Veterans Administration**. You can apply online, or you can provide a mortgage company like Charley’s with a copy of your DD 214 discharge papers to have them get a copy of your CoE for you.

The biggest benefit to this loan is that allows veterans to buy property with 0% down. Also, the VA funding fee that is required to participate is less expensive than the mortgage insurance you would pay for other, less beneficial programs.

**And because this loan is backed by the Veterans Administration, interest rates tend to be lower as well.**

If you apply with a lender who doesn’t do VA loans regularly, they aren’t going to be as enthusiastic about the program and may feel more confident suggesting something else. However, it is a great program. If you are a veteran of the armed services, you’ve absolutely earned the right to take advantage of it.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
