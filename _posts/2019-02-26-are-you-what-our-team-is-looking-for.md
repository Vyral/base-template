We had our best year ever in 2018, and now we’re aiming our sights even higher. We did 435 transactions last year, totaling $130 million in sales. Since our goal now is to hit over 650 units in 2019, **we need the help of some new talent.** But don’t worry—we have the training, the coaching, the leads, and the support you’ll need in order to flourish as an agent.

Our listing agents go on appointments, negotiate paperwork, and handle home inspections—**the rest is handled by our great behind-the-scenes staff.** Photography, room measurements, checklists, paperwork completion and prep, and much more is simply taken off your plate. Buyer’s agents get help with buyer presentations—your only concern should be with showing homes, writing offers, and negotiating.

If you’re ready to jump-start your career and begin handling 40 to 50 transactions a year, making a considerable amount of income along the way, **we’d be glad to put you in the environment where you can easily do so.**

If you’re interested in joining our team, have any questions about what your position would be here, or need more information, feel free to reach out to me at 410-638-9555. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
