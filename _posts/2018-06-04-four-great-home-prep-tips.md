Today I am going to give you a few tips if you have been thinking about putting your home on the market for sale. Here are four of the best things you can do as a home seller:

**1. Declutter your home**. If there are things that you are not using on a daily or weekly basis, they can be packed into moving boxes and stored neatly in your garage or other storage space.

**2. Neutralize the home**. This can refer to repainting any bold colors on the walls, specific decorating styles, or even odors. If you have collections around the house, move them out of the home so they are not distracting to the buyer. As far as odors are concerned, do not overwhelm buyers with incense or a strong perfume. The key is making the home smell neutral.

**3. Approve as many showing requests as possible**. If too many are declined, agents and buyers start to think that you’re not serious about selling the property.

**4. Try not to be there for the showings**. As nice and helpful as most sellers can be, it is still awkward for the buyer to have them there. A lot of times, it can actually deter the sale.

If you have any questions about selling your home or you are ready to list now, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
