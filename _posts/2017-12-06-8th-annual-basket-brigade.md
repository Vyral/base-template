We have been fortunate to run the Basket Brigade for the past two years. Thanksgiving 2017 was our most successful year to date.

We recently completed our eighth year at the annual Basket Brigade. This event was started by the Barton and Palmer families, but it got so big a few years ago that they turned control over to The Larkin Group. We’re honored to keep this tradition alive.

See the full story here: http://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2017/11/23/jmr-brigade-volunteers-surprise-260-local-families-with-baskets-of-thanksgiving-food/

Last year was our first year in charge and we were able to help 222 families. However, it was complete chaos. This year, I think we finally figured it out. We helped 260 families and it felt much easier.

A lot of Thanksgiving events will serve meals to those in need on Thanksgiving and that’s great. With Basket Brigade, however, we’re adding that element of home back into the equation. Families in crisis are nominated at stgeorgebasketbrigade.org, and then we build a full basket for them that contains everything they need for a complete Thanksgiving meal.

**We just wanted to give you a quick update on the success we had this year with the Basket Brigade.** If you have any questions for us about this event or about anything in the real estate world, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you soon.
