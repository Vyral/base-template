If you’re waiting for 3% interest rates to come back before making your real estate move, you might want to think twice. Today, the inflation rate is starting to drop, and as a result, mortgage rates have dipped below last year's peak. That's potentially great news if you're a buyer aiming to jump back into the housing market. Any drop in mortgage rates helps boost your purchasing power by lowering your expected monthly mortgage payments. This means the lower mortgage rates experts forecast this year could be just what you need to reignite your home-buying goals.

While this opens up a window of opportunity, remember that **you shouldn't expect rates to drop back down to record lows as we saw in 2021**. Experts agree that's not the range buyers should bank now. I think we could be surprised at how much mortgage rates pull back this year; however, they won’t be back down to 3% anytime soon because of inflation.&nbsp;

It's important to have a realistic vision of what you can expect this year, and that's where the advice of an expert real estate advisor is crucial. You may be surprised by the impact even a mild drop in mortgage rates has on your budget.
