Today I want to answer some of your questions about real estate throughout the state of Montana. We usually do this once a year, and to help me, I have a state-wide market report from the Montana Association of Realtors. I can’t wait to pass on some of this data. As a little bit of a spoiler: The least expensive cities in Montana are Butte and Great Falls. Both have a median price that’s under $300,000.

**You can watch the full report above or skip to each section using the timestamps provided:**
