How do you buy a new home when you need to sell your current house first?&nbsp;

We help people through this process all the time. Depending on your specific situation, **there are several different avenues you can pursue**.

First, we’ll talk to you about your personal timeline. We can negotiate a longer closing time for your house. We can even line it up so that you close a day or two before you close on the sale of your next house.&nbsp;

How? We keep an eye on market activity and the activity on your house. **We’ll tell you when to start looking for a home** so that you have as little lag time as possible between transactions. That way, instead of worrying about finding temporary housing, you may only have to spend one or two nights in a hotel.

If you need a little more time to find your next home, we can negotiate a rent-back. Basically, you’ll stay in your current home and rent it from the buyer until you find your next one. In some cases, we can also negotiate a pre-occupancy.&nbsp;

If you have to deal with two real estate transactions at once, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
