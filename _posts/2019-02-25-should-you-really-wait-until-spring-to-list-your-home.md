&nbsp;

Should you wait for the spring to list your home or should you do it now? When is the best time to sell your home?

Everyone assumes that the answer is spring, but think about it—if everyone has that same notion, that means you’ll have to compete with a ton of other sellers if you choose to list during that time.

When you list your home, you want it to stand out, and you give yourself a real advantage if your home is one of the first ones on the market that buyers can get excited about. **That’s why we’re advising our clients to list their homes sooner rather than later**. That way, they can also deal with buyers who are taking advantage of the still-low interest rates.

So far this year, we haven’t actually seen the traditional break that many home sellers take between winter and spring. **Sellers have been putting homes on the market in full force ever since 2019 began, and they’re continuing to sell, so it’s a great opportunity for buyers and sellers out there**.&nbsp;

If you’d like to put your home on the market now and take advantage of this situation, don’t hesitate to give us a call so we can help you sell for top dollar.
