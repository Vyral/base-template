What is the advantage of using RE/MAX?

I’ve chosen to associate with RE/MAX as my brokerage of choice primarily because it gives me great brand awareness. This means when I’m listing a home like yours, it will get a lot more exposure. We actually have five different websites we can market through RE/MAX:

* [thesilvateam.com](http://thesilvateam.com)
* [www.remaxgold.com](http://www.remaxgold.com)
* [global.remax.com](http://global.remax.com)
* [www.theremaxcollection.com](http://www.theremaxcollection.com)
* [home.remaxcommercial.com](http://home.remaxcommercial.com)

There are more than 104,000 agents who work with RE/MAX in 6,986 offices in 95 different countries. We know the importance of networking in today’s market, and our ability to network is unrivaled. Even if you’re relocating to another state or city here in California, we can reach out to a RE/MAX agent in that city or state in order to help you. I would even go so far as to personally screen those agents to make sure that they’re competent to handle your business.

RE/MAX likes to claim that nobody sells more homes than they do, and the data from the National Association of Realtors backs that up.

If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
