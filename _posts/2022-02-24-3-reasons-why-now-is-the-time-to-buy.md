If you don’t act soon, your dreams of buying could be gone. Here are three reasons why now is the time to make a move:

**1\. Interest rates are on the rise.** The Federal Reserve recently announced that they'll have four rate hikes by July 1.

**2\. Rising rates mean less buying power.** A 1% increase in your interest rate could cost you $50,000 in buying power. If you bought a $450,000 house now, your monthly payments would be about $1,900. Once rates go up, that same price and payment might net you a less valuable home in a completely different neighborhood or school district.

**3\. Property values appreciate 10% to 20% every month.** This quick rate of appreciation emphasizes the previous point. With values appreciating so quickly, you could be losing even more buying power.
