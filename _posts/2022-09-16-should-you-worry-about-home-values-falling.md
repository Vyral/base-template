Are you worried home prices are going to fall? I know many of us remember that home values in 2008 tanked. If you’re concerned it may happen again, you can put your mind at ease because the market today is very different. However, don't just take my word for it.&nbsp;

At 0:20 in the video above, the graph shows the latest home price forecasts from seven industry leaders. If we average all of them together, experts say that&nbsp; we'll see roughly 10% appreciation this 2022 nationwide. While that isn’t a 15% increase like the one we saw in 2021, it's certainly not a decline, and none of the experts are forecasting depreciation.

So if you're wondering if home prices are going to fall, here's your answer: **Experts are confident home prices will continue to climb this year** but at a more moderate pace than 2021. If you have questions about what's happening with home prices in our local area or have any related concerns, let’s connect\! I’d love to be your real estate consultant.
