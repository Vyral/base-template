Welcome to part two of our series about estate planning. I’ve invited Eric Froisland, a licensed attorney, to come back and explain estate planning in a little more detail.

When should you put an estate plan in place? **There’s really no right or wrong time.** However, Eric recommends that you start thinking about it more seriously after you’ve bought a home or had children.

Another thing to remember is that an estate plan is something that you need to update continually. **As your life changes, your estate plan should change too.** For example, you may need to update it after you have a child or get married. Should the worst happen, you don't want an ex-spouse or former friend to be listed as the decision-maker on your healthcare directive.

According to Eric, a typical estate plan will cost $1,000 to $1,500. **It’s something smart to get taken care of early** so that your family will be taken care of no matter what happens. If you have any questions for Eric or would like to hire him to set up an estate plan for yourself, give him a call at <a href="tel:801-290-2130">801-290-2130</a> or send an email over to <a href="mailto:froidlandtaxlaw@gmail.com">froidlandtaxlaw@gmail.com</a>.

If you have any other questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
