Are you interested in doubling your business?

Today, I’ve got two questions you can ask that can help you do just that. When done at the right time with a genuine attitude, asking these questions can go a long way in developing deep relationships with your customers. It will also help you with future referrals.

First, as a buyer consultation is coming to a close, ask your buyer the following before either of you leave: **“What are your biggest fears or concerns in the upcoming transaction?”** In this sometimes intimidating process, people want to feel understood and reassured.

There is a common belief that being a good listener is the best sales skill you can have. Personally, I believe that having empathy is a close second to that.

As professionals, we deal with the stress and uncertainties that come along with real estate transactions every day—but this likely isn’t the case for your client.

Being able to genuinely listen and take a sincere interest in their concerns will not only help to assuage your client’s fears, but also build a better relationship between you in general.

Put yourself in your client’s shoes—doing so will make a huge difference.

The second question you should ask should also be posed at the end of a buyer consultation. That question is: **“Is there anything unrelated to real estate that I can help you with?”** By asking your client this, you are showing a level of service that extends beyond what they likely expect of you.

While it’s true that an agent's job is not to be a therapist, the reality **is that going out of your way to do something nice for your client can really make an impact.**

After posing this question, listen to their response and consider taking notes. Empathizing with and caring for your clients will foster strong relationships and build a strong referral business for the future.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
