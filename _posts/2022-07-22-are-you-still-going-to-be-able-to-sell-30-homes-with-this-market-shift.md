This market shift is completely different from what we've been facing these past few months. Do you have the resources to still be successful in this new market?

The market that we're starting to see will be geared towards constantly makings phone calls for new business development. Here at The Dan Jones Group, we have at least 1400 leads per month that reach out to us for business. This gives our agents ample opportunity to write contract after contract.

If you want to be a part of a team that offers you massive support by handling your transactions, contract to close, so you can focus on prospecting, give us a call\! Let's have a confidential conversation about your goals so you can sell 30+ houses in your first year of real estate, not matter what the market looks like.
