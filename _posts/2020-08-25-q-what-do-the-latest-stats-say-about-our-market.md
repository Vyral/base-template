What do the latest stats say about our Clarksville market? We’re seeing the same trends here as we are nationwide.&nbsp;

First of all, inventory is getting lower and lower. We have half as many homes available now (488) than we did at this time last year (896). About 270 of these homes are new construction.&nbsp;

This means **if you’re a seller with a house that may have issues selling in a slower market, now’s the time to list it.&nbsp;**

If you work with the Air Assault Team, we’ll help you stage your home for the market and take all necessary safety precautions when showing it. Houses are selling within the first week we list them, and they’re selling at or over asking price.&nbsp;

What about buyers? Interest rates are very low, so **i**f you’ve been renting for a while, it’s a good time to buy because your mortgage payment would likely be less than your rent. Make sure you hire a buyer’s agent who’ll show you how to compete for the home you want because you’ll likely encounter multiple-offer situations.&nbsp;

**Here are some other key numbers, and how they’ve changed year over year:**

* The number of properties sold year to date has risen from 3,100 to 3,300
* The average list price has risen from $210,000 to $227,000
* The average sale price has risen from $208,500 to $226,000
* The average days on market remains mostly unchanged at 40 days

The biggest price range, comprising 27% of the market, seems to be from $150,000 to $250,000. This is a hot market segment, but any home listed below that is selling even faster. The price range from $250,000 to $1 million, meanwhile, comprises about 13% to 18% of the market, and those homes are selling at a healthy rate too.&nbsp;
