As a homebuyer, here are three questions you must ask an agent before you hire them:

**1. How many homes have you sold in the last 12 months?**

Many agents will tell you the number of years they’ve been in business, and that’s useful, but their recent activity is more relevant. Asking this question can tell you how well they know the market and how successful you can expect them to be when representing you. You’ll probably also want to ask whether they work primarily with buyers or sellers, since many agents specialize in one area or the other to some extent.

**2. Can I have the contact information for your last three deals?**

Anyone can claim to be a marvelous, effective real estate agent, but talking to their past clients can help you decide whether that’s actually true or just a bunch of hot air. When you talk to an agent’s previous clients, you don’t have to get too fancy to get useful information; just ask them to share their experiences. Before you get off the phone, ask them whether or not you can trust the agent and whether or not they’d use that same agent again.

**3. What is your strategy for my specific needs?**

As a buyer, you’ll want the agent to explain how they’ll search for your new home, how many homes you can expect to see, and how they handle multiple-offer situations. If you’re a seller, you’ll want to know where and how the agent will advertise your home and what their online marketing strategy is.

What kind of answers should you expect from these questions? **Ideally, you should get the sense that the agent in question is someone you can trust and feel comfortable working with.** At the same time, you’ll want them to be experienced and diligent, as evidenced by recent successful deals and a concrete action plan for your situation.
