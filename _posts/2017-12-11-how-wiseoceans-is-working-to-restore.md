I recently talked to Hannah Harries from WiseOceans about their Reef Restoration Project. Learn more about how they are working to reverse the effects of climate change.

The Seychelles is composed of 115 scattered islands in the Indian Ocean. This tiny nation finds itself at ground zero of climate change.

The sea level has risen almost a quarter inch each year.  El Niño’s warmer sea patterns are killing the coral, which usually prevents beach erosion.

However, one local organization is trying to make a difference.

Today, I’m joined by Hannah Harris, a Marine Educator at WiseOceans.

A lot of people don’t know this, but **70% to 90% of the world’s coral reefs have been destroyed over the past year thanks to climate change and El Niño.**

<a href="http://fourseasonsreefaction.com/2016/05/28/el-nino-and-the-third-global-coral-bleaching-event-what-has-happened-and-have-we-reached-the-end-of-the-tunnel/" target="_blank">El Niño</a> is a global weather event which occurs every two to seven years. It causes a shift in temperature patterns in the equatorial Pacific, which has global repercussions. El Niño is the warm phase of the cycle. Higher-than-average sea temperatures are bad news for corals.

WiseOceans is working hard to reverse the damage done to the coral.

WiseOceans has been based in the Seychelles for five years now. They are dedicated to raising awareness about the fantastic marine life in the area. Getting people up close to the fish is an important step in getting them to care about the environment.

**About two years ago, WiseOceans launched their Reef Restoration Project.** The aim of the project is to restore an area of reef within the bay. Guests at the Four Seasons hotel can come out and snorkel in the bay to see the wildlife, and WiseOceans educates them about restoring the reef.

WiseOceans has a coral nursery to grow new coral. They take corals that have broken off naturally from the reef (“We call them corals of opportunity,” says Hannah) and place them in the coral nursery. There, the coral can grow and thrive in a protected area. After a few months, the coral will reach a healthy, reasonable size. From there, they are transplanted straight onto the rock.

People can sponsor their own corals in the nursery and sponsor the reef.

This process is very time consuming, which is why a project director is there to look after the coral day in and day out.

Guests can get involved in the Reef Restoration Project, as can the local community. The education provided by WiseOceans helps people understand how vital the reefs are to us as human beings.

WiseOceans gets everyone they can involved. Hannah says, “We have workshops, talk at the local schools, run youth groups, take people snorkeling—the more local people we can get to care about the environment, the better.”

I would like to thank Hannah Harries for taking the time to educate us all about the Reef Restoration Project. You can visit <a href="http://www.wiseoceans.com/" target="_blank">www.WiseOceans.com</a> to learn more about how you can help give back and protect your environment, and for more information visiting Seychelles, visit the official website of the Seychelles Tourism Board <a href="http://www.seychelles.travel/" target="_blank">www.seychelles.travel</a>.

As always, if you have any real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
