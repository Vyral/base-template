I read a book recently that I should have read much earlier in my career, and I wanted to share it with you today. It’s called *“Profit First”* by Mike Michalowicz. It details a strategy for doing business that allows you to get paid first and make sure you know how much you should be spending, how much you should be saving, etc. It also teaches a way of dividing funds into different bank accounts so you know exactly how much money you have and for what.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm happy to help\!
