<div style="text-align: left;"><div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Why is your home not selling?<div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Thats a tough question. Here in the Tahoe Truckee area, you cant just put a For Sale sign in your yard and expect your home to go off the market. The answer, though, can usually be boiled down to one or a combination of five different reasons:<div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">1. **The home is overpriced.** Our average buyer is an out-of-towner who visits the area for the weekend, looks at several properties, and picks whichever one offers the best value. Price is a big factor in how emotionally attached they get to a home, as well. If youre just waiting for an offer to come in, youll be waiting for a long time. Price the home correctly the first time to generate offers and give you the opportunity to choose the best one. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<div><div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">If youre just waiting for an offer to come in, youll be waiting a long time.     <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">2. **The presentation is off.** Have you ever gone into a house that didnt quite smell right or just didnt feel very good to be in? A houses presentation is another factor that plays a large part in how emotionally attached a buyer is going to get to it. To present your home in the best possible light, make sure its clean, it smells good, and its nice and warm.<div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">3. **Poor marketing.** This can either be because the online photos dont look very good, the property is unavailable on multiple websites, or the description of the property doesnt correlate with its actual dimensions. Many agents look at the multiple listing services to decide what houses theyre going to show, so you need to make sure your houses photos look spectacular and its description conveys exactly what it has to offer. <div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">4. **The home is in bad condition.** Do you have a few light bulbs out? Is the carpeting peeling? Then you may have a problem. You want your house to stand out for the right reasons. <div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">5. **The seller isnt listening to feedback.** Whenever we have a listing being shown, we always get feedback from buyers and agents, and we listen to that feedback. Thats the primary way we know if theres something that we need to correct. Thats also a good way to know if your competition is priced better.<div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">
