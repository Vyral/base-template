What gives our clients the best results? Here are a few of the common denominators.

Today we’re going to talk about the two best ways to get better results from your outbound prospecting.

**The first thing you need to understand is that the prospect list that you’re putting into the system matters.** Not all data is created equally. Certain data is more valuable, and it will absolutely play a role in the results that you get. When you work with us, we use a company called Exact Data, who has done a great job with predictive analytics to help our clients purchase data (prospect lists and contacts). **Predictive analytics can actually give us an idea of if a person is right for you.** After we go through hundreds of different data points to come up with your perfect client, they can further classify that list with predictive analytics.

Having great data makes this process better and, in turn, makes you more money and gets you more leads.

**The second thing you need to know is that a nurture campaign is essential.** Once we start bringing you these strong leads, we’re passing them on to you. However, maybe they aren’t ready to do business quite yet. That’s why there needs to be a nurture campaign in place. It could be with a CRM, a text message campaign, or follow-up phone calls. The bottom line is that you need to have something in place. Once you bring a prospect into your funnel, it's important to stay in touch with them so that you are top of mind when it comes time for them to hire someone. Having a solid campaign will help you close business and your ROI will go through the roof in year two. If you’re nurturing your leads properly, your ROI should increase every year.

If you're curious about what a great nurture campaign looks like, we have one that we can send on over to you. **If you want a copy or if you have any other questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email.** We look forward to hearing from you soon.
