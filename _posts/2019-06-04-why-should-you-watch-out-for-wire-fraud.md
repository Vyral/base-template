Today I wanted to send out a quick message about wire fraud because we've been seeing it happen more and more lately in the real estate world. People who are in the middle of transactions are receiving emails that look legitimate and are asking them to wire funds from closing. These emails can be quite convincing, and by the time anyone realizes what happens, the money is often gone. If you’re ever asked to wire a large sum of money from someone, **always make sure that you verify the information in the email by calling them or even visiting them in person**.

If you have any questions or would like to know more specifics regarding how you can safeguard yourself from the threat of wire fraud, please reach out to me. I'd be happy to help\!
