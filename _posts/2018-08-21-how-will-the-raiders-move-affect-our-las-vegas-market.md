[Today's video is the second part of a two part series.](https://myvegasrealestateinfo.com/put-your-deposit-down-now-for-las-vegas-raiders-season-tickets.html)&nbsp;I am at the Las Vegas Raiders Preview Center at Town Square once again to talk about some very exciting things that are happening in Las Vegas. Many homeowners have been asking me how the Raiders’ move from Oakland will impact Las Vegas both in terms of city growth and real estate prices.

It is very exciting that Las Vegas will have a football team here. The stadium, which will be ready in 2020, will have its first ever game played on July 31, 2020. It will be a great entertainment venue.

Even more exciting is that it will help a lot of small businesses, especially with the venue hosting a lot of events. We will get a lot more traffic off the strip and over toward the stadium, which means small businesses will benefit greatly.

In general, **the Raiders’ move to the area is definitely going to impact the city in a positive way**. Las Vegas is here to stay, and overall it will impact the real estate prices.

However, the main thing that affects a city's growth and financial benefits is jobs. Currently, we don't know if the Raiders will bring jobs, so we’re unsure whether more people will move and start prospering or the opposite will happen.

**No matter what happens, I am very excited about the Raiders**. And, I have my fingers crossed that the change will help Las Vegas grow in a positive way.

If you have any further questions or are interested in speaking with me about buying or selling, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
