{% include youtube.html %}Zillow is one of the most common websites used today by people trying to figure out the value of their home.
<br>
<br>However, while Zillow might be a good way to get a ballpark figure you might think twice about trusting its accuracy. In fact, the New York Times and multiple Seattle newspapers have reported that **the CEO of Zillow sold his home for 40% less than the Zestimate.**
<br>
<br>In other words the Zestimate can be, and often is, inaccurate. Right here in Dallas it tends to be off by an average of 5%.
<br>
<br>This might sound like a fairly close evaluation but for those seriously considering buying or selling a home 5% could total about $15,000 in today’s local market
<br> **{% include pullquote.html %}**
<br>The best way to make sure that your estimate is accurate and that you are making the most out of a real estate transaction is to hire a real estate professional.
<br>
<br>Working alongside someone able to determine a realistic price is going to make a big difference in your pocket.
<br>
<br>So how does Zillow determine values, anyway? Well, they use a computer. As you and I both know, a computer is not what determines the value of a home.
<br>
<br>**A home’s value is determined by what a buyer is willing to pay as well as what the seller is willing to list it for.** These two figures can be vastly different from what a computer might estimate.
