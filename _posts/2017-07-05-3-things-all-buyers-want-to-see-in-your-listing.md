When selling your home, keep these three things that buyers look for in mind:

**1. Curb appeal:** Buyers should be impressed from the moment they pull up to the curb. Sweep the driveway and entryway, power-wash the exterior, and plant fresh flowers outside the home. You want them to be excited as soon as they step out of the car.

**2. Space:** Get rid of all the clutter in your home even if you have a lot of space; excess clutter is one of the biggest turnoffs for buyers. You could rent a storage unit at a minimal cost. For a better return on your final sale price, get rid of all the knicknacks and make sure all countertop and floor space is available.

**3. Updates:** You don't need to replace the whole kitchen, but try to upgrade things that are outdated. That could be the countertops, appliances, or hardware like the faucet and cabinet pulls.
