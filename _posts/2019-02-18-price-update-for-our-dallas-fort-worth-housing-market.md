<center><em>A market shift is happening, but there&rsquo;s still time to get your home sold for top dollar. Here&rsquo;s how.</em></center>

&nbsp;

The latest numbers are pointing to an upcoming shift in our real estate market. Here’s where the market is currently:

**1. Prices are at all-time highs**. For the past several years, home prices grew at twice the rate of inflation, and faster than incomes. Not surprisingly, we are now at record price levels. However, price growth has definitely been slowing over the past several months. We're even seeing some softness in the market with an increasing number of price cuts.

**2. Mortgage rates are rising**. The current 30-year fixed mortgage rate stands at 4.63%. That's almost a 1% increase over a year ago and the highest level we've seen since 2011.

**3. Affordability and demand are dropping**. Combined with current high prices, the rise in mortgage rates is causing a decrease in affordability. Earlier in the year, affordability was estimated to be at a 10-year low. Not surprisingly, this is having an effect on demand, with mortgage applications down 16% over last year.

This all seems to be part of a fundamental shift in the market.<br><br>**Home price growth is slowing, and home prices might eventually start to decrease**. Mortgage rates are expected to continue to grow, and if that happens, we will slowly but surely enter a market where buyers, not sellers, have the final say.<br><br>So what does this mean for you? **If you're looking to sell, it means the time to act is now**. I still see a lot of demand for homes. However, over the next several months, it's likely that national trends will catch up with us here as well.
