An economics professor once said, “Capitalism works best in an economy of creeping inflation.”

If you've ever wondered why prices always rise over time, that’s capitalism doing its job. **For some of our friends and family, that principle becomes a problem when they find themselves on a fixed income during retirement and they just can’t keep up.** They start looking for other sources of income, including going back to work, cutting back on what they love to do, and more.

What if they didn’t have a house payment to worry about? **A reverse mortgage actually pays homeowners money based on the equity they have in their house.** It’s a way of converting their hard-earned equity in their home into cash they can use every month.

I have a great article to share on whether a reverse mortgage might be right for you or someone you know. If you or someone you know might benefit from taking a look at it, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email and we’ll send on over a copy. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
