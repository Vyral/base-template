Karen Agar is one of our main client care specialists, and she makes our team run like clockwork.

For my latest team member spotlight, I’m interviewing coordinator Karen Agar. Karen runs the back office of our team, and though she’s only been with us a short while, she’s been an awesome addition.

According to her, Karen frequently brags about being on our team because there is so much to learn. **Anytime she has a question, she can turn to anyone for answers, and she’s always well-received.**

“It’s all about making sure that we understand what we’re doing and feel comfortable with what we’re doing; that support is just invaluable,” she says.&nbsp;

As I’ve said many times, our core passion is to enrich lives, and the main challenge Karen faces in her position is getting facetime with our clients. The majority of her job is conducted over the phone, so anytime a client walks through our doors, she jumps at the chance to meet them. One of her job descriptions is “client satisfaction,” so she hopes to meet with more clients face-to-face moving forward.

Karen makes our team run like clockwork, and we’re grateful for everything she does.&nbsp;

If you or anyone you know is interested in a real estate career or would like to learn more about what it’s like to work on a team like ours, don’t hesitate to call or email us. We’d love to help you.
