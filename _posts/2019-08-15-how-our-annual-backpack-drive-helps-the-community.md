For the past three years, our real estate team has partnered with \[Organization\] to source backpacks for local children, so that families without the resources to provide them on their own can still send their kids to school with all the necessary tools.&nbsp;

**In addition to \[INSERT ORGANIZATION NAME\], we also work closely with local law enforcement to create these opportunities year after year for our area’s youth.&nbsp;**

I like to think of our impact on the community as being similar to the old folk tale of the young boy throwing starfish back into the sea after a storm. In the story, thousands of starfish have been stranded on a beach. The boy throws back as many as he can, but is obviously unable to save them all. As he’s working to help the starfish, an old man approaches him and says, “You aren’t making a difference. You can’t save them all.”

Throwing back another starfish into the sea, the little boy looks at the old man and says, **“I made a difference to that one.”**

In this same way, even knowing that we can’t help every child in America, our team is proud to know that we are making an impact at all. Every good deed matters. One local woman, a special education teacher named Karina, exemplifies this point.&nbsp;

**Three years ago, it was Karina who came to us and the idea of beginning our now-annual backpack drive.** Fast forward to this year, and we’re about to donate 2,000 supply-filled backpacks to children in our community. Katrina’s idea has grown into something amazing, and each of us has the capacity to make a difference, just like she did.&nbsp;

In our real estate business, for example, we strive to do this every day. More than just selling properties, it’s our mission to connect families with their next home. The bottom line is that there are many ways to make a difference. Even something as simple as smiling at a stranger or holding open a door for someone has a positive impact.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions about today’s message, would like more information about how we can serve your real estate goals, or would like to talk about other ways to give back, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
