When buying a home, there are certain things you mustn't overlook. Here are the eight most important ones:

**1. See the neighborhood at all times of the day**. Don’t just observe it when you visit the home. Check out what traffic is like during rush hour or after school.

**2. Pay attention to your daily commute**.

**3. Know your neighborhood codes and restrictions**. This is especially important in neighborhoods that have HOAs (homeowners associations).

**4. Don’t overlook the bedroom/bathroom count**. If you are looking at a 4-bedroom home, for example, make sure it doesn’t have just one bathroom.

**5. Make note of any specialty inspections**. We always recommend a general home inspection but depending on the home you’re looking at, you might want to order a radon inspection, a termite inspection, or a number of other specialty inspections.

**6. Pay attention to the things that can’t be changed about the home**. This includes the lot size, the location, and the floor layout.&nbsp;

**7. Make note of the home’s resale value**. Sometimes buyers can get too excited and forget to pay attention to any barriers that would make the home harder to sell than normal.

**8. Is there room to grow into the home?** This depends on your individual circumstances, obviously, but should be considered no matter what those circumstances are.
