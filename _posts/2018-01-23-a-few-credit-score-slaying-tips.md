If your credit score isn’t quite where you’d like it to be, there are plenty of things you can do to bring it up. A good credit score is important, especially when it comes to home buying.

**The first thing you should do in order to tame your credit is set up automatic payments.** This way, your payments are automatically made at the same time every month and are never late. Lenders love that and those on-time payments help your credit score go up.

Another thing people might not realize about their credit is that opening up new cards or making big purchases can greatly affect whether you qualify for a loan or not. **It’s best to leave your cards alone while you're trying to qualify for a loan.** Pay them down and keep your debt ratio low.

It’s a good rule of thumb to keep the balance on all of your credit cards at around 30% of your limits. **This shows lenders that you are good with money and can manage and pay things down correctly.**

If you have any questions for me about credit or about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
