A lot of our customers contact us with questions about owning a second home. The good news is that **transactions for second homes are treated almost identically to transactions for primary residences**.

The one big difference is that a lot of lenders will look closely at the distance between your primary and secondary residence.

Something like a vacation home, located far away from where you currently reside, will make sense. However, a secondary residence in the same, or near the same, neighborhood as your first home isn’t going to pass a sniff test.

So, **talk with your lender ahead of time to develop a roadmap for making a successful offer on your second home**.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
