<center><em>Here are my five tips for buying in a fierce seller&rsquo;s market like ours.</em></center>

<br>It’s no secret that our market is hot right now and favors sellers. How can you compete as a buyer when homes are selling quickly for top dollar? Keep these five M’s in mind:

**Meet:** Meet with a real estate professional to discuss your plans and truly understand the process of buying a home in today’s market. Pick an agent who isn’t just selling homes today, but who also has a proven track record of helping clients in any kind of market. For example, we at The Wolek Group have been in this industry for 20+ years combined, so we have the systems, tools, and technology in place to ensure a smooth transition for you and your family.

**Motivation and Mindset:**&nbsp;Pinpoint the ‘why’ behind wanting to make a move, and understand that it may not be easy. Buying a home can be one of the most exciting times of your life, but it can also be stressful and overwhelming. Be honest with yourself about having a true desire to make a move and know that it may be competitive, depending on your price point or desired location.

**Money/Mortgage:** How are you going to purchase your home? Cash offers are actually very common in tight real estate markets, meaning that sometimes they may win in multiple-offer situations, since there will not be an appraisal or any lender delays. However, most buyers do obtain a mortgage, so you want to be sure to start that process now so you are confident in your ability to purchase and have a letter to prove it to a seller.

**Move safely through the process:** All throughout the real estate transaction, we have implemented a step-by-step guide to assist you:

1\. First we’ll meet either via Zoom, FaceTime, or in person—you pick your comfort level.

2\. Then we’ll look at houses, which may be through virtual walking tours/open houses, or in person with masks and distancing.

3\. We’ll help you write a contract with an electronic signature system.

4\. You’ll order inspections, which you may or may not attend; inspectors will be wearing masks, and some will even record a video report for you.

5\. Finally, you’ll attend closing. Title companies have created a mostly ‘contact-free’ process for attending closings and signing the paperwork for your new home.
