<br>What’s happening with the real estate market in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic?

If you’re anything like us, you’re stuck indoors trying to juggle things like homeschooling, working in close quarters next to your spouse, and new cooking recipes (sometimes succeeding, sometimes failing).

This is the new normal, but the good news is, **the real estate industry is moving right along**. Frankly, we’re surprised at how well consumers and agents have adapted to an industry that’s gone virtual. We have sellers showing buyers homes via Zoom, Skype, etc., inspectors showing up to houses wearing gloves and hazmat suits, and more. We have a responsibility to protect each other while continuing on with life.

We thought there would be a drop in activity, but virtual showings, meetings, open houses, notary signings, etc., have kept opportunities readily available for buyers and sellers.

What do the Pikes Peak MLS numbers say specifically? In the week leading up to the recording of this video, 329 new listings hit the market. **Out of all the homes already on the market, 1,057 went under contract, and 1,218 sold**.

If you’d like to know more about our market or aren’t sure how to navigate the new normal, give us a call and we’d be happy to help. More importantly, if you know someone who’s going through financial hardship and may have to sell their home or is in need of supplies, please reach out to us as well. We have the resources to help, and we’re here to serve our community.

From our home to yours, we hope you stay safe and healthy.
