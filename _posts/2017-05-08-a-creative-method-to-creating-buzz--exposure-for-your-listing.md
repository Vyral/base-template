If you have a home to sell, agent caravan can be very beneficial to you. It's where a bunch of agents from one or multiple offices get together to talk about new listings to benefit our clients.

In the video above, you can actually see agents' cars starting to gather around me for agent caravan. **We'll talk about the new properties and their benefits, as well as the prices.** We'll then pitch it to the other agents. Then, someone might stand up and say they have an interested buyer or that they want to go see it.

We might have as many as 40 agents trekking through a house before it even hits the market to help their buyer.

It's very powerful tool to use to attract buyers to your home. **You can get a lot of traffic and feedback on your house before it even goes on the market, which are both extremely valuable assets when selling a home.**

If you're thinking about selling your house or you're curious about using agent caravan to get more traffic and feedback on your home, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I'd be happy to help you!
