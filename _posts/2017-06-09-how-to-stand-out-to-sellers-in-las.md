We're back to continue our conversation about how to get your offer accepted as a buyer in the crazy seller's market we're experiencing in Las Vegas. If you missed the first part of our discussion, you can see it <a href="http://myvegasrealestateinfo.com/how-to-stand-out-to-sellers-in-las.html">here.</a>

**Inventory is low across the country and Las Vegas is no different.** We have just 4,917 single-family houses for sale in the Las Vegas area. That might not sound like a shortage, but compared to the nearly 8,000 houses we had for sale at this time last year, you can see how drastically inventory has shrunk.

There are also just 366 condominiums and 305 townhomes for sale in our market. When you buy a home in our market, you need to be aggressive. You can win in this low inventory market by following a few key tips:

**1. Don't overanalyze the process:** Be aggressive and don't take too long looking for options because you just won't have many options.

**2. Be prepared for a bidding war:** There will be a lot of buyers looking for homes that are priced right and in good condition, so put your best foot forward.

**3. Listen to your agent:** Learn from other buyers' mistakes. An experienced agent can help you through the whole process, so trust them and be prepared.

If you're looking to buy a home or sell your current house, give me a call or send me an email. I'd love to use my experience to help you get the best outcome in our market.
