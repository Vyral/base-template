Interest rates have gone up significantly in the last few months, and some programs have risen as high as 0.5% or even 0.75%. What does this mean for you?

This means if you’re thinking about upgrading your property, refinancing your property to remove the mortgage insurance, or accessing your equity to take out some cash, things have gotten more expensive.

**We now know that these things will get even more expensive in both the short term and long term**, so the time to act is now if you’re planning on doing any of them.
