Some homeowners will need to stage their home for showings while they’re still living in the property. Today I’ve listed a few tips to help make the staging process easier.

**1. Remove all signs of personalization.** A homebuyer should be able to envision themselves in the home through its design, and if too many personal items are around, they won’t be able to do that.

**2. Re-define each room’s purpose.** Adjusting the use of converted spaces back to their original purpose will help you get the home sold.

**3. Make use of a storage unit.** Investing in a storage unit close to your home will give you quick access to items that you may need, while still allowing you to remove some items so that seller’s can see the entire space without clutter.
