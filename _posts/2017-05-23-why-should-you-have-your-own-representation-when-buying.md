  - Home Buyer Tips
excerpt: 'As a buyer, you need representation. Trying to hire the agent you see on a yard sign isn’t the best idea. Most of the time, that person is working for the home’s seller and has their best interests in mind. You need someone on your side throughout the process. To find out why a buyer’s agent is so essential, watch this short video.'

When you’re gearing up to purchase a home, it’s important that you are represented by an agent. This agent could represent you as either a customer or a client. **The agent you want is the one who will represent you as a client.**

When you’re a client, the agent has your best interests at heart. They aren’t just looking at you as a number or someone they can provide a service for; they want to share their opinion, their expertise, and guide you through the process step by step.

Always make sure your agent is included in the transaction. Sometimes buyers will go look at homes without their agent and jump the gun, so to speak. They will make an offer or write a contract with the seller’s agent and totally forget about the agent working on their behalf.

It’s important to know that **any agent on a yard sign who is showing a home to you is actually representing the seller.** They have their best interests in mind, not your own. You don’t want to hire that same person who is representing the seller. You want someone who can look out for your best interests instead.

Whether you are working with an agent now or not, **I encourage you to reach out to a few different agents to interview them for the job.&nbsp;**That’s how you’ll get the best results for your home sale.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
