It’s June now, and things are starting to warm up in Tucson. As our temperature goes up, the number of visitors goes down. Tourism doesn’t stop, but it slows down a bit. We go from 100% to about 80% to 85%. It’s still possible to sell in this market, but only if you approach it the right way. That means avoiding overpricing.

First of all, buyers who are shopping are studying all the inventory on the market, and if you overprice, they’ll know you’re overpriced. This will cause them to skip over your home and not even look at it until you make price reductions to bring it down to market value.

Secondly, by overpricing, you are going to make your competition look more attractive. Buyers will perceive the competition as a better value, and they will be more interested in those homes. As always, it’s important to price your home right at market value and not a penny higher. You’re better off pricing it there and letting us do the negotiation for you.

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out by giving us a call or sending us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!
