It’s time to continue our ongoing discussion about downsizing. If you haven’t already seen the first two installments in this series, I highly recommend checking those out. **You can find the [first part here](http://damongettierblog.com/the-1st-and-most-important-part-of-downsizing.html){: target="_blank"} and the [second part here.](http://damongettierblog.com/downsizing-part-2-what-you-should-get-rid-of.html){: target="_blank"}**

Now let’s move onto today’s topic. For this installment in our downsizing series, I’d like to talk about the importance of having a helper.

I don’t know that I’d encourage anyone to enlist a family member to fill this role, but I would recommend seeking the help of a close personal friend to help talk you through what you think. Working with someone who knows you well can greatly smooth out the process.

Deciding what to keep and what to get rid of when downsizing can be emotionally draining. As you move through your current home and begin sorting through your belongings, **ask yourself what these objects really mean to you.** You might find that certain belongings mean less to you than you previously thought.

Especially if you’ve lived in your property for years on end, it can be extremely helpful to work with someone who can act as a sounding board for your thoughts. Hopefully, this will help prevent you from making decisions you might regret in the future.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
