What’s the story on our market as we move toward the end of summer? Let’s take a look at some year-over-year statistics from last July.

The number of sales remained steady, but inventory rose by 21%. **This means the number of properties available is putting downward pressure on prices,** and certain pockets of our market are forced to compete.

We’re also noticing a trend I like to call “price fatigue.” Over the past five years, the home prices have risen 45%, but incomes have only risen by 15%. If income doesn’t keep pace with prices, not many people can afford new inventory.

So are we in a buyer’s market or a seller’s market? As you may remember, a buyer’s market is when the supply of homes is more than six months, while a seller’s market is when the supply of homes is less than six months. **Since we currently have a 3.8-month supply of homes, we’re in a seller’s market.**

Additionally, interest rates are still at 40-year lows, starting at 4.5% and then going up depending on the purchase price and the scenario.

**Overall, our current market is a market of compromise.** If a buyer makes a reasonable offer and the seller makes a reasonable counteroffer, deals come together.

If you’re a seller, now’s still a very healthy market to sell. Our market has peaked, and you have a great opportunity to cash out. If you’re a buyer, you can take advantage of our still-low interest rates and our increased level of inventory.

As always, if you have any other questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d be happy to help you.
