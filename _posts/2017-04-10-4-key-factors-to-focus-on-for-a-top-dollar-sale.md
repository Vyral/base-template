{% include youtube.html %} If you're selling your home, there a few things you can do to help yourself get top dollar in today's market here in Virginia. When selling, pay attention to these factors:

1. **Preparation before a photo shoot is absolutely essential.** Our team provides a consultation with a professional stager to help you get insight on how to get your home ready for the camera. After all, the camera is the only eye we have to please. Many people don't want to pay for a stager or think they'll need to buy new furniture, but remember, a stager will help you take advantage of things you already own. They'll help you decide how to place furniture and what to take out of a room to showcase your home to the fullest.
2. **Pricing.**Even though it's a seller's market, pricing definitely matters, especially if you want multiple offers for your home. Focus your price on where it will sell and it will pull the trigger on a lot of interest in your property.
3. **Drive exposure with all the buyers out there.** Take advantage of all the tools in our toolkit like our 'coming soon' listings. We market these properties to get a little advanced buzz before it even goes active on the market. We've been able to sell properties before they even went active on the MLS with this method. We also have a full-time marketing specialist who exposes your house to more than 300 websites. It's not just about Zillow and Realtor.com; we want to maximize the eyeballs on your house.
4. **Make sure you work with a Realtor who can negotiate top dollar for your property.** With more than 30 years in the business, I'd be honored to show you what it's all about and how our team can help you get the most for your home.

If you have any questions or you'd like to learn more about how we can help you get the most for you home, give me a call or send me an email any time. I'd love to help you!
