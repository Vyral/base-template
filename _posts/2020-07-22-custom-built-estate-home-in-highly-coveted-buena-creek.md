Custom-Built Estate Home in highly coveted Buena Creek\!

Welcome home to 855 Sugarbush Drive in the jewel of Vista known as Buena Creek. Buena Creek is highly coveted for it’s wide open streets and large, spacious homes and parcels. Sugarbush Drive and a few streets around it benefit from a unique combination of peace, privacy, and excellent proximity to everything North County has to offer.

One of the first things you will notice when you pull up is the elevated 1.02 acre lot with excellent curb appeal and lots of extra space that being at the end of the cul-de-sac provides. As you enter the driveway and pull through the pillars you will notice the wonderful curb appeal and water wise landscaping. The owner has recently updated the landscaping with rocks and native plants to help keep water bills down. There is plenty of room to get an RV or trailer in and out on either side of the home and driveway.

Head inside and you will find a spacious interior with a very functional floor plan that is ready for your own custom touches. Inside measures approximately 3,691 square feet and includes 4 bedrooms with 2 optional bedrooms and 3.5 baths. I love the floor plan of this home. If you have extended family moving in and are looking for multi-generational living there is an area down a short flight of steps off the entry with a bedroom, full bathroom, and living room with wet back that would work very well as a dedicated suite or living area. The common areas including the family room, Kitchen, dining room, laundry are all on the main level. If you head upstairs there are two additional bedrooms off of the landing with a dedicated bath room and a huge master suite with bonus room/sitting area, and fireplace.

The backyard of this home is sure to impress. Much of the 1+ acre lot is behind the home so there is plenty of space to enjoy the West facing backyard with wrap around deck, sunset views, pool, Jacuzzi, and open space. If you are looking for room to build your own guest house or shop, there is plenty of room for that as well.

855 Sugarbush Drive is an incredibly special home in one of the best areas in Vista. The home is move in ready, but the owner has priced it so that the new owner can make it their own.
