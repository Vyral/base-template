<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In case you weren’t aware already, there are a lot of different down payment options out there for homebuyers. Here are some examples.</em></p>

Is 20% the only down payment option out there for homebuyers? **A lot of people may believe this myth, but it simply isn’t true.&nbsp;**

The truth is that there are plenty of different down payment options out there for different loans. You can put the traditional 20% down, but there are also 5%, 10%, 3.5%, and even 0% down payment options.

**It all depends on where you are in your life.** If you’ve owned a home for five years and are ready to cash in on that equity and use that for a down payment on a new home, putting more money down will help you get a lower interest rate.

On the other hand, if you’re ready to buy your first home and don’t have a ton saved up, there are programs for you, too. **The first-time homebuyer program is one that doesn’t require a down payment.**

Putting 20% down isn’t always the best option, and it isn’t the only option. It’s important that you pick the down payment option that’s ideal for you and your situation.&nbsp;

In conclusion, there are lots of options for you when it comes to down payments. You don’t have to put 20% down. If you have any questions for us or need some help figuring out the best down payment option for you, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.
