If you need to buy and sell a home at the same time, we have three ways to help you accomplish this goal.

First, **we give you access to homes that aren’t on the market.** This means we have a list of homes that haven’t officially been listed by their owners, but they would still sell if they had a buyer.

Second, **we use a team approach.** There will be at least five people from our team who will be involved in your simultaneous transactions. If you are concerned about your home selling too quickly, we can set up a contingency plan for you that will protect you in case you are unable to find a new home after you sell your current one. On the flip side, we have a transaction management team that will make sure you hit the exact closing date you need.

Lastly, **we take care of all the details involved in prepping your home for the market.** These details can range from suggesting which upgrades to make, how to properly stage the home, taking pictures for it, and shooting a 3-D video of the interior. We can also pre-inspect the home to make sure there aren’t any surprises once it does go under contract.

As always, if you have any questions about our market or you are thinking of buying or selling a home in our market, please feel free to reach out to me. I would be happy to help you.
