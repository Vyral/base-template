Today I want to discuss some strategies which can be used to manage the stress caused by changes happening in the market and around us every single day.

**This kind of rapid change creates an overarching stress which can affect us in ways we don’t even realize.** Stress impacts everything we do each day. If you don’t acknowledge it up front, a lot of issues can arise. So, to address all of the stressful and rapid changes that occur around us all the time, we must work to change ourselves.

First of all, create a goal sheet. This goal sheet should cover important aspects of your personal and business life. There are many ways to compile this information, but the important thing is that you organize and write down these goals. **You should spend a significant amount of time thinking about and setting up this goal sheet.**

Spend at least a half a day each month looking at this goal sheet and making sure that you are actually working toward what you set out to do. Examine the steps you have taken so far, as well as what steps you plan to take in the future. The reason this is so important is that control in our environment will decrease stress.

A big part of this goal sheet should focus on your finances. This is critical, because even a small change to your personal life or business could vastly impact your financial wellness. Make sure you have a plan B. Without a plan in place for the unexpected, managing changes can become much more stressful.

Stress can take away your options. A lack of options means that you will be more likely to make bad decisions. These forces will put you into a spiral. So, **make sure that you have a plan from the start before the spiral begins.**

The last way to handle change is to manage your personal stress. How you achieve this is up to you. We are all different, but one thing we all have in common is the hectic nature of life. If you don’t take time to slow yourself down and do the things that give you inner harmony, you are not going to fare well in the long term.

You may not realize it, but stress can negatively impact your relationships, business, and even your health. You could combat this stress by leaving your phone at home during your morning run or by spending some time with family. You could even try yoga. **Whatever you do, be conscious about your level of stress as you move forward in your daily life.**
