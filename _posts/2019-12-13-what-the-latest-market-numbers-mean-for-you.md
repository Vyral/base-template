{% include youtube.html %}<br>For your latest Charlotte market update, let’s look at the key year-over-year statistics from November. The number of new listings dropped from 3,655 to 3,425, and the number of homes for sale dropped as well, going from 12,097 to 9,912. The number of closed sales, meanwhile, rose from 3,218 to 3,268, and the average days on market dropped from 19 to 17 days. The median sale price rose 7.1% from $238,000 to $255,000. Moving forward, as long as we continue to see inventory drop and home sales increase, there will be fewer options for buyers, which means prices will go up. If you’re thinking of listing your home, now would be a great time to do it. There’s not a lot of competition out there, but buyers are still buying homes. If you have any more questions about these numbers or you’re thinking of selling your home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
