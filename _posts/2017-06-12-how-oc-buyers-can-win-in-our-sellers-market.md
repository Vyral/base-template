{% include youtube.html %}Many buyers get frustrated trying to buy a home and don't even know why a seller didn't accept their offer and ultimately give up trying to buy a home. If you want to buy a home in a seller's market like Orange County, there are a few things you can do to be successful.
<br>
<br>Don't despair and don't give up. It's not all about the price, so there is hope for non-cash buyers. **Start by being absolutely sure you can prove to the seller that you're approved for financing**and ready to close quickly with a credible lender.
<br>
<br>Price is important, but you don't have to go way over the asking price. However, you also shouldn’t offer a price below the list price. Next, consider the terms of your offer. How fast can you close? Can you reduce the inspection periods? Sellers don't want to sit around for weeks waiting to find out if you're going to give them a long list of repair requests when they could have accepted a different offer that would have closed faster.
<br>
<br>**You can also gain an edge by making your offer more personal.**Give the seller a reason to believe they should sell you their home! You can also make an effort to make your offer look good. Sellers will receive a stack of papers for each offer—would you accept an offer that was messy, poorly presented, and half complete, or would you accept an offer that's well-presented and professional?
<br>

<br>Finally, the most important way to win the home you want is by **choosing the right agent.** The right agent will do their research in advance and give you all the information you need, as well as finding the seller's motivations. This will help you craft an offer that has all the important elements and will make your offer stand out to the seller above all other offers.
