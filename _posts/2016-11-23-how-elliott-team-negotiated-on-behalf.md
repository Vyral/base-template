And it was the house we really wanted. The process was really smooth, he worked very well with the seller in pretty much making sure he represented our best interests and getting us the best results. I would say just A+ across the board. We actually had an appraisal issue with the house so the house actually came in $7000 below what we offered. And originally we were thinking it was going to come down to some type of split but Doug really negotiated and kind of used some of the good faith and honorable type of lingo I guess to get the sellers to actually cover the entire appraisal because we really didn’t want our closing costs to go up. So that really saved us some money both on closing and also the full purchase of the house. “</span></span></i>
