There are a few things you should be aware of right now in the St. Charles marketplace.

St. Charles currently has 482 active homes for sale, 211 homes under contract, and 506 homes that have closed in the last six months.

These market conditions point to great news for sellers. **Assuming it is priced and staged correctly, your home will sell for top dollar.**

Speaking from a technical perspective, the market’s current absorption rate is about eight months—a number that actually favors buyers.

But the current market provides incredible opportunities for both savvy buyers as well as savvy sellers because we are so near an equilibrium point of inventory.

It’s for this reason that it is so critical to list and/or buy with a top producing agent like myself.

Be sure to keep interest rates in mind, as well. The Fed recently increased short-term rates by a quarter of a percent. But, because this increase was anticipated it has already baked into the market. 30-year fixed mortgage rates have dipped just under 4%.

Ultimately, **having a quality real estate professional on your side will make a world of difference given today’s market conditions.**

So if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you, soon.
