Our team here at Spring Mortgage is different in a lot of ways. Most of the work we do is behind the scenes, but we wanted to share some of that with you today. **Here’s how we differentiate ourselves from the pack:**

- **Knowledge.** We know the business, including all the guidelines and how to make things work in an ever-changing mortgage world.

- **Flexibility.** We have home loans for everyone. Whether you need to buy a mansion with a super jumbo loan, or you’re a first-time buyer who needs down payment assistance, we can help you. We have loans for those with great credit, and those who have some hiccups. We even have loans for people who have gone through bankruptcy or a foreclosure last week.

- **Communication.** We work really hard at it. The level of communication between Realtor, lender, and customer in this industry is horrible. We don’t accept that. Our process is fine-tuned so that no Realtor or customer will ever be in the dark. If you ever have questions for us, we’ll get right back to you.

**Finally, we have our $10,000 closing insurance program.** We are so proud of our process that if we fail to perform on our commitment to a customer, we will pay them $10,000. If that’s not different, we don’t know what is.
