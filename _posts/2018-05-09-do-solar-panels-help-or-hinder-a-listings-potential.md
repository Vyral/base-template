Many people these days are installing solar panels to their homes, but is this a good idea? There are valid points on both sides of this debate.

Of course these panels are beneficial in terms of environmental impact and energy conservation, but **the real question is whether homeowners can expect them to add value to their property.&nbsp;**

Many people obtain solar panels through financing in the form of a lien. This can create additional debt when it comes time to list the property. Sellers should be careful to disclose this fact so that buyers aren’t left with an unpleasant surprise in the form of extra expenses after closing.&nbsp;
