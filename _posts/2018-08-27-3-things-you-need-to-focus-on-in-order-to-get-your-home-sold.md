The three key aspects you need to focus on in order to get your listing sold are marketing, condition, and price.

There are three key aspects of the home selling process you must focus on in order to sell your home quickly and for top dollar.&nbsp;

The first is **marketing.** You should hire a real estate professional who’s media-savvy, does a lot of internet advertising, follows up with buyers who look at your home, and is aggressive in making your property known. This part of the process is in their control, so make sure you hire someone reputable.&nbsp;

The second part is 100% in your control, and that’s **the home’s condition.** I recently listed a home that was priced higher than fair market value but still secured an offer quickly because it was in excellent condition. This is the most important thing you’re in control of, so make sure your landscaping looks nice and your home is painted and decluttered.

The third aspect is **price.** A lot of people assume that Realtors are in charge of pricing the home, but that’s not true. In reality, the homeowner is. When it comes to pricing, you have three options. First, you can price it over fair market value and hope the right buyer comes along. Second, you can list it at fair market value and find a few people in your price range who are interested. Third, you can price it below fair market value. Oftentimes, this can create a multiple offer situation, so that’s something to consider. Your Realtor will advise you on which strategy is best.&nbsp;
