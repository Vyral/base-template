If you want to buy a home but can't cover the down payment, there are three options for home loans here in the Phoenix area that are perfect for you.

Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value report
Want to buy a home? Search all homes for sale

If you want to buy a home but don't have any money for down payment, you still have three options.

If you're a veteran of a military service, you might have VA eligibility that would allow you to qualify for a **VA loan.** This is a government-insured loan program that lets you buy a home without any money down.

Another option would be looking at the many grant programs offered in our area. In Maricopa County, we have two in particular called **Home Plus and Home in 5 that provide grant money that's set aside by the county** for your down payment to buy a home. You can even get closing cost assistance from sellers; I've had client buy a home with way with less than $1,000 out of pocket.

You can also look into **USDA financing.** This loan program is sponsored and insured by the United States Department of Agriculture and provides zero money down financing for rural areas. Most areas in Maricopa County don't fall into the USDA requirements, but there are some that do in surrounding areas.

If you're interested in any of these three zero money down home loans or you have any other questions about the Phoenix market, give me a call or send me an email. I'm here to help.
