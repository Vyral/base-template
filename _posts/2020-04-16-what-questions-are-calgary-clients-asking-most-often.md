<center><em>As we continue to navigate the real estate market during a pandemic, it&rsquo;s clear that business is still being done. Here&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re helping buyers and sellers remain safe.</em></center>

<br>A lot of people have been asking me the same two questions: “Are properties selling in Calgary?” and “How can I sell right now and reduce my risks?” To answer the first question, we’ve had over 307 sales in the last two weeks, so yes, **plenty of properties are still selling**. If you are in a position where you need to sell, we can help you take the necessary steps to prepare your home and get it listed, even in a market where physical contact is kept to a minimum.

For a full list of questions you can ask buyers before they view your home to keep your health risk at a minimum and information about new rules and regulations made for real estate in Alberta, see below.

If you have any other real estate questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I’d be happy to answer them.

### **Optional questions to ask of buyers before showings:**

<br>1\. Has anyone in their house travelled internationally within the past two weeks?

2\. Have they been in contact with anyone in the past two weeks who has tested positive for COVID-19?

* If yes, is that exposure due to employment relating to the health care profession?
* Please provide any additional information regarding exposure.

3\. Does anyone currently in the house have any symptoms of COVID-19? Including but not limited to a fever, dry cough, or flu-like symptoms?&nbsp;

4\. Have you or anyone in your house tested positive for COVID-19?

* If yes, when?
* When were you determined safe by Alberta Health Services?

5\. Are you or anyone in your house awaiting test results for COVID-19?

6\. Is there any additional information or procedures that would make you feel comfortable showing your house during this time?

You also will need to keep people coming into your space safe too, so it’s important to review the below questions if you are selling your property.

### **Potential Exposure to COVID-19 (Yes or No)**

<br>1\. Has anyone in the house being sold travelled internationally within the past two weeks?

2\. Has anyone in the house being sold been in contact with anyone in the past two weeks that has tested positive for COVID-19?

* If yes, is that exposure due to employment relating to the health care profession?
* Please provide any additional information regarding exposure.

3\. Does anyone in the house currently being sold have any symptoms of COVID-19? Including but not limited to a fever, dry cough, or flu-like symptoms?

* If yes, your Realtor&reg; may wish to have further discussions with you regarding showings.

4\. Has anyone in the house being sold tested positive for COVID-19?

* If yes, when?
* When were you were determined safe by Alberta Health Services?

5\. Is anyone in the house being sold awaiting test results for COVID-19?

If you have answered yes to questions 1, 2, 4, and/or 5, your listing cannot be shown until 14 days have passed since the arrival home of the person who travelled internationally, or when you were in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 (health care professionals excluded), and/or have been determined safe by Alberta Health Services. Your listing can remain on the MLS&reg; system as active, however, there must be clear disclosure that no showings will be permitted.
