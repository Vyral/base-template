As the owner of an investment property, how do you get paid? I’ll explain the process today.

One of the most common questions we get is, “How do I get paid?”

It’s pretty simple. **We collect rents on the first of every month.** Hawaii has a “no grace period” law for tenants, which means that rent is definitely due on the first.

It takes a couple of days to process the payment but thanks to ACH and the magic of online banking, our owners will get paid on the fifth of the month.

We do all of the behind-the-scenes work to manage your property. However, the only thing you need to know is that **we make the rent appear at no hassle to you.**

When you work with me, you don’t have to pay any money up front. If your property needs repairs, the cost will be taken out of the rent. Don’t worry—we don’t do anything without your permission, and you will be communicated with about everything via text, email, or a phone call.

If you have any other questions about your payment or would like to learn more about how we can help you, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
