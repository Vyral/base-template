What does the market look like for Columbus’ hospitality industry?

I recently read an article from [www.columbusceo.com](http://www.columbusceo.com/business/20170202/commercial-real-estate-spotlight-budding-boutique-hotels){: target="_blank"} that touched on this topic and talked about the development of boutique hotels in the Short North and downtown areas of Columbus.

In the Short North, there has been a lot of new development and conversion of large projects into hotels. The Bollinger Tower, for instance, was previously a senior housing complex, but it is now being converted into a hotel. Downtown, we have seen the LeVeque Tower being converted into a boutique hotel. Many bars on Park Street near downtown have also been sold as part of another hotel development.

As you may know, I am a member of Columbus Hosts Alliance, which is a short-term rental organization who works to introduce Airbnb to the Columbus marketplace. A lot of the current discussion in this group is focusing on where most of the demand is in Columbus, and **most of the demand is close to downtown (more specifically, within two to three miles of the Convention Center) and many of the arts districts of the Short North.**

The local hotel owners my team met with in the last six to 12 months have differing opinions about this topic. When we spoke to them about the market and what their plans are for expansion, they told us that, depending on their location, their hotels have not been performing as well as they previously had been. Usually, this means either their occupancy rate or their average nightly rate is down.

In any case, the majority of owners who own less than two hotels have no plans to expand their operations. The owners of larger hotels, however, are looking to expand into downtown and other districts where new construction is limited. The same article from www.columbusceo.com mentioned the Bridge Street project. Local hotel owners told us that it’s difficult to get into new hotel development in Dublin because of the funding that went into the project.

**Overall, the hotel market is very mixed.** In certain areas of Columbus—downtown, in particular—this industry is flourishing. In other areas, many hotels are being converted into housing complexes, storage units, or some kind of other commercial asset because the demand isn’t there anymore.

If you have any other questions about the hotel industry in our market or you yourself are a hotel owner and you’d like to chat with us, please feel free to call or email us anytime. We would love to speak with you.
