<p style="text-align: center;"><em>There are four key points to know about our St. George market as we move forward in 2019.</em></p>

As we settle into 2019, our St. George market has ebbed slightly recently. Does this mean the market in general is slowing down? No—we’re still in a robust market. To explain why, there are four points you need to remember.

**For your convenience, I’ve provided timestamps of each point in the video above so you can skip ahead to the section(s) that interest you the most:&nbsp;**

1:57—We are not—I repeat, not—in a housing bubble&nbsp;<br>2:54—Interest rates are rising<br>3:51—Buying a home is one the best investments you can make<br>5:22—2019 will be an “I wish I would have” year

As always, if you have any questions about our St. George market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
