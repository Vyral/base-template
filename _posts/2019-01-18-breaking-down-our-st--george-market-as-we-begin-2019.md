Friends and clients –&nbsp;

As we settle into 2019, it’s time to take a look at our St. George market. It’s certainly ebbed slightly recently. Does this mean the market, in general, is slowing down? No—we’re still in a robust market. To explain why, there are four points you need to remember.

**\*I STRONGLY RECOMMEND WATCHING THE ENTIRE VIDEO\* to make, or save, the most money in your real estate moves this year.** But if you’ve absolutely gotta “skim” it, I’ve provided timestamps of each point in the video above so you can skip ahead to the section(s) that interest you the most:&nbsp;

1:57—We are not—I repeat, not—in a housing bubble!&nbsp;<br>2:54—Interest rates are rising – do you know how high they COULD go?&nbsp;<br>3:51—Buying a home is one the best investments you can make<br>5:22—2019 will be an “I wish I would have” year for many people
