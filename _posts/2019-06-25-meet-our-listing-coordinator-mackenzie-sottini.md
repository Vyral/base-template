Today I’m excited to introduce you to my team’s listing coordinator: Mackenzie Sottini. You can see my full conversation with Mackenzie in the video above. Otherwise, there are just a few things I’d like to point out about who she is and what role she plays in taking real estate deals from contract to close.&nbsp;

Not only does Mackenzie help ensure that all the paperwork for a given deal is filed correctly, but she also facilitates effective communication between our team and the various vendors we work with—including stagers, photographers, landscapers, and many others.&nbsp;

**It’s a lot of hard work, but keeping deals running smoothly is exactly what Mackenzie loves most about her job.** She says her favorite thing about being a listing coordinator with our team is that it affords her the opportunity to take the stress out of our clients’ real estate experiences.&nbsp;

Of course, helpfulness is in Mackenzie’s nature. Before joining our team, Mackenzie worked as an award-winning teacher for more than 20 years. This new phase of Mackenzie’s life is a far cry from the classroom, but she finds it very fulfilling nonetheless.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give my team or me a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
