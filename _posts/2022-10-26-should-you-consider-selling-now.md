If you're thinking about moving, don’t let the cooling housing market slow you down. Although mortgage interest rates are higher today than they were six months ago, there are still many other reasons why it may be time to sell. A Realtor.com survey studied the top reasons why homeowners recently sold their houses, and a major trend emerged.

**The most common reason people are still selling is that their needs have changed**, and that meant their house needed to as well. 31% said they wanted a home with different features or amenities, 26% said they needed space for a home office, and 23% said they wanted to be closer to their friends and loved ones.

If any of these reasons resonate with you, it could be time to sell. If you're not completely satisfied with your current housing situation, let's find one that checks all of your boxes. Reach out to me and my team at [(502) 376-5483](tel: &#40;502&#41; 376-5483). We’d love to help you.
