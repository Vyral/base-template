Today, I’m sharing some important data that affects both buyers and sellers. If you want to sell, this is a great time to put your home on the market because this is the best time to buy. I say this because there is some important information on home prices that has come up recently.&nbsp;

Many people were worried about prices crashing, but if you’re waiting to buy until that happens, that might not be a great idea. The truth is that **statistics show prices have already reached their low point and are climbing back up again in the majority of the country.**

**{% include pullquote.html %}**

In November 2022, home prices were declining in 96% of the largest markets. However, in February 2023, **home prices are increasing in 78% of those markets**, which is a big change that is continuing to build as we enter May. Therefore, prices are going up, so waiting for them to go down isn’t smart.&nbsp;

If you want to buy or sell a home or have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact me. You can call me anytime at (502) 376-5483, send an email to [bob@weselllouisville.com](mailto:bob@weselllouisville.com), or [visit my website by clicking here.](https://www.weselllouisville.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} I will contact you back right away.
