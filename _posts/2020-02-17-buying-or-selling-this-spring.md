What to know if you may plan to buy or sell this spring.

Today we’re going to discuss buying and selling in the spring season. February is already proving to be a busy real estate month this year. The spring real estate market is upon us a little earlier than usual. **Homes in excellent condition that are priced well are selling quickly,** sometimes with multiple offers.&nbsp;

That means it’s a great time to consider selling your house in this early spring market. We would love to speak with you about pricing and staging your home. Those elements are critical because houses that have not considered these or have not been maintained sit on the market for months. The properties that have been taken care of, priced correctly, and staged are selling quickly in this market.

If you’re a buyer right now, this affects you as well. Make sure to get pre-approved for a loan or have proof of funds. Also, when looking at homes, **it helps to narrow your search down to a few neighborhoods** where you want to be. That way you can watch that specific area, and when you see a house you love, you can go see it immediately and be ready to make a quick offer. Due to a busy market, you may benefit from making an offer quicker than another buyer.

As always, if you have any questions, please contact us via phone or email. We would love to help you. Also, download the Charleston properties app, it’s a great way to keep on top of the market in real time.
