Recently, I’ve been hearing a lot of people asking whether fall is a good time to list. The fall season is actually the perfect time to put your home on the market. Though few expect this to be the case, there are a lot of advantages to selling later in the year.&nbsp;

Today, I want to give you three reasons why you should think about listing in fall.&nbsp;

1. **Less competition.** In the spring and summer months, the market is saturated with buyers and sellers alike. People tend to think summer is the ideal time to list simply because that’s what everyone else is doing. However, this creates a lot of competition. If you list in the fall, you’ll have less competition from other sellers. This will give you leverage and could help you earn more for your listing overall.
2. **More motivated buyers.** The old rule of thumb was that people wanted to move before the start of the school year. However, this is no longer the case. Now, people are more concerned with moving in before Thanksgiving or Christmas. This makes fall the ideal time to put your home on the market. There are still plenty of buyers out there looking for homes at this time of year. Fall buyers have less time to find the right home, meaning they will be more motivated and serious about striking a deal.&nbsp;
3. **Homes are more photogenic.** At this time of year, your home is going to look absolutely awesome in photos. Fall colors and some tasteful decorations will really make your home pop. The internet is the first place many buyers look for homes, so having impressive photos for your online listing will get buyers off of their computers and into your home.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
