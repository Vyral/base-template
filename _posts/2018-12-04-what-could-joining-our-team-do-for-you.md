Today we’re excited to introduce one of Jeff Cook Real Estate’s amazing team members: Brad Williams.

Brad usually starts his day bright and early at 6 a.m. with a hot cup of coffee and a trip to the gym to get his energy levels up. In his words, “coffee equals contracts.”

Of course, even the most motivated individual still needs the right environment to thrive. Before coming to Jeff Cook Real Estate, Brad was working on his own. He was doing a few deals a year, sure, but he wasn’t seeing the level of success he knew he was capable of.

When he came to us in 2016, everything changed. He began producing at a much higher level almost right away. In fact, **he sold over $12 million in sales volume and was named “Agent of the Year” within his first full year on our team.**

Better yet, Brad was able to do all of this without having to shell out any business expenses. Not having to pay money upfront for marketing is one of the things he loves most about working with us. We offer our agents the resources, support, and financial freedom they need to succeed.

And this is just a small glimpse into what sets us apart from the industry standard. Our agents are also highly knowledgeable about recent trends and statistics, meaning they’re able to help our clients earn the best possible deals as they navigate the market.

At the end of the day, **Brad is living proof of what’s possible for real estate professionals who join our team.** He went from selling just a handful of homes to nearly 50 a year, and his career isn’t the only area of his life that’s been transformed. He’s also now a successful real estate investor, as well.<br><br>Joining us has allowed him to have the life he’s always dreamed of—living on a beautiful island, visiting Mt. Pleasant in his free time, and working at a great brokerage that makes it all possible.

With all of that said, we’ve got some great news: We’re hiring. If you’re ready to take control of your future and steer your life and career toward the success you deserve, don’t hesitate to reach out.

After all, in Brad’s words, “Joining Jeff Cook Real Estate has opened a lot of doors for me, and it can for you too.”
