Today we wanted to introduce you to Miranda Haws, one of our beloved inside sales agents here at Team Lally.

Miranda heard about Team Lally from the radio and also by seeing our yard signs throughout the community. She was motivated to join us after hearing about our success as the No. 1 team in Hawaii.

"I had to come and see what all the rave was about," she says. "It turned out that Adrienne and Attilio are just really down-to-earth people. **They care about the team and they care about their business."**

As an inside sales agent, Miranda works hand-in-hand with buyers and listing agents to help guide our clients to the best resources and all the information they desire. Her favorite part of the job is the collaboration everyone brings to the table from their many years of experience.

"Any time there's a problem or conflict that comes up, we can all work together to figure it out," Miranda says.

If you have any questions for Miranda or you're thinking of buying or selling a home here in Hawaii, you can always give us a call or send us an email. We're here to help!
