We use the DISC personality profile to help us in our business and personal lives.
Here’s what DISC stands for.

Behavioral assessments can be used to better both business relationships and relationships in your personal life.

When you can observe behaviors in your friends, family, coworkers, clients, etc., you know better how to adapt and relate to who they are and understand how to help them.

We use the DISC personality profile to accomplish these things. What does DISC stand for, though?

**The D stands for “driver,” “dominant,” or “doer.”** These people are the CEOs and trial attorneys of the world. These people come in, get stuff done, and don’t allow anyone to waste their time.

**The I stands for “influencer.”** These people are motivated and typically work through other people. They’re sometimes referred to as “the life of the party” or “a social butterfly.” This isn’t always the case, but they’re definitely not shy in group settings.

**The S stands for “steady,” “stable,” or “secure.”** This personality represents the majority of the population. These people don’t like change. They’re the schoolteachers of the world. They’re all about love—when you walk into their home, you’ll see family pictures everywhere because that’s important to them. It should be important to all of us, but it’s especially evident in them.

**Finally, the C stands for “compliant.”** These people are the accountants and engineers of society. They love following the rules and checking off tasks. Sometimes, they’re hesitant to move forward until they have all the answers.

All of us have each of these different behaviors inside of us—they just show up differently for each person. Some people are more slanted toward one behavior, while others are a blend of each. D and C personalities are task-motivated, while I and S personalities are more relationship oriented. You can tell a lot about people by how they act in groups and how they work through challenges in their life.

If you have any questions about DISC or how you can use behavioral assessments to better your life and the lives of those around you, feel free to get in touch with me. I’d be happy to talk with you.
