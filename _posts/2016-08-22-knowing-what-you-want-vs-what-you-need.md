I believe homeownership is the American Dream. When you buy a home, though, it is important to understand the difference between what you want in a home and what you need. How can you tell the difference?

The first thing I’d advise is pulling out a pen and a piece of paper and writing down two columns. In the left-hand column, list all of the things that you have today. In the right-hand column, list all the things you want. From left to right, your list should expand. This will be the criteria you will use to shop for a new home.

Whatever amenities you end up listing in the right-hand column, it’s important to keep in mind that you may not get all of them in this next purchase. If your new home doesn’t have all the amenities that you want, I would strongly encourage that you start looking for ways to save money so that somewhere down the line you can procure them.

I often see people make upgrades to their home solely as part of their strategy for selling it. This is a mistake — you’re spending money that you don’t get a dollar-for-dollar return on. If you’re making upgrades, do it for yourself first. Reap the benefits of how it contributes to the home’s sale later.

If you have any questions you’d like answered, just shoot me an email or give me a call. I’d love to help in any way I can!
