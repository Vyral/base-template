Here’s how the first quarter of 2020 panned out for our Flathead market.

Today I’m excited to share with you the Flathead market summary for the first quarter of 2020. Though we’re nearing the end of May, I wanted to wait until I had all of the numbers available for the surrounding areas before I presented this recap of Q1.&nbsp;

For those worried about how Q2 is faring, I did also wrangle up the numbers for April (the month in which quarantine really took full effect). We saw a slight decrease in properties going under contract in Flathead Valley year over year, with 209 this year as opposed to 224 last April—a 10% change. Though there hasn’t been a huge impact thus far, it'll be really interesting to see how Q2 pans out. In the meantime, here’s everything you need to know about Q1.&nbsp;
