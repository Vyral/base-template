Working with Treu Group Real Estate is like a cupcake. How?

If I baked a muffin and offered it to you, you would love and enjoy it. This represents what many agents do to get their client’s home sold, especially in a seller’s market. They may get you to the closing table, but the question is, “How much are you missing out on by having the muffin?”

What could be missing?

The alternative is a cupcake. A cupcake is like a muffin but it comes with frosting and sprinkles on top, which makes everything better—don’t you agree? If I have to choose between a muffin and a cupcake, I’m going to choose the cupcake.

When you work with Treu Group Real Estate, you get all the icing and the sprinkles.

We’re going to market your property locally, nationally, and internationally, as it is a very small world today. We’ll also take aerial photos, do walking tours, and advertise your property on Facebook. We have a full plan of what we’re going to do.

If you’re buying a home, do you deserve a little frosting and sprinkles too? Of course you do. Whether you are buying or selling a home, we will make sure you get that opportunity.

Some of the sprinkles our sellers get are post-occupancies, selling for over asking price, and more.

If you would prefer a cupcake over a muffin, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
