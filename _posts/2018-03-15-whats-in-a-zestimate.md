Today we’re going to focus on Zillow. More specifically, their Zestimate. What is it? Essentially, it’s a starting point for determining the value of your home. **Zillow will predict the value of your home, and people ask me all the time if this prediction is reliable.** Let’s take a bit of a deeper look.

Basically, the Zestimate pulls from two data sources: **The first is user-submitted data and the second is public data.** The public data comes out of tax records or the MLS, but the user submitted data is something to focus on. A homeowner can change the user submitted data for their home. In doing that, they can manipulate and affect the price that Zillow comes up with for your house.

**Once you go into Zillow and claim your house, you can go in and change the facts.** Maybe you’ve made an improvement since your recent public data was pulled and you want to add to your home’s value. Once you do this, Zillow will update the value of your house within 24 hours.

Now you know how to manipulate the Zestimate a bit, but does that make it any more accurate? Listen to this. In 2016, the CEO of Zillow went and sold his house for more than 40% less than his Zestimate. That’s a pretty clear indicator that the Zestimate is not very accurate. It’s definitely not an appraisal. It would be called a “Zappraisal” in that case.

**Nevertheless, we do use Zestimates to give us an idea of a property’s value.** They have a lot of valuable data, but it’s not the end-all-be-all of pricing. Zestimates are more accurate in certain areas than others, you can check the accuracy chart for your area here. Make sure you claim your home if you haven’t yet as well.
