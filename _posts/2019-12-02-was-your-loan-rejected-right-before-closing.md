*How can you prevent your home loan from being rejected right before you close? Jake Bernhard (nmls: 870775) from United Heritage Credit Union (nmls: 630601) joins me to answer this key question.*

Some buyers have reached out to us saying that they had tried to buy a home in the past, but something went wrong with the transaction that prevented them from moving forward with the purchase. We often find that what went wrong was that the bank had pre-qualified them for their loan, but about a week before closing, they were informed that their loan application had been rejected.

Jake Bernhard from UHCU joins me today to discuss **how a homebuyer can prevent their loan from being rejected right before closing.**

According to Jake, what typically happens is that the documentation that you provide to the lender doesn’t match up to the pre-qualification that the lender had for you. In the home loan process, your loan officer will ask for certain documentation to get you started. Then your processor will also ask for documentation. After that, the underwriter will look at all the provided documentation and ask for additional documents where necessary to have a full picture of the borrower’s finances.

To prevent this scenario from happening, communicate with your loan officer and provide the documentation to them as soon as possible. Oftentimes, documentation is requested but the borrower fails to provide it. This leads to the sudden and unexpected rejection of the loan application. **You need to be diligent about providing all that is requested of you when applying for a loan.**

At United Heritage Credit Union, the business standard is to sprint from the beginning of the process and jog across the finish line—all the documentation is gathered upfront so it can be reviewed, and further documents that are needed can be identified early on.

Also, keep in mind that the title work and the appraisal will also need to be reviewed by the lender before you get to the closing table. In some cases, after their review, **a property doesn’t meet secondary market guidelines or safety and soundness requirements,** causing the transaction to halt altogether.&nbsp;

A transaction might also be put on hold **if the lender makes a mistake that the underwriter only discovered right before closing**, which prevents you from being able to close. At UHCU, they have their own portfolio which allows them to issue portfolio loans. In the event a lender makes a mistake that disallows the buyer from closing, they can just portfolio that loan to make sure that you still meet your closing date.&nbsp;

As comforting as it might be to hear from an agent and a lender how easy it is to go through the homebuying process scot-free, it’s also important to have a candid conversation about what could go wrong and why. It’s our duty to you to make sure you’re educated at all times so you don’t have any blind spots.

If you have more questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you\!
