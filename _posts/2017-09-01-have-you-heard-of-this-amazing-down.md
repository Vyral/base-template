Today I’d like to tell you about a little known program that has already thousands of people buy homes. This program can give you up to $15,000 toward your down payment. Unfortunately, many of today’s potential buyers have never heard of this program, so we want to spread the word to all of our friends and clients who might be able to take advantage of this wonderful program before it’s too late!

**Back during the housing crisis, the federal government designated funds to help in the bailing out of the housing crisis.**

However, because not all of this money was used, the funds that were left over were given to several of the most affected states in order to aid in their recovery.

Florida was one of those states. As a result, state bond money is being given out to aid in home purchases in many counties here in Florida.

Not only does the program give you up to $15,000 toward your home purchase, **it also doesn’t need to be repaid as long as you stay in the house for at least five years.**

But this down payment assistance program isn’t going to last forever—funds for the full $15,000 assistance are running low, and are set to run out around October 31-November 3 this year, and once they do, the program will change. While the program will continue, the amount of money that is offered will be dropping to $7,500, and the repayment requirements are stricter should you sell the home.

So, who qualifies for this program? If you have not owned a home in the last three years, or are a veteran, you may qualify.  Additionally, the income requirements are less strict than you might think. In fact, you can still qualify as an individual with a base salary of up to $82,600.

This program is absolutely worth checking out. If you know anyone who would benefit from this program, please feel free to forward this message on to them, and call us immediately for more details.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
