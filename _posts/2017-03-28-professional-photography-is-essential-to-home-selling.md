<br>I am absolutely amazed when I see photos of homes on the MLS that are either upside down, out of focus, or taken by a camera phone. Photography is not something you want to skimp on if you’re selling your home. Here’s why.

Listings that use professional photography to showcase their home online sell 50% faster and 39% closer to their original list price than homes that don’t. Is that a gamble you are willing to take? You shouldn’t.

Another interesting study by a New Orleans based real estate agency shows that listings using professional photography get viewed 118% more than other listings. I can’t stress enough how important this is.
