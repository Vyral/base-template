Today we are excited to share with you the five big reasons that you should list your home on the market in 2019. It’s no secret that life has been pretty sweet for sellers over the last few years. The current housing landscape has probably tempted you to put your house up for sale even if you’re happy where you’re at.&nbsp;

As they say, all good things must come to an end and you’ve probably heard that our white-hot market is starting to cool a bit. You haven’t missed the boat to sell yet, but with each passing month, experts expect the market to continue to shift in favor of buyers. We’re still in a seller’s market, but things are starting to balance out. Here are five reasons why you should sell in 2019:

**1. You won’t be the only listing on the market for long.** Low inventory has driven our market for years now. With a limited supply and plenty of hungry buyers, homes were going under contract after sparking bidding wars regularly. The tide is now turning because our inventory is increasing. The competition will only increase from here, so it really pays off to list sooner rather than later.

**2. You can still make a good profit.** Home prices have been on a meteoric rise. In January 2012, the median price was $154,700. Today, that figure has nearly doubled to $289,300. Now comes a twist. 15% of all listings took a hit in their price in January, according to Realtor.com data. That might sound like bad news, but hear us out. The moderate prices combined with today’s mortgage rates means increased buyer demand for your house. Prices are still increasing in general, just not as fast as they have been.

**3. There is high demand for homes under $300,000.** If you have a home in this price range, there are tons of buyers shopping at this price point, especially with interest rates on the rise. You’re still going to see a great seller’s market in this price range, and multiple offers are still common. The last two homes we helped buy were multiple offer situations.

**4. We’ve seen a bit of a dip in mortgage rates over the last few months.** Experts predict that they would rise at a much faster rate, but since the start of the new year, our rates have been falling. These historically low mortgage rates mean more buyers knocking on your door. The dip in rates also presents an opportunity for you to trade up into something better. There’s time to get both transactions done in this market. About 70% of our clients buy and sell at the same time, and we can help you do that too.

**5. Millennials are flooding the market.** More and more millennials are entering the housing market and have become a driving force. With a huge increase in buyers expected, that’s just another great reason to list now.
