*Here’s what you need to know about a new valuation software I’m providing for my clients called Homebot.*

Recently, I’ve rolled out an automated valuation software called Homebot for the benefit of my clients. It’s **a monthly digest that updates you on the valuation of your property**, allowing you to track your equity over a long period of time.&nbsp;

For most people, a home is their most valuable asset, and Homebot provides a way to keep a close eye on how that asset grows. It also shows you how best to monetize that asset whenever you so choose.&nbsp;

If you haven’t already signed up for Homebot, I strongly encourage you to do so, especially if you own multiple properties that you’d like to track. Just type in this URL: www.valuemypropertytoday.com. That’s my landing page where you’ll enter your relevant property information to start using this unique software.&nbsp;

It’s not a big deal if you unsubscribe after trying it and not liking it for whatever reason, but I do believe you’ll find it to be **a very good tool to track your net worth as it relates to real estate**. Do keep in mind, however, that this an automated valuation and not an appraiser’s or a trusted real estate agent’s opinion.&nbsp;

Those two sources will be more accurate with their local knowledge and boots-on-the-ground experience. Homebot is a good place to start, though, and no—it’s not the same as a Zestimate. For those simply interested in monitoring their largest asset over time, this software is a fantastic option.&nbsp;

Again, follow the link to get started, and in the meantime, reach out to me if you have any other mortgage- or equity-related needs. I’m always here to help you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
