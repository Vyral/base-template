Today I’m joined by professional structural engineer Jahan Abdoveis of Foundation Engineering Inspections (FEI) to talk a little about home inspections.

For Jahan, structural engineering is a family affair. His father was a structural engineer too, and he’s the one who started FEI. Their company handles all kinds of inspections, but their primary focus is structural inspections. According to Jahan, **the biggest home inspection issue he deals with in Tulsa is the foundation and floor slab problems.&nbsp;**

“Unfortunately, we have uniquely bad soil and uniquely relaxed building standards in Tulsa,” he says.

Becoming a certified engineer requires a lot of schooling and a long apprenticeship, so **inspectors like Jahan are the main authority on whether a home is safe and secure.** Jahan and his father don’t see eye to eye on every single home, but between the two of them, they’ve done about 50,000 inspections.&nbsp;

A great way for sellers to lay a foundation for a successful home sale is to get a pre-inspection done on their house before they list it. That way, you won’t have to deal with any unwelcome surprises when the buyer does their own inspection and you give them peace of mind that they’re getting a quality house.&nbsp;

If you have any more home inspection questions for Jahan, you can visit **<u><a target="_blank" href="http://www.feiinspections.com/">www.FEIinspections.com</a></u>** or give their office a call at (918) 865-2593.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any questions for me about our Tulsa market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
