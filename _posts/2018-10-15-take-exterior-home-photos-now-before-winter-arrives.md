Fall will be over before you know it, and with winter will come plenty of snow. This is why, if you plan on selling your home sometime between now and next spring, it’s an opportune time to take exterior photographs of it now before the white stuff comes down.

**Because 92% of homebuyers see homes online first, it’s important that you have photographs that leave a good impression**. If you take photos now, potential buyers will see a home bathed in autumnal colors instead of a white winter wasteland.

To help you make this great first impression, we will come and take professional photos for you if you’re planning on selling this spring.

If you’d like to take advantage of this offer, have any questions, or would like some more information, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
