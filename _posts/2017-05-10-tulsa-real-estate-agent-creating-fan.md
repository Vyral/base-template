Creating a fan club is one of the best things you can do for your business. I’ll explain why today.

I wanted to take a minute to talk to you about something that I’ve noticed and has been on my mind.

There are so many Facebook referral groups out there, and **there is a lot of business to be had by having great relationships with agents across the country.**

We see some negativity surrounding the term “fan club,” but at the end of the day, I chose to create my own fan club. That means I invested in and have relationships with agents across the country so **when they think of Oklahoma real estate, they think of me.**

I have systems in place and processes that allow me to ensure the relationship goes both ways and that we are able to deliver by keeping you, the referral agent, in the loop during the process. Referrals are so important to us. In fact, 16% of our business last year came from out-of-town Realtor friends like you.

So, create your own fan club! **Don’t give into the negativity or the hype.** Also, when you send a referral to someone in another area, vet that referral. It’s your job to call and qualify those agents to make sure they are a good fit for your client.

Treat your Realtor friends like a database. It’s a contact sport, so get out there and make some contacts!

If you have any questions about creating a fan club, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m here to help.
