## Emergency Infant Services: Helping Tulsa Families in Need

Emergency Infant Services (EIS) is a Tulsa-based non-profit that provides essential items and support to families with children in crisis. Founded in 1977, EIS has helped countless families by offering:

* **Basic Needs:** Food, diapers, clothing, formula, and books for children.
* **Immediate Help:** No appointment or income verification needed.
* **Community Connections:** Referrals to other social services for further assistance.

**EIS Needs Your Support!**

The demand for EIS services is high. Here's how you can help:

* **Donate:** Financial contributions or gently used clothing (infant to size 6) are always welcome, especially winter coats.
* **Volunteer:** Fold clothes, help with events, or offer other skills. Sign up on the EIS website ([https://www.eistulsa.org/](https://www.eistulsa.org/) ).
* **Attend Events:** The Young Professionals Board hosts events like the upcoming "Popping Bottles" social, where you can have fun and support EIS.
