Today I’m delighted to be joined by Zach White, from Utah Luxury Group, **who was recently named the No. 2 agent in our market center and the No. 3 agent in the entire state of Utah.**

Zach has been in the business for a little over five years now. Prior to real estate, he was a junior high history and Spanish teacher. The structure and preparation involved in teaching have both been very helpful in preparing him for a successful real estate career.

**Zach’s work ethic is second-to-none.** He credits that to his father and grandfather, who were also able to find success through the same hard work ethic. He’s motivated by his family and by being able to provide the best service he can for his clients. 

Zach is known for his great success when listing homes and he credits that to his work ethic as well. He puts in the necessary time and effort on each property to get it sold, along with a few marketing tricks. He customizes his approach to cater to each listing individually.

**Technology and marketing are essential to Zach’s business.** He told me that if you’re not using technology in today’s market, you’re falling behind. A lot of his clients aren’t full-time residents of Park City, and technology has made his job communication with those clients much easier.

In his personal life, Zach loves to hit the slopes, and he’s recently become a guide for visually impaired skiers.

Thanks so much to Zach for joining me today. If you have any questions for him or want to learn more about what he does, give him a call at (435) 640-9722 or send him an email at [Zach@UtahLuxuryGroup.com](mailto:Zach@UtahLuxuryGroup.com).

If you have any other questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
