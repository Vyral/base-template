We’re here at our new listing, 2927 Mirado Drive. Located in Mira Lagos, this beautiful, 3,100 square foot home features four bedrooms, two bedrooms, a game room, and a gorgeous open floor plan.

There are also great schools nearby, such as ISD, Cora Spencer, Mary Lillard, and Danny Jones. The property is also close to Lake Ridge High School, which is the most requested school district in Mansfield right now.

Mira Lagos is a beautiful community complete with walking trails, community fishing ponds, a clubhouse with a swimming pool, playgrounds, soccer fields - everything you want in a master plan community is here. Joe Pool Lake is nearby as well, so your family will never run out of fun activities to do!

We are having an open house this Saturday from 1 to 3 p.m. Come take a look at this property and get acquainted with Mira Lagos.

To get a quick preview, watch the video above for a tour of the home. The master suite is one of my favorite rooms in the house. It has plenty of open space so you have a lot of options - you can have a nursery, exercise space, or home office in the master suite, depending on what you need.

The kitchen features gorgeous granite counter tops and opens up to a breakfast area and family room. You will also see the formal living room, the dining room, and more.

Again, don’t miss the open house this Saturday at 2927 Mirado Drive from 1 to 3 p.m. If you have any questions about the property, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email in the meantime. We look forward to seeing you!
