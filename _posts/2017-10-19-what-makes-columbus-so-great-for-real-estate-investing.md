If you’re a real estate investor, there are a few reasons you should think about investing in the Columbus market.

A question my team and I commonly get from investors here in our area, as well as across the country, is: **“Why should I consider Columbus?”** From Dallas to Seattle, people are looking to Ohio for investments.

What makes Ohio so great is the steadiness of our values. **Things don’t fluctuate the way they do in coastal areas like California or Florida.**

But what sets Columbus apart from other cities in Ohio, like Cleveland and Cincinnati? Well, excluding Franklin and Delaware County, Ohio is declining in population as a whole. Despite that fact, Columbus is growing.

As of 2016, Columbus was growing at 9.8% year over year. As it continues to grow, Columbus is expected to become one of the top ten cities in size. Ohio State University is helping to drive this growth.

**Thousands of young professionals are graduating and entering the city’s workforce each year**. Many stay to settle down, since they already know the city’s macroeconomics are in great shape.

I myself am actually part of this demographic. I’m not native to the city, but I did decide to stay in &nbsp; Columbus after graduating.

As the state’s capital, Columbus has a lot of opportunities and a lot of job opportunities fused into it. Companies like Nationwide Insurance, Cardinal Health, and more are all contributing to Columbus’ growth. Other submarkets in the area just don’t have the same things to offer.

Especially given the presence of Ohio State University, Columbus offers some unique opportunities for investors. Student housing is a great investment, as are Class C apartments.

Some people may choose to invest in properties in the suburbs, but the options are vastly limited compared to what is available within the city. **If you do want to invest outside of Columbus, certain tertiary markets can also be a good route to pursue.**

If you have any other questions, &nbsp;would like more information, or need help determining what you’ll need to do to be successful as an investor, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
