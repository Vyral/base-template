We recently had the opportunity to sit down with another great agent here at Keller Williams, Kaitlyn Norton, and ask her a few questions about how she got into real estate and how KW has helped her career.

Kaitlyn had always been involved in sales, so getting into real estate seemed like the next logical step for her career. She heard of Keller Williams through her mother, who worked for KW herself. Once she started doing research between different brokerages and what we offered for training, however, the choice became clear. As she learned, **real estate school can get you your license, but it can’t tell you what to with it, and that’s where KW stepped in.**

“They have the systems and models and the training where you can hit the ground running,” she says. Though she did consider joining other brokerages besides Keller Williams, they didn’t offer training for new agents.

“You do need a mentor, and you need someone who is looking out for you to make sure you know what you’re talking about.”

Many of Kaitlyn’s friends have also gotten into real estate, so it’s been interesting for her to compare different teams and models with them. The biggest thing that surprises her when she talks to people in different brokerages is the scarcity mindset and the inconsistency in their business. **Being with KW, she notes, protects agents from experiencing that same kind of inconsistency because of the models and systems we have in place.** Furthermore, those same models and systems allow agents to develop their business into something bigger.

Kaitlyn’s current role is a listing specialist with the William Bustos Group, which means she primarily works with sellers and helps market and negotiate their homes. This role, she claims, is well-suited to her strengths, and she credits the mentorship she received and the models and systems her team has in place for allowing her to focus on that.

What makes her and her team unique are the drive they have to do the job every day regardless of the rejection and having the mindset to run everything like a business.

“Sometimes, people don’t see that when they get into real estate—you are running a business, and you have to have that same mentality.”

If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.
