Instead of talking about real estate today, I want to take a minute to reflect and say thank you.

As you probably know, I'm training for a marathon. As part of that training, this morning I did a 20-mile run which meant that I had three hours to reflect on things.

Since I live in an area with a tremendous number of historic markers, I started to wonder what it takes to have a historic marker. What accomplishments do you have to have? What do you need to do?

I realized early on that my mission in life is to make a difference. I love helping you guys get to your goals. I love the hugs, the cries, and the laughter, so **I just want to say thank you to all of you for helping me make a difference in your lives.**

If you start a business and your mission is only to make money, I can guarantee that you are going to fail. Your mission has to be a calling and I think that our calling here is to help others. We care greatly about our clients. We enjoy helping you get to your goals while better serving you. We know your stories and feel your pain when something happens.

This is why **I want to thank you for watching and reading this and being one of our clients.** We appreciate you more than you know. If there's ever anything you need, call us. We would be happy to lend you our bounce house, power washer, tools, folding tables, etc., because they are there for you to borrow since you have supported us through the years.

If you have any questions about buying and selling, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to working with you soon.
