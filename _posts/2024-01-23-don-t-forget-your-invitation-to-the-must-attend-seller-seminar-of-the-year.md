Happy 2024! We’re just here to remind you about our annual seller seminar, an essential event for anyone considering selling their home. Whether you're planning to sell this year or just exploring your options, this seminar offers valuable insights for everyone.

Mark your calendars for Saturday, January 27, from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Be sure to visit our website to register—**seats are limited to 50 to 60 people and tend to fill up fast!**

At our seminar, we'll cover the entire selling process in detail. We've lined up guest speakers, including an appraiser, representatives from a title company, a lender, a home warranty company, and a home inspector. They'll share their expertise and give you a comprehensive understanding of what goes on behind the scenes in a home sale.

ot only will you gain invaluable knowledge, but we'll also provide lunch. It's a fantastic opportunity to learn in a relaxed, friendly environment. Plus, there's no obligation to list with us. Our primary goal is to educate you about the selling process.

Selling a home might seem straightforward, but there's a lot that happens behind the scenes. **It's crucial for sellers to be informed about the process.** Attending our seminar will equip you with the knowledge to navigate the complexities of selling your home.

We're hosting the seminar earlier this year, giving you ample time to prepare for the most active market period, which typically runs from March through June.

If you have any questions or need further information, feel free to give us a call. We're here to help and ensure that you're fully prepared for your home-selling journey. Don't miss this chance to become an informed seller—we look forward to seeing you there!
