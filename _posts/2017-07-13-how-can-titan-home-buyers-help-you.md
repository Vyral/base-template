Today we are glad to be joined by Glenda Bastien from our sister company, Titan Home Buyers. She’s going to talk to us about how they can help you out if you need to sell your home in a hurry.

**If you’ve found yourself in a situation where you desperately need to sell your home, Glenda and her team offer a few solutions that can help you out.**

If it’s a case of too many repairs and too much work to get the home ready for the market, they can make you a cash offer on the spot.

If you are part of a military family and you don’t want to go through the hassle of having your home on the market while you’re long gone, they can take the hassle away. In fact, they’ve helped three families do this in just the last month.

**If you are facing a foreclosure, you can save your credit and get a cash offer by working with Titan Home Buyers.**

If you or anyone you know is going through a tough time and is in need of a quick home sale, give Glenda and our friends at Titan Home Buyers a call at (843) 603-3377.&nbsp;
