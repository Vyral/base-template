{% include youtube.html %}The market is extremely hot for sellers right now, and as a home buyer, it may not be as easy to get your offer accepted as it has been in the past. Here are a few tips to help make your offer stand out and win you the home you want:

1. Keep your offer simple and straightforward. This is especially important if there are multiple buyers making offers on the same property. This doesn’t necessarily mean that you should neglect important aspects of the transaction that concern you. Just keep in mind that if there is something you can do to eliminate a contingency, your offer will be simpler, and therefore much more attractive to the seller.
2. Consider writing a personal letter to the seller. I know that this may sound cliché, but personal letters really do make a difference. Statistically, it’s been shown that offers which appeal to the seller emotionally have a better chance of standing out and being accepted than other offers do. If you and your family are really excited about this home and all of its features, let the seller know all of the specifics. Compliment the way that the seller has maintained the home, include your vision of it for your family, and make sure that the letter is personalized. Don’t hesitate to include a picture of you and your family within the letter for maximum impact.
3. Have your loan officer personally follow up with the seller or listing agent. This is probably my favorite tip and the one that is the most neglected. This will make a huge impact because one of the biggest concerns for a seller is the strength of your financial situation. Most buyers will have a pre-approval letter included with their offer, but very few will have their lender call the seller personally to explain that they’ve looked over all of your financials and have determined that you are completely qualified to buy the home. A loan officer that is confident in you as a buyer will give the seller peace of mind when it comes to reviewing your offer.
4. Be ready to act swiftly in the event of a counteroffer. Strike while the iron is hot and don’t take multiple days to respond to a counteroffer. Instead, quickly consider whether you’re going to accept the counteroffer or quickly counter the counteroffer to keep the ball rolling.

These tips can make a world of difference when submitting your offer and may even help win you the home that you want in the end. If you have any other questions about buying or selling a home in our market, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to speaking with you!
