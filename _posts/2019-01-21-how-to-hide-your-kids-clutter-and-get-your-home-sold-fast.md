If you’re trying to sell your home but you have small children running around the house, that can make things a little more difficult. Fortunately, though, with these four small decorative fixes, you can conceal your kid’s clutter and switch your “For Sale” sign to a “Sold” sign:

**1. Hide in plain sight.** If you have a storage ottoman next to your living room sofa, for instance, fill it with all the toys laying around. Next, divide the credenza in your living room so your kids can store their toys behind its closed doors. Also, try accenting any open shelves with ceramic vases, neutral photos, and any other decorative items that might appeal to sellers.

**2. Hide within reach.** Discreetly stow away any clothes you don’t use regularly in multiple containers and slide those containers under your kids’ beds. You can also try concealing them by throwing a quilt over them.

**3. Rotate toys based on seasons.** Or rather, get your kids in the habit of doing this. Have them decide what they want to keep, put those items in containers, and then store them away in your attic, basement, or garage. That way, it’s completely out of sight and they’re not thinking about it.

**4. Minimize clutter to maximize style.** After your kids are done sorting through which toys they want to keep, donate, or throw away, you’ll have more space to decorate and stage however you like.
