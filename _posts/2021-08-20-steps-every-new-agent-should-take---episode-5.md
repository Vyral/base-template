We’re back for the final episode of our series on the 10 steps new agents should be doing to grow their business. Today we’ll be talking about calling expired listings, for sale by owners (FSBOs), and direct action.

We encourage everybody to call the current expired listings because there aren’t many of them. However, you should also **call the people that expired their listing two or three years ago.** Touch base with them and see if they're still looking to sell. You’ll be surprised how many people will want to meet with you because nobody else is making these calls.

There are a ton of FSBOs out there. A lot of people think it's super easy to sell your home right now, but the fact of the matter is that **FSBOs sell for about 12% less** than somebody using a trained professional. Showing your value is your ticket to getting a listing signed and building your business.

**Take direct action and have conversations.** Industry averages show that it takes 50 real estate conversations to close on one sale. These conversations should be highly intentional and about real estate. Ask if they know someone who’s looking to sell their home. Ask them for permission to stay in contact with them. Keep them updated on the market so that when they do have an opportunity or a question, you're the first person they call.

We hope you found these 10 steps helpful. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us.
