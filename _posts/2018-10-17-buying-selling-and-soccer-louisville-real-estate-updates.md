What do I enjoy more than tailgating at the Louisville city soccer match? Tailgating with past clients, current clients, and Sokoler Medley Team agents. With a big turnout, hundreds of hot dogs to share, and a great soccer game to enjoy, I’m excited to share this experience with you, as well as share the latest market updates in the Louisville and Southern Indiana area.

**You can join in on the fun starting at (3:00) in our video.**

Right now, reports are split when it comes to predicting what’s on the horizon. Some say the housing market is set to cool, while others say a recession is nowhere in sight. One report says that we’re at peak housing, and one says we’re heading toward the worst slowdown in years. All signs point to only one sure thing: A change is coming.

Let’s take a look at what facts are out there. **For your convenience, here’s where to navigate in the video to see our infographics:**

(1:17) A year-over-year breakdown of the Louisville housing supply.

(1:22) A breakdown of active listing statistics.

(1:40) How well homes are selling.&nbsp;

<br>Though the market has slowed down somewhat, we still have plenty of eager buyers and continue to sell homes throughout the year. If you’re thinking of buying or selling, have questions, or need some information, feel free to give me a call at (502) 376-5483 or shoot me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
