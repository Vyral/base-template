Oftentimes, home sellers aren’t sure if the time is right when it comes to selling their house. Here are three key questions you can ask yourself that will help you make the right decision:

**1. Why now?** Do you need the money? Is it because of current market conditions? What’s motivating you to put your home on the market? Could your reason for selling be a change in your lifestyle—perhaps a job change or a marriage? Right now in Columbus, we have about 1.7 months of inventory, which makes us a strong seller’s market.

**2. What’s next?** Are you looking to downsize or possibly upsize to a bigger house? Are you looking to have a mortgage-free lifestyle and sell your property and buy something else with cash?

**3. Who is your ideal buyer?** You need to identify who would be the ideal buyer for your property. Once you identify the ideal buyer for your property—maybe they’re a millennial, a baby boomer, or a part of Generation X—you need to ask yourself if you need to do a major renovation or you only need to do a little staging and a paint job on a lower budget.
