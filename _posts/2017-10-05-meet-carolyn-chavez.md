We recently had the opportunity to sit down with another great agent here at Keller Williams, Carolyn Chavez. We sat down and asked her some questions, which she provided some great answers to. Here’s what she had to say:

**Why did you choose Keller Williams?**

I joined KW in 2007 when the market was a lot different. I was encouraged to come here because of the training, which was an amazing thing to have as a new agent. As a seasoned agent, the continued training has allowed me to grow, expand my business, and take things to the next level.

**What did you do before you joined KW?**

I was a bar manager at a restaurant. In some ways it was similar because both jobs focus on the business of people and relationships, but as a Realtor I feel like I’m bringing more real value to people's lives by helping their dreams come true.

**What is one of your earliest memories at KW?**

One of the first things I did as a new agent with KW was meet with a successful, seasoned agent with an incredible business. We went to lunch and I picked her brain about any and every little thing. She didn’t hold back, gave me great advice, and shared with me how she was having success even in a down market. It was really cool to experience the KW culture in that way and be welcomed into the fold so warmly.

**What does that particular agent mean to you these days?**

They will always be a mentor and someone that I look up to. I know I can always turn to her for advice, whether it’s in my professional life or personal life.

**What is unique about your practice?**

My tenacity is one thing that sets me apart. People have described me as a dog with a bone. I get after it and don’t let go. I will do whatever it takes to get things done. I’ve also made it a point to really focus on my craft and develop my skill set in a way where I feel confident in pretty much any situation I will encounter.

**What is one of your favorite client stories?**

I have one client who I ran into at a Tony Robbins seminar a few months back in L.A. We had already established a business relationship and friendship, but it was great to get to see her outside of the business world. Since then, we’ve developed a deeper friendship and continue to keep in touch. I always feel tickled pink knowing that this relationship happened off of a sign call. It’s amazing what can happen in this industry when you’re open and eager to build relationships.

Thanks to Carolyn for spending some time with us. If you have any questions for us in the meantime about KW or what it’s like to work here, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
