I’m here today to discuss closing costs and earnest money: What are they and how do they apply to you?

These questions often come from new buyers in the market. Typically, the seller will pay the real estate commission for both agents. **The closing costs for buyers include title fees, lender costs, escrow, insurance payments, and more.&nbsp;**

Earnest money is essentially good-faith money that shows the seller you are willing and ready to move forward with an offer. **It’s a negotiable amount, but the more you put up, the better your offer looks.** If you’re a first-time homebuyer and money is tight, know that your earnest money can be applied toward all of your other closing costs.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
