<div style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Choosing the right lender is critical if you want to close on time, and today I want to tell you why. *<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Closing on time is a promise that every lender makes, but the reality is that very few actually do it consistently. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">When I have an initial conversation with a borrower and I ask them whats most important to them, Ill often hear things like the interest rate, the communication level, the products that are offered, and the ability to close on time. **Out of all of those factors, the one that has the most bearing on a successful transaction is the lenders ability to close on time.** 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">If you take out a loan, its very important to partner with a lender that will go through the due diligence steps up front to ensure that youre fully pre-approved. After that, they should set the correct expectations for you so that when you shop for a home, you know how to properly negotiate for it so the transaction is a smooth one and you have a happy closing. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Nationwide, about one-third of all home loans dont close on time, according to the Campbell/Inside Mortgage Finance Housing Pulse Tracking Survey. FHA loans only close on time 59.2% of the time. Conventional loans (e.g., those that are backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) only close on time 63.6% of the time. Cash transactionsbelieve it or notonly close on time 79.1% of the time.
