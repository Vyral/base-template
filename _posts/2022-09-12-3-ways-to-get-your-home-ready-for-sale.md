When it comes time to show your home to potential buyers, it pays to make sure your house is ready for the market. Keeping your property in top condition will ensure you sell for top dollar. Here are three simple but effective ways to prepare your home for sale:

**1\. Fresh paint.** As the market’s most popular color, white paint makes rooms look larger.

**2\. Flooring.** It’s worth it to invest in a nice hardwood flooring. For a smaller budget, carpet or tile are great options.

**3\. New appliances.** New means the best and most reliable functionality, which buyers love.
