Tulsa looks good on you, and it also looks good on The Succulent Shop in the Rose District of downtown Broken Arrow. I can’t wait to take you on a tour of this amazing shop today.

I’m so excited to be joined by Andrew Meredith to talk about his amazing space and how it came to be. He has a landscaping background, but it was Andrew’s wife Cassidy who actually came up with the idea after returning from her bachelorette party. **You can read the full story**[**here.**](https://thesucculentshop.com/about-plant-shop)

Their vision resulted in The Succulent Shop. It’s a fun, unique space where people can learn more about plants, how to care for them, and create customized treasures by building their own succulent masterpieces. Andrew is excited to be a tool for them. They teach new plant owners how to take care of their plants and bring in fantastic options for experienced plant people as well.

**They’re all about DIY and cultivating a family atmosphere.** There is a bar, but there are no TVs. They want families to spend time together away from the screens, come in, get their hands dirty, learn, and have a good time while doing it.

In my short period of time here, I can attest to how wonderful this place is. There are plants of all shapes and sizes. Whatever your preference, The Succulent Shop has it.

**Their greatest joy so far has been bringing something brand-new to the community and seeing people respond to it.** The people of Broken Arrow and surrounding areas have been fantastic, and they’re so excited to serve them.
