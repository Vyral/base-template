I’m excited to be joined today by my brother, Jim, to talk a little bit about buying a home in the wake of financial issues. Jim runs his own mortgage company and shared some of his insight with us.

**Life happens, and many of us go through challenging financial times and can have credit issues that pop up here and there.** If you’ve had some hard times, such as a bankruptcy or a foreclosure, there are solutions for you out there to get into a new home.

**In most circumstances, you can get pre-approved for another mortgage just two to three years after going through a financial hardship with a previous home.** You’ll get competitive rates, too. In some cases, there are programs that can help you buy a home even sooner than two years after a bankruptcy or short sale.

Thanks to Jim for joining me today. If you have any questions for him about your unique situation and how Jim can help you get pre-approved for a mortgage today, don’t hesitate to give him a call at (208) 703-9696 or send him an email at [JDildine@BOEMortgage.com](mailto:JDildine@BOEMortgage.com).

If you have any other real estate-related questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.
