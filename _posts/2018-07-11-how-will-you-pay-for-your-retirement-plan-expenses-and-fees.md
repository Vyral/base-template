Today I want to talk briefly about understanding retirement fees and expenses. One of the obligations as a plan sponsor or as part of a committee overseeing a plan is to pay reasonable and prudent expenses. **What are those expenses?**

Obviously, a retirement plan has a lot of services associated with it. There are print materials, web access, and investment management services that you’ll need to pay for, not to mention administrative work and testing. **These all require people to interact with your plan and they all require money.**

How do these expenses get paid? In a few different ways. There are billed fees, asset fees that come right out of your account, deducted fees, and more. Oftentimes, these are paid through revenue sharing, which is built into the plan.

**This process can be confusing**, so if you’d like to talk about your fee arrangements and how to make sure they’re accurate and reasonable, we would love to hear from you today. Give me a call or send me an email and I’d be happy to take a closer look for you.
