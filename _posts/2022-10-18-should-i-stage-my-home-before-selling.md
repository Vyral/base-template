Should you stage the house before you sell? This is a very common question that I’d like to answer today.&nbsp;

We recently listed a home that needed to be staged. You can see the before and after photos in the video at 0:44. The reason I want to show this house, in particular, is because **the seller staged everything on her own.** It took her a little while, but she did an amazing job. Anybody can do it. I encourage anybody looking to sell to be brutally honest with themselves and figure out how to make the house look as appealing as possible.&nbsp;

If you aren't selling or moving, I recommend you check out this other service I found called Swedish Death Packing ([video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XNbAbhQZFA){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIW3ttZzfkI){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}). The idea behind it is that instead of leaving everything to friends and family when you pass away, start simplifying your life now and get rid of those nonessential things.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email. I really appreciate all the great comments, and I look forward to hearing from you.
