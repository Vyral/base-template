Are pre-inspections a good idea if you’re a home seller? Not necessarily.
{: .present-before-paste}

You see, if you have the home inspected, make all the noted repairs, and then list the house, guess what’s going to happen? The buyer will also have the home inspected and pay anywhere from $500 to $1,000 for a battery of their own inspections.

When they hire an inspector, they’ll want to get their money’s worth, so you can be sure that **they’ll find many other problems with the home**, because no two humans are going to find the same list of issues. While you’d think you’d be prepared by getting a pre-listing inspection, you could still be faced with many issues that come up.

Ultimately, the decision to get a pre-inspection is up to you. If you’re the type of person who prefers to have a little peace of mind that’s afforded by a pre-inspection, then by all means get one. You may find some issues you didn’t know your home had.

If you’re the kind of person who wants perfection, though, there is no such thing. A buyer is still going to inspect the home on their own and find their own set of issues, and if you do choose to inspect your home and you find some issues that you choose not to take care of, you’ll be obligated to disclose those in a disclosure.

**In most cases, you’re better off leaving the inspection to the buyer.** That’s what their due diligence period is for. In the meantime, you can work with a professional such as myself to prepare your home to sell. That’s what we’re here for.
