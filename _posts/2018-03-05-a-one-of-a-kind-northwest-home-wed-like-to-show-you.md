Welcome to 3245 Northwest Thurman Street.

If you follow along in the guided video tour above, you can see a first-hand look at all the amenities and features that make this newly listed property special.

This is a remodeled modern home with old-world historic details. By entering through the romantic iron gates, you’ll find yourself inside a private courtyard with 100-year-old brick walls. This home is truly one of a kind, with a floor plan centered around an outdoor courtyard which brings the outdoors in while maintaining privacy.

**It has three bedrooms, three full bathrooms, and occupies just under 4,000 square feet.&nbsp;**Rich with history, in the 1970s the structure was in disrepair and said to once be a Willamette Heights horse stable, then a trolly car garage, and then an auto barn. It was then repurposed during that time by homeowners truly dedicated to preserving the history while modernizing and honoring the historic neighborhood of Willamette Heights. You can still see the huge old-growth beams supporting the 12-foot ceilings of the kitchen, and you will notice many architectural details salvaged from other northwest mansions of the past, like the solid oak doors, the beautiful fireplace, and the antique door hardware.

Currently, it’s had over $50,000 worth of updates just in the last six months, in addition to the beautiful remodeled kitchen and bathrooms. The master suite and a second bedroom can be found on the main level, which showcases those beautiful floor-to-ceiling brick walls. The daylight lower level below that offers wine room storage, a dumbwaiter, wood storage, a huge family room with a separate entrance, and a second master suite or separate apartment that could function as an additional dwelling unit or a possible nanny suite.

Once you fall in love with this amazing home, you can step outside and find yourself surrounded by one of Portland's best neighborhoods. It sits in close proximity to fabulous cafes, restaurants, walking trails, and shops—not to mention some of the top-rated schools in Portland.\*\*This home does not disappoint.
