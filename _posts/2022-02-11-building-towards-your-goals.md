Today I want to talk to you about the rhythm method. Let’s start by talking about how success is sequential, not simultaneous. It comes from habits that are built up over time until the goal is achieved.

Since it’s Q1 of the new year, **now’s the time to focus on your habits and your rhythms.** Do you have any? Do you have a one-page personal business plan to guide you through the rest of the year?

Have you unpacked this plan into actionable items and set aside time each week to get these items done? **Only once you’ve completed all of these steps can you execute at your highest level.&nbsp;**As always, I hope you found value in this post. If you’d like to learn more about creating a one-page business plan, or if you have any questions, please call, text, or email me. We can set up a complimentary 30-minute evaluation.&nbsp;
