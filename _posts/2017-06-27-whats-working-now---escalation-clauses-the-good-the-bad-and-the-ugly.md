Welcome to another episode of&nbsp;*“What’s Working Now!”*&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Sometimes, buyers will include escalation clauses when they make an offer. Today, I’ll go over the good, the bad, and the ugly when it comes to offers with an escalation clause.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>An escalation clause is when the buyer says, “Mr. and Mrs. Seller, I will pay this amount more than any other buyer, but I won’t go higher than this amount.”&nbsp;
<br>
<br>What’s the good thing about an escalation clause? As a seller,&nbsp;**you may be able to get them up to that higher number.**&nbsp;
<br>
<br>What about the bad news?&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Let’s say that a buyer offers $1.3 million and says that they will offer $7,000 more than any other buyer up to $1.5 million. Now, let’s say another buyer comes in and the price escalates to $1.45 million. You relay that information to the buyer with the escalation clause and the buyer may say, “Wow, I didn’t think anyone else would offer that much. Sorry, I’m out of here!”

The ugly is that you could end up with nothing.
<br>
<br>So, what’s the solution?&nbsp;
<br>
<br>**As a buyer, you should write a contract without an escalation clause.**&nbsp;If you want to buy a house and you are willing to pay a certain amount like $1.45 million, then write your offer for $1.45 million so the seller can sign off on it right away.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>You should also work with a strong agent who will give you the right advice, tell you to get rid of the escalation clause, and help you make a good offer to get that house.&nbsp;
<br>
