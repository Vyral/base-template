Why is time blocking your schedule important?

Many people will go through their days at random. If you’ve ever looked back on your day and thought, “Well, I was busy, but I didn’t get anything done,” then you may want to consider time blocking.

**On our team, we time block dollar-productive activities (DPAs) to optimize our business.** DPAs include things like meeting with clients and adding to your database, but posting on social media or sitting through entire home inspections are not.

When Realtors are unsuccessful, it’s often because they aren’t time blocking. **If you were to look at your schedule right now, would your activities match up with your goals?**
