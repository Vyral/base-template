There are some great places in our area to take the family for some fall fun.

When it comes to seasonal festivities, **one of my personal favorites is something most people know about: Shadybrook Farm’s PumpkinFest.**

But, I’ve also got a recommendation that might not be so familiar. Another great place I recommend is Eastburn Farms, located on Dorm Road in Newtown. Eastburn Farms is family operated, and was actually started as a hobby.

However, even now that it’s grown into something much bigger than a hobby, you can still expect to be treated with a lot of personal care.

The attention to detail that is put into Eastburn Farms is obvious in everything they do. They’ve got a wide variety and selection of pumpkins, **from Jarrahdale to Cinderella to your typical Jack-o’-Lantern style, and more.** They’ve also got a variety of squash, which are great for cooking.

I hope all of you have a great time taking advantage of our area’s fall festivities. Happy Halloween!

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
