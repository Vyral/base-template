excerpt: >-
  There are many moving parts to a real estate transaction, and it’s a Realtor’s
  job to guide you through the process. Even in a hot market, you still have to
  prepare and market your home, and having the right expertise behind you makes
  all the difference in terms of maximizing your sale price. What does that
  expertise look like, though? I was recently a guest on the radio show “Van and
  Bonnie in the Morning” to help answer that question. To listen to the
  interview, watch this short video.
