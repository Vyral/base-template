77% of consumers and 44% of real estate agents believe that we’re in a housing bubble, so there’s skepticism that it’s not a great time to buy a home, but there’s still potential in our market. We believe that we’ll see a slight shift in the market within the next 12 to 24 months. We don’t expect any wild changes because **people still have plenty of equity in their houses** that they can use toward a down payment for another.&nbsp;

Even though we’re in a wacky real estate market right now, it’s still a good time to buy a house. Here’s a little math for you: Let’s say you pay $2,000 per month in rent for the next four years. That’s $96,000 that could have been paying down a mortgage, where you’d also get a tax deduction for your interest payments. Instead, if you bought a house for $400,000, after four years, you’d have paid almost the same amount.

Remember that there’s a chance that our market may stay stable; many more people have excellent credit scores now than they did during the last bubble. Yes, we may see a bit of a bubble within the next year or two, but **it still makes sense to purchase a house in this market and hedge against inflation** versus riding the wave and throwing money away on rent. So if you find a house that you love, by all means, go after it.
