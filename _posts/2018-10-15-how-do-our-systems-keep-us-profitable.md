As I’ve worked to grow my team, I've also had to let go of team members. This is never, ever any fun at all.&nbsp;

However, by utilizing the 30-60-90 system with bringing on new team members after we hire them, **we’re able to make sure agents have what it takes to be successful on our team by the time their 91st day rolls around.** They have to crush their 20% tasks in those first 90 days and I’ve seen the beauty of this system.

This system has allowed my behavioral style, which would have traditionally kept team members on because I care about them and don’t want to let them down, to be able to let them go. In the past, I would have allowed to let team members stay just because of my own personal feelings.

**I had to let go of a great person today who was all in on our team and culture.** For the current role we need, though, they just weren’t a fit, which the 30-60-90 system showed me.&nbsp;

It was about what the team needs. I feel that it’s my duty as a team owner to protect our bottom line. When we have the wrong person in a role, it really hurts the whole team. I had to remove my ego from the process in order to be the protector of the profit. **If our team isn’t profitable, there’s really no point in doing this.**

By following these systems that are already created for us at Keller Williams, like the 30-60-90, it allows us to move on faster when things aren’t the right fit and we’ll keep moving forward and looking for the next great fit.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me in the meantime or want to learn more about how our team works, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
