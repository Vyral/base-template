Whether you’re a brand-new agent or thinking about entering the real estate profession, there are 10 steps you need to take to get into production and fulfill the reasons you may have (or had) for becoming an agent in the first place. Here are the first two steps:

**1\. Build a database.** The most popular reason people leave the real estate industry is that they don’t have a database of people to market to. This business is all about numbers: The more people you can market to, the better opportunities you’ll have to connect with people and gain clients. Think of everybody you’ve ever done business with, interacted with, or given money to. That could include your hairdresser, dentist, parents of the children your kids play with, etc. Once you add these people to your database, start marketing to them with your value proposition. People with the largest databases tend to have the most robust businesses.&nbsp;

**2\. Private message anybody you’ve ever bought anything from.** If you communicate enough with the people you’ve purchased things from, you’ll create an ancillary way of connecting with people. They’re getting into your database as well, but this is more of a direct or referral-type business. Either way you slice it, this is a new avenue for new and old agents to develop an income stream. We’ve all purchased something recently, so direct message whoever you bought something from and watch what happens with the business you start attracting.&nbsp;
