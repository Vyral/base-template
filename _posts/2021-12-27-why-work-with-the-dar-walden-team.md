Between our members, the Dar Walden Team has many, many, *many* years of experience in the real estate business. For myself, I’ve been in the business for 21 years now\! All of our agents are long-term agents, and **our team is a well-greased wheel.**

As you know, years of being in the business doesn’t necessarily make an agent good. What makes a special agent is the number of transactions they’ve done and the experience they’ve gained over time. If you hired an agent who has been in the industry for 20 years, but they only sell four or five houses a year, they’re typically not as experienced as you’d need them to be. We can honestly say that in our time in the industry, there’s not much we haven’t encountered.

We have a team of around 15 here in Anchorage serving the area including Willow, Girdwood, and Soldotna. Because we’re a team, **we have specialists who are specifically trained to assist you with your transactions.** If you’re a buyer, you won’t be working with a listing agent, and if you’re in the market to sell, you won’t be paired up with a buyer’s agent. The individuals on our team have each become experts in their fields, so no matter what you’re doing, you’ll benefit from their expertise.

Beyond that, we offer many different programs to our clients. For example, we have a program to help you renovate your home if you’re a homeowner who lacks the funds to get those projects done.&nbsp;

In the end, we’re here to help you with all your real estate needs. If you need assistance or have any questions, please feel free to give us a call. We would love to be your resource.
