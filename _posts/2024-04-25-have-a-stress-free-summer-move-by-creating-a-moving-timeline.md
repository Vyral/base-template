When moving in or out of your home, one aspect that sometimes gets overlooked is the timeline. It is easy for many sellers to underestimate the time required for a smooth transition, particularly when aiming to move before the start of the new school year in August.

**If you are thinking of making a move this summer, understand that timing is crucial.** If you start taking action in April, you're already behind schedule if you aim to be settled in your new home by August. Let me break it down for you.

To secure a new home by August 1, you ideally need to have your offer accepted by July 1 or even late June. This means you should start looking for homes in June or May to allow enough time for the buying process.

On the flip side, if you plan to sell your current home before purchasing a new one, you'll need to list it by May to attract potential buyers and close the deal by June or July. Consider the following preparations needed for sale:

* Cleaning, repairs, painting, and landscaping can take several weeks.
* Photography, listing, and selling should also be factored in

When you list all the things that need to be done, you'll realize the importance of starting early. My advice to both buyers and sellers is simple: don't procrastinate.
