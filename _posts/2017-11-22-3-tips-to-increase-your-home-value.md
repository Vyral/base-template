If you plan on selling your home, there are a few things you can do to increase its value.

**First of all, certain upgrades will definitely increase your home’s value**. Focus on areas like the kitchen; install granite or quartz countertops. You can also install new flooring. Fixing up the bathroom will always help out when you are trying to reach a certain price point for your home.

Next up, make sure you pay attention to curb appeal. Your landscaping needs to be just right. You should not have any overgrown grass or weeds in the flowerbeds. Keep everything on point and looking nice and pretty.

Finally, you can always let your neighbors know that you are thinking of selling. See if they will pitch in by cleaning up their areas or **making the overall neighborhood more appealing to homebuyers**.
