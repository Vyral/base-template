If you are looking to upgrade or transition to a new home, you’ll want to know these three options for buying and selling at the same time.

**Want to sell your home?** <a href="http://www.sellwithsikora.com/cma/property-valuation/" target="_blank">Get a FREE home value report.</a>
**Want to buy a home?** <a href="http://www.sellwithsikora.com/" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale.</a>

If it’s time for you to upgrade or transition to a different home, you might be wondering how you can navigate buying and selling a home at the same time. Here’s a quick rundown on how to make sure the process goes smoothly.

**Your first option is to get your home on the market and get an offer from a flexible buyer.** A flexible buyer will give you time to find your new home without the looming stress of a closing date. This is also beneficial when buying your new home, as you can tell the seller you are already done with your home inspection and have a buyer waiting for you to close.

**Another option is to sell your home first and look into temporary housing while you look for a new house.** This option gives the seller of your new home a lot of confidence because you are already completely done with your home sale and are ready to purchase their property.

**The last option is to find the new property first** and then list your home if you are financially prepared to carry two mortgages until your home sells.

Which option is best for you depends on your specific situation, so if you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
