Our team’s “Coming Soon” program, which we to our sellers, is absolutely phenomenal. In the last 12 months, we have sold every single listing we’ve taken on in just seven days, on average, and for 100% of the asking price. A lot of these sales can be attributed to our Coming Soon program.

**This program attracts buyers to your listing before we ever actually put it on the market.** By the time we put it on the market, we inundate our sellers with showings. This results in multiple offers.

One of the ways that we achieve these results is through extensive marketing. **We post your home on over 400 different websites and advertise that it is “Coming Soon.”** Since there is such an inventory shortage, the anticipation we build around your listing gets buyers excited and allows your home to gain traction. And when your listing does hit the market, we end up scheduling many different appointments for showings from the very first day that it’s active.

In addition to that, I have a massive database of buyers that are currently looking for homes. So, I go through every single one of those buyers and call them to let them know about your home.

**We also do a lot of social media marketing.** Social media has a massive influence in today’s world. So if you want to get your listing in front of people, you have to do marketing on social media.

Our client development team also helps by making phone calls. They call up and down the streets of your neighborhood to see if anyone wants to move. Some people may need a larger home but still want to stay in the same neighborhood, so we want to make sure they’re aware that your property will soon be available. Those people may even know someone who wants to move into the neighborhood as well. They provide us with referrals for us to contact.

Finally, **we advertise for a mega open house.** For the very first few days that you are on the market, we will do this and drive a ton of attention to it. Once it is on the market and people interested see others looking at it, there is a sense of urgency and excitement. As a result of this, you will get multiple offers, and we will be able to get you under contract within seven days with 100% of the asking price.

If you have any additional questions about our coming coon program or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
