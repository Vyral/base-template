Low inventory actually means big opportunity for real estate agents, and I’ll explain why today.

Thinking about a career in San Diego real estate sales?
 Email me today for a private San Diego real estate career consultation.

There are a lot of agents out there who are moping around because there are only one-and-a-half months of inventory on the market.

On the contrary, low inventory actually means big opportunity for you and your real estate business.

In fact, just last month we sold 214 homes. That is the second-highest month that we’ve had in 10 years of being in business, beating even our May, June, and July numbers.

So, how are we doing that when there are only 4,800 homes on the market?

We’ve helped our agents realize that **low inventory means big opportunity.** You can’t just do three of the four P’s in real estate. You can’t just put the sign in the yard, pop the property on the MLS, and pray that another agent brings a buyer along.

You have to proactively prospect every single day to find listing inventory.

**Send mailers, knock on doors, and consult your sphere**—there are several strategies you can use to turn this market into a great opportunity for your business.
