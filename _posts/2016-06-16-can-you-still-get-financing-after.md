One of the common questions I get from my clients is how quickly can they enter back into the real estate market if they have suffered through a short sale, deed-in-lieu, foreclosure, Chapter 7 bankruptcy, or Chapter 13 bankruptcy.

 You need to know a few things first. Depending on the type of loan product you used and which of the four procedures you went through, your time away from being allowed to purchase will vary.

**However, most people can enter back into the market in two to seven years in order to get financing.**

One other option if you’re almost done with your waiting period is to use **non-traditional financing.** The interest rate for these loans will be a bit higher, but you can qualify one day after a foreclosure or a short sale. That way, **you can get into a home, and then refinance after your waiting period is over.**

Last but not least, don’t forget to check out one of our favorite restaurants in Palm Beach: <a href="http://oldkeylimehouse.com/" target="_blank">Old Key Lime House.</a> Come and enjoy the great views, amazing food, entertainment, and a nice cocktail if you’re in the mood!
