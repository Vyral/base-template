<P style="text-align: center;"><em>Are you ready to see all the great Charleston sights? Here’s how you can do it with Sweetgrass Tours.</em></p>

I was given a guided look at the best sights in Downtown Charleston, and it’s all thanks to Sweetgrass Tours.

Their vans fit 12 people, and it’s a perfect thing to do with family or for business events.

Best of all, it’s a great opportunity to learn about the many areas in Charleston. Check out Sweetgrass Tours on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sweeegrass/){: target="_blank"} for any and all of your Charleston touring needs.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
