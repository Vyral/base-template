People often ask me whether it’s best to join a team or to work as a single agent. When faced with this question, I tend to counter it with a question of my own: What is joining a team going to offer you that is worth forfeiting half, or sometimes more, of your commission?

When you join a good team, the portion of your commission that you give up is exchanged for leads, training, and other resources they offer to their agents. This may potentially make the team environment worthwhile for you, but making an ultimate decision as to whether this is the case will require you to think critically about the cost-to-benefit ratio associated with joining a particular team.

However, working as a single agent when you’re just starting out also carries certain problems. New agents generally won’t start making a sufficient income for the first few months of their career due to a lack of experience. Agents just getting started should therefore have enough money saved to sustain themselves for three to six months while they find their footing in the industry.

This is also critical given that, during the beginning of your career, the time you would otherwise spend on networking and lead generation will instead be devoted to education. And since 57% of all real estate deals come from networking and from your sphere, any time lost from engaging in these activities will translate to lost leads and lost money.

As you can see, the decision between joining a team and working as a single agent isn’t exactly clear cut. Personally, I believe working as a single agent is the superior choice in the long-term, but that joining a team may be a good starting place for new agents. Make sure that you don’t choose just any agent as your mentor when looking at various teams, though. The greatest indicator of success is results, so you must find an agent with a proven track record. This is the kind of professional you want to learn from.

Similarly to this, a real estate team looking to hire an agent should make sure that they choose a candidate who will serve as a worthwhile asset.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like to discuss your future as a real estate agent, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
