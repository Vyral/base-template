We wanted to invite you to our Summer Barbeque Kickoff\! It’s a great way to start the summer right. We’ve had a long winter, so now it’s time to have some fun.&nbsp;

It’ll be just down the street at Lone Peak Park in Sandy on South 700 East. It’s been a couple of years since we’ve done this, and this time, we’re going to have pulled pork sandwiches. **Swing by on June 11 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.**; we’ll have games, drawings, gift baskets, and more. We can’t think of a better way to kick off the summer.

If you have questions about real estate in the meantime, please call or email us. We would love to help you.
