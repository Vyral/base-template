In this seller's market, it can be challenging to work with buyers. That’s why the AskSarita Team, are very direct when managing our buyer clients' expectations regarding list price, showings, offer deadlines, etc. They have to trust our guidance as we help them make the best deal possible, be pre-approved, prepared to make decisions quickly, and clear with their criteria.

The acceptance rate for buyers right now is very low at around 25%, which means **you have to write four or more offers before you can successfully purchase a house**. We're proud to say that our team has a higher acceptance rate than the average, and this is due to how well we manage our buyers' expectations.

After working in the real estate industry for 19 years, I have already established a solid reputation and maintained good relationships with other agents. We may not have a 100% home acceptance rate, but by having an open dialogue and building rapport with my buyers and fellow agents, we can help them achieve what they're looking for in the marketplace.

Winning your dream home right now will take some perseverance—partner with an experienced agent like myself who can help you navigate this seller's market. If you need more help with your buying plans, don't hesitate to call or email me. I'm always happy to help\!
