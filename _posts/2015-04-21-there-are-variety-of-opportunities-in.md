The spring season is here, and with that comes one of the busiest times of year for real estate. Today we are going to look at the spring market and how it's shaping up for 2015 as we continue into the busy selling season.

It has been a fast-paced spring so far and home buyers are out there looking for homes and making offers. One way we measure activity is through the absorption rate, which is a measure of inventory in our market. As a whole in our MLS, there is around a 4.5-5 month supply right now, which puts us in a neutral market.

However, every neighborhood is different. Even though as a whole we are in a balanced market, certain price points are selling more quickly than others.

For example, right now in the $200,000 and $300,000 price range, we have 114 homes for sale, with 40 homes being sold last month. This gives us a 2.8 month supply of inventory of these homes, putting them in demand in a strong seller's market. 

To give you an idea of what's going on in Fishers, right now there are 424 homes for sale, with 133 being sold last month. This puts Fishers at an inventory level of just over 3 months.

We hope this helps you out when you are thinking about buying or selling in Indianapolis this spring. If you have any questions, be sure to give us a call or send us an email.. We'd be happy to answer them!
