How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the real estate market?

Here in Mecklenburg County, real estate has been deemed non-essential, which means **we agents aren’t allowed to show a property in person to someone unless there’s a contract in place with money at stake.** In other words, if there is a contract in place, we can operate under established CDC guidelines: We can order inspections and appraisals, visit a property, perform walk-throughs, etc.&nbsp;

That being said, my team and I have put a lot in place so we can work virtually and protect buyers, sellers, and ourselves. To get an exclusive rundown of what our team is doing to keep you safe, follow this link to our website. We’re still functioning at a high level, and we have the ability to take care of any buyer or seller needs virtually while maintaining the very best health and safety guidelines.&nbsp;

The state government may not consider us essential, but buyers still need to buy, and sellers still need to sell. Life is still happening out there, and people need to move. For example, my wife and I were in the process of building a house before the pandemic hit, and we still have one house to sell and another to finish. Many people are undoubtedly facing similar situations.&nbsp;

We know you’re concerned with what’s happening, and **we want to be able to address those concerns and show you how we can still help you achieve your real estate goals.** If you’re a buyer, you may be able to get a great deal on a home right now. There’s a lot of pent-up demand, and once all of these restrictions are lifted, I think we’ll shift back into an extreme seller’s market. Additionally, interest rates are volatile, but still very low.&nbsp;

If you have questions about our local real estate market or are thinking of buying or selling now, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.
