If you're in the market to buy a home, doing so during the holidays might end up being the best decision of your life. There are a few reasons why.

Buying a home over the holidays could end up being the smartest decision you'll ever make. There are a few reasons why:

**1. There is less competition.** Bidding against other people when there is a lot of activity and little inventory makes it very difficult for a first-time home buyer to get into the marketplace. It can be hard when properties get priced above what you're ready or able to pay for. It can also be intimidating to be in a bidding situation where you need to react very quickly and, sometimes, spend more money than you're ready to spend. During the holidays, inventory may still be low, but competition also slows down.

**2. Sellers who have their home on the market during the holidays tend to be more serious and motivated to sell.** Many sellers will take their home off the market during this time because they want to focus on the holidays. The sellers who keep their home on the market over the holidays are very focused on selling. They also tend to be more reasonable and open to negotiation.

**3. A home you love is a great gift to yourself.** During the holidays, you always want something for yourself and your familyâ€”what better gift than a new home? Think of buying at this time as you are buying yourself a big Christmas gift.
