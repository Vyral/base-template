If there was ever a time you needed to make informed decisions in the real estate market, it’s now. It’s a crazy seller’s market, it feels unbalanced, and it may even feel unfair to buyers. If you’ve ever had any doubts or anxiety about putting your home on the market, put them to rest. **Now is the time to sell your home.&nbsp;**

The home behind me in the video above is a three-bedroom, cape-style home in the Wallingford area that sold for $25,000 over asking price to a first-time homebuyer. We received multiple offers for this property within the first couple of hours.&nbsp;

**Despite how well homes are selling, there’s an art and science to pricing and listing homes.** It’s not about listing high to get the highest price; sometimes the best strategy is to price at or just below market value to create a feeding frenzy and multiple-offer situation. Professional photography and video services matter, along with all the other things real estate agents can provide.

If you’re considering selling your home or have doubts or questions, call, email, or visit our website. Let us, the local real estate experts, help you position and sell your home.
