If you haven’t heard, rates have increased big time—more than half a percent, up to three-quarters of a percent, depending on the product. What does that mean to you?<br><br>It means that if you were looking to buy, upgrade, or refinance a house, **things have gotten a little bit more expensive.** If you are in the market to purchase, please contact me now so that we can run updated numbers for you and show you not only what the payment would be today at a certain price point, but also what that payment could potentially be if you wait until later to buy.

If your rate goes to 5% or 5.5% percent, as a lot of economists are predicting before the end of this year, **it’s really going to drive up that back payment** for you and also detract from your purchasing power.

Maybe you were barely qualified. Maybe it barely fit within your budget today. Just know that **the house you’re looking at is going to look entirely different on paper six months or a year down the line.**

In this market, you’ve got to &nbsp;have sense of urgency. In San Diego, prices are still continuing to increase, and when you have the combination of prices and rates increasing, it definitely creates a perfect storm. If you’re thinking about joining the market, **do it now**, before the prices and rates get away from you.

For questions about buying or selling, please feel free to contact me. I’d be happy to help you navigate the market to get you the home you want at a price you can afford.
