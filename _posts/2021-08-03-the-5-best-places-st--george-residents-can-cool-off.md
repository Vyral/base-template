Itâ€™s been a hot summer thus far, so today Iâ€™ll take you on a tour of the five best places St. George residents can go to cool off and enjoy themselves:

**1\. Pine Valley Recreation Area.** As they say, if you canâ€™t beat â€˜em, join â€˜em, and if you canâ€™t beat the heat, just leave. The Pine Valley Recreation Area is located about 45 minutes away from St. George. The ducks love it, the kids love it, and the senior citizens love it. It only costs $6 to enter, and the town of Pine Valley is free to explore as well. The best part? Itâ€™s 20â„‰ cooler than St. George is.

**2\. The town square splash pad.** This is one of my favorite places to cool off in the summer. Itâ€™s fun for all ages, and Iâ€™ve run through it with my kids many times over the years. Itâ€™s located right in the heart of downtown, and itâ€™s completely free.&nbsp;

**3\. The St. George municipal swimming pool.** Iâ€™ve been coming to this place for 40 years. At 1:40 in the video, I had one of their lifeguards join me to give his input.

**4\. Veyo Pool Resort & Climbing.** Could there be a natural, spring-fed swimming pool in a volcanic canyon in the desert? The answer is yes, this is where youâ€™ll find it. Youâ€™ll also have the chance to snack on a Pronto Pup, which is Utahâ€™s version of a corndog. I've been coming to this place even longer than the St. George municipal pool, and as you can see in the video at 2:36, the crowds flock here even on weekdays.&nbsp;

**5\. Someone elseâ€™s swimming pool** ðŸ˜Ž. If all else fails, find a friend, family member, or neighbor who has a pool. Thatâ€™s what I did most recently\!

If youâ€™d like to talk more about the best places to cool off this summer or have any real estate questions, feel free to call or email me anytime. Iâ€™d love to hear from you.
