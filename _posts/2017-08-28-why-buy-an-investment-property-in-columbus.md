Buying an investment property here in Columbus is a great opportunity you should consider taking advantage of, and there are a few important reasons why.

According to Michael Hamby, we have a lot of owner-occupant buyers looking to buy their first home, and we’re currently working with people from all over the country looking for investment properties.

First, **there are many macroeconomic factors at play.** We’re not only the state capital of Ohio, but we’re also one of its largest and fastest-growing cities. People from all over the state migrate here for jobs, and the presence of many big industries and Fortune 500 companies drive that growth.

**Ohio State University is a another important factor because of student housing.** Of all the investment properties we sell, a significant portion come from the two zip codes (43201 and 43202) that surround that campus. If you’re interested in this area, you should use a professional property management company to help find you a renter because it can be very competitive. Most of my clients investing in this area have 90% to 100% occupancy.

Properties are selling very quickly in these two spots, and landlords are taking two different approaches in response to this—they either try to drop rent or they make the place a little nicer to keep the rent where it was. If you consider the sophomore housing rule and how it affects demographics, the market will be back to where it was in three or four years.

Along with students, there is a sizable portion of young professionals looking to rent or buy in the campus area, and most new graduates move back there anyway because of its central location and housing opportunities.

Before starting your search for an investment property, **make sure you know someone on the ground.**Whether it’s us or another agent, talk to someone who knows the area you’re interested in, has sold investment properties there before, and has connections with commercial agents.

**Also, stick to your numbers.** Investment purchases aren’t like traditional residential purchases. Again, it’s important to work with an agent who understands this concept. Mike himself owns several investment properties, and I’ve bought and sold many of them too. We are also both part of many investor groups

If you’re a buyer and you’re not sure a home is right for you, you can move into an investment property to save some money and wait until you find the right house for you.

If you have any questions for Mike or would like to reach out to him, you can call him at (614) 519-2297. If you’d like to know more about real estate investing or are thinking of buying or selling a house, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to hear from you.
