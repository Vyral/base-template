How can you make your home ready to list this spring?

Winter is obviously a very hard time to list your home. A lot of things can be left unkempt. However, if you’re ready to list your home this spring, here are some pointers you might want to consider in preparation.

**1. Curb appeal.** Your yard is the first impression buyers will have when they pull up to your home. Rake up all those dead leaves and grass and spruce up your yard. Utilize the weather becoming warmer to plant some flowers. You might also consider power washing your sidewalks to clean up the grime and salt that the melting snow left behind.

**2. Spring cleaning.** Clean up both the interior and exterior of your home. For the inside, declutter your space and organize the items that you leave in place. For the outside, clean the mildew from your roofs and wash your windows. We have a list of recommended local vendors that can help you with these spring cleaning projects.

As always, the very best thing you can do to list your home this spring is find the right Realtor. That’s where we step in.
