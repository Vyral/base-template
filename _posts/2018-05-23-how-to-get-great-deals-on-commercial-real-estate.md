People often approach me to ask where they can find great deals on commercial real estate. One response my team and I often give is to explain the option of purchasing a foreclosure property.

As a reminder, **foreclosure is when the bank takes back possession of a property from a tenant who wasn’t paying their mortgage.** This isn’t as common in commercial real estate, because commercial properties tend to require higher down payments and much more capital to be invested. But, it definitely still happens.

So how do you find foreclosure properties? **Well, just like in residential real estate, you can be set up to receive search alerts when a property is being foreclosed on.** The different asset classes depend on what you’re purchasing, but I’d say the most popular are multi-family assets. There are also industrial, retail, and office asset classes.

A lot of these properties may also end up going to auction rather than being foreclosed upon by the bank. Our team has formed relationships with many of the auction companies here in Columbus and across Ohio, and so we would be happy to connect you with them or provide more information about what they do.

In my personal experience, I was able to sell a property through an online auction within 30 days of listing it.

Another option my team and I recommend for pursuing great deals on commercial real estate is to have us set you up to receive alerts for available commercial properties below a specific price point. For example, let’s imagine that there are some local apartments that sell for around $100 per square foot. My team and I can set you up to receive alerts when similar listings become available for $50 per square foot or less. This search would include foreclosures, as well.

**Obviously commercial property is driven more by the income it generates than by price per square foot, but a cheap property is a cheap property.** Industrial properties here in Columbus typically trade for between $20 per square foot and $40 per square foot, but there’s a listing now for a property that’s just $7 per square foot. This is a very affordable deal.

Of course, I would definitely say that it takes expert advice to make sure you’re making informed decisions when you pursue commercial real estate deals. My team and I would be happy to provide that guidance for you.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
