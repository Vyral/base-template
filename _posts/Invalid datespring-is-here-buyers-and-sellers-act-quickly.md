The spring market is usually our most robust time of the year for buying and selling homes. However, this year, it may be even more important than others because **the Federal Reserve has indicated that interest rates are going to go up.** They’ve already crept up a tiny bit, but this means something for both buyers and sellers.

For buyers, if you wait until the end of the year and interest rates have gone up, say, 1% on a $300,000 loan, that **could mean an additional $180 per month on your payment.**

For sellers, this means that if you put your house on the market now, **there could be a larger pool of buyers** because there could be more who will qualify for your house.

Either way, if you’re thinking about buying or selling your home, give us a call so that we can talk about your specific situation and set you up for success.<br>
