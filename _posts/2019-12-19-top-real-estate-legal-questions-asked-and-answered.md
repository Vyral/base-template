We really rely on real estate attorney Justin DeCrescente to help us through all our transactions. Today he joins us to answer some key legal questions and recurring themes related to real estate transactions.

Honestly, the language of New Jersey real estate contracts can be confusing. Many times, buyers will hesitate when presented with a contract because they don’t feel like they’re ready. When that happens, they give Justin a call to ask if it’s okay to sign a real estate contract without first speaking to an attorney.

For the most part, Justin tells them that **it is fine.** Especially when the clients have come from New York, where the process is completely different, they’re taken aback by someone asking them to sign a “Contract for the Sale of Real Estate.” Nevertheless, there is a very distinct paragraph on these contracts that says, “Studied by an Attorney,” aka an attorney review clause.&nbsp;

When someone calls him after signing a contract, he usually tells them that as long as the fill-in-the-blank parts of the contract read the way they’re supposed to, you’re fine. **Things can always be changed during attorney review**; you don’t want to completely restructure a deal, but we can certainly tweak things. If you do need to change something drastically, we can do that, too.

So when a buyer or seller accepts or presents a bid, it comes in contract form, but they’re not legally obligated to follow it until they’ve finished the attorney review process. In fact, New Jersey case law says that if the attorney didn’t draft the contract, the contract cannot be binding until the client has an opportunity to consult with an attorney to make the contract binding.

Typically in a real estate process, there are three initial steps: First, a bid is presented; next, the bid is accepted; and third, the contract is sent to an attorney for review. Sometimes, though, I’ve gotten calls from sellers saying that the buyer’s attorney has rejected the contract.

Justin says that, because it technically is a contract, **if the parties choose not to consult with an attorney, the contract would automatically become binding as written three business days after.** Case law says that attorneys have to disapprove of and cancel the contract, after which we reinstate the contract subject to the acceptance of the additional terms, either in the form of a rider or an attorney review letter.

For Realtors, buyers, and sellers, **setting expectations is so important.** The main point to keep in mind is that when you’ve accepted a bid, it’s not legally binding until you go through attorney review. During attorney review, the attorney may reject the contract in its current form and replace it with some new conditions.
