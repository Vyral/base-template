Do you feel stressed out? I know I do. Working full time and keeping up with my four daughters makes it increasingly difficult to find tranquility and relaxation. That’s why I decided to incorporate some Zen principles to create a comfortable haven for all of us.

In interior design, Zen reflects balance, harmony, and relaxation, and here’s how you can apply it to your own bedroom.

First, **choose a natural color pallette**. Neutral colors like white, gray, and warm brown provide a timeless backdrop that evokes the calmness of nature and matches any accent color for an ordered space.

Second, **invest in a great bed.** A substantial and comfortable bed promotes a good night’s sleep. Opt for a mattress with a dense memory foam core—it’s awesome! When arranging your furniture, position the bed against the wall farthest from the door. This achieves a sense of safety and allows for more foot traffic to flow through the room. Also, consider anchoring the bed with a heavy wooden or upholstered headboard or a dark accent wall. These things create a sense of being enveloped or cocooned.

Next, **pay special attention to the lighting**. One of the most annoying ways to lose sleep is by glaring sunlight flooding your space. To create a nurturing sleep space, cover windows with light-blocking roller shades framed by beautiful linen drapes. To give the room a welcoming glow at night, frame the bed on either side with table lamps or wall-mounted reading lamps. Soft, indirect light, rather than the harsh brightness of overhead light, will help maintain healthy circadian rhythms.

Lastly, **layer on those natural textiles.** From wool rugs to cotton bedding, go overboard on high-quality natural textiles. The softness of the material will cushion sound and make comfort and calm a priority. For large area rugs, look for 100% wool since synthetic blends don’t hold up as well to traffic and vacuuming. When shopping for bed sheets, choose 100% cotton with longer fibers, such as Egyptian or Pima.
