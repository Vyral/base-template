Each year, thousands of homeowners unnecessarily lose money when they sell their homes. They don’t lose money because someone took advantage of them, and they don’t lose money because their home “wasn’t marketed well.” **Even seasoned homeowners lose thousands of dollars because they didn’t know about the important factors that influence the value of their homes in the eyes of a buyer**.

Not only will I share with you those crucial and essential factors involved in preparing your home to sell for top dollar today, but I’ll also let you know how you can receive a no-cost, no-obligation report for your home to ensure you don’t lose money\!

Potential buyers are much more likely to return to a home that impresses them at first glance, while homes that appear disorderly or poorly maintained seldom sustain buyer interest.

**Here are six problems your home may have that can instantly turn buyers off:**

1. Home odors
2. Worn and dirty carpets and floors
3. Paint and Walls
4. Clutter
5. Signs of pests
6. Unkempt landscaping
