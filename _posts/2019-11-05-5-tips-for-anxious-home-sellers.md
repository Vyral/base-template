<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Home sales can be sped up from the normal timeline through a few different strategies. Here are five of them.</em></p>

If you need to sell your home quickly, there are a few things you can do to differentiate yourself from the other sellers out there and give yourself a better shot at a quick sale:

**1\. Price your home correctly.** When you’re looking for a quick sale, sometimes you have to price a bit below market value to show that you have the value to necessitate a quick sale. A lot of times, however, doing that creates a bidding war that brings the price back up to market value or even higher in some cases.

**2\. Declutter.** First impressions are big. As buyers are walking up to your home, you want the yard to be nice and clean, and the same with the home.

**3\. Stage your listing.** Staging your home allows you to set the stage for buyers and could expedite your sale as well.

**4\. Be flexible with showings.** The more willing you are to show your home, the better chance you have of getting more offers more quickly.

**5\. Offer an incentive.** Right now, you could offer some closing cost assistance or a home warranty that will help you stand out even further.
