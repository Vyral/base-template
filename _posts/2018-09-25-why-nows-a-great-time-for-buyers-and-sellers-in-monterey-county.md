What’s the latest news from our Monterey County market? From August 2017 to July 2018, the market stayed pretty consistent, which was pleasantly surprising. When I looked at the statistics, I expected to see big fluctuations with the list-to-sales price ratio, but it has actually stayed in the 92% to 97% range. Not only is the Monterey County market consistent, but it’s also robust, which means that it is a great time for buyers and sellers to make their move.

When looking at real estate statistics, however, it’s important to remember that they are neighborhood-specific. Even though we just mentioned how consistent Monterey County is, your local neighborhood might look different than the other surrounding neighborhoods.

If you'd like to learn more about our local market, don't hesitate to call or email me for more information. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
