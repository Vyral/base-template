Today I’m here to explain our “Friends of the Myles Group” rewards program. It’s our way to shower our past clients and referral partners with monthly giveaways, exclusive offers, and fun client events to show our appreciation for your continued business and referrals.

**The first level is the “silver level.”** All of our past clients and anyone who has referred business to us in the past automatically begins at this level. You’re eligible for monthly giveaways that you’ll find out about via email and our exclusive Facebook group at the beginning of each month.

If you refer one buyer or seller to us or hire our team for a second transaction, you move up to the “gold level.” You’re eligible for the giveaways, plus six months’ worth of Starbucks benefits.

**To become part of our exclusive “platinum level,” you need to refer three or more buyers or sellers to us within 12 months.** You’ll get all the silver level and gold level benefits, plus exclusive invites to our platinum client events throughout the year.

You can find more information on our FAQ page here. If you have any other questions about the program or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
