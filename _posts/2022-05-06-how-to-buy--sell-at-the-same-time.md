Today we're going to talk about how to buy a new home and sell your current home at the same time. **Here are the three key points to think about when involved in this kind of transaction:**

**1\. Planning.** Your plan should start at least four to six months in advance. Starting the process early will save you a lot of stress. Communication is crucial during this process, so we like to coordinate with our clients months in advance to make sure that we're on the right path. Then you can prepare your home for sale because you never know when the perfect home is going to come to market.

**2\. Commitment.** Juggling both transactions on top of everything else in life is stressful, so you just need to commit to the process. You can lean on us for help because part of committing to the process is being educated about it. When clients we work with don't expect what's coming, it takes them by surprise, and they get frustrated.

**3\. Execution.** We sit down with our clients and explain the contingencies of the contract and write out a plan for the entire process. We may tell you some things you don’t want to hear at first, but if you trust the process and remember that we only have your best interests at heart, I guarantee you’ll be happy in the end.

If you have any questions or are planning to sell and buy a home, call or email us as soon as possible so that we can start making a plan. We look forward to hearing from you.
