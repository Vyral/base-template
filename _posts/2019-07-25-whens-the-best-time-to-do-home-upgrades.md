People often ask us when they should do their home upgrades: right now, or when they’re getting ready to sell their home?

**No matter what upgrades you do, you first need to realize that you’re never going to get 100% of your money back on your investment.** Your upgrades will make your home much more saleable and you’ll likely get a higher price for it, but dollar for dollar, you won’t get a full return.

With that in mind, we highly encourage you to do any upgrades that you want to enjoy while still living there whenever you want to. If you want to update the bathroom or kitchen, refinish the hardwood floors, or replace the roofs, **time your project so that you’ll have ample time to enjoy the finished work.**

If you have any questions about upgrading or selling your home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to hear from you\!
