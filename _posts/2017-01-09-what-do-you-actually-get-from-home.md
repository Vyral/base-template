Not many home buyers seem to truly understand what you get with a home inspection, so today, I wanted to clarify the possible outcomes of such inspections.

**Want to Sell Your Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.com/list/" target="_blank">Get the Value of Your Central or Southwest Virginia Home</a>
**Looking to Buy a Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.net/" target="_blank">Search All Homes on the MLS</a>

When it comes to home inspections, one of the most common misconceptions is that they cover only a basic inspection.

**Home inspections are designed to give you a report card on your house.** In the grand scheme of things, it outlines everything a home inspector can find during a three- to four-hour window. They won't find everything, but they will find more than just the basics.

An inspector will look at the systems, appliances, and HVAC, to name a few. Their job is to give you a good report card of your house, because not all these items will be covered by the contract, and not all these things will be repaired by the contract. Instead, **you'll get a good list of things to work on in the house.** Remember, when you buy a house, you buy a used house; it's going to have issues.

The good news is that you'll get a really good report up front to know what's wrong with it.

If you have any questions about home inspections and what you get from them, or you're ready to buy or sell a home in the Roanoke market, give me a call or send me an email. I'd be happy to help!
