We know that the market is a bit rough out there because there are so many buyers and so few homes for sale. **The No. 1 question I’ve been hearing from people lately is “Should we wait until things settle down a little?”** If I knew the answer to that question, I’d probably be spending a lot more time in Vegas playing poker. Nobody knows what will happen in the future, but I did want to share a quick tidbit from one of my favorite morning newsletter publications, “The Morning Brew.”

Here’s the quote from John Burns, who explained to the WSJ that,&nbsp;*“Institutional investors, like pension funds, are swooping in to buy single-family homes in the U.S., driving up prices, and potentially creating another housing bubble.”*

About 20% of homebuyers never moved in, meaning they’re owned by investors. What this suggests is that **as long as there is low inventory and high buyer demand, the prices are likely to continue to rise.** We don’t know for sure what will happen, but we do know that you need a winning strategy to come out on top. We’ve been very successful in helping both sellers and first-time homebuyers because of the creativity and agent connections we have.

If you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
