{% include youtube.html %}&nbsp; *Our duplex development in Caldwell is well underway. Here’s why the demand for this type of property is so high.*

Today I’m here at our duplex development out in Caldwell. Last time I was here, it was just a bunch of vacant lots. **But as you can see in the video above, there’s much more going on now.** We’ve sold six of the eight duplexes we have here, but we’ve run into a problem.

**There’s a ton of demand for these multi-family units, but there’s a limited supply.** If you have some land that’s in an area where we can put duplexes or fourplexes, I’d love to have a chat. I could probably have sold 50 of these things if we had the land to build them on. Just a quick word of advice to anyone looking to take advantage of the market right now.

If you're looking to invest in multi-family properties yourself, I’d love to hear from you too. Just give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
