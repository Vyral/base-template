Today I’m joined by Shiloh Glaze from FloorScapes Austin to talk a little bit about what his company does to take care of all of your home’s floor needs.

FloorScapes Austin’s primary focus is on carpet cleaning, tile and grout work, hard concrete, and hard surfaces. **Though their primary area of business is Cedar Park, FloorScapes Austin will come out anywhere between greater Central Austin to the Lake Travis area to up and around Round Rock.**

What makes FloorScapes Austin different from the average floor company? Shiloh says that **they have a 12-step process that they employ on every project.** First, they’ll pre-vacuum every area they’ll clean, pre-treat any spots in the carpeting, and deodorize the whole space. They also use a truck-mounted system that separates them from everybody else. Their main focus is to make the cleaning process as stress-free for the customer as possible, which is why Shiloh will personally come out to properties and deliver the customer an estimate before actually starting the cleaning process.

What tips does Shiloh have for floor upkeep during the winter season? His advice for home buyers who have recently purchased a new construction home is to **make sure all of the grout around your tiles and hard surfaces is sealed before the holiday season.**

The same goes for carpeting. One of the things that FloorScapes Austin does that many other floor care companies don’t do is scotch guard your carpet with carpet protectant. With all of the snow and foot traffic of the holiday season, a carpet that is not scotch guarded can get grungy very quickly. A scotchguarded carpet can be cleaned much easier with regular vacuuming.

For all of my clients who have recently bought a home with our team, Shiloh has a special for you. Reach out to him on his personal cell phone number at 817-729-5653, mention this video, and you’ll get 25% off your first <a href="http://floorscapesaustin.com/">FloorScapes Austin service.</a>
