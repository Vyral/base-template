Today I just wanted to say a few words about “get-rich-quick” real estate seminars and how you should view them.

There are some great seminars out there about how to flip houses and sell real estate. I’ve been to many in the past. However, here’s my rule of thumb: **If it sounds too good to be true, it likely is.**

A lot of these “gurus” will tell you that you’ll be making $50,000 a month in real estate. Maybe it is possible with the right person, but I don’t know anyone that’s doing that.

Now, you can make money in real estate by investing. You can buy a home that needs work, put some repair money into it, and sell it for a profit. **You can make good money doing that.** However, you can lose a lot of money doing this if you don’t know what you’re doing.

I think what a lot of these people fail to teach you is that there is a lot of behind-the-scenes education and knowledge that goes into these transactions. Just as easily as you can make $20,000 on a home, you can lose $20,000. It’s a risky venture, but there is reward there.

Can you make money by investing in real estate? Yes you can. Can you get rich quick by doing it? Probably not as quick as you think.

If you’re interested in buying or investing in a property anytime in the near future, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to answer any questions you might have.<br>
