By now, you’ve all probably heard the same home selling tips over and over again. You know you need to paint your home in neutral tones and that hiring the right Realtor can make a big difference in your success.

But what questions should you ask Realtors before you hire them to make sure you choose the best agent for the job?

Well, first of all, you should ask about their credentials. **Ask them how long they’ve been an agent, how many sales they’ve closed, and about their track record overall.** You can also ask whether they specialize in a particular area.

All of these questions will give you a better idea of whether an agent is qualified to sell your home. Beyond qualifications, though, you’ll also want to discuss how an agent plans to sell your home in particular.

They need to have a personalized strategy for your listing, so ask them about how they would price and market your property. The right agent should never simply tell you what you want to hear. **It’s crucial that they give you the facts and help you achieve real success.**

Of course, real estate teams are all the rage right now, so it’s likely that you’ll be in communication with more than one person throughout the process. If this is the case, talk to the Realtor about their team.

And finally, there are a few questions you should ask about your own role in the process. Ask **how much the sale will cost you, how long the process will take, and what you as a seller will need to do to prepare your home.**

These are just a few key questions that any quality Realtor will be able to answer with ease, and their responses should give you an understanding of what you can expect from your transaction.
