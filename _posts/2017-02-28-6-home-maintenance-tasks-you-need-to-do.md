As a homeowner, it’s important that you keep up with home maintenance. It’s especially important when you are preparing to sell your home. Here are six tasks that you should take care of today:

1. Apply a coat of fresh paint throughout the house. Fresh paint will go a long way and make your house show very well. Spiff up the walls, cabinets, doors, and trim. Make sure you eliminate scuff marks.

2. Redo your laundry room. Take advantage of every square inch of the laundry room. Make sure the room is clean and organized so that it looks as open as possible. Don’t just leave a big pile of clothes in there.

3. Clean out your dryer vents and ducts. Not only will you take care of a dangerous fire hazard, you will also lower your utility costs.

4. Clean your refrigerator coils. Save energy and improve the longevity of your fridge’s life.

5. Give your mattress some love. Flip the mattress, rotate it, and vacuum the coils so that the mattress is fresh and comfy.

6. Look for leaks. Inspect the roof for missing tiles and damaged vent hoops. You should also check out your foundation. If you’re not sure how to inspect your roof, take a flashlight into the attic and look for leaks. That can help you determine if you need to address any issues with the roof.

Taking care of these six home maintenance items will make your home more appealing to buyers. Even if you are not selling for a while, these six tasks will improve your home and make it feel fresh.
