When you sell your house in the spring market, you want to avoid these five mistakes at all costs.

**Want to sell your home?** <a href="http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/free-home-value/" target="_blank">Get a FREE home value report.</a>
**Want to buy a home?** <a href="http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/homes-for-sale-search-advanced/" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale.</a>

If you're getting ready to sell your house in the upcoming spring or summer months, there are five mistakes you want to avoid making:

**1. Do not overprice your home:** Even in this appreciating market, it could cost you in the long run.

**2. Don't leave minor repairs undone:** Minor repairs are part of getting your house ready to list on the market.

**3. Don't overimprove:** Don't think that spending a ton of money on improvements will all come back in your bottom line. Consult with your Realtor about which upgrades will make you your money back when you sell.

**4. Don't make it hard for buyers to see your property:** With low inventory in our market, we have a lot of motivated buyers. A lot of people will want to see your house in the first two weeks it's on the market, so make it as easy as possible for them.

**5. Don't try to sell on your own:** You might think you'll save money on real estate commission, but in this appreciating market, it will cost you more than if you sell with a professional real estate agent.

If you have any questions or you're thinking about making a move in the Las Vegas market, give me a call or send me an email. I'm always happy to help.
