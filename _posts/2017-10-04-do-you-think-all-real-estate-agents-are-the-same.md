  Do you think all real estate agents are the same? Unfortunately, many are. But
  not us. To show you how we’re different from other teams out there, we’ve
  launched a new website.

Today, I’ve got a question for you: Do you think real estate agents are basically the same?

I think many people would say, “yes.” And unfortunately, they are often right.

At the Wicker Homes Group, we think that’s unacceptable. **We are on a mission to raise the bar in our industry.** We want to bring a new level of professionalism, service and integrity to real estate.

With 30 years of experience helping clients buy and sell homes, we’ve developed a 19-point system that delivers proven results for our sellers. &nbsp;<br><br>**To help our clients and friends better understand this system and the difference it makes, we’ve launched a new website: [www.SellWithWHG.com](http://www.sellwithwhg.com/).** It’s a one-stop shop for anyone thinking of selling their home.

There, you’ll find our 19-point selling system, along with samples of our marketing and professional photography. Our goal is to drive as many potential buyers to see your home as possible. It’s all about making sure you get top dollar for your home.

On our seller portfolio site you will also see a map of our past sales, bios of seller team members, our awards, mission, vision and values, access to Debbie’s List and our video blog.

We’ve also included **a page with our Zillow reviews so you can see what our clients have said about us.**

Check out the new site and let us know what you think!

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
