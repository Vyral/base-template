Today I want to talk about a few specifics regarding the home inspection process when you are buying or selling a home.

When you’re buying a home, we always recommend getting a home inspection done, even if it’s a brand-new home. There are always going to be issues that you won’t be able to see with the naked eye. **A home inspector will check the foundation all the way up to the roof to make sure everything is in proper working order.**

When you ask a seller for repairs, try to keep the list to major items only. A blemish on the wall or carpet isn’t worth getting hung up about. Your inspector will go through the home with a fine-toothed comb and be able to tell you any and every imperfection.

If you’re a home seller, don’t freak out about the inspection list. A lot of the items are minor. Realize that the inspection is just a part of the home buying process and you will have the opportunity to make repairs. **In fact, you might be able to save quite a bit in repairs by having a home inspection completed before you list your home.**

If you have any questions for us about home inspections or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
