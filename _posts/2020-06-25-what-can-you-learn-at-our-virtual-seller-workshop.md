<br>Are you curious about how to sell your home in this new normal? Maybe you like planning ahead and just want to see what sort of things you should be doing right now to prepare for a move in the future. Either way, you should join us on Tuesday, June 30, for our Virtual Seller Workshop\!

Like you, we at The Wolek Group are adjusting to life and work in this pandemic era. Believe it or not, **homes are still moving in Tulsa, and the real estate market is hot\!** We’ve modified our business to ensure that you are safe while still achieving your real estate goals. We’d love to share with you, through Zoom, how we help over 100 families a year buy or sell a home in the Tulsa area, and make the process as smooth and stress-free as possible.

We’ll share the most recent market data, current staging and design trends, and all of the ways we’re able to help you through most of the process without any physical contact\! We look forward to sharing our listing and staging secrets with you, as well as walking you through the home selling process so you can be ready when the time is right\!
