Now that we’re already into February of 2020, a new year and a new decade, how much has the Athens area real estate market changed in the last 10 years?

**My team and I compared the data from 2009 and 2019, and the results are pretty amazing:**

* Homes sales increased from 2,048 to 3,782
* Bank-owned sales decreased from 657 (meaning 32% of all 2009 homes sales were distressed sales) to 55 (1.5% of all sales in 2019)
* The average sale price increased from $166,533 to $264,268
* The average days on market decreased from 195 to 60 days

Here’s one more stat to think about: In 2010, 1,935 homes sold, and 40% of those were bank-owned sales. This makes sense when you consider that we were still in a recessionary period back then.&nbsp;

As you can see, we’re in a completely different market and economy now. If that average sale price increase is not a case for homeownership and real estate investment, I don’t know what is. What changes are in store for our market this decade? **I anticipate that real estate will continue to increase in value, and the way we shop for and view real estate will change as well.&nbsp;**

If you have more questions about how our market has evolved in the past decade, or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
