A question I’m often asked by home seller clients is, “How long does it take to close on a home purchase?” In general, most homeowners can prepare to close around 30 days after an accepted offer. The buyer initiates the process by submitting a formal offer. Depending on the type of offer, the home may need to be appraised, inspected, or repaired before the lender will close on the purchase.&nbsp;

**There are a lot of moving parts, so closing in faster than 30 days can be challenging.** The lender will also need to gather financial documents from the buyer and finalize the loan. You can save time by accepting a cash offer, but it’s still a good idea to get an appraisal done. If a buyer or seller wants an extended closing for whatever reason, it’s all negotiable.

If you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
