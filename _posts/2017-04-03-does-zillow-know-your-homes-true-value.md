One of the most common questions I’m asked is, “What’s the deal with Zillow’s Zestimate and is it an accurate representation of my home’s value?”

A Zestimate is a statistical model that Zillow runs on basically every home in America. The number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, special features like pools, and location all go into their model.&nbsp;**The one thing it can't look at is condition, which is an important part of your home's value.&nbsp;**That’s an important part of your home’s value.

The main ingredient for a Zestimate is the data they pull from public records. That data includes tax assessments, as well as any mortgages that may be tied to the property. It also includes past sale history. However, Mississippi is a non-disclosure state. That means when you sell a home, the information from the sale, specifically the sale price, is not entered into public record. **Therefore, Zillow does not have access to the data from our state.&nbsp;**Zillow rates their Zestimates’ reliability on a scale of one to five stars. Here in the Jackson, Harrison, and Hancock County areas, Zillow gives their Zestimates a one-star rating.

What can you do to actually come up with a good pricing strategy for your home? Give me a call. I’ll take a look at all the data that Zillow does not have access to and compile a comparative market analysis for you. Then I’ll come out to your home to assess its condition and offer staging tips. **Then we can sit down, go over all the data together, and come up with a price that makes sense.**
