Are homebuyers still eyeing fixer-uppers these days?&nbsp;

**The short answer is no.** We live in an increasingly fast-paced world where people want what they want on demand, and real estate is no exception. Homebuyers are seeking move-in ready, hassle-free properties that they can swiftly close on.&nbsp;

For years, the running joke has been that buyers are looking to have the moving truck show up at 10 a.m. sharp, so they can welcome guests to the cookout at their new home by 5 p.m. that evening.&nbsp;

Obviously, this is meant to be hyperbole, but the fact remains: **Buyers of today don’t want to have to tackle a long list of upgrades after closing on a home. &nbsp;**

I can’t emphasize enough how important it is for you, as a seller, to get your home in prime condition. Otherwise, buyers won’t even give it a second glance because they know they’ll have the ability to borrow more money for a home in better condition and at an exceptionally low interest rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Simply put, **as a seller, you want to extract the most value out of your home sale, so we need to make a concerted effort to ensure your home is in turnkey shape.** For any questions related to real estate or if you or someone you know would like to make a move, please let us know today.
