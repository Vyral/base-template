Here’s what’s happening in our post-election real estate market.

People have been asking me what the market looks like now that the election is over. To be honest, the trend that we are seeing isn’t what I expected. What happened to the real estate market post-election?

 For one thing, **it has picked up quite a bit.** Even though interest rates have hiked by about 0.75%, it didn’t stop buyers whatsoever.

 We are also starting to see the luxury market moving again. It seems that people who had money parked and were waiting to see how the election went have decided to stay purchasing homes in the $1 million to $2 million range.

 This is **also a very active time for investors.** It seems that they are focusing on properties that can house five families or more. There are also a lot of 1031 exchanges going on. Please feel free to contact me if you don’t know what those are.

All in all, it seems a lot of **people are crunching numbers and putting together some pretty big investment deals.** Even though the market slowed pre-election, there seems to be a lot of consumer confidence right now, creating a very active market.

 If you have any further questions feel free to reach out either by phone or email. I look forward to staying in touch!
