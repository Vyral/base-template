How much money do you need to put down when you purchase a home? Contrary to popular belief, you don’t necessarily need to have 20% down.

How much money do you need for your down payment?

Clarksville is a military town, **so many of our residents are eligible for VA loans and can get a house for no money down.**

If you do not qualify for a VA loan, there are still many loan programs that can get you into a house for less than 20% down. Depending on your credit score, you can get a conventional loan with 5% down. If you qualify for an FHA loan, then you only need 3% down.

We also have local programs where the **seller can pay most of the closing costs for you** and you won’t have too much of a down payment.

If you have any questions about your down payment or if you want to know more about buying a home, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
