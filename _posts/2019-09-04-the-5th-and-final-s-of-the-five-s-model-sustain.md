It’s finally time to explore the fifth and final “S” of the Five-S model of customer experience: Sustain. At this point, you’ve set expectations, kept your clients updated along the way, you’ve surprised and delighted throughout the transaction, and now it’s over. **Once you’ve done all of this, now it’s time to sustain the relationship in order to create a client for life.&nbsp;**

You need to make them feel special, but it doesn’t require a ton of effort or planning. **First off, make sure you call them a few days after closing to thank them for allowing you to help them.** This is also a surprise and a nice thing to do. It’s not a call for a referral; it’s purely a gratitude phone call.

**To properly sustain a relationship, you have to have a touch program in place.** If it’s already built out on your calendar, you won’t forget to keep those who are most important to you in the loop.&nbsp;

So many people think that real estate agents are just money hungry. When you don’t call someone after closing or maintain your relationship with them, you’re essentially proving their point. I know that’s not who you are, so that’s why you need to take steps now to make sure you stay in touch with all of your clients in the future.

**Let me know some of the ways that you stay in touch with past clients.** We use a lot of events and giveaways to increase engagement, but we'd love to hear about what you’re doing.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
