Getting ready for our fifth annual pumpkin pie giveaway was quite a task—organizing pallets of pies to hand out a whopping 1000 of them! **We had a blast during Thanksgiving week, connecting with our community at both the West Des Moines and Indianola locations and sharing delicious, oversized pumpkin pies.**

We owe a huge thank you to our fantastic team and generous sponsors for making it all happen. Wishing everyone a wonderful holiday season, and we're already looking forward to next year! To see some of the fun things that happened during the giveaway, watch the video above. And as always, if you have any real estate concerns, call or email me. I’m always happy to help.
