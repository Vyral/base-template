How is the real estate market looking so far in 2020?

Well, the great news is that interest rates have come down even farther—we’re currently hovering in the mid 3%-range for 30-year fixed loans, and even closer to 3% for 15-year fixed loans. This makes it a really fabulous time for buyers to lock in those low rates and save some money on their monthly payments.

With these low rates, there’s a lot of buyer demand. Our inventory is still very, very low, which makes it competitive for buyers to get into a house. On the selling side, however, homes that are priced right and in good condition are generating multiple offers and excellent prices.
