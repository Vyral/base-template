<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Overpricing your home is risky and, ultimately, a mistake. Greyson Dixon joined me recently to help explain why.</em></p>

I was recently joined by real estate rockstar Greyson Dixon to talk a little bit about a specific instance that he recently dealt with. Greyson is one of the top agents on our team, and he was able to help a home seller correctly price their home and get it sold, but not without some struggles along the way. **Here’s an outline of our conversation, with timestamps so that you can skip ahead to the section(s) that interest you the most:**

0:45- A little background on Greyson’s unique pricing situation with his client<br>1:50- A summary of their initial conversation about pricing and how market conditions played a role<br>4:30- How Greyson’s clients justified their price and why it was unrealistic<br>5:30- Why Greyson chose to give his clients the benefit of the doubt at first<br>6:20- When and why they decided to reduce the price three times<br>7:30- The kind of activity a home seller should expect if they’re priced correctly in this market<br>8:20- How condition plays a role in price<br>9:15- How Greyson would handle this situation if he had to do it again<br>10:05- The key takeaways from this story that can help future home sellers out there

If you have any questions for Greyson, feel free to give him a call at 801-686-8389. If you have any other questions for me, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
