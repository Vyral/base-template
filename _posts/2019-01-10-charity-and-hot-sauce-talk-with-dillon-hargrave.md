Today I’m joined by a great client and friend turned business owner, Dillon Hargrave of Baby D’s Bee Sting.&nbsp;

**Dillon is also the literacy director over at&nbsp;**<u><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.neighborsalongtheline.org/">Neighbors Along the Line,</a></strong></u> a small nonprofit organization in West Tulsa. They offer GED programs for adults, as well as after-school tutoring at Mark Twain and Tisdale Elementary Schools. The majority of the money to fund this program comes from donors because they don’t get a lot of state or federal funding. Before this, Dillon was with the nonprofit Reading Partners.

**These days, Dillon is venturing out on his own****.** Last year, he founded a hot sauce company,&nbsp;<u><a target="_blank" href="https://babydsbeesting.com/"><strong>Baby D&rsquo;s Bee Sting,</strong></a></u> and makes it right here in Tulsa. They currently make six different flavors and are finally shipping nationwide. From the original to the triple-X death sauce, there are plenty of different options. You can find them at the Cherry Street Farmer’s Market or online. The 5-pack travel size hot sauce pack is a great gift idea, and if you use the discount code “wolek,” you can get 25% off site-wide!

I love their hot sauces and if you’re a fan of spice, you will too. In the meantime, if you have any real estate questions for me or have any needs that I can assist you with at all, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
