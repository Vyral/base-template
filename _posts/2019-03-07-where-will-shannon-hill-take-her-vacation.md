As you know, I recently announced the winner of my 2018 referral raffle—Shannon Hill—and today Shannon joins me to announce where she’ll be taking her all-expenses-paid vacation.

**Her destination of choice is…Gatlinburg, Tennessee!**

Shannon is a good friend of mine and has referred a lot of clients to me, and I’m more than happy to give her three days of fun and adventure right next to the Smoky Mountains.

If you’d like to be a part of my next referral raffle and have a chance at winning an all-expenses-paid vacation, please let anyone you know who is looking to buy or sell about us here at Woodland Eco Realty. Your business allows me to do what I love most: helping others in the community.

If you have any other questions or you yourself are thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
