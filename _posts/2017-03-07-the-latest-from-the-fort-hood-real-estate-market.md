What’s happening in our local market?

**Right now, we’re in a buyer’s market.** That means there are more homes on the market than there are people looking to buy homes. If you’re a buyer, now is a great time to make your move. Interest rates are also low, which only adds to the appeal of buying a home.

If you’re a seller, you can still sell your home—you’ll just need to work a little bit harder and price your home competitively.

If you have any questions about our market or are thinking about buying or selling, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help!
