Today I’m going over four tips for improving your credit when applying for a home loan.

How can you improve your credit score when applying for a house loan?

First, **don’t open or close any credit accounts**, as that will lower your score.

Second, **check your credit card balances.** You want to keep your credit card balance at 25% or less or if you can, pay off the cards each month.

Third, this may be common sense, **but don’t switch jobs.** You generally need two years in the same line of work and one year with the same employer.

Finally, **don’t buy new furniture or a car until after you’ve purchased the home**. Those types of big purchases could significantly affect your credit score.

If you have any questions about buying a home or getting a better credit score, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m more than happy to help!
