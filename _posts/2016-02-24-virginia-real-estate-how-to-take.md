Today we’re going to be talking all about refinancing, and whether or not you should consider it as a Loudoun County homeowner.

If you haven’t taken advantage of a refinance in recent years, now is the time to do so. Interest rates are still at near historic lows. Even though the Fed raised short-term rates at the end of 2015, they haven’t trickled down to the long-term rates yet.

If a refinance has been on your to-do list, now is the time to pull the trigger. After 28 years in real estate, we know that every home and every situation is unique. If you have any questions for us at all about your specific situation, we would be glad to answer them. Just give us a call or send us an email, and we will talk to you soon!
