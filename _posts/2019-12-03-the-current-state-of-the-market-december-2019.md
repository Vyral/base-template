<center>Today let&rsquo;s reflect on the year-to-date 2019 real estate market and what we predict for the end of this market year.</center>

&nbsp;

So far this year, the number of new listings has increased by about 5.5%, meaning that more properties have been hitting the market. The interesting part of that is we also saw the number of new contracts with pending homes increase by a similar amount. This shows that the market is absorbing all the new inventory—**this is a great sign for those who are thinking of selling their homes this year or next.** However that’s not the only great sign for sellers in our market:

Our average days on market are down by 9.6%, meaning that not only are more homes selling, but they’re also selling faster.

Plus, the median and average sales prices have increased by a whopping 6%, and **we anticipate our market finishing out the year really close to that figure.**

All in all, it’s been a great year for us, and especially for those who already own a home and are thinking about selling. Don’t hesitate to reach out to us for any questions you have about the market or about selling your home quickly and for top dollar. We’d love to help you.
