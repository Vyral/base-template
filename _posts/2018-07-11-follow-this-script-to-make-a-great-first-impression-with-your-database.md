Every one of us has a database. Whether it’s Facebook friends or the contacts on our phone, all of us have people we can reach out to.

We know the value of establishing a great foundation in your business based on your database, so we have a script you can use to introduce yourself to your database. **This is the follow-up script my team uses to call people after we’ve done the Facebook exercise that I mentioned in a [<u>previous </u><u>video</u>](https://yourjourneywithjennie.com/how-to-use-facebook-to-grow-your-database.html):**

*“Hey, it’s (name) with the Wolek Group! How are things going? I’m so excited—I started my new job and I’m just calling all my friends and family to let them know it’s official. I am now in real estate with the Wolek Group.”*

Depending on who you’re talking to, there are three different ways you can continue with the script, but here’s how I’ll continue in this example:

“*You know, I’ve been looking forward to this for awhile. I mean, the Wolek Group loves helping buyers and sellers and they helped over 100 families last year. I would love to mail you some of my business cards when they come in. I want to make sure you have them in case you hear of anyone who may be looking to buy, sell, or invest in real estate. My team covers all of Metro Tulsa, so no matter where they may be moving, I can help. I have your email address, but may I also have your home address?*”

Don’t be afraid to ask for a piece of contact information—they will always give it to you:<br><br>*“I just want to make sure I have the best contact info for you. Obviously I would love to be your new resource for all things real estate. Also, if you hear of someone moving out of the area, we have a huge database of agents all over the world, so I can help them get in touch with an excellent agent anywhere. Either way, please keep me in mind. Since real estate is referral-based business, I really appreciate your support. As soon as my cards come in, I’ll get you one. Thank you so much! Well, I’ll let you get back to work—I’m sure you are super busy. Great talking with you, and tell Mary (or whoever) I said hi.”*

*The point of this script is to follow it so you don’t get off track. It’s really easy to get distracted, so **stay in line with the words.** There is a purpose behind this script, and it keeps you focused.&nbsp;*

Also, you really need to share your enthusiasm. The people you’re calling already know, like, and trust you, and they want to support you. Be comfortable asking for contact information and don’t get sidetracked by wondering if you’re bugging them or not, or if they think you’re too pushy or sales-ey.&nbsp;

Lastly, make sure you get the best possible contact information from them. You’re building a business, and that starts with building a foundation based on your database. We’re in a relationship-based business, and you need lots of relationships in order to have a big business.&nbsp;

After you use this script, feel free to reach out to me and let me know how it’s working out for you. If you have any questions about it or there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to call or email me anytime. I’d be happy to help you.
