<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This Thanksgiving message is one of gratitude for you and what we have.</em></p>

This year has been one like no other in our country. We’ve had many challenges and changes and had to make quite a few adjustments. However, we’re still standing and have a lot to be grateful for; we have a country that offers us freedom and opportunities. We’re grateful we live in the greatest country in the world; there’s no place like America.&nbsp;

**We at Vision Realty appreciate everything you’ve done to help us succeed**—we’re extremely thankful for you. This Thanksgiving, we ask everyone to be safe, follow health guidelines, and have a great time with family and loved ones. Happy Thanksgiving\!
