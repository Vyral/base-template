Today I’m excited to introduce you to my friend Luke Frazier with INSPiRE Financial Group. I met Luke at a Tulsa Chamber of Commerce event and I was so inspired by him and how he runs his business as a financial planner.

**Luke started this firm three years ago with what he calls “uncommon knowledge”.** He felt that the industry as a whole was going in one direction, but not enough people were asking why. We’ve taken that knowledge and applied strategies and recommendations behind it to better our clients. As opposed to the stock market, they tend to focus on cash flow.

Products and services can only get you so far if you don’t have a strong “why.” **For Luke, he believes that there are five core areas in which everyone is trying to improve:** Relationships with family and friends, career, finances, spiritual well-being, and physical well-being.&nbsp;

Luke and INSPiRE feel like the financial aspect too often adds stress or negatively affect the other five areas. Their goal with their clients is to put strategies in place to turn the financial aspect into a positive and positively affect the other areas.

**Way too many people are relying on Wall Street and big banks for their finances.** Luke and his team promote investing in themselves instead of Wall Street or big banks. They work with a lot of small business owners and even real estate investors to produce cash flow instead of just putting money away and not ever seeing it for 30 years.

**Their program is based on what the truly wealthy people in our country do.** They go to work and make money, put their money to work for them, and use other people’s money to make even more money. They finance their own deals and use their own leverage, and Luke uses a lot of these types of strategies with his clients. As opposed to paying a lump sum for a boat, for example, you can take that amount and put it towards a rental property, for example. The income on the property can pay that mortgage and the loan on the boat. If we repeat that process over and over, it will create wealth.

Everybody has a different personality and mindset about finances. Where Luke and his team shine are with the clients with abundant mindsets who want to get wealthy now and not wait for it for later.
