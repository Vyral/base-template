<center>June is World Pollinator Month and a great time to plant some flowers.</center>

&nbsp;

When we were younger, most of us were very idealistic and set out to change the world. Now, with a few miles under our belts and maybe a bit more cynicism about our ability to change anything, **there is still something that every one of us can do right now to make an absolute positive change in our world.**

If you didn’t know already, June is World Pollinator Month. It’s the month where we are supposed to give attention to the insects, birds, plants, and wildflowers that pollinate our world. **Did you know that honeybees pollinate ⅓ of the entire world’s crops?** This means that a third of the food we would eat wouldn’t be available to us if it were not for the humble honeybee.&nbsp;

Since 1945, the honeybee population has been cut in half as our human population has tripled. You may have heard about all of the problems and issues with hive collapse and danger to the existence of the honeybee, which translates to danger to the existence of the human race.

Can you do anything about it? Absolutely you can. **It can be as simple as planting wildflowers in your own backyard.** Anywhere you have a monoculture grass, consider putting in some milkweed, some American beauty berry, or some sunflowers. Anything that honeybees and other pollinating insects can use to spread that pollen to other plants and crops.

What in the world does this have to do with real estate? Well, we can’t sell it if we don’t have a beautiful, abundant, healthy world to live in. Regardless of what brokerage you’re a part of or what side of the political spectrum you’re on, I hope we can all agree that we want a healthy ecosystem. Go plant some wildflowers\!

If you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
