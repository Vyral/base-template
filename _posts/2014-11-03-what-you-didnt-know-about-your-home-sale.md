Did you know that 92% of consumers are searching for homes online? Because of this, it is crucial your home shows well online if you are going to get people into their cars and through your doors. But how can you make your home stand out from the competition online?

At the Vallee Gold Team, we go above and beyond when it comes to getting your home ready to show. We hire an interior decorator to go into your home and repurpose your furnishings for flow and positioning, so we can get the best images possible.

If you've already vacated the property, we work with professional stagers to bring furniture to your home and make it look irresistible. We'll get professional photographs taken so your home shows in it's best light online and in-person.

If you have questions about what we can do for your home, give us a call. We would love to help you get your Tucson home sold!
