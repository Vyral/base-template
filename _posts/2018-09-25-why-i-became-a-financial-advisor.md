*By Nathan Bopp*

There’s always that one person in your life who influences, encourages, and motivates you more than anyone else. For me, that was my grandfather. We were close throughout my childhood years, but as I got older, we started having more in-depth conversations about bigger life issues, such as money. As I became interested in financial planning and investing, my grandfather would tell me stories about what his advisor taught him and how he helped him. There was never any doubt that my grandfather’s advisor was taking care of him and his money.

When it was time for me to choose a career path, my grandfather’s experience with his advisor was my inspiration to enter the financial industry. My hope was and is to offer people the same peace of mind that my grandfather’s advisor gave to him.

## Launching My Career

I had passion and motivation, but I needed knowledge and experience to build a solid foundation. I earned a bachelor’s degree in finance and economics from Ohio University, and eventually went on to receive an MBA from Kent State University. Throughout my early years as a financial advisor, I pursued designations that would give me the skills and information to better serve my clients, including CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ (CFP&reg;), ACCREDITED INVESTMENT FIDUCIARY™ (AIF&reg;), and Retirement Income Certified Professional&reg; (RICP&reg;).

## My Career Today

Since 2000, I have been providing financial planning and investment management advice to clients, giving personalized guidance to each one of them. Just as my grandfather’s advisor did for him, my goal is to help my clients actively pursue the life they have always imagined.

I want my clients to feel appreciated and know that I don’t take their trust in me lightly. I want them to feel comfortable enough to share their greatest fears and desires and know that I listen to and deeply respect them and their goals and wishes. I continuously strive to do my part to improve their lives.

## Challenges And Victories

As in any job, there are obstacles that can cause difficult days. For me, the hardest challenge I’ve had to face in my career is dealing with the death of a client. I place a high priority on building long-term relationships, which means I develop strong personal connections with my clients. When a death occurs, I’ve lost a friend more than I’ve lost a client. I think my clients recognize how much I invest in them. In fact, one of the greatest compliments I’ve ever received was when a client told me that he was so comfortable working with me that he knows his wife will be in good hands if something ever happened to him.

But despite difficult circumstances, I can’t imagine having any other career. There’s nothing more fulfilling than seeing clients reach their financial and life goals. When I start working with a client, those goals and dreams often seem so far off. That’s why it’s so satisfying to see progress and celebrate with them when they achieve their goals. &nbsp;

## Working Together

I am passionate about helping clients develop a personalized plan that works towards their long- and short-term financial goals. Whether you’ve already started planning for the future or have yet to put strategies in place, I encourage you to reach out to me today for a no-obligation conversation to see how I may be able to help you.
