You’ve probably been hearing a lot about the future of our market in the news lately, and today, we’re going to get to the bottom of what may lie ahead by reviewing some projections, as well as some recent market trends.

On a national level, average home prices have appreciated 5.5% since this time last year. Locally, however, appreciation levels haven’t been quite so high, with average Pennsylvania home prices seeing an increase of just 3.6% year over year. Of course, these numbers only reflect the statistical average on a broad scale. Real estate trends vary between different counties, and even between different neighborhoods.

Also, **according to findings by CoreLogic, August 2018 had the slowest appreciation rate in nearly two years.** This may be part of why we’ve seen affordability issues lately. Buyers and sellers alike have been hesitant to enter our market as a result of recent trends, with buyers holding out for greater affordability and sellers waiting for greater appreciation.

Everything in our market is connected. As such, everything we’ve mentioned so far has also had an impact on supply. We’re still currently experiencing low inventory, and with mortgage rates beginning to climb, this trend is likely to continue. **Now at approximately 5%, the current average interest rate for 30-year fixed mortgages is higher than we’ve seen in the past eight years.**

With all this in mind, you may be wondering what we can expect from the coming year.

In terms of appreciation, forecasts predict that we’ll see an average national growth of 4.7% and an average growth in Pennsylvania of 5.5% between August of this year and August 2019.

As we’ve already mentioned, interest rates will continue to rise as we move into next year. The bottom line is this: **Buyers and sellers alike should make their move as soon as possible.**
