Today we’re going to talk about Guild Mortgage’s new “3, 2, 1” mortgage program. We just rolled out this brand new, exciting loan program that could be just what you’re looking for as a homebuyer.

Here are the basics. **It’s a 30-year, fixed conventional home loan that only requires a 3% down payment instead of the typical 5%.** But wait, there’s more. In addition to a lower down payment, Guild Mortgage will also give the buyer an additional $1,500 to use towards their down payment, closing costs, or whatever else.

Finally, when the loan closes, **this program also gives you a $2,000 Home Depot gift** card that you can use to buy appliances, furniture, and more.

There are a few rules. It’s a fixed, 30-year program and you have to have a 620 credit score to qualify. It also has to be used on a pre-owned property.

I just wanted everyone to know about this fantastic program that might be the perfect fit for you, a friend, a family member, or someone else you know.

If you have any questions for me, feel free to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. Remember, it doesn’t cost a penny to talk. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
