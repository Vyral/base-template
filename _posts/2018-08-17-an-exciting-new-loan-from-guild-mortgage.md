Today we’re going to talk about Guild Mortgage’s new “3, 2, 1” mortgage program. This exciting new loan program could be just what you're looking for as a homebuyer.

**Here are the basics: It's a 30-year fixed conventional loan that requires a 3% down payment and a credit score of at least 620.** Beyond that, the loan may also only be used to purchase a pre-owned property.&nbsp; But wait, there’s more. In addition to a lower down payment, Guild Mortgage will also give the buyer an additional $1,500 to use towards their down payment, closing costs, or whatever else.

Finally, when the loan closes, **this program also gives you a $2,000 Home Depot gift** **card** that you can use to buy appliances, furniture, and more.

I just wanted everyone to know about this fantastic program that might be the perfect fit for you, a friend, a family member, or someone else you know.

If you have any questions for me, feel free to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. Remember, it doesn’t cost a penny to talk. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
