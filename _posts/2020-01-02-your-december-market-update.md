Today I’m delivering a quick market update and information about our upcoming spring market.

Today I wanted to give you a quick market update as we wrap up the year. 2020 is coming up rapidly\!

Currently, we have 1,743 sold homes in the last six months. We’re in a great, strong market. Right now there are 207 pending property sales, for this time of year, that’s excellent. We also have about 609 properties on the market.

Believe it or not, our spring market starts in about four weeks. **We will see the activity pick up promptly after the first of the year.** This creates an interesting opportunity for those ready to sell their home. Many sellers don’t believe anything sells before April. However, the great thing is that for the first 60 to 90 days of the year we have many active buyers who are eager to move, and low inventory. So there’s a wonderful opportunity to sell in the first two to three months of the year.

The biggest objection we frequently hear from both buyers and sellers is that they do not want to move in January. The great news is that if you list your home in January, you often won’t close until February or March. So, if you’re thinking about selling, **at present the interest rates tend to be lowest of the year**, inventory is the lowest, and it is a fantastic time to put your house on the market.

If you have any questions give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to speaking with you soon. Have a joyful holiday season\!
