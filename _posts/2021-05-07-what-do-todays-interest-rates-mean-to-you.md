I’ve been selling real estate for 17 years. When I first started, mortgage interest rates were in the 8% range. Some of my colleagues remember them being over 10% before that. We used to think a low interest rate was anything under 5%, but I’ve seen rates well under 3% over the last few months.

**The cost of money has never been lower.** If you’re getting a rate at 2.85%, you’re paying roughly $25 per month for every $10,000 of your purchasing price. When you look at buyers who are paying extra to buy homes, this is something they point to. They may be offering $20,000 over list price, but it’s only going to cost them an extra $50 every month.

The one mistake everyone makes is going with the high end of what they’re approved for. **You should be looking at homes based on the monthly expenses you’re comfortable with.** Your buying power has never been stronger than it is right now, so it’s a great time to buy.

If you have any questions about your specific situations or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
