Thanksgiving is not only a time for pumpkin patches and turkey dinners; it is a holiday that reminds us to take some time to think about the lessons we’ve learned, acknowledge the areas in which we’ve grown and look back on all the great memories and good people who have come into our lives. With complete gratitude, the Patty Sells NC team wants you to know that we appreciate you so much and we are very grateful that you are a part of our lives. We wish you and your loved ones a Happy Thanksgiving!
