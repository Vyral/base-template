The traditional real estate process is no longer a method that works for sellers, and I’ll tell you why.

The traditional real estate process is lengthy and confusing for sellers. The first step that agents usually take is the listing interview, where they may be afraid of giving staging suggestions to the owner of the property for fear of insulting the owner. They’ll suggest a starting price and put the house on the market immediately without taking the time to adequately stage the home.

The seller will sign a long-term listing contract with no “easy out guarantee” in case they aren’t satisfied, and **after a month on the market they’ll put the price reduced sign out on the front lawn.** Does that sound like a successful process to you?

The average traditional Realtor lists one to two homes a year. They might not own a digital camera. The photos on the MLS may not be updated as the seasons change. They don’t do premarketing or a pre-inspection on the home, and one broker monitors hundreds of agent’s listings in those large corporate real estate offices you think of. There are no systems for monthly marketing meetings, either.

**There are so many unstaged homes with ineffective pictures online that a well-staged home will stand out from the competition and be noticed.** Something as simple as updating photos to match the current season will make a world of difference to potential buyers.
