Today I want to bring our brand-new website to your attention.

Our new site was created with you in mind. As a matter of fact, your feedback was taken to improve the site.

The No. 1 thing most people want when they look at a real estate website is to be able to search like an agent. Now we’re able to give you an **advanced search with more options**. For example, you can search by city or subdivision; you can include or exclude country clubs and 55-and-over communities; and, if you’re a seller, you can even see sold activity.

If you’re looking to buy a property, you probably have a lot of questions besides, “What’s for sale?” Well, **we’ve put together a top-level resource for you**. You can:

1. Get to know Treu Group Real Estate a little bit more
2. Get the information you need to know before you decide to buy
3. Go through what to expect with the offer process

If you’re a seller, don’t feel left out; I’ve included information for you as well. Sellers can learn about:

1. The appraisal process
2. The offer process
3. Staging
4. What to expect while their home is on the market

If you are looking to buy or sell and haven’t been on our site lately, **jump back in and check it out**at [www.treugroup.com](www.treugroup.com). I think you’re going to love it.

When you’re ready to either sell your current home or buy your next home, we’re here to help, whether it be your first home, your move-up home, your dream home, or maybe your sunny retirement home. Looking forward to hearing from you!
