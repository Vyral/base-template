Today let’s take a look back on the market over the first four months of 2019 and compare them to the first four months of 2018.

Earlier in the year, we predicted that the Hoboken market would stabilize, and comparing the numbers from the first four months of 2019 to those of 2018, it looks as though that prediction is coming true.

In Q1 of 2018, we had 92 unsold units. **This year, that number is up slightly, with 108 unsold units.**

The number of **closed units decreased year over year from 250 to 210, though the average sales price went up by 2.79%**, and the days on market rose from 41 to 44 days.

The absorption rate in our market went from **2\.75 months in 2018 to 2.35 months in 2019**, which really shows the strength of our current market. For reference, a normal, stable market has between five and six months of inventory available.

All in all, we’re seeing some great opportunities in our market. For buyers, there’s more inventory to choose from. For sellers, the market leans in your favor, meaning that you’re in a good position to get your home sold quickly and for a great price. To get the results you want, you just need to put the right marketing plan behind your listing.
