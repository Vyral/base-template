If you’re looking for ways to cut your monthly expenses, here are a couple of quick tips that will help:

**1\. Look at your home and auto insurance.** About a month ago, my company started a joint venture with HUB International, the largest private insurance company in North America. I had them quote my home and auto insurance, and now they’re saving me about $1,000 per year. You can do the exact same thing, so just give me a call and I’ll refer you to our insurance representative.

**2\. Look at your mortgage.** The Federal Reserve recently cut interest rates, and while this only distantly affects mortgage rates, they’re still low as well—as low as 3% or 4%. I refinanced my mortgage recently and now save a couple hundred dollars per month. Again, if this is something you're interested in, give me a call and I’d be happy to get you in touch with a certified professional.&nbsp;

Now, what’s the latest news from our market? I’ll say this: The world is not coming to an end. The real estate market is holding steady. New listings are coming onto the market and new sales are happening every day. A lot of people are watching the stock market and thinking the real estate market is following the same trajectory, but it’s not.&nbsp;

The bottom line is, **there’s no need to panic.** In fact, now’s a great opportunity to enter the real estate market. A lot of investors whose cash and equity are taking a hit are needing to liquidate some of their assets, so now’s the time to shop for investment properties.&nbsp;

Barring an executive order for everyone to stay inside, we’re still showing and putting homes on the market. Of course, we’re taking every precaution to make sure everyone stays safe and healthy.&nbsp;

In any case, I encourage you to take this time to take care of yourself and your family. We’ll get through this together.&nbsp;
