Even if you’re thinking of selling your home a year or more from now, there are still certain things you’ll want to consider before solidifying your decision to do so. Here’s a checklist to go through to make sure you’re ready for the market:

* **Add a fresh coat of paint.** Repainting your home with trending colors is a good way to boost its appeal to buyers. We can recommend professional painters whose services are priced right and are of high-quality.

* **Make some repairs.** If you’ve lived in your home for five years or more, it’s probably a good idea for you to have an inspection done so that you know what repairs to make.
* **Work on the landscaping/curb appeal.** Don’t make the exterior of your home overwhelming, but you do want to give it a fresh, vibrant appeal to potential buyers. If you’re not handy with this sort of work, we can definitely recommend some quality professionals to you.

If you’d like our recommendations for vendors to help you accomplish these tasks, or if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out. We’d be glad to help you get your home sold quickly.
