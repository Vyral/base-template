<p style="text-align: center;"><em>My daughter is back to talk about what she wants in a future home.</em></p>

Back by popular request, I’m joined once again by my rockstar real estate assistant (and daughter) Ali Anne Ramey, who is here to speak on behalf of all the children out there and tell us the three top things that kids are looking for in a house:

**1\. A big pool.** She’s trying to convince us to buy a house with a pool, so that one was an easy choice.

**2\. Bunk beds.** I actually showed a house over the weekend to a family with two little girls that had built-in bunk beds and they went crazy for them.

**3\. TV.** A lot of sellers are leaving mounted TVs in their rooms and Ali would like that written into her contract.

If you are looking for a new home for you and your family, we would love to help. Give us a call or send us an email today and let’s get the process started.
