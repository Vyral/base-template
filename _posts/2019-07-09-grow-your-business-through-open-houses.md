For most of us, the rapid expansion of technology has worked wonders in our real estate businesses. Our team should know—there’s probably no one in our market who uses technology at a higher level than we at Damon Gettier & Associates do.

Even still, **there’s something to be said about the old way of doing business.** Real estate always has been—and hopefully always will be—a face-to-face business. As an agent, your goal should be to meet eight, 12, or maybe 15 potential clients each month and convert three or four of those leads.

To that end, **it’s important to put somewhat of an emphasis on your open houses.** We teach our agents that open houses take more proactivity than putting a sign in the yard, baking cookies, and waiting for buyers to arrive.

**Our agents spread the word three days in advance of the open house date by door-knocking in that particular neighborhood with fliers in-hand.** We go to the doorstep of the five neighbors to the left of the home and to the right of the home as well as 10 more across the street.&nbsp;

**Knocking on 20 doors prior to the open house is a surefire way to meet more people, sell more homes, and see your real estate career blossom.**&nbsp;
