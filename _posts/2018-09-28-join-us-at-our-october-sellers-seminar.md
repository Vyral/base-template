The process of selling your home and navigating today’s changing real estate market can be challenging, so if you’re thinking of selling your home or investment property now or in the future, we have an upcoming home seller seminar that’s just for you.

We’ll also share the steps you need to take to sell your home for the most money and talk about you and your agent’s role in making the sale happen. Additionally, we’ll discuss the current market, share our marketing strategies, and show you how to outshine the competition and make your home look its best before listing it.

Seal Beach Winery is located at 3387 West Cerritos Avenue, Los Alamitos, California. We look forward to seeing you there!
