There are four surprising things that may increase the value of your home:

1. **The color blue.** Studies show that if you paint your kitchen and bathrooms blue (usually a light blue), then you’ll get more for your home.
2. **Trendy features.** Things like barn doors, farmhouse sinks, and other trendy home items can increase the value of your listing. Be sure to include these features in the listing description.<br>{% include pullquote.html %}
3. **Mature trees.** Studies show that having mature trees (in your front yard especially) will boost your home’s value. If you’re thinking of cutting them down, you may want to reconsider.
4. **Being near a professional sports stadium.** We happen to have one coming into Nashville, so if you’re in about a two-and-a-half mile radius of that, then your home’s value will go up.
