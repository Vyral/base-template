{{ include youtube.html }}<br>Did you know that the number of days on market can affect you? Whether you are a buyer or a seller, homes are moving quickly in our market, which can affect your plans greatly.<br> <br>As a seller, you need to be prepared to move quickly. Most of our inventory below $300,000 in the Tucson area is going under contract in the first 15 to 30 days. Since this is happening so quickly, you need to be prepared to move out of your home just as quickly.<br> {% include pullquote.html %}<br>As a buyer, the same thing applies. Once you find a home you like, you need to move quickly on the property if it is a good fit for you. This is because the home will probably not be around very long.<br> <br>Like I mentioned before, the $300,000 price range is moving quickly, and we are seeing multiple offer situations occur. Sellers are receiving three to five offers in the same weekend on their property.<br> <br>To win the home you desire, you have to come in strong and be prepared to write an offer as soon as you find a house that is a good fit for you.<br> <br>If you have any questions or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
