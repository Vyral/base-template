<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The year is nearly over, but the St. Cloud market remains strong. We’re still seeing quite a few sales for this time of year.</em></p>

As we head toward the end of the year, things are going really well in the St. Cloud real estate market. Interest rates are near record lows, sales are strong, and inventory is steady.

We currently have about 725 homes on the market with 265 sales pending. Those are very good numbers for this time of year. It’s still time to buy a home for the holidays, and it’s a great time to start getting your home ready for sale because the spring market starts on January 2.

If you have any other real estate questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.
