If you’re looking for an accurate valuation of your home, you shouldn’t rely on one of Zillow’s Zestimates.

**Zestimates are based on a fixed algorithm that only takes into account public information about homes.** They don’t account for any interior upgrades or renovations you may have made. If your home is in a cookie cutter neighborhood, its Zestimate may be pretty accurate. Here in Memphis, though, we don’t have many neighborhoods like that.

If you scroll down to the bottom of Zillow’s website, you can even see their accuracy rating, which usually isn’t very good. A Zestimate can also change daily and be anywhere from 5% to 15% off.

**If you want a truly accurate valuation of your home, reach out to an experienced real estate professional** so they can take a look at it for themselves and give you an exact number.
