June is here, and the summer selling season is in full swing.<br>&nbsp;<br>I just want to give you a quick reminder that if you want to sell your home or be in a new home before school starts this fall, now is the time to start preparing. **It can take 60 to 90 days to sell your home.** That time frame includes preparation, showings, negotiations, escrow, and closing.

{% include pullquote.html %}<br>&nbsp;You also want to allow yourself enough time to get settled in the new home which you find. Since we are currently in June, that means that **now is about the latest time we want to start working on the process of getting you into a new home** before the new school year begins.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you are thinking about selling or moving to another home this summer, please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I would be happy to get the process started for you right away.
