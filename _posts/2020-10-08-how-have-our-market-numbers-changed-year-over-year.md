<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Let’s compare the market conditions from August 2020 to those of August 2019.</em></p>

Both last August and this August, we witnessed relentless buyer demand. Let’s take a look at how those numbers compare:

So far, buyers have signed 19.7% more purchase agreements in August 2020 than they did the previous year. **That’s evidence of strong buyer activity in our market.**

Meanwhile, the inventory levels in our market have dropped by 32.4% year over year. With the increase in buyer demand and the reduction in inventory, we're seeing home prices rise due to more and more multiple-offer situations on the available homes.

Another interesting fact is that the median sales price rose by 9.8% year over year. Currently, the median price is $315,000, **which is the highest it’s been in many years.**

Single-family home sales are up by 23%. Townhome sales rose by 14.8%, and even condominium sales went up by 1.4%. There have also been a lot of new construction homes going up in the area, and those sales rose by 46% between August 2019 and August 2020.

We’re also seeing buyers make quite a few concessions when writing offers due to the fact that many homes are generating bidding wars—we’ve seen homes with as many as 12 or 15 offers on them\! **We normally see a bit of a slowdown at this time of year as school begins, but we didn’t get that in 2020.** Market activity continued throughout August and September.

If you have any other questions about the market as we head deeper into the fall season or if you’re preparing for a home sale in 2021, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.
