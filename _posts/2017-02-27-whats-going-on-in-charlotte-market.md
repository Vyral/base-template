The Charlotte market is on fire right now! I’ll go over what’s making our real estate market so hot today.  

The Charlotte real estate market is on fire right now, so I wanted to give you a rundown on what’s happening.

Many people thought home prices would come down as interest rates increased, but that hasn’t been the case so far. However, **price per square foot is expected to decrease as interest rates continue to rise in 2017. **

So, if you’re thinking about selling your home or investment property this year, now is the time. In fact, some people are saying that this year will be the best year ever to sell an investment property.

If you’re looking to make a move, whether you are downsizing or upgrading to a larger home, right now is the best time to take advantage of a low interest rate and secure the most profit from your current home sale.

All in all, right now is a great time to buy or sell real estate. Also, if you have been thinking about buying new construction, I know **a lot of builders have been accepting contingency offers, so make sure you keep that in mind. **

If you have any further questions or want to discuss how you can take advantage of Charlotte’s hot market, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
