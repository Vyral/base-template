David Rudd, leader and owner of Kindred Real Estate Group, has been with Keller Williams since April of 2014. He has 15 members on his team, which is the largest team in the No.1 market center in Southern California. Not counting his referrals, he and his team brought in $68 million last year, and he’s on track to do much more than that in 2019. 

David is a loved and cared-for member of the KW family, and a while ago, he had a unique experience that I’d like to share with you today after we discuss his journey to becoming one of KW’s top agents.
