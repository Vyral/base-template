David Rudd, leader and owner of Kindred Real Estate Group, has been with Keller Williams since April of 2014. He has 15 members on his team, which is the largest team in the No.1 market center in Southern California. **Not counting his referrals, he and his team brought in $68 million last year, and he’s on track to do much more than that in 2019.&nbsp;**

<br>Back in 2014, after a Keller Williams agent had reached out to David, inviting him to come meet with the team leader at the time, David was impressed with the value that KW offered—He ended up sealing the deal not just because of the systems they had in place, but also because of the company’s enthusiasm and the culture of the team.

Three years later, a new real estate company that seemed to focus on tech growth came into town. Many in the industry will recognize the name eXp, which began reaching out to KW’s agents en masse. David was intrigued to hear more about what they had to offer, but when he realized that their focus was on revenue sharing to the point where they boasted he won’t even have to sell real estate, he was turned off. **The fundamentals of any company that you associate with should be 100% focused on building your business,** and his core business was selling real estate.

That said, he did meet with the then-CEO of eXp. They were really focused on the technological side of the industry, telling him that they were set to be the new foundation that real estate would be built on moving forward. To entice people to join, they offered the inclusion of the CRM Commissions, Inc., which would reduce costs by about $25,000 per year. Others jumped ship to eXp because they thought the commission splits would be beneficial to them.

David always looks at the core fundamentals of a business. To him, it’s important to work for an entity that will help generate business not just for himself, but for all the people in the company. Along with a number of other agents, he ended up making the switch to eXp.

**However, about 10 months after moving to eXp, David came back to Keller Williams. But why?**

David abides by the philosophy “Slow to hire, quick to fire”: When you find that a company isn’t a fit, you need to make changes that fundamentally benefit your business. One of the main things that turned him off of eXp was that the technology they boasted wasn’t actually their. He and the other agents who had made the switch learned within the first few weeks that Google Suite would be removed—they were actually starting to cut back on technology.

In addition, eight weeks later when they were going to switch over to eXp’s CRM to get their “discount,” he learned that it was actually a watered-down version that wouldn’t be productive for his work.

The third factor in him leaving eXp to come back to KW was the system used to interact with other employees, called The World. The system eats up a significant amount of battery life, but you also have to constantly be connected to the internet and there was no app available to consult if you had an immediate question.&nbsp;

For a company that was as focused on efficiency and systems, they were also lacking in the email department; a question sent by email would maybe get a response three to five days later. To him, it was like going up to meat counter to pull a ticket number just to wait in line for his turn to have an issue addressed. David’s team was larger and so received preferential treatment, but he can’t fathom what it must have been like for smaller teams or individual agents who weren’t getting priority service.

I’m thankful to David for taking the time to speak with me about his journey to Keller Williams, and we are certainly glad to have him back in the family. I look forward to speaking with him more in the future.

If you have any questions about the real estate industry or about joining Keller Williams yourself, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to talk to you.<br>&nbsp;
