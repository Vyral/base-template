Today, we're going to talk about something super important in the mortgage business: the top five ways to derail your loan approval. Here are some common home loan pitfalls you need to watch out for:

**1\. Don't take on any new debt.** Any new debt will affect your debt-to-income ratio and can upset your loan approval.

**2\. Don't buy or lease a new car.** Changes to your debt-to-income ratio can happen and again upset your approval.

**3\. Don't let anybody pull your credit.** Every time somebody pulls your credit. It could cost you 3 to 10 points. So don't let that happen.

**4\. Don't change or quit your job during the loan approval.** I know that sounds funny, but believe it or not, sometimes people do that and don't think it would have any effect.

**5\. Don't buy new furniture or appliances for the house,** even if the interest rate is zero for the first 18 months. The reason for that is we will have to count 5% per month of whatever debt that you took on during that process.

The things that I've gone over can have a significant effect on your final loan approval. The other thing many people don't realize is that either the day of or the day before closing, we have to go in and take another soft pull on your credit to see if any new debt has been taken on. The truth is going to come to the surface immediately when we see that, and, at the very least, your file will have to go back through underwriting again, so we're going to have delays.

The worst that could happen is if you have taken on new debt that could permanently upset your loan approval. You could lose your earnest money. You'll lose the money you paid for your inspection and your appraisal and all kinds of things like that. All you have to do is just hold off on any new debt that you're going to take on. Do it after you buy the home.
