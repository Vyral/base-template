Today, I want to discuss the unexpected costs that can leave sellers surprised.

A lot of agents out there are just taking listings without **giving the seller the information they need** to determine how much money they’re going to walk away with. Sellers may begin to wonder if it really beneficial to sell their home at this time.

**One of the first things you should always discuss is the agent’s commission.** The seller pays both the listing commission and the buying commission, which people sometimes forget. Your combined commissions pay for both agents.

You’re also going to have closing costs. It’s common for people in our area to split the escrow fees with the buyer.

You will be responsible for all of the title insurance policy, and you may also be asked by the buyer to pay for the home warranty.

It is possible that there will also be fees associated any inspection repairs if the buyer so requests.

**Then you’ll have to factor in your moving costs**—as well as buying packaging, you may need to place some of your stuff in storage for awhile, rent a truck. During the move, consider that you’ll likely have to take time off work, which is a loss of income.

**The one thing we don’t want you to do is to end up with two mortgages.** It’s very important that we sit down and plan that out accordingly, so you can not only sell your house, but you can buy your house and only have one mortgage at one time.

If you know somebody for whom this information might be helpful, please pass it on to them, or give their information to me. I’d be happy to call them and discuss it as well. See you next time!
