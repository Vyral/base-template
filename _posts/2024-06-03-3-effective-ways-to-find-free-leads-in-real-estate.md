What are three ways to find leads for free when you're new to real estate? When I started in real estate, I had just moved to a new area and didn't know anybody. On top of that, I quit my full-time job and went all-in on real estate, so I didn't have a lot of extra money to spend on leads. Here are three resources that will help you find leads for free if you're new or don’t have a lot of extra money to spend:

**The first way to find free leads is through open houses.** If you don’t have a listing, don’t worry. Someone in your brokerage, market center, or team should be able to help you with one. Open houses offer a prime opportunity to gather leads. I recommend spending some time in the neighborhood beforehand, getting to know the neighbors, and inviting them to tour the home and bring along anyone who might want to become their neighbor. This way, you can build rapport and establish connections that could lead to future business.

**The second free resource for finding leads is through community groups.** You can engage with these groups on social media or in person. Examples of community groups include the Chamber of Commerce or professional referral exchanges. You can also join groups that align with your personal interests, such as book clubs, sports leagues, or parenting groups like MOPS (Mothers of Preschoolers). These settings provide a relaxed environment where you can meet potential clients and build relationships.

**The third way to find leads is through door knocking.** This approach involves directly engaging with residents in neighborhoods, offering valuable information such as home value estimates and details about local events. By being a resource, you can also recommend local contractors or insurance agents, thereby positioning yourself as a helpful community member. Door knocking allows you to make a personal connection and leave a lasting impression, which can lead to future business opportunities.
