The prevailing sentiment among most people is that spring is the best time to put your home on the market. So it may come as a shock to you that, from our findings, the best time to list and capture top dollar on the sale of your home is actually mid- to-late January.

For what reasons will both buyers and sellers get the most out of the winter market—specifically January? 

Buyers know it’s only a matter of time before they enter the market because the decision to buy is an inevitability. **So they’re actively trying to develop a grasp of the market and get a feel for what’s on the market now. **

Sellers who list in January will have an edge over others because most are waiting out the winter to list in the spring. The buyers described above will be hungry to buy and will be serious about purchasing at that time. 

Though our market is relatively stable and consistent year-round, we’ve seen evidence that the peak occurs in January. **So if you’re a seller that planned on putting your home on the market sometime in, say, March, you may want to re-evaluate.** That way, you can capture January’s buyer traffic and outcompete spring sellers.   

Thank you for all your support this past year. Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, Happy New Year, and we very much look forward to talking to you again in 2019! <br>
