  Hurricane season is upon us once again. Up until a few years ago, it wasn’t
  much of a worry for homeowners or homebuyers in our area. After the last few
  years, however, things have changed. If you’re a homebuyer or homeowner who is
  looking to get a flood insurance policy in time for hurricane season, there
  could be a significant delay in your coverage. To learn more about what you’ll
  need to do if you’re a homebuyer or a homeowner, watch this short video.

Up until two years ago, we were fortunate enough to not have to worry much about hurricanes. However, multiple storms have come through the Savannah area since and **it’s beginning to become more of a worry for homeowners and homebuyers alike.** I want to make note of a few things I've noticed over the years.

**One thing you should be aware of is your flood insurance policy.** Typically, when you initiate a flood insurance policy, **there is often a waiting period of around 30 days** until the policy goes into effect. Keep that in mind if you’re currently in the middle of a real estate transaction.

Another thing to keep in mind if you’re currently in the process of buying a home and there is a named storm in the area: Most insurance companies have limitations in their ability to write new policies. **That can oftentimes delay closings or put a hold on home purchases altogether.**

Even if the storm misses us, the best case scenario is that your closing will be delayed.

**If you find yourself in a real estate transaction during this hurricane season, you should definitely have a conversation with your real estate agent and your insurance agent.** If you already own a home and are looking to get flood insurance now, get a hold of your insurance agent as well.

I hope this information was valuable to you. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
