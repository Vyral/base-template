As summer ends and we begin fall in earnest, we’ve got an end-of-summer market update to share that will tell you all you need to know about the San Diego real estate market. **Here are the numbers that stood out to us:**

* The average sale price is $775,000 for single-family detached homes, up 9% from this time last year.
* The median sale price for single-family detached homes is $610,000, an 8% increase from August 2016.
* The average days on market are down 9% from last year. {% include pullquote.html %}
* The average sale price for condos and townhomes is up 7% from last year and 5% from last month.
* The median sale price for a condo or townhome is $400,000, a 6% increase from last year.

**Since last year, homes have significantly increased in price while selling twice as fast.** As you can see, the San Diego market is still very hot. If you have any questions for us about it or you’re looking to buy or sell a home yourself, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
