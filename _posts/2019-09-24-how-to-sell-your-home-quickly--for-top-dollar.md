<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Need to sell fast? Today I’ll share my best tips for selling your home quickly and for top dollar.</em></p>

If you’re in the market to sell a property quickly, here’s what you can do to get it done fast:

**1\. Set your sales price at or a little below market value.** The moment you position your listing below market value, a tremendous number of buyers will quickly show interest. Buyers know a good property when they see one, and because of all the information available online today, they understand what constitutes a fair price for a home. So if your home is in good condition on top of being priced lower than other comparable homes, people will go above and beyond to make sure they get your home.

**2\. Stage your property.** At the Hayer Group, 100% of our listings are staged. Why? Statistically, it takes 90% less time to sell a property that has been staged. Buyers tend to spend a lot less time inside homes that haven’t been staged, since it can feel like the home isn’t quite ready to be on the market.

**3\. Take high-quality photographs.** Full-time real estate professionals may be great at their jobs, but they might not be the best at taking pictures. Teams like ours hire professional photographers who know best how to capture the essence of your home so that buyers can envision themselves living there even just by looking at a photo.

**4\. Offer incentives.** &nbsp;I’m not talking about giving away tens of thousands of dollars or changing the price of your home online. Instead, give the buyer a closing cost credit. If you merely change the price of your home online as an incentive to a buyer (say, a $2,000 reduction), that will only change their monthly payment a little. However, if you give them a closing cost credit of $2,000, they’ll actually save that money and be able to use it to buy furniture or appliances.

**5\. Be flexible with showings.** Once your home hits the market, the first two or three weeks are the most important times to be flexible. Why? Depending on your area, there is an average length of time that it takes for a home to sell, and if yours is on the market for longer than that because you’ve been restrictive about when you allow showings, you might have missed out on a prime opportunity. Even if you have to work a little harder to accommodate showings, please do so—buyers who come in within the first two or three weeks are the most serious.
