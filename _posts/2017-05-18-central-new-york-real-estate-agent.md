Saving Face Barbershop is a versatile and high-end barber shop that I highly recommend.

If you’re in need of a quality shave or haircut, I have the perfect place to introduce you to.

That place is **Saving Face Barbershop,** where I’m live on location speaking with barber and co-owner Taylor Horseman. Located at 127 East Seneca St., Saving Face has been in business at this new location for about four months. They also have another location in Camillus that’s been open for seven years.

According to Taylor, what makes **their establishment different is that their employees have been at their jobs for a long time and have a passion for what they do.** Cutting hair is more of an art than a job to them. With the communal atmosphere they present, they intend Saving Face to be a place where men can hang out and build friendships in addition to getting a haircut.

While you wait for a haircut, you can watch TV, play shuffleboard, or pour yourself a nice cup of coffee. They like to be versatile and able to accommodate any customer, so they perform many different types of cuts, including straight-razor shaves and full facial treatments.


To learn more about Saving Face Barbershop or to schedule an appointment, you can visit them online at <a href="http://www.savingfacebarbershop.com/" target="_blank">www.savingfacebarbershop.com</a> or email them at <a href="mailto:savingfacemanlius@gmail.com">savingfacemanlius@gmail.com</a>.

I highly recommend that you visit this location in the near future. It’s great for Manlius, and I look forward to featuring more local businesses in the near future. If you have any other questions, give me a call. I look forward to talking to you soon!
