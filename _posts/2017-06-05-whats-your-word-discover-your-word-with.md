Lisa discussed how she met Chris Pan and discovered MyIntent.org and the power of Treu Group Real Estate's Word. The 2017 Word is Commitment. It is a constant reminder that they will Say What needs to be said, Do whatever needs to be done and Go where they need to go to help them accomplish their clients and team goals. Chris Pan, the founder of myintent.org, shares that bracelet product that is more than just a fashion piece. Chris talked about the bracelet not as jewelry but as a reminder of oneâ€™s idea of what he/she wants more from life, what challenges he/she wants to overcome, or what is something he/she is really passionate about in life.

Chris was kind enough to offer a 20% discount code which you get by listening to the show. These are great gifts or can be used for your personal or corporate Word.
