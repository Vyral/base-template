You may remember the fixer-upper home we showed you just a few months back. Well, today, we’re back to show you an updated look at this property. **[Click here](https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=AmHRGsaxxWp&amp;brand=0)** to take a 3-D tour of the house.

We ran into a few unexpected hurdles along the way while fixing up this home, but a few months and $135,000 in renovation costs later, the property is virtually unrecognizable. 

**We did end up exceeding our original budget, but that’s simply the reality of home flipping.** Sometimes you’ve got to spend more than you expected to get the results you want. You never know what issues might pop up as you begin work on fixing up the home.

For this house, the big-ticket item we had to fix was the roof. We thought it was in good shape, but it turns out we were wrong. We also had to reinforce some structural features of the home. 

After being completely renovated, this 4-bed, 3-bath home, which is about 2,300 square feet,  was put back on the market for $259,000 and is set to close in the next couple of weeks. We’re very proud of the job we’ve done, even if we made less money than anticipated. 

Something everyone who’s interested in this business should realize is that this will sometimes be the case. **You will sometimes net a lower profit than expected. **

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are interested in learning more about flipping, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.
