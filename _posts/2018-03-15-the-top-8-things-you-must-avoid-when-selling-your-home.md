Here are the eight worst things you can let happen to your house when you’re trying to sell it:

**1. Tangled chords.**We get it—tangled chords happen in a lot of places around the house, but you want to hide them as much as possible or organize them to look clean and tidy.

**2. Busy decor.** It’s fun to be expressive with your decorating, unless you’re trying to sell your home. People want to walk into your home and see a more neutral space (or blank canvas, if you will), so put away your prints and wallpapers and keep things low key.

**3. Open shelving.** You want to try to utilize open shelving as a decoration and put your finest China on display. Don’t use it for actual storage.

**4. Unmade beds.** It’s especially important during home showings to make your bed. That could go a long way in making your house look fresh and clean.

**5. A messy entryway.** When people walk into your house, you want to make a good first impression on them, so don’t have shoes strewn everywhere or keys hanging on the walls around your entryway. Keep that space clean and open.

**6. Leaving laundry out.**Even if it’s clean and folded, any laundry that’s left out can make the home look a little too “lived-in.” Remember, you want people to imagine themselves in your home, and if they see your laundry on the counter, that can diminish the effect.

**7. Cluttered countertops.** Again, you want people to envision themselves in your home, so clear off your countertops and open up space for them to do so.

**8. Dirty floors.** Try to tidy up your home’s floors before every showing. That will make your home look very appealing, attractive, and sellable.
