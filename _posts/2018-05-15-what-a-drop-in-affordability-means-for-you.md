Some potentially worrying news came in this month. **Home affordability is shrinking rapidly**, according to the research done by Arch Mortgage Insurance.

In the first quarter, **affordability dropped by 5%**. This is mainly because of the increase in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the property values as well.

As a result, more people are stretched thin and taking on greater debt than in the past.

And that’s not all. Affordability is expected to drop another 15% to 20% by the end of the year.

That’s because home prices continue to rise, and the Federal Reserve is expected to ratchet up its reference interest rate, which often leads mortgage interest rates, three to four times this year.

What does this mean for you?

Well, if you're looking to sell, **you won't have a hard time finding a buyer**. Even with decreasing affordability, demand for homes still outstrips supply.

However, it's certain that buyers will look to take advantage of current conditions before affordability drops any further.

That means that this spring and summer might see an additional rush in the real estate market. It also means that **now might be a very good time to list your home** if you've been thinking about selling for a while.

On the other hand, if you are thinking about buying a home, you might think this news spells doom for you.

However, there's no need to panic.

While affordability is dropping, it is still well above historical averages (just like current mortgage rates). In fact, Arch Mortgage Insurance estimates that **homes are now 15% to 20% more affordable than they were from 1987 to 2004.**

At the same time, it's certainly true that mortgage rates are going up, and this will affect what your monthly payment will be on a new home. From this perspective, **it makes sense to move now in case you've been looking to buy before rates rise further.**

So what's the next step?

If you are thinking of selling, we would be happy to meet with you and share if it makes sense for you to move. Or, if you are looking to buy, let’s sit down and have a conversation about your buying needs. &nbsp;I look forward to speaking with you soon.
