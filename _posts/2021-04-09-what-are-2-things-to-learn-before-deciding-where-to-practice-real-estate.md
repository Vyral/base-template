When you’re a new or newer agent, there are a lot of considerations to make before deciding where to practice real estate. There are questions of commission splits, fees, and more to consider. In my experience, there are two things that provide fulfillment in the professional environment. The first is the work environment itself, and the second is how you're compensated.

Naturally, the two things that are most helpful to do before hanging your hat at a brokerage are these:

**1\. Ask the broker if you can talk to a few of the agents offline.** Be transparent, ask them everything that is on your mind, and hopefully the broker will be open to that.

**2\. Learn what the average net take-home pay is among the agents in the office.** We could talk about commission splits all day, but none of it matters if the agents aren’t taking home enough money to support their families. This is the thing that can cut through all of this confusion. It should be documented in writing, like it is for our team.

If you want to learn from our agents about our culture and our average net take-home pay, **comment “learn more” below or private message me the same phrase.** If you have any other questions for me about the real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email at 717.216.0860 or&nbsp;[dave@davehooketeam.com](https://davehookecoaching.com/dave@davehooketeam.com). I look forward to hearing from you soon.
