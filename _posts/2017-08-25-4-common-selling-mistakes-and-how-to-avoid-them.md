During the process of selling your home, there are certain things you should absolutely avoid.
<br>Today, I’d like to share four major seller mistakes that could negatively impact your home sale.&nbsp;

1. **Selling your home by yourself.** Doing this is a big risk. Certain data, such as the Multiple Listing Service’s sold information, isn’t available to you without the help of a professional. Additionally, when you sell your home without an agent, you are doing so without the kind of marketing leverage a professional can provide. Most homebuyers begin their search online. This means that you will need strong marketing to set your listing apart. Even if you do get your home sold, how can you be sure you did so for the highest price and with the best possible terms? Using an agent is always preferable.
2. **Pricing your home incorrectly.&nbsp;**It’s difficult to know exactly how to price your home. In order to do so correctly, you’ll need to strike a balance between what is too low and what is too high. A home with a high price will bring buyers with higher expectations. Your home should ideally be priced to what the average potential buyer will be willing to pay.

3. **Using poor photography.** With the majority of people turning to the internet when they begin looking at homes, the first impression your home will give off will be through photographs. Hiring a quality, professional photographer will be absolutely essential to ensuring that your home is put forward in the best possible light. Having attractive photos of your home will always help you attract more buyers.
4. **Ignoring your backyard.** While curb appeal tips tend to focus on the front of your home, you should never neglect the state of your backyard. Remember to remove weeds and trim your hedges. If you need or would like help with completing this, I have a great list of professional landscapers who I would be happy to recommend to you.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
