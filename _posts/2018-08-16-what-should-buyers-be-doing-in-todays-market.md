Today we’ve got three tips to share that will help out homebuyers in today's market:

**1. Make sure you’re set up for instant property alerts.** Not all websites are created equal because not all websites have direct access to the information on the MLS. It’s important for you to work with an agent that has the information from what we call an IDX feed. This will allow you to get instantaneous information about homes that are on the market.

**2. Hire a fast-acting agent.** You need an agent who is working in the business full-time and one who is tech-savvy. This will help you as you’re moving through today’s market to give you the best opportunity to find the right home.

**3. Be prepared to make an aggressive offer.** After you’ve looked at several homes and you’ve made a decision, go ahead and put your offer together. Take time to talk to your agent about how to make your offer stand out against the other offers that may be presented to the seller. A good agent who has had experience working with buyers in this market knows what it takes to make your offer look better than others.

We hope this information was helpful to you. Feel free to send it along to anyone else who you think it might help as well. In the meantime, if you have any questions for us or need any advice about buying a home, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
