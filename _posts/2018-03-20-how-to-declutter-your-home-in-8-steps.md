Welcome to the latest episode of “What’s Working Now!” In our last video, we talked about decluttering. What is it, why do it, and what’s holding you back.

Today, I’ll go over eight steps on how to actually declutter your home.

**1. Find your “why.”** Why do you want to declutter? Are you making more room for yourself or a family member? What is your “why”? Are you moving? That’s my favorite one.

**2. Decide to start.** Pick a date and give yourself a deadline.

**3. If you’re decluttering because you plan on selling**, call me at (240) 731-8079 or email me at marjorie@marjoriedickstuart.com.

**4. Get your supplies ready.** Get some boxes, trash bags, sticky notes, and colored dots. You should also look for helpers. You can do this yourself, or you can ask a friend or family member to help. You can even hire a professional organizer.

**5.Make your to-do list.** If you’re using an actual organizer, they can help you with this step. Get a pad and pencil and start making your list. Figure out how you are going to sort everything. What will you keep, throw away, or donate? How will you get rid of your trash? Do you need a dumpster? How will you donate items and which organization will you donate to?

You should also make a list of what items you will sell. You can use a yard sale, a neighborhood listserv, or call an auction house. If you’re getting ready to sell, your to-do list should include repairs. Do you need to fix the refrigerator, paint a bedroom, or change a countertop? Even if you’re not going to move, you may notice cracks on the walls behind bookcases or beds. Make a list of those items that need to be repaired and things that need to be cleaned.

If you’re going to sell your property, you also need to make a list of upgrades. Do you need to replace the carpet? Do you need to paint or do some landscaping? Get your list together before you start step six.

**6. Begin sorting.** Some people say that you need to go room by room and organize each room. The problem with that is you’ll go into the first room, find something you can’t part with, and get stuck. I suggest going by category. Organize your dishes, then your clothes, then your books. Start with a few easy decisions to get the ball rolling.

**7. Use your sticky notes.&nbsp;**You’ve made a few easy decisions on things you want to get rid of. Put a sticky dot or label on these items so you know which ones you want to throw away, sell, or donate. Use a different colored sticky note for items you want to keep.

**8. You’re ready to advertise and get rid of all that stuff.**&nbsp;Check out resources like neighborhood lists for estate sales, movers, and decorators. If you live in my neck of the woods, you can call me and I’ll put you in touch with my resources. If you don’t live near me, call another real estate agent in your area—they should be able to help.
