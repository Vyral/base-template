Over the last few weeks, we’ve seen a steady increase in interest rates. It’s been one of the key notes that keeps coming up with clients at open houses, listing appointments, or showings, so I wanted to talk about it a little bit today.

For the first time since last summer, the average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage is above 4%. One of Freddie Mac’s chief economists, Leonard Kiefer, says that he believes **we have seen the end of sub-4% interest rates.**

Mortgage applications have increased by 4.1%, although a key aspect of that is people refinancing their homes. We are also seeing 10% fewer homes on the market nationally. Here in Hoboken, we’ve seen a 3.92% decrease in active inventory compared to this time last year according to the Hudson County MLS.

**Rising interest rates might reduce inventory further**, as sellers will lose some incentive to sell their home and purchase a new one. With that said, there are still a bunch of great homes hitting the market, and we still have less than a three-month supply of inventory, which is great for sellers.

If you have any other questions about rising interest rates or buying or selling a home, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
