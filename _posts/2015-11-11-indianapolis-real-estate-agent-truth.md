Are you considering selling your home soon? Many people get nervous selling their home around the holidays and during winter, so I want to share what I know about the market at this time.
Recently, I ran some data to see how the winter market compares to the spring market. Last spring, we sold about 12,000 from March 1 to the end of June; last winter, from Nov 1 to February, there 8,900 homes sold. While fewer homes sell in the colder months here in Indianapolis, it's clear that A LOT of homes still sell during that time.

The holidays can be a bit more difficult to sell because of time constraints, family events, and decorations, but there are ways to work around these things. The great thing about selling in the winter is there are more serious buyers in the marketplace. Buyers just don't go out looking in the cold unless they are looking to move soon!
If you have any questions about selling in the winter months, or if you would like real estate assistance of any kind, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to hear from you!
