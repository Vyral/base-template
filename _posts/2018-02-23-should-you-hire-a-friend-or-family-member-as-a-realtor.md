If you’re considering hiring a friend or family member to help you buy or sell a home, there are a few things you should know first. Here are five points to consider:

**1. They may not know the area well.** If you’re interested in purchasing a property here in Hays County, Aunt Josie in Pflugerville might not have any idea of what’s going on in this specific housing market. The school districts play a big part in property values and the numbers are constantly changing.

**2. Can you handle disagreements on key points?&nbsp;**A friend or family member won’t want to hurt your feelings and might let you decide on the commission or sale price. That might not be the best move. An expert will be blunt and tell you what you need to hear, rather than what you want to hear. By sugarcoating things and not giving you the truth, a family member or friend is doing more harm than good to your real estate transaction.

**3. They may insult your home decor.** Our team uses a professional home stager to insult your home decor instead. Their job isn’t to insult your tastes, of course. Their job is to make the home look as appealing as possible to the largest possible audience of buyers.

**4. It’s awkward if you don’t sell quickly.**

**5. Even friends and family members deserve to get paid.** Maybe you're considering hiring a friend or family member because they will give you a discount or you feel like you owe it to them. If you’re a bit hesitant, I have the perfect solution. If you hire our team, I’ll pay a referral fee to that family member or friend that you’re considering hiring. They will still get paid and won’t have to do any of the work. You can leave that to us.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me or want to make the best of both worlds in your next real estate transaction, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
