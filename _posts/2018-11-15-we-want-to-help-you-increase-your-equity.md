Home equity is essential if you want to retire comfortably. Here’s how we can help with that.

Today I want to introduce you to a new tool that can help you build wealth. **Did you know that 83% of all wealth at retirement comes from home equity?** That really surprised me. I thought IRAs, stocks, or other investments would be the biggest contributors.

This is why I wanted to see how I can help those who I care about, including our past, present, and future clients, grow your equity. **You deserve more money at retirement, and we have come up with a great tool to help you get it.**

This isn’t your typical Zestimate. Who needs that, anyway? What we’re offering is a report from Homebot that covers what your home is worth, how you can increase your home’s equity, and much more. It will answer many different questions such as, “When should I refinance?” and “What should I do with my equity?”

To get this free tool, all you have to do is click [this link](https://get.homebot.ai/?agentId=5be2fa40c65e07009bfc4945){: target="_blank"} and enter your information. We’ll make sure that you’re set up with a comprehensive report to help you along your journey.

**If you’re a prospective homebuyer, we can help you too.** We can offer you a direct MLS feed, which gives you real information in real time. Even if you’re not sure of when you want to buy or what makes sense for you to buy, we’ve got the knowledge and resources to assist you.
