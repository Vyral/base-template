I’ve got a quick market update to share with you today regarding DFW real estate. To put it simply, we’re in a great market right now. Last year, we were the second-strongest market in the entire country. Since then, we’ve gotten even stronger.

Our home sales are up by 5% in the last year. Our average sale price is also up to $299,000 after being at $261,000 just a few years ago. Homes are also continuing to sell even quicker, with the average days on market currently sitting at 41. With a lack of available homes to purchase, buyers are having to compete over what’s available. That’s part of the reason we’re seeing all these increases.

Each market comes with its set of challenges and opportunities. From 2008 to 2012, meeting with sellers to discuss strategically pricing their homes was an everyday thing. We had to do something to compete against all of the short sales and foreclosures in the market.

We work on agent skills every morning so that our buyer’s agents are better equipped to win bidding wars and our listing agents can generate maximum offers and sale prices. Our goal is to get our buyers and sellers the best possible results, and that all starts with understanding exactly what your goals are.

If you have any questions for us or you’re looking to buy or sell a home in DFW, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
