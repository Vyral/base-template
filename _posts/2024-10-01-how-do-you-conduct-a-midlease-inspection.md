Are you consistently doing mid-lease inspections? If yes, are you doing them right? Usually, property inspections are made when there’s a complaint or referral. However, proactive mid-lease or mid-tenancy inspections are necessary for catching any potential maintenance issues. This minimizes repair costs and ensures the safety of your tenants. As landlords, it may be challenging to add another item to your to-do list, but it will save you a lot of time, money, and energy to conduct periodic inspections rather than deal with the consequences of a poorly maintained rental property. Here are three important things to do for a successful mid-lease property inspection:

**1\. Timing and notice.** Conduct your inspection at a reasonable time and day and in accordance with your local area’s regulations and lease agreement. Typically, halfway through the lease term is best. Inform your tenants in advance with a 24- to 48-hour notice so they can make an initial assessment of the things that concern them. Also, respect your tenant’s privacy and schedule by avoiding surprise inspections.

**2\. Inspection checklist and documentation.** Preparing a detailed list of items you need to check ensures that you’ll have a smoother and faster inspection. Some routine items you should inspect include noticeable signs of damage to the interior and exterior of the property, plumbing, and electrical hazards. Look for signs of pests and insect infestations. In addition to that, check if home safety features like smoke detectors and fire extinguishers are working. Make notes during the inspection and take photos to track wear and tear and potential issues in the future. If you're inspecting a tenured renter, go over any prior notes that you may have made about the property and renter.

**3\. Open communication.** Both the landlord and tenant should be present during the inspection. Be open and transparent with your tenant. Hear their concerns and respond accordingly. This is an opportunity to address any clarifications of your duties and establish an agreement on needed repairs or maintenance. After the inspection, give the tenant a copy of the completed checklist and any relevant findings.

If you’re a landlord, consider conducting a routine mid-lease inspection. When a property is not properly maintained, it’s almost too easy for minor issues to become problematic and costly. If you’re a tenant, be prepared for these inspections and use them as an opportunity to raise any concerns you may have about the property. A well-maintained property benefits both landlord and tenant, leading to better landlord-tenant relationships.
