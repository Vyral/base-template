Today, we’re here to talk about being a referral agent. If you’re a real estate agent and you want to become a referral agent with us, just call us, send us an email, or come into the office and we can work it out. Just know that **all of our referral agents get paid the first month's management fees.&nbsp;**

It’s important to note that we don’t do sales. When your client wants to sell their property, they can get referred, but know that we only do property management. If you are already one of our referral agents, thank you so much for working with us! If you want to become one, you can call (808) 445-9223 or send an email to [duke@hawaiipacific.com](mailto:duke@hawaiipacific.com). We look forward to hearing from you!
