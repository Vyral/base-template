<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s how you can attract multiple offers as a seller and avoid multiple-offer situations as a buyer.</em></p>

A multiple-offer situation is something sellers want but buyers want to avoid. Depending on your circumstances, there are a few tips you need to remember to either attract or avoid a multiple-offer situation.&nbsp;

How do you attract multiple offers for your home as a seller? Right now, there’s low inventory in the $300,000 to $500,000 price range, so your first task should be to **make your home stand out.** It takes thousands of dollars to market your property and make sure everyone knows about it.&nbsp;

When it comes to getting people inside your home, that requires an agent with a team behind them who are willing to reach out to buyers before your home even hits the market. During open houses and showings, the interior of your home should be cozy and well lit. If you can put some music on, do that as well. It also doesn’t hurt to have a TV or two going, and as far as family pictures go, having a couple hanging from the walls will actually make your house feel good.&nbsp;

The bottom line is, **you need to have your home marketed appropriately and priced correctly.** There’s a reason why our homes average between 25 and 28 days on market, whereas the city-wide average for Charlotte is between 75 and 80 days.&nbsp;

Now, if you’re a buyer and you want to avoid a multiple-offer situation, that requires one thing: **priority access to the MLS.** In other words, you need priority access to all the good deals, which means you need to network with other agents to know about homes before they come on the market. If you’re just scrolling Realtor.com and asking your agent to see various homes, those homes have probably already been on the market for several days.&nbsp;

If you don’t get priority access to better deals, you’ll miss out on the home you want and end up overpaying for another home.&nbsp;
