Did you put your home in forbearance during the pandemic? If so, you might be getting bombarded with calls from your bank. We’ve talked with a lot of homeowners who put their homes in forbearance, and a lot of them didn’t completely understand the terms of the agreement. If you’re in this position, what can you do?&nbsp;

We’ve talked to a few homeowners who need to refinance due to the terms of their forbearance. This is difficult since a lot of people had interest rates at 4% or even 3%. Now that they need to refinance to a rate close to 7%, they’re finding that they can no longer afford their monthly payment. Fortunately, you have options.

The truth is that **banks will use every trick in the book to benefit themselves, and they’re betting on you not knowing your options so they can take advantage of you**. One simple thing you can do is have an expert talk to the bank on your behalf about your situation. A knowledgeable agent can help put the banks in their place and potentially save you tons of money and allow you to keep your home.&nbsp;

If you’re facing this vulnerable situation, it can be tough to ask for help, but it’s worth it. Just a couple of weeks ago, we were speaking with clients in this situation and discovered that they had been approached by someone pretending to be a lender. This person claimed they could help our clients get out of their sticky situation, but in reality, they were just an investor looking to take advantage of vulnerable people. The worst part of all is that our clients’ bank referred this predator to them. Fortunately, we were able to figure out what was happening and help these people out and save their home, but it just goes to show that **you need an expert on your side**.&nbsp;

This is a difficult position for anyone to be in, and we know asking for help is tough, but you shouldn’t have to go through it alone. Call or email us if you or someone you know is having this trouble. We are always here to help.
