I’ve lived here in St. Charles for about 20 years, and it’s where I’ve happily raised my two sons. **I absolutely recommend everyone to move here**; it’s a wonderful community with a vibrant downtown. In fact, they’ve just done all kinds of renovations and are adding restaurants, office buildings, and both two- and three-story parking garages. There are great places for shopping and other awesome businesses to stop in. There’s something for everyone in downtown St. Charles.

The town runs right along the Fox River. A bike path runs along the river all the way to Batavia, and **the river is the site of various festivals throughout the year**, which include riverboats, steamboats, bands, and much, much more. We recently had our annual Thanksgiving Day Parade, where businesses, students from the high school, and all sorts of people come out to participate. It’s a fun event for everyone in the community.

Hotel Baker is a beautiful historic building built right along the Fox River. With more than 50 rooms, **it’s a great venue for hosting weddings and other elegant events.** Inside is Rox City Grill—a fabulous place for an upscale dining experience where you can get fish, steak, and a wide variety of other menu options. The menu is changed fairly frequently, so there will always be new and interesting dishes to try.

Did I mention the outstanding school districts? Park District is truly exceptional.

Additionally, I’m so proud to represent JRH properties, LLC, and the fine homes that they build. Recently, **they’ve built a beautiful, 150 homesite subdivision on the west side of St. Charles that you just have to see.** Each property is anywhere from a half-acre to an acre, and almost all of them are backed with some type of open space. Much of this greenspace is tree-lined and has bike paths, lakes, and ponds. It’s absolutely gorgeous.

Though they primarily build in St. Charles and Glen Ellyn, **they’ve also built a series of beautiful custom homes that are typically 5,000 square feet or more and fall into the million-dollar price range.** The work on these properties is absolutely exceptional; the features and craftsmanship is state-of-the-art.

I welcome everybody to come see the three spec homes we have available right now for occupancy. The kitchens will just knock your socks off if the rest of the houses don’t first.

If you have any questions about the properties available for purchase or about why St. Charles is such a fantastic place to make a home, please reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.<br>&nbsp;
