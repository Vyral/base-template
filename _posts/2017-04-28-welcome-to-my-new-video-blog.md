{% include youtube.html %}I have some exciting news to share with you today. I am going to start sharing my real estate expertise with you through this video blog.
<br>
<br>**Each month, I’ll be sending out two emails touching on different trends in the market.** I’ll also be covering changes in the lending and title world because all of these industries are intertwined. To take advantage of the real estate market, you need to know about all of them.

{% include pullquote.html %}

That being said, if you have any questions, topics you’re confused about, or anything else you want me to talk about, give me a call or send me an email and I’d be happy to make a video about. If you have a question, chances are that someone else has that question too and would benefit from the answer as well.
<br>
<br>**If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.**We look forward to hearing from you soon.
