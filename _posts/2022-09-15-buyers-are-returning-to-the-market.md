What's going on out there with buyers right now in this market? For the first part of the year, many buyers left the market because they were facing multiple offers and losing. They were disenchanted and on the sidelines. However, with rates changing slightly, **our market is changing and those buyers on the sidelines are coming back.** There are more opportunities right now. Properties are sitting out here that you can make offers on and actually win.

Back in January, we had about 1,800 properties in our MLS. Today we have about 2,400, and they are staying on the market slightly longer with some price adjustments. For the buyers out there that are still interested in buying, opportunities are out here so you should give us a call and weâ€™ll give you advice on how to navigate this market and secure your dream home.
