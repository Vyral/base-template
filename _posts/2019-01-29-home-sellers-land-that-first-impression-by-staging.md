When people hear the wording ‘staging,’ they often think of a complete remodel where we knock down some walls. That’s rarely the case. Here at Home Expert Advisors, we bring in Monica Lee, an expert home stager and photographer to advise us; she has the vision to tell you exactly what needs to be done.

If you have a job interview or a big date coming up, you probably wouldn’t wear your regular clothes, hair, and shoes—you’d shave, shower, and put on your best outfit. And that’s really the idea behind staging your home: You want to dress your home to impress so that it stands out from the competition.

When buyers shop for homes, it’s reasonable to assume they’re going to compare your home to the others in the area using whatever criteria they’ve decided is important, and if your home doesn’t shine, they might just move on to a different one without a second glance back. Adding in furniture, moving things around, changing the scents of the home, and similar projects can make a home truly pop to a prospective buyer.

Staging also helps buyers visualize themselves living in that space; if they can’t imagine how their furniture will fit in the home, they won’t form as strong of an attachment to the house. That’s why I strongly recommend that you take the time to go through every room with an expert and see how they would view it through the buyers’ eyes. This can be hard without professional help, as we often tend to become blind to our own spaces.

If you have any questions about home staging or need recommendations for professional stagers, reach out to us. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
