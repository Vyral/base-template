“It was great. They were very professional, they kept us informed through every bit of the process and the house sold quickly. I thought that they were very good at communicating with us during the process. Just keeping in touch, letting us know what’s going on, how it’s working out. I mean in three weeks we had an offer, so it wasn’t a long process but yet we didn’t close on the home until a month later because of the house we were holding off on buying that home. During that process they were making sure that everything was going smooth with the buyers and their process with regards to loan approval.”
