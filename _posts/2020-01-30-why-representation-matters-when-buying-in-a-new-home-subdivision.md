<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Is it important to be represented by an agent when buying in a new home subdivision? Yes, and here’s why.</em></p>

As a buyer, it’s very important to be represented by an agent when buying in a new home subdivision. To illustrate why, I’ll tell you about one of my team’s recent clients.&nbsp;

This client was a relocation buyer coming to our area and wanted a brand-new home in a brand-new subdivision. With our connections, we were able to find him a house in Sterling Grove, a subdivision in Surprise, Arizona that’s not even open to the public for (as of the recording of this video) another four weeks.&nbsp;

We spent about six hours on a Saturday looking at lots and floor plans in Sterling Grove. There were about 34 different floor plans and we went through every option, but only a handful met the client’s needs. It was a very trying day, but we came back the next day—the first day people were allowed to put earnest money down for lot holds. That Sunday, we spent another seven hours there. That makes 13 hours in total, not to mention everything else we did beforehand regarding the other properties we showed them.

We’ll have to go back one more time to finish the rest of the contract, and **over the next 10 months, we’ll continue our presence in this subdivision,** advocating for their interests throughout the home’s construction.&nbsp;

So if you’re thinking of buying a new house, give us a call and we’ll save you a lot of time, energy, and money. We can help you avoid the same problems most other buyers face.
