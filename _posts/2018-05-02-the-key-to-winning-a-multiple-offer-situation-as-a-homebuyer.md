Right now there’s low inventory in our marketplace, and because of this, we’re seeing a lot of multiple offer situations happening with listed homes

If you’re a buyer and you find yourself in a multiple offer situation, it’s important that you work with an agent like me who can structure your contract in a way that allows you to beat out the other buyers and their offers.

Some of the tactics our team has used in the past when negotiating on behalf of a buyer in a multiple offer situation include:

* Raising the earnest money
* Shortening up the closing time
* Writing an as-is contract
