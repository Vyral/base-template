There are many different loan types, including conventional, FHA, rehab, VA loans, and many more. We’re only going to talk about a couple of those loan types today, but **you will choose your loan based on your situation and on the house that you want to buy.**

If you’re buying a standard, move-in ready home and you’re a first-time buyer, your credit history, employment history, down payment, and long-term goals will all factor into the type of loan that you want to apply for. &nbsp;

**I always say, “The more down, the merrier.”** If you can put 20% down on your home, you can avoid things like private mortgage insurance, but for most people that’s just not an option. FHA loan are popular because they allow you to put less down and allow you to keep more money in your pocket.

The interest rates have been so low lately that it really creates an environment where borrowing money is a smart move. Again, it really depends on the type of home that you want to buy. For example, a rehab loan might be a good option if you’re buying and renovating a home.
