When selling your home, there are certain things you must avoid during the process. Today I’d like to highlight a few things not to do when it comes time to list:

**1. Don’t set an unrealistic price.** Pricing your home too high will discourage interested parties from making an offer, which could leave your property to sit on the market for months. If you’ve made, or are thinking of making, updates to your home in an attempt to raise its value, be aware that not all renovations will earn you your money back. You likely aren’t the only person in your neighborhood to have made these same upgrades.

**2. Don’t try to sell your home without an agent.** A Realtor knows what’s selling around you and for what price, so they can tell you which offers are reasonable. They will also be able to help you negotiate and make informed decisions. Beyond that, forgoing the help of a Realtor wouldn’t save you as much money as some may think.

**3. Don’t skip marketing.** Some may think that all it takes to sell a home is to put photos online and a sign in the yard. But doing these things alone will not bring buyers flooding to your door. The only way to guarantee you’ll earn the best price for your home is to utilize all available marketing tools.

**4. Don’t put off fixing broken items.** If buyers walk through your home and spot a handful of items in need of immediate repair, they’ll begin to wonder what else may be wrong with the property. The entryway of your home will serve as a major indicator for the property’s overall condition. So be sure to fix things like loose handrails on the steps, ripped window screens, and any other features that could damage a buyer’s perception.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
