*As the year winds down, I wanted to send you a special message. Thanks for your support this year.*

I just wanted to take a moment to stop by and wish everyone happy holidays and a happy New Year.

2016 was a record-breaking year here at Carbutti & Company, and I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who supported us and tell you **how grateful I am that you chose us to help you with your real estate needs.**

I am looking forward to seeing each and every one of you in 2017. **God bless, have a great holiday, and I look forward to talking to you next year.** If you have any questions or any real estate needs in the meantime, give me a call or send me an email. Weâ€™re always here to help.
