I recently got asked a great question by a friend of mine whose son was graduating from college and looking to go into a sales career. So, today I’m answering the question, **“What should you look for in a company when looking for a career in sales?”**

The number one thing I would look for in a company when seeking a sales career is if the company is sales driven. Companies can be marketing driven, research driven, or distribution driven, but you want to make sure you’re with a sales driven company.&nbsp;

For example, a marketing driven company would be Visa. They are great at marketing and have great brand identity across the world. A research company would be a company like 3M, which is phenomenal with their research and development which leads to them producing fantastic products.&nbsp;

**A sales driven company is a company that places a high value on sales people, and as a result they are compensated accordingly.** One question I would ask the president or CEO to find out if a company is a sales driven company is, “What do you do when your top sales rep makes more money than you?” A company that would see that as a problem is not a sales driven company, whereas a company that says they would send them on a trip, buy them a watch, reward them, or ask them to teach other reps, is a sales driven company.&nbsp;

If you want to have a career in sales, **your best earning potential and long-term potential is going to be with a company that understands and respects sales and rewards people accordingly.**

If you have any questions please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m always happy to help!&nbsp;
