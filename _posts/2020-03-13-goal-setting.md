Goal Setting or Commitment Setting-

When you planned out the new year, did you make a list of goals that your were striving to achieve or, a commitment to deliver on? It’s human nature to have a goal, yet change or modify the goal when the going gets tough. On the contrary, one who is committed to a desired outcome will do anything and everything needed to achieve it.

We are nearly a quarter of the way through 2020 and it’s time to do an inventory check on your years missions. Are you ahead, on pace or behind?&nbsp;

A goal is a good idea, while &nbsp;a commitment is measured by one thing…the result.

Are you achieving the results you want so far this year? If you are, congratulations\!\! If not, I encourage you this week to recommit to those things you are willing to go All In on, and the. Go do it\!

Cheers to a productive week\!&nbsp;
