Lately, a few people have asked me whether income properties are a worthwhile investment. Without a doubt, the answer is yes. Real estate is a great way to earn an income and control your investment. Also, because you have a more active role in the success of the investment, the risk is much lower than other venues.

Compared to the stock market, investing in income properties is a no-brainier. With stocks, you have no direct impact on a given company's success besides the money you supply. However, with income properties you can be both financially and physically engaged. I really believe in this venture, so much so that I recently helped my daughter buy her first income property and I plan on using my income property as my retirement plan.

If you are ready to invest in real estate or just want to know more, give me call today at 818.953.5300 or send me an email at brad@bradkorb.com
