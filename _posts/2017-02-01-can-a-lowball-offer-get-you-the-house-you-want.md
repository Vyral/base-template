Today I’m joined by our team’s director of sales, Hilary Cabiness, to answer the question, “Can you really get a good deal on a house if you lowball your offer?”

In Hilary’s experience, buyers often try to lowball their offer on a house because they’re afraid of overpaying for it. According to her, **doing this hurts your chances of getting a good deal on the house you want in the long run.**This is because many sellers are emotionally attached to their homes, and it can be a challenge to separate emotion from business and act according to what the market is bearing for houses right now.

To make an informed decision as a buyer, you must **look at comparable home sales your agent provides you in that neighborhood to see what houses are selling for.**This will give you a better idea of if the house you want is priced correctly.

For example, if you see a brand-new listing priced at $200,000 and you want to make an offer at $175,000, look at the comps first. If other homes in the neighborhood are selling for $200,000, you will most definitely have to offer full price to have a shot at that house.

If you come across a home that’s underpriced, the seller might just be extra motivated to sell it. These situations can often result in multiple offers and the home selling above asking price. If this is the case, you’re better off making your offer at asking price or slightly above. Unlike previous years, there is very limited inventory in our current market, and getting a good deal can be hard to come by. Examine all factors before you make a decision, though. If a home has been on the market for four months and has undergone multiple price reductions, there might be something seriously wrong with it.

Our market is ever-changing, but the bottom line is that

Our market is ever-changing, but the bottom line is that **right now we’re in a sellers market.**That means that sellers can dictate the price and terms of the offer and you’re less likely to get the deal that you want. Always be open to what the market is doing and consult with a real estate professional before making any decisions.
