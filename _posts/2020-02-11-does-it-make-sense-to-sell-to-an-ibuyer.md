<center><em>Selling a home to an iBuyer isn&rsquo;t right for everyone, but it is right for some. Here are the pros and cons of this method.</em></center>

<br>There are certain circumstances that arise in someone’s life where they need to sell their home extremely fast. If you or someone you know is in a position like this, it’s important to know your options.

**There are companies, such as Zillow Offers, Opendoor, or Offerpad, who will buy your home very quickly if you need the money now**. Typically, these companies are set up to buy with cash and no contingencies, but sellers tend to leave a lot of money on the table this way.

Most of the time, they’ll only offer you 70% of your home’s value. On top of that, they’ll be adding up fees to charge you so that you end up netting even less money.
