What are some of the qualifications for applying as a tenant in Hawaii? This is a tricky topic whether you’re a landlord or tenant. Let me share some of the most important qualifications if you’re a tenant.

**Most tenants usually apply online through** [**our website**](https://www.hipacificpm.com/) by clicking the “Apply” button, where you’ll fill out a form. However, 25% of the time, we get applications that are incorrect or cannot be verified.

When it comes to your credit score, we check three major credit bureaus, and we receive a score based on that. It’s important to note that **we don’t accept scores below 600.** Scores between 600 and 650 are negotiable, and scores over 700 are generally good.

We continue with the background check, asking the applicant for additional information, such as banking and landlord information, and verifying all those resources.

If you have questions about the application process, feel free to call us at [**(808) 445-9223**](tel:8084459223) or send a message to [**duke@hipacificpm.com**](mailto:duke@hipacificpm.com)**.** I’d be happy to help.
