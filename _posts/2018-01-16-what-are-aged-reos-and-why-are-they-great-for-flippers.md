It can be really tough to find good properties that are going to work for fix and flips. I think that there is a good opportunity for flip projects in aged REOs.

Aged REOs are bank-owned properties that have been on the market for over 60 days. The longer they’re on the market, the better.

Here’s how the whole process works.

Once the bank gets their foreclosure judgment, that property goes to their in-house asset management team. The property gets assigned to an asset manager, who gets on the phone with local Realtors to get a broker’s price opinion, or BPO.

After gathering a few BPOs together, the asset manager will look at those, the information he has on the property, and the bank’s position in the property in order to determine the asking price.

After that, the property goes to the market. Maybe a couple of weeks go by without any offers. The asset manager will have the property go through a price reduction. Maybe they get an offer, go through the inspection process, and the deal falls apart in a couple of weeks.

When the property has been on the market for 30 days, the asset manager starts to sweat. **When the property has been on the market for 60 days, the asset manager thinks, “Uh-oh, there’s a problem.”**

The asset manager will go to his meeting with the other asset managers in the region and the investors to go through the portfolio and see which properties are moving. All of a sudden, the asset manager is on the hot seat because the property has been on the market so long and the bank wants that property to move.

Our asset manager goes back to his cubicle and gets on the phone with his Realtor to see what they are going to do. These guys want to get an offer. They don’t want to get another browbeating at the next meeting. **Plus, the bank is now in a negotiating mood.**

Now is the time for you to make an offer on the property.

You are going to make a solid offer that they can’t refuse. It’s going to be a realistic offer, but it’s also going to be aggressive. There is going to be a quick close with no contingencies, as in no inspections. You’d better know what you’re doing when it comes to figuring out what the repair costs will be.

When you work with me, I’ll discuss the offer with you. **Do not call me if you do not have your proof of funds ready to send over right away.** I’ll help you figure out if it’s worth moving forward with the offer, and then we’ll pull the trigger. Again, I hope you know what you are doing when it comes to repairs because you are going to own this property.
