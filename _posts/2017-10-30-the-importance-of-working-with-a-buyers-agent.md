  I talk to friends and buyer clients all the time that say that they don’t want
  to waste my time because they’re still trying to figure out what they want in
  the home. My reaction to that gracious sentiment is always the same. You’re
  not wasting my time. In fact, if we visit a home and you don’t like it, that’s
  the opposite of a waste of our time.

I talk to friends and buyer clients all the time who say that they don’t want to waste my time because they’re still trying to figure out what they want in a home. My reaction to that gracious sentiment is always the same. You’re not wasting my time. **In fact, if we visit a home and you don’t like it, that’s the opposite of a waste of our time.**

You see, it’s my job to help you. To do that to the best of my ability, I need to understand exactly what you’re looking for. The more homes we look at, whether you like them or not, the better idea I'll have of what you're looking for.

The alternative to working with a buyer’s agent isn’t that great. By going to a home and only working with the listing agent, you’re not helping anybody (except for maybe the seller).

**A buyer’s agent does much more than just show a home.** That’s why it’s important to work with one every step of the way. Not only can we help you find the perfect home, we can help you write a contract and negotiate the best terms on the sale.

If you have any questions for us about buyer’s agents, seller’s agents, or anything else about real estate, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
