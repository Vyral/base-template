If you’re like many employers we speak with, an ever-growing piece of your compensation pie is going toward health care expenses. If your employees are sharing in the cost, their premiums are rising—they not only have to pay co-pays, but they also have to pay higher out-of-pocket expenses as well.

I’m not suggesting there’s a magic wand or a silver bullet to solve this issue, but **there are some exciting alternatives in the marketplace right now that we’d love to share with you in more detail.** There’s also an alternative to Kaiser Permanente here in the Bay Area, and that’s an exciting development as well.

I started Morrical Insurance back in 1992, and the goal then was the same as it is today—to help you evaluate the most appropriate options that fit within your budget and meet your overall goals for your employees. We know how they look to you and how important it is for them to have healthcare and retirement plan security.

If you’d like to talk about your firm and its goals or some of the exciting alternatives in the marketplace that I mentioned, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d love to help you.
