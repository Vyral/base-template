Today we want to introduce to you The Stern Team’s Love it or Leave program, the ultimate buyer protection plan for uncertain times.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Buying a home is a big decision, and one that you literally have to live with.&nbsp; We strive to find you the perfect home, a home that you will love for years to come.&nbsp; Our experience and our consumer oriented programs provide you with numerous unique systems that allow us to quickly zero in on exactly what you’re looking for and help you beat out the other buyers to the best new listings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

* What if you get transferred just after you’ve bought the home?
* What if you receive a fantastic but unexpected job offer which requires you to move?
* What if you decide that the home or neighborhood just isn’t what you wanted?
* What if you win the lottery and want a bigger home?

We want you to be able to buy a home with confidence, so we’re going to remove the risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Simply put, if you don’t absolutely love your home within the first 12 months, we will sell it for free on our side and help you find a new home.

When you work with one of our specially trained buyer’s only specialists and the home you buy turns out to be less than perfect during the first year of ownership, or you hit the lottery, we will sell it for free.&nbsp; We won’t charge you a listing commission while you’re looking for your replacement home with The Stern Team. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Yup, it’s that easy.&nbsp; So give us a call or shoot us an email and put us to work.&nbsp; We’ve helped over 2,500 families with the American Dream and I’m confident we can bring the gift of homeownership to you and help you get started down the road to financial independence.&nbsp;
