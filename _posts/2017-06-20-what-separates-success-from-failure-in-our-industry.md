As an agent, there are three things that will determine your success (or failure) in real estate.
<br>&nbsp;

1. **Your attitude:** Henry Ford once famously said; "Whether you think you can or you can't, either way, you're right." You need that unstoppable mindset with a commitment to winning and succeeding.&nbsp;
2. **Your schedule:** There are a lot things you could spend your time on, from broker tours to lunch with lenders to socializing with other agents in the office. Being very structured with your time helps you focus on on the income-generating activities like serving your clients, generating new clients, showing homes, and meeting with buyers and sellers. All the other stuff isn't always the highest and best use of your time. Use your energy in the morning when you have the most vigor to focus on the most important things.&nbsp;
3. **Commitment to do whatever it takes to succeed:** For one, this means digging to find the resources you need to level up in your business. As a sales agent, you can practice on your scripts or sales presentation, for example. Secondly, you need the inner drive and total commitment to do whatever it takes.
