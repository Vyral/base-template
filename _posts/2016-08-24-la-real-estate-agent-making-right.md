Recently, I’ve had a couple of clients working on their property and doing things that I didn’t think were important in order to get top dollar in the market.

This got me thinking about how I could help others. Before you go and spend any time and money working on things around the house to get it fixed up and ready for sale, talk to an experienced real estate professional who knows about the buyers in your market. They can help you determine the best ways to spend your time and money when updating your home for sale.

Clients often invest money in their house before listing, which is nice for them, but they’re the seller - not the buyer. Whatever they invest in might not be what buyers are looking for in today’s market. This is why we want our sellers to be laser-focused on the best way to spend the least amount of money to get the top dollar in today’s market.

If you have more questions how to spend money wisely when improving your home, give me a call or send me an email. I'd be happy to give you advice about preparing your home for the market.
