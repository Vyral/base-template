As we enter the fourth quarter, we're still in a seller's market here on Mainline. Have you been thinking of selling your home?

As we enter the fourth quarter, we can see that the fall market is a very busy one for us; it's almost as busy as the spring.

**When it comes to the Mainline real estate market, we are still in a seller's market.** There is very low inventory right now, and currently in our system, we have more than 5,000 active buyers looking to purchase a home. If you're thinking about selling your house this fall, give us a call. We'd love to come out and give you a free comparative market analysis on your home to let you know what it's worth in today's market.
