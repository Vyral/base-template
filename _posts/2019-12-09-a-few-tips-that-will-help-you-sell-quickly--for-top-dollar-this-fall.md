Temperatures are dropping, leaves are changing color, and pumpkin spice everything has taken over the world. With fall color and produce so prominent this time of year, you might be tempted to load up your home with an abundance of both, but if you’re a home seller, a little discretion goes a long way.&nbsp;

With that in mind, here are a few tips that will help you maximize your home sale this fall.&nbsp;

First, **pay attention to your curb appeal.** Too many fall decorations will take the focus off your home and its best features, but a few tasteful accents can create an inviting setting and make it feel fresh. You also want to make sure fall leaves haven’t taken a toll on your yard. Buyers may understand if your yard is unkempt—they’re living in the same reality—but that doesn’t mean it will make a good impression.

Second, **go easy on the gore.** You may love the idea of blood and guts and skeletons rising from your yard, but will buyers be amused or afraid? Anything that has the potential to turn them off is a big no-no when listing your house. Sticking to safe decor choices will help you appeal to the masses.

Next, **let in some light.** It’s always a good idea to open the blinds and make sure all your windows are sparkling-clean when selling your home, but now that the days are shorter, you need to maximize the natural light in your home. This will make it look bigger.&nbsp;

Lastly, **make sure the space is inviting.** As the weather cools down, a warm and cozy atmosphere will give buyers a pleasant and comfortable feeling. Use plush throws on the couches and beds, and add some fall-accented pillows for the couches and chairs.&nbsp;
