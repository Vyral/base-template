Is listing your home in the winter a good idea? The answer is yes, and here’s why.

**Homes listed during the winter are 9% more likely to sell than homes listed during the other seasons.** These properties, on average, sell a week faster, sell for 1.2% more than their list price, and are more likely to sell above asking price than the homes listed in summer or fall.

If you’re surprised by these statistics, you’re not alone. Conventional real estate wisdom says to pass on the winter market and wait for the spring. However, as you can see from the numbers, **passing on the winter market would be a mistake.**

It’s true that there are less buyers in the winter, but that isn’t necessarily a problem as buyers during the winter are more motivated. Some of them might need to get into a new home for a job relocation, some might want to take advantage of low interest rates before another increase occurs, and some have been searching for months with no luck in finding their dream home.

If you are looking to sell your home, I would definitely recommend selling in the winter. However, keep in mind that the winter market is a whole different ballgame. **For example, you really need to list your home as close to market value as possible**&nbsp;because an overpriced home causes low buyer interest and strips away time for any price reductions.

If you would like to know the current value of your home, get advice on how to prepare your home for the winter market, or if you have any other real estate related questions, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help!
