"Jeremy, would you buy a home in this market?" I get asked this question a lot. The answer? I already did.

Despite rising interest rates and plenty of negative real estate news circulating, I purchased the historic "Miles House" on Main Street in my hometown of St. George\!&nbsp;

This home is not my primary residence - I live just four blocks away.

So why would I buy now, with prices falling and interest rates rising?

I made a decision for my family because there's *always* a time to purchase real estate. One of my favorite quotes is: "Don't wait to buy real estate...buy real estate and wait\!"

It sounds cliched, but recent data shows that if you owned a home for at least 10 of the last 30 years, you ALWAYS came out with positive equity\!

Check this out:

Do you know of other investments that returned ***621%*** since 1991? And how many of them had the original purchase price being ***paid down*** monthly over that time?&nbsp;

And imagine if you had owned a rental since 1991. A complete stranger would have paid off your entire 30-year mortgage by now\!&nbsp;

You must make real estate purchase decisions based on ***your ***goals and family situation. Don't get caught up in the market. If you intend to own a property for a long while, you can buy at almost any time.

If you have questions about this topic, just call or email me. I'd love to talk.

Happy Fall\!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
