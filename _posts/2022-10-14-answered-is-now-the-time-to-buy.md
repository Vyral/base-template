“Jeremy, would you buy a home in this market?” I get asked this question a lot. The answer? I already did. The Miles House isn’t where I live: It’s actually an investment property. Built between 1865 and 1869 in downtown St. George, Utah, it is a nightly and weekly rental.&nbsp;

So why would I buy now, with prices falling and interest rates rising? I made a decision for my family because there’s always a time to purchase real estate. You need to make that decision based on your goals and your family situation. Don’t get caught up in the market: If you intend to own a property for a long while, you can buy at almost any time.&nbsp;

If you have questions about this topic, just call or email me. I’d love to talk.
