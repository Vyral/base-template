On our team, one of the most foundational ways we encourage our agents to leverage their business is through the utilization of a showing agent. **A showing agent is someone who works directly with a buyer agent to help open doors and show clients properties that the buyer agent can write contracts for.**

This year, the number of our transactions is up 27%, and leveraging showing agents is a big reason why. We've hired four showing agents to give our buyer agents more time to do other things that grow business, like additional lead generation, more appointments, or more time writing and negotiating contracts.

If you have questions about leveraging showing agents, give me a call. Iâ€™d love to hear from you and answer any questions you may have.
