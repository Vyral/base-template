{% include youtube.html %}The need to buy and sell real estate simultaneously is a common occurrence. Most people can’t afford two mortgages at once, so a home sale must be completed before funding can be approved for a home purchase. **If you anticipate being in a similar situation in the near future, I’ve got some tips to share to help you out.**
<br>
<br>The first thing you should do is figure out the true value of your home by sitting down with a Realtor, appraiser, or another real estate market expert. As soon as you find out how much it is worth, the next step is to list the home. **Now, you have a few different options with how you want to handle this.**
<br> {% include pullquote.html %}
<br>One option is accepting an offer that is contingent on you finding your next home. It can be a little tricky, but because inventory is so low in the market, a lot of buyers will be OK with this kind of deal.
<br>
<br>You’ll need to figure out how much you can qualify for in your next home before you make an offer on one. **When you make an offer, it might be wise to make the offer contingent on you selling your home.** If your home already has an offer or is under contract, this only improves your chances of securing the home.
<br>
