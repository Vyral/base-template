How do property taxes affect your monthly payments? This is a topic that many people are unclear about, so I’d like to shed some light on it today.

If we have a $200,000 home where the interest rate is 4%, and the mortgage is set over a period of 30 years, **your regular payment (without taxes and insurance) would be about $955.**

{% include pullquote.html %}

Now suppose that your property tax is 2.5%. You would **multiply that $200,000 by 2.5%, leaving you with $5,000.** Since there are 12 months in the year, divide that $5,000 by 12, which would be $416.66.

Now that you have that figure, **add it to the $955 monthly payment. That means that you’ll pay $1,371.66 per month.**

However, don’t forget your insurance. Supposing your monthly insurance payment is $50, you’d add it to the last figure, **totaling a $1,421.66 monthly payment.**

When it comes to figuring out how much you’ll pay per month for your home, factoring in property tax and insurance make a big difference.
