<p style="text-align: center;"><em>How should buyers react to seeing “coming soon” listings? Today I’ll discuss.</em></p>

Advertising a home as “coming soon” is a great strategy that helps the seller get an early start on their marketing program. Most of the time, however, “coming soon” listings are not available for viewings until they’re fully active listings on the market. According to the National Association of Realtors, **“coming soon listings” are not allowed to be shown by any agent, even the listing agent.** Even still, a “coming soon” listing should have a date by which they’ll be open for showings and will usually have at least a few pictures of the home.

**So what should you do if you see a “coming soon” sign in front of your dream home?**

First, don’t get too excited and begin to mentally settle on that home in particular just yet. There will be an opportunity for you to view it eventually, and in the meantime, you can do research online.

If, while you’re waiting, you decide to pursue that home, know that you can make an early, sight-unseen offer on it. Confer with your Realtor about the best way to structure your offer so that you don’t get burned without any contingencies. If you’re serious about purchasing the home, you’ll definitely want to be able to view it and do a home inspection to make sure it fits your needs.

In a fast market like this, we’re seeing more “coming soon” listings, but **be careful not to jump the gun.** Do all your due diligence before you make an offer, and be patient if the seller doesn’t respond to your offer right away. Often, sellers advertise their home as “coming soon” specifically to generate excitement for the property to enter the market; they’ll wait to see how the market reacts before they’ll accept an offer.
