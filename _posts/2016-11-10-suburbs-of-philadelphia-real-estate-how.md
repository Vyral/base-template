One of my greatest passions as a Realtor is getting my home sellers the best possible price in the least amount of time with the least amount of hassle. In short, my biggest concern is making your real estate great again.

**Today’s home seller faces many challenges in our current market.** For one thing, our market is complicated. You can’t just put a sign on your lawn and expect it to sell. Currently, the average days on market is 80 days, which isn’t great. In fact, it’s bad. Taxes are also high, and they’re only getting higher. This makes it difficult for buyers to afford homes, which is causing home values to go down every single year.

Another problem is Realtors making false promises about selling your home and then using slipshod tactics like taking its listing photos with a cell phone. That’s not what a professional does! It only takes about $600 to get a license, so, unfortunately, not a lot of training goes into handling such a large asset.

How can you avoid these problems when listing your home? I’ve put together a list of eight secret strategies to help guide you through the process. You can learn these strategies by visiting <a href="http://8secretstrategies.com/" target="_blank">8secretstrategies.com</a>. Whether it’s through me or another agent, this list will tell you what you should do to sell your home. In short, there are two main things that can make your real estate great again: having both a marketing expert and a negotiating expert on your team.

Why am I telling you this? **Because houses today are selling quickly–for those whose house is priced right and staged properly.** It’s now November, which means if you plan on selling in the spring, you need to make a plan now. Don’t make the mistake of waiting too long or not hiring an expert Realtor.
