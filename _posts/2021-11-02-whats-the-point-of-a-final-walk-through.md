Before you close on your home purchase, you have to do a final walk-through to ensure your soon-to-be-home is move-in ready. **Here’s what you should be checking during that walk-through:**

* Test all lights and ceiling fans
* Test all outlets. Bring a phone charger with you to check
* Run all sinks and faucets. Check for leaks
* Test all kitchen appliances
* Test garage door and remote
* Run the heater and A/C
* Test the fireplace if applicable
* Open and close all windows and doors
* Check toilets for leaks
* Run all exhaust fans in bathrooms and kitchen
* Inspect walls, flooring, and ceilings
* Check exterior for damage or cosmetic issues
* Make sure all garbage and personal items are removed from the house

**Your agent should also bring along the repair amendment in the contract to make sure all the agreed-upon repairs were completed.** If you have any questions about this list or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
