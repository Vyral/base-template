One of the most common questions I receive from people moving to The Flathead Valley area is, “What is there to do?” There’s plenty\! Today I want to discuss what sorts of activities we like to do for fun around The Flathead Valley, including a special new attraction.&nbsp;&nbsp;

There are excellent skiing mountains in the winter and wonderful fishing spots in the summer. We also are close to Glacier Park if you are interested in hiking and wildlife. Great rodeos come to town, and there are concerts all year round. The range of activities here is great, but there’s a new thing coming to town that may pique your interest.&nbsp;

**We’re getting a semi-professional baseball team called the Glacier Range Riders.** Naturally, the mascot will be a mountain goat. The stadium is currently under construction and will be open this summer. It will have 2,500 seats, so there should be plenty of room for a fun crowd.&nbsp;

**The first game will be on June 14,** and there will be 48 home games. The Range Riders will be the fourth team in the state of Montana, the others being in Missoula, Great Falls, and Billings. They play in the Pioneer League, which is affiliated with Major League Baseball and consists of 10 teams total.&nbsp;

The tickets become available in February, but you can reserve season tickets now. Just visit [www.gorangeriders.com](http://www.gorangeriders.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} if you’re interested. I believe this team could be an anchor for our community, so I’m excited about their arrival\!&nbsp;

If you have questions about today’s topic or anything real estate-related, please call or email me. I am always willing to help.
