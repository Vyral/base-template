Out of all 50 states, Florida has the most international buyers. This means more opportunities for you! This means more potential buyers for your home and an active real estate market. Most international buyers pay cash for vacation homes, and add to the local economy when they come to visit. Understanding which countries are interested in Florida is important, and at Treu Group Real Estate we stay informed of what's happening abroad. Our understanding of the international market helps us better navigate our local real estate markets, and help you make an informed decision when making your next big real estate transaction.
