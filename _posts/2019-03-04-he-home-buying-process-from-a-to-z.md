I just wanted to take a moment today to introduce you to my right-hand woman, Erica Nickel. She’s our client relationship manager, and you’ll be hearing more from her more and more as we strive to keep in better touch with everybody on a more regular basis. For anything you need, you can reach out to either of us and we’d be happy to help. Keep an eye out for our upcoming client events in the meantime. To meet Erica for yourself, watch this short video.

Today I’m going to give you all the steps that you need to take before you buy a house.

The first thing you want to do is meet with a lender. There are many different lenders out there that offer a wide variety of services, so shop around and compare. I’d be more than happy to give you a referral for a good one.

I’ve seen people make the mistake of finding a house before meeting with a lender. They end up finding out that their dream home is out of their price range and are always disappointed with whatever they find after that.

The next step is to identify the type of loan you want. Can you afford a high down payment, or do you need one that’s a little more affordable?

Once you’ve got the financials figured out, you need to meet with your Realtor and determine the type of home you’re looking for. If you’re looking for a new construction home, a resale home, or a condo, it’s important to consider it all.

Then, make a list of things you absolutely have to have in a home and things that you want but could do without. All of this will help you open up your search.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
