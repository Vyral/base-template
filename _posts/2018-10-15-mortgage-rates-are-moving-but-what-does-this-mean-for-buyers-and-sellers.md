Mortgage rates are rising, which means both buyers and sellers need to make their move now.

What do rising mortgage rates mean for buyers and sellers in our market?
{: .present-before-paste}

When you break it down, rates have gone from just under 4% to 5%, and they should continue to rise into the mid-5% and 6% range over the course of 2019. As you may know, a 1% increase in mortgage rates decreases buyers’ purchasing power by 10%. For example, if a $300,000 house was the maximum you could afford when rates were at 4%, the maximum you can afford now that they’re at 5% is $270,000.&nbsp;

This rise will also start putting downward pressure on prices, so **whether you’re a buyer or a seller, the best time to make your move is now.** If you’re a seller, you’re better off selling now while buyers can afford more. We’re seeing an exodus of buyers in the $350,000-and-above price range, so this trend along with the rise in rates is not helping home values in that area. Below $350,000 is still a solid seller’s market, but that will start to shift as well.
