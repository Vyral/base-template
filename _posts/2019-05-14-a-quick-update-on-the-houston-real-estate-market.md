I’ve been getting a lot of questions about the market lately so I wanted to bring you an update today. **Since January, I’ve seen a ton of relocation clients come to Houston.** Usually, the first few months of the year are slow for us, but we’ve been extremely busy so far in 2019.

Lately, our market has gone up because more and more jobs are coming here to the oil industry. With more jobs comes more homebuyers. **There are two types of markets right now in Houston that are existing simultaneously.** The first is the existing inventory that has been on the market since last year, and the other is the new homes that are being put on the market now.

**Today’s buyers are much more attracted to those homes that have just recently come on the market.** With the homes that came on last year, a lot of buyers view them as stale listings and think there’s something wrong with those homes.

As for those stale listings, I believe that a lot of investors will come in to absorb that existing inventory and that the new inventory will be absorbed by the new buyers that are relocating here.

**When will this turn into a seller's market?** We don’t have a crystal ball, but we do know this: Historically, when oil prices start going up and keep going up, so do home prices. This has happened in our market as recently as 2014.

However, there's one little thing that’s bothering everybody: the potential Anaraku deal. If the company is sold, there will be a lot of overlapping projects and **when they bring the two businesses together, they will have to make some layoffs.** Most of the time, they let go people who are near retirement age, so we could see a lot of senior citizens take an early retirement and move out of the area. This could have a huge impact on our market going forward.

**My advice is to take advantage of the market today.** Instead of waiting to see what happens, take advantage of the buyers on the market now if you’re thinking of selling your home. If you’re planning on buying a new home here in Houston, you can negotiate a great deal on a home that is in that existing inventory market.

If you have any questions for me about how you can take advantage of these conditions or about anything related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
