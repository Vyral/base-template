Do you want to improve your finances? Many do, but maybe you don’t know where to start.&nbsp;

Well, promoting your own financial health all starts with measuring some basic skills.

First, **learn how to budget.** Budgets can be boring, but they are the cornerstone of financial responsibility. They can help you no matter what the situation is, be it paying the bills, chipping away debt, saving for retirement, or buying a home. Budgeting can help you answer the dreaded question, “Where did all my money go\!?” that you may ask yourself at the end of the month.

Next, **use credit cards correctly.** Credit cards can be a valuable financial tool that can help you build credit or repair poor credit. Just be sure to avoid getting caught in a bad cycle with credit cards; only buy what you can afford.

Also, **pay yourself first.** This seems impossible, but it’s incredibly important that you make sure to pay yourself first by transferring money into your savings account before paying any of your bills.&nbsp;

You’ll also want to learn how to **invest wisely.** Whether you invest in a small stock portfolio or you own your own home, learning how to invest is a keystone of your financial health and wealth.

Finally, **live within your means.** Don’t compare yourself to others, and if you can’t afford it, don’t buy it.
