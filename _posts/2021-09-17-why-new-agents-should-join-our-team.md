Today I’m excited to be talking with Anjanette Calderon about what it’s like to be a young, successful agent in San Diego. Without further ado, let’s get started\!

**So Anjannette, how long have you been in the business?&nbsp;**

I’ve had my license for four years, but I’ve been in the business for about five. I started focusing primarily on the South Bay area, but I’ve expanded recently. I’m fluent in both Spanish and English, so that’s a huge benefit in this area.

**Recently, you joined our team at Select Premier Properties. You’re a pretty successful agent, so what made you decide to join our team?**

I’ve experienced being a solo agent and working on different teams, and Select Premier has the best culture by far. Everyone on the team is looking to grow, and the mentorship helps take people to the next level.&nbsp;

**What advice do you have for any new agents out there?**

My number one piece of advice for new agents is not to focus too much on commission, at least at first. Instead, focus on finding a team that will set you up for success in the long term. It’s way harder to find the tools to be successful by yourself.&nbsp;

**How many deals did you close your first year, and where are you at now?**

When I first started, I was closing around 10 transactions per year. Now, I’m averaging 20 transactions per year. I just received the top 10% award from PSAR for my work here in San Diego, so I’m looking forward to working with Premier Select.&nbsp;

I would like to thank Anjanette for talking with us today. If you want to reach her, you can give her a call at 619-248-3363 or check out [her Instagram](http://instagram.com/ms.southbay). Meanwhile, if you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out. I am always willing to help.
