If you’re a seller who has been thinking about putting your home on the spring market, now is the time to get a move on and actually do it.

In our market, we can’t keep these properties long enough. **There is so much pent-up demand from buyers** who have been in the marketplace for three to six months and haven’t yet seen anything they like. They’re just waiting for something new to come on the market.

A couple weeks ago, we were in a situation where we put a nice 3-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom, colonial starter home with a one-car garage on the market at 9 a.m. on a Friday morning. **We had seven requests for showings in just the first 24 hours\!** In the first 48 hours, we had six offers on the property. We ended up listing it for $329,000, and we ultimately put the property under contract for $250,000. **We were able to create a multiple-offer situation that only benefited our seller.**

The pent-up demand stems from a number of different factors, but one of the main reasons for it is that **there’s been a real shortage of good inventory on the market**. With interest rates holding as low as they have been, there are a lot of buyers who are looking to purchase homes right now.

So again, now is the time to put your home on the market and take advantage of all this demand from buyers in the marketplace.

So, if you’re thinking of selling your home and would like to get top dollar for it, reach out to me. Let’s set up an appointment for us to come down to your house so we can give you an honest, realistic estimate of what your home would sell for, and so we can generate a marketing plan and a time-frame that works for you. I hope to hear from you soon\!
