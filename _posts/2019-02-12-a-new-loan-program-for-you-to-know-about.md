**Today we’re excited to talk about a brand-new loan program that allows buyers to use the rent on an investment property to help them qualify for more home.**

{% include pullquote.html %}

Utah Housing has been around for a long time. They have a ton of different loan programs, from the traditional 20% down mortgage loans to zero-down loan programs. Recently, they’ve introduced a new program that allows buyers to purchase different kinds of properties, such as a duplex or a home with a mother-in-law apartment, and use the projected rent from those accessory dwellings to add into their income in order to purchase more real estate.

**This is a great opportunity for a buyer to buy a new home while also getting a great asset.** If you or someone you know is interested in this brand-new program, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
