In today’s hot seller’s market, buyers can use all the help they can get. Homes are selling quickly and usually with multiple competing offers, which can make it challenging to secure a property. If you’re in the market for a home, use the following three tips to make your offer stand out against the competition:

**1\. Find out what is important to the seller**. Some sellers are interested in specific closing dates, others might want a leaseback, and others may have concerns about doing repairs after the inspection phase. Whatever they’re looking for, craft your offer to reflect their desires to take the stress away from them and to entice them to consider yours above all others.

**2\. Have a completed contract that is ready to sign**. When little details in the contract aren’t filled out correctly, it can slow down the entire process. If an offer comes in and the seller is willing to accept it but there are housekeeping errors, typos, or blank spaces in the contract, it will have to be sent back to the buyer’s agent for modification. As a buyer, you’ll want to maintain momentum in the deal, so be sure to cross all your t’s and dot your i’s.&nbsp;

**3\. Make your offer stand out.** If you want to draw the seller’s eyes to your offer, make it unique somehow. That could entail offering a higher price or making the close easier. Sit down with your agent and discuss some ways to differentiate your offer from the competition.
