Luxury home shoppers can have high expectations when it comes to buying a property. The higher the price point, the more they expect. Most luxury homes have similar traits, but there are four features that are trending in 2019:

**1\. Greater privacy.** Luxury home shoppers don’t want to be able to see their neighbor when they walk outside. They want gates, walls, and hedges in order to keep things private.

**2\. Smaller pools.** Deep pools aren’t trending anymore; luxury homebuyers are instead looking for smaller plunge pools that take up less space so that there’s still plenty of land available.

**3\.Two of everything.** One set of appliances isn’t enough. Luxury homebuyers want two stoves, dishwashers, etc., and they want them to be high-end designs.

**4\. Guest suites.** This doesn’t have to be a detached suite—luxury buyers are open to having rooms with an en suite bathroom. They use these rooms for live-in nannies, maids, and friends and family. They also want additional rooms they can use as a study, home office, theater, home gym, etc.
