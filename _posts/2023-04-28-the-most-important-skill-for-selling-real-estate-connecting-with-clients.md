I've been successfully selling real estate since 1999, and throughout the years, I've learned a few secrets that have helped me achieve success. Today, I'm going to share those secrets with you so that you, too, can do your best.

One of the greatest ironies of being new in real estate is that you are armed with information, yet you may not know where to start. You know how to calculate a mortgage payment, **but when it comes to connecting with people and properly qualifying them, you may be at a loss.**

The most important thing to know to be able to sell real estate is how to connect with people, how to talk with clients, and how to lead them through thoughtful questions about real estate. These are the skills that truly matter, and they are the first things that we train you on when you're part of my team.

Because let's face it, **who cares about filling out a real estate contract if you have no clients?** It all starts with knowing how to talk to clients and building those relationships.

So if you're ready to learn the secrets to selling real estate, join my team and let's get started. Just reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you!
