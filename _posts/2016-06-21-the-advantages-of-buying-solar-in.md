I recently had a client ask me if installing solar panels on his home would affect the sale. With solar, you have an option to lease the system or buy the system. There are advantages to each.

Leasing can be up to a 20-30 year term, and sometimes the units are not large enough so you will have to pay a little extra to your utility company at the end of the year. Another thing with leasing is that your technology won’t be updated unless it says so in the lease.

If you purchase the system, you can buy the correct size for your home, and you can update your technology, and you can also install a system large enough that you will not have to pay any utilities. Another benefit of purchasing is that you get quite a few tax benefits.

Just so you know - we sold a few homes for clients last year that were leasing solar, and they have all decided not to continue doing so in their next homes. Just thought you might want to know that!

If you have any questions about buying or leasing solar energy, please don’t hesitate to contact me. In some instances, it can raise the value of your home significantly.

Thanks for tuning in!
