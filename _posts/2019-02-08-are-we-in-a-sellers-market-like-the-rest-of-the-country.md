Are we in a buyer’s or seller’s market?

While the rest of the country is transitioning from a strong seller’s market into more of a balanced market, this trend doesn’t apply to our Houston marketplace.

Why? Our economy is oil-dependent, and since oil prices are down right now—and have been for the past few years—that means the oil industry isn’t hiring. If the oil industry isn’t hiring, new jobs aren’t being created and people aren’t moving into our area. This means no buyers are moving to our area either.

**In effect, this makes us a strong buyer’s market**. Inventory is high, so any buyer who moves into our area will have a lot of choices, especially if they’re looking in the higher-end price ranges.

In 2018, we started to see oil prices rise, but during the holiday season, they dropped again, and so did home prices. That’s why, right now, we have a lot of sellers who bought their homes back in 2012, 2013, etc., and are receiving offers that are lower than the prices they paid.

If you’re in this same predicament, it’s important to realize that now is not a good time to get top dollar for your home. As I said, buyers have plenty of other homes to choose from, and you have a lot of competition from other sellers.

**If you aren’t getting the offers you want, I recommend taking your home off the market and waiting a few years before listing it again.** The oil market is a lot like the real estate market—it rises and falls just like home prices do. Since the oil market has been down these last few years, it will eventually start to rise, and when it does, home prices will rise along with it.

**If you’re a buyer, however, now is absolutely the time to make your move,** whether you’re thinking of upsizing or downsizing.

If you have any further questions about our market or you need to buy or sell a home, feel free to call or email me. I’d love to help you.
