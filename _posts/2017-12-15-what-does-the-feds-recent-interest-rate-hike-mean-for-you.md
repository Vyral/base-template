I’m joined today by my preferred lender, Brian McKim over at SkyLine Home Plans, to talk about the Fed’s recent interest rate increase and how it’s going to affect you.

**In case you haven’t heard already, the FED raised rates by .25% this week.**However, this has been long expected and has been priced into the market for the last few months. The FED also announced that they would probably raise rates again two or three times in 2018.

**Even though the FED has increased their rates, mortgage interest rates have not been affected.** They remain excellent and still near historic lows. We don’t expect any major changes in the mortgage rate market for the time being.

If you have any questions in the meantime, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
