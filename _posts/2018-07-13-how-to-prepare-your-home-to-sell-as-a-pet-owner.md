Are you a pet owner? If so, you should know that there are four main things to consider when preparing to sell your home.

**1. Stains.** Have your little friends left any stains around your home? You want to make sure you steam clean your carpets or even replace them if so.

**2. Damage.** Fix any damages done by your pet including chewed window sills or back doors.<br><br>**3. Smells.** We want to make sure that when potential buyers come into your home, it is fresh and does not have odors. Many people have pet allergies, so your home needs to be prepared in a way that nothing distracts potential buyers from moving forward with purchasing your home.

**4. Backyard.** Sometimes, pets may fill your backyard with holes, so itâ€™s important to fix up your landscaping and curb appeal before buyers visit the home.

After doing these four things, you are ready to prepare for showings. Make sure you crate your pets and put away bowls so visitors cannot tell that there is a pet in the home.

If you have any additional questions or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
