Today I’m talking about appraisal concerns you might have. We're in a super hot market right now: Demand is high, supply is low, prices are rising, and occasionally we run into instances where a house will sell for more than the appraiser valued it. What happens in that situation, and what do you do as a buyer and a seller?

Believe it or not, we're seeing some instances where buyers are buying homes regardless of the appraised value. Some are agreeing to pay a certain amount above the appraised value. An appraiser will come up with a valuation based on other sales in the area, and that poses part of the problem. The appraisal is based on history and homes that have sold in the past. In a rising market, prices are going up, so when you're looking backward, the prices are a little bit lower than what's selling today.

In today's market, three things can happen if the house appraises low:

**1\. The buyer can renegotiate the price.** If you go under contract for $400,000 and the house appraises at $390,000, you can go to the sellers and negotiate to pay $390,000. As a seller, you have the option to drop to $390,000, or you can stay at the contracted $400,000.

**2\. The buyer has the option of canceling that contract if it doesn't appraise.** You can walk away if the seller refuses to drop that price.

**3\. The buyer agrees to pay the additional money as cash at closing.** The bank will finance the house based on $390,000. They have to bring an extra $10,000 in cash to the closing. That can make a big difference if that buyer is putting 3% down on a $400,000 house—that's $12,000. If they have to bring another $10,000, that's quite a big difference. If you're a negotiating seller and there's an appraisal contingency, if the buyer is putting down a large down payment, it's less of a concern than if they're putting down a small down payment.
