What can business leaders learn from hockey?&nbsp;

In hockey, players are taught to skate not to where the puck is, but where it's going next. **To win the game, you have to be able to effectively anticipate your next move.**

In N. Dean Meyer’s book, "Structural Cybernetics," he actually talks about five different organizational systems. The first is culture, which is how we treat one another. The second is structure, which is work charts and workflows. Then, there is the internal economy, which is how money moves throughout the organization. The fourth is methods and tools, and the last is metrics and reward, which is incentives and accountability.&nbsp;

Here’s a really good example of how anticipation works in business. In a company, you could have a people problem, which ultimately could be a structural problem or a culture problem. Or, simply put, it could simply be that you need to change out an existing tool.

For companies, not knowing how to anticipate the difference or the end result of your actions can mean fixing one problem only to cause two more.&nbsp;

Companies need to think like hockey players so they can effectively anticipate their next move.

In the movie *Miracle on Ice*, there's a saying that comes up over and over, 'the legs feed the wolf.' **The coach anticipated that in order for this team to go all the way to the Olympics, they would need one thing,** and that was to be able to have the strongest legs on the ice. So he trained his players to not only have the strongest legs but also have the greatest amount of endurance. His ability to anticipate what his team needed from beginning to end was why they won the gold.

If you have any further questions about the power of anticipation in business, we'd be happy to answer them. We hope to hear from you soon!
