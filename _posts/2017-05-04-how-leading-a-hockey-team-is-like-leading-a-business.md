What can business leaders learn from hockey?&nbsp;

In hockey, players are taught to skate not to where the puck is, but where it's going next. **To win the game, you have to be able to effectively anticipate your next move.**

In N. Dean Meyerâ€™s book, *Structural Cybernetics*, he actually talks about five different organizational systems. The first is culture, which is how we treat one another. The second is structure, which is work charts and workflows. Then, there is internal economy, which is how money moves throughout the organization. The fourth methods and tools, and the last is metrics and reward, which is incentives and accountability.&nbsp;

Here's a really good example of how anticipation works in business. In a company, you could have a revenue problem, which could be an efficiency problem, which could be a structural problem, which could be a people problem, and ultimately, it could lead to a culture problem, or it could simply be the need to change out an existing tool.

For companies, not knowing how to anticipate the difference or the end result of your actions can mean fixing one problem to not only cause two more.&nbsp;

Companies need to think like hockey players so they can effectively anticipate their next move.

In the movie *Miracle on Ice*, there's a saying that comes up over and over, 'the legs feed the wolf.' **The coach anticipated that for in order for this team to go all the way to the Olympics, they would need one thing,** and that was to be able to have the strongest legs on the ice. So he trained his players to not only have the strongest legs but also have the greatest amount of endurance. His ability to anticipate what his team needed from beginning to end was why the won the gold.

If you have any further questions about the power of anticipation in business, we'd be happy to answer them. We hope to hear from you soon!
