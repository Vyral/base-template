<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you’re thinking about refinancing your mortgage, you’re in luck. Today I’m answering some common questions about the topic.</em></p>

Today I’m back to answer a few common questions that homeowners have about refinancing. **First, Dan recently asked me, “If I refinance my home, is it going to increase my property taxes?”**

The simple answer is no. When you refinance your home, it does not reassess your home or increase your property taxes. **If it did, it wouldn’t be advantageous to do a refinance because the jump in property taxes would offset the savings from the refinance.**

The second question comes from a lot of people who believe their home is in a trust, only to find out that it’s not. **Why is their home no longer in a trust?** What we’ve found is that sometimes when you refinance, the property isn’t always put back in a trust.&nbsp;

If you or your parents have refinanced in the past after placing a property in a trust, double check to make sure that the title is held properly. **One simple oversight could be a big headache down the road if it’s not caught.**
