My conversations the past several weeks have focused on listing: In this market, an agent that can control the listings and have more listing conversations is going to win more easily. Given that, it’s critical for us to be utilizing any tools we have available to us to set us apart.

That’s why I asked James and Mark Western from CityWide Home Loans to join us for today’s conversation. I’m very particular about my partnerships, and the reason I decided to bring them on as our mortgage partners is that they’re incredible businessmen—their ethics, culture, and quality of service are very much in line with our standards, and they constantly bring value to the table.

In addition to introducing James and Mark to you, I wanted to also discuss a particular tool that will set our agents apart when they’re speaking to their clients about their listings: **[ListReports](https://welcome.listreports.com/){: target="_blank"}**. Though it’s been available to our agents for a while, they’re not plugging into it the way I’d like to see.

This is my actionable recommendation to anyone who is looking for tools and resources to enhance your control of your listings: Partner with a CityWide Representative and ask them to help you implement the ListReports tool; they’ll help you set up your account. Then, pull up and look at every report and make a system out of them. Decide what reports you’ll use on which listings, but don’t use all of them.

I want to thank James and Mark for joining me today, and especially for being such a phenomenal resource and partner for our team. They’re truly an asset for us.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us. Until then, make it a great week! Get out there and crush it.
