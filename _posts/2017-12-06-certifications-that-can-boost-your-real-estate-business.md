Today we’re continuing our discussion on how to increase your income in real estate with my third point: add certification to your name.

If you’re going to work with buyers, **I highly suggest you get an ABR (Accredited Buyer Representative) designation.** This is an accreditation or certification that shows that you’ve been trained on how to work with buyers.

What does that mean to buyers? Probably not a whole lot. But **an ABR designation really teaches you the value of a buyer agency agreement** as well as how and why to fill out the form, and how to explain to the buyer the protections you’re giving them when you do that.

If you like working with seniors, then the Senior Real Estate Specialist (SRES) accreditation would be a great one, because seniors will seek someone out who is shown to have that experience.

There are a ton of certifications and designations out there. When you find your area of expertise, **ask yourself if there’s a certain demographic you want to work with as well**—a certain age group, buyers or sellers, etc.

I would really encourage anyone to strive to get those certifications so that you can show your areas of expertise.
