It’s time for part two of our video series on home inspections. [Last time](http://bryandavidgroup.tv/what-to-expect-during-a-home-inspection.html), I talked to homebuyers but today, I have a few inspection tips for sellers.

If you plan on selling your house, **why should you consider getting a home inspection before you put your house on the market?**

The number one reason to get an inspection before listing your home is that you can take care of all necessary repairs before your home hits the market. An inspection costs about $300, and you will be able to know exactly what condition your home is in and take care of about 90% of those repairs.

Every home inspector is a little different. One may find something that another one doesn’t, but you can get most of those repairs taken care of. If there are any major repairs, you can get most of that done on your own time prior to getting an offer.

Now, if you get a great offer on your house without taking care of the inspections and repairs, then the buyer will order their own inspection. I’ve seen many buyers get scared off by an inspection report because they cannot deal with the number of repairs.

If the buyer backs out of the contract after the inspection, you will have to put your house back on the market. Your next offer will probably not be as good as the first offer you had, so you could end up selling your house for thousands of dollars less than the original sale price.

You should also consider the time involved in this process. When you have to put your house on the market, you lose weeks or even months due to those repairs.

**Ultimately, you will have to do the repairs anyway to get the house sold.** Instead of going back on the market and making two or three additional mortgage payments, order that $300 home inspection before your home is on the market. Doing so will save you a lot of time, money, stress, and heartache.

When buyers see that you have already ordered an inspection on the home, they may accept your inspection report. From there, the contract just flies through.

If you have any questions about home inspections or preparing your house for the market, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
