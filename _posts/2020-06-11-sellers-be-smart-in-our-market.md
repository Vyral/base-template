If you’re planning to sell this spring, be careful about making quick decisions.

If you’re a home seller thinking about entering the market this spring, I caution you to avoid making quick decisions and hiring the first Realtor you speak to.

**Experience and reference points matter in this business.** You need to work with an agent who is spending money on marketing, including the use of professional videography, photography, floor plans, and home warranties for each property they sell.

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen sellers leaving money on the table by not doing a simple marketing technique or service that should have been used from the start. Remember that **most properties are going to get the most activity and the best offers in the first couple of weeks after you list it.** You’re in the driver’s seat, so make sure that you’re in a position of strength.

If you’re thinking about selling your home in our marketplace, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. Let’s make an appointment to look at your home, where I can walk you through our selling process. I hope to hear from you soon\!
