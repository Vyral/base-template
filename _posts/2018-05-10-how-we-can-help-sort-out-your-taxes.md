<center>Today’s topic isn’t the most popular, but it’s an important one. Let’s talk about how taxes and real estate can work together.</center>

Today’s topic is a tough one--taxes. We just got back from our accountant and it wasn’t fun, but it’s always important to keep in mind that you have options.

**What kind of options do people have after they’ve seen their tax accountant on tax day?** You may need to sell a home, buy a home, or pay off a mortgage sooner.

<br>A lot of people are afraid of tax laws, but we aren't. **We like to work with CPAs to help work out a plan that allows you to take advantage of the tax laws available**.

We’re not tax accountants, but we know real estate. If you want to create a plan, **we would love to work with your tax person to create a plan that will benefit you** and get you to your final destination (reduced taxes, retirement, investment vehicles). We’ll work hand-in-hand with your tax person to create a plan for you.

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
