Standing out as a buyer can be tough in a seller’s market. Here are three ways to make it easier.

When competing for a home in a seller’s market, you need to do everything you can to help your offer stand out. Here are three surefire ways to make your offer more attractive to sellers in this type of market:

**1. A professionally written offer.** This means no mistakes and no questions left for the listing agent to ask. The No. 1 pet peeve of listing agents is a sloppy offer.

**2. A heartfelt, handwritten letter to the seller.** Explain why you want to buy their house and what it means to you and your family.

**3. A fully underwritten approval.** That’s where we come in.

If you have any questions for us about any of these topics or you’d like to get pre-approved for a mortgage today, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help out.
