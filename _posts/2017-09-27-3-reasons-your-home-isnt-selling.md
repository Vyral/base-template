A lot of things can prevent a home from selling, but there are three of them that are within your control:

**1. Marketing.** This is our specialty. If you don’t have a broker or agent who is marketing your property, it’s likely not going to attract enough demand to sell. Even if you price it extremely low, the home still might not sell if the right buyer doesn’t see it. The higher quality marketing you have, the more reach your listing will have. If your home is out there on a ton of different websites and advertised with professional photography, it will drive demand and encourage more offers.

**2. Condition.** You can have the best marketing in the world but if your home is in poor condition, it’s not going to sell. Decluttering and staging are important tasks to complete. Touching up paint, patching holes, and deep cleaning are also must-dos. The more desirable the condition, the more desirable the home is.

**3. Price.** If you’ve got good marketing and good condition but a ridiculously high price, the home won’t sell. It will just sit on the market. You can reduce the price, or you can wait a few years for a different market and (possibly) more appreciation.

These three things affect your home sale as much as anything else. If you have any questions at all, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you soon.
