Home inspections. Why are they important?&nbsp;

While most homebuyers today see the value of a home inspection, there are still people who would rather save money and not do a home inspection. This is why I would like to talk to you today about why they are important and what they do.<br>&nbsp;<br>When you go under contract, **you typically have one to two weeks to hire a home inspector to come in and evaluate the house.** They can charge anywhere from $300 to $500 depending on the inspector, the size of the home, and what the inspection entails.<br>&nbsp;<br>In my opinion, it is a very important piece of the equation. Unless you are completely home savvy and know everything possible about houses and can do the inspection yourself, **I recommend hiring a professional home inspector.** Sometimes people choose to use a family member or friend, but that person may not look at homes every day like these home inspectors do.

{% include pullquote.html %}A home inspection gives you a top to bottom inspection where they look at the crawl space, plumbing, electrical, the exterior of the home, the foundation, the attic, the appliances, etc., to inspect for any problems. This does a couple of things for you, including letting you know exactly what you are buying.<br>&nbsp;<br>If there are problems, you can either take care of them after you purchase the home or inform the seller of them. Oftentimes you are able to negotiate with the seller to remedy any problem areas before closing so that it is not an issue for you.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you are buying a house that is $200,000 or $300,000, in the grand scheme of things, an inspection for $300 or $400 is a small price to pay for the peace of mind of knowing what you are buying.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you have any further questions about inspections or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to contact me. I would be happy to help you.
