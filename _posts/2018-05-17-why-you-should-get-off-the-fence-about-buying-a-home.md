Everybody is concerned about what is going to happen if interest rates go up.

Well, interest rates have ticked up a little bit since my last video. This increase has actually stimulated the market; it seems like more people are out there looking at homes, which is great. However, **with less inventory on the market and more people looking, it causes buyers to lose buying power.** They have to pay more for a property today than they would have for the same property a month ago.

Let’s take a look at what that actually means, using a $250,000 mortgage as an example.

If you’re qualified for a $250,000 mortgage at a 4% rate over the course of a 30-year term, your monthly payment—principal and interest—would be roughly $1,193. Let’s now assume that interest rates will go up 1%: **that same $250,000 loan would then cost you $1,342, which is $149 more per month.**

If you were approved for that $250,000 loan and the monthly payment of $1,193 was the maximum payment that you could afford, and then the rate increased by 1%, you’d no longer qualify for that amount. You’d end up only qualifying for a $222,000 home—you’ll have lost over $25,000 of buying power.

Ultimately, this shows that when rates go up, homes become more expensive. So **if you’re thinking about buying a home, go ahead and make a move now.** Rates are expected to go up even more this year—not a whole lot at a time, but as we’ve just seen, even a little bit can make a big difference.

If you’re looking to buy, sell, or if you have any questions, feel free to give my team a call. We’d be glad to help.
