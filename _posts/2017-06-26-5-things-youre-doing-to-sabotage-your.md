Seeing a home sit on the market can be frustrating, but there are a few ways to help get it moving. Here are five tips that could make the difference in selling your home.

Seeing a home sit on the market for too long can be a frustrating and confusing ordeal.

As a seller, there a few key things to check when you notice that your home isn’t moving as quickly as you’d like it to.

First of all, you want to look at the price for which you’re listing the home. **Both over- and underpricing your home can have undesirable effects.** When it comes to overpricing, the result could be that your home will receive fewer showings, sit longer on the market, and may compromise your final sales price.

At the same time, underpricing your home may leave you with less money than your home is worth.

Luckily, there are a number of things we can do to help to help you maximize your return.

If your price isn’t the problem, consider taking a look at the condition of your home and how, or if, you have it staged for potential homebuyers. Homebuyers want to see a clean, uncluttered home with good curb appeal when they turn up for showings. Staging your home is one of the best ways to make it look its best in showings and photos alike.

In our highly digital age, listing your home is a much different experience than it once was. This brings us to our next point, which is marketing. Is online content about your home accurate? Is it painting a good picture for potential buyers? **Proper marketing is one of the best ways to generate demand for your property.**

Another factor that can impact the amount of time a home spends on the market is convenience and showability. Having your agent readily available to show your home is extremely important to ensuring that potential buyers don’t feel hassled by the experience of visiting the property. Even if your home is otherwise perfect, it simply won’t sell if it can’t be shown.

The last thing that can help to move a home off the market is style and finish. For example, if all the other homes in the area come equipped with certain updates, like granite countertops, but yours does not, buyers may overlook your home in lieu of a more recently renovated property.
