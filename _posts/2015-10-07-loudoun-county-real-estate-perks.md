Today we are going to be talking about making sure you stay connected to us throughout the year via email. We plan on giving away some really cool things this year and planning some great events for all of our clients, so we don’t want you to miss out on the opportunity!

Our email addresses are TadWicker@WickerHomes.com and DebbieWicker@WickerHomes.com. Make sure you have them in your address book, and make sure your email settings are set up to receive emails from the Wicker Homes Group, so you don’t miss out on the many fun things we have planned.

We have already sent some great opportunities out to our clients this year via email. This year, we had wonderful club level seats to all the Nationals games. Over the last few seasons, we’ve been offering those tickets for anyone who has the opportunity to use them, first come, first serve. In addition to those Nationals tickets, you’ll be the first to know about the events we host throughout the year, like our client appreciation party and many more events that we don’t want you to miss out on.

If you have any questions for us, or any real estate needs whatsoever, we would be glad to help out. Just give us a call or send us an email today!
