**A lot of people have questions about down payments. Today, I’m bringing you some answers.**

Today, we’re going to be talking about down payments. This is a topic that raises a lot of confusion, which is why I’m here to clear up the subject.

One of the main things people ask is, “How much do I need to put down?”

The truth is that it all depends. We need to ask ourselves if we can meet your financial budget, if we can meet your monthly payment requirements, and if we can buy the house you have in mind with the funds you have on hand.

Most of our clients put down between 3% and 10%, but some put down more and others put down less. The amount people put down varies a lot more than some might tend to believe.

We even have programs available that allow you to buy a home for nothing down at all.

Ultimately, we’d love to walk you through the process and determine what route is best for you.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
