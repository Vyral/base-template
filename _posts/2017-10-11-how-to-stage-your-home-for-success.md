There are a lot of things to think about when staging your home for sale. Today, I’ve got a few staging tips that can help you sell for top dollar.

First of all, you need to think about curb appeal. **How does the front of your home look?** A few changes here and there can really set your home apart. Consider a welcome mat to make buyers feel more at home as they enter your property.

Also, **make sure that your yard is clean and well-kept, and that all of your exterior lights are in working order.**

Another tip to consider is creating an inviting ambience in your home. This means you should think about smell, sound, and taste as well as sight. You can engage buyers beyond the visual level by leaving out cookies, playing soft, instrumental music, and having an air freshener plug-in in each room.

Next, **embrace floor space to make rooms appear as large as possible.** Moving furniture away from the centers of rooms, and adding mirrors to smaller spaces can really open things up.

Don’t forget to embrace any unusual or quirky parts of your property. Why not turn a smaller space into a reading nook? The goal is to showcase your home’s potential.

Finally, play up the lifestyle surrounding your home. With our area being so near the beach, **we like to play up this surf and sand lifestyle by adding beach decor to a home.**
