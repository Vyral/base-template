Today we’re continuing our series about the different paths to take in your real estate career and where it’s headed. **Our focus today is the kind of brokerage you want to work for.**

If you’re paying your broker money, there should be an exchange. What are you getting for your money? Ask yourself and ask your broker this. You could get leads, support, staff, or nothing at all. In real estate, the effort is yours and nobody else's.

If it’s a team environment, you usually get a lot, especially if it’s a big brokerage. They often provide leads, structure, and closing assistance. Independent brokerages can be hit or miss, however, so they need to be assessed on a case by case basis.

**There is a model out there for everyone.** If you join our program at Elite Realty Partners, we have a 100% model where you get to keep all of your commissions. If you have any questions about it, I’d love to answer them.

In the meantime, just remember that it’s a lot cheaper to find the right model before you start than after you start. If you have any questions about where to start or what to do, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
