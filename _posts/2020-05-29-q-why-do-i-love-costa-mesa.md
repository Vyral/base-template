*I’m sharing the top five reasons to love Costa Mesa.*

I’m excited to share the five main reasons I love Costa Mesa, California. It has much more than wonderful weather and the yearly Orange County Fair (though those are great too).

**1\. City of the Arts**. Costa Mesa is known as the “City of the Arts.” The Segerstrom Center for the Performing Arts not only includes a 3,000 person opera-style hall for Broadway musicals, but also a 2,000 person concert hall that brings shows and music to the city. It’s an excellent venue to enjoy the very best of Costa Mesa musical arts.

**2\. Conveniently located.** The city has the 405 freeway, 55 freeway, and the 73 toll road. Unlike New York, San Francisco, and London, here, we need a car to get around. However, no matter where you’re trying to go, Costa Mesa has convenient roads to get you there.

**3\. Close to all the beaches.** As a kid, the beach was too far away from where I lived, but in Costa Mesa, no matter where you are, you’re about five miles away from a beach. If you’re looking for sand and waves, they have beautiful Huntington Beach and Newport Beach.&nbsp;

**4\. The South Coast Plaza.** This is the largest shopping mall on the west coast. Originally, it began as a lima bean field. The first department stores were Robinsons May and Bullock’s. Every year, 24 million people shop and dine in the plaza. It’s a fantastic place for retail therapy\!

**5\. Amazing restaurants and bars.** “Mesa” means “table” in Spanish. You could eat at a different restaurant every day of the year and still not have tried everything. There are also plenty of gyms and yoga studios to burn off the delicious calories.&nbsp;
