<p style="text-align: center;"><em>As we wrap up summer, our market is showing signs of slowing down, but this isn’t a cause for concern. Here’s why.</em></p>

Now that we’re in the waning days of summer and the kids are headed back to school, I’d like to give you a quick rundown of how our market usually performs this time of year. The first and second quarters of 2019’s market brought a flurry of activity—sales were up and inventory was down. As summer winds down, though, we traditionally enter into a bit of a cooling period, which we’re beginning to see play out now.

Don’t worry, though: It’s perfectly normal and we’re still selling real estate. In fact, our team put three homes under contract in the last week alone\! Despite the current slowdown, homes are still moving in our market, and after Labor Day, the fall market will be back in full swing.

Whether you’re looking to make a move this year or next, please give me a call. Now’s the time to put together a personalized plan to get your current home sold and your next one purchased. I look forward to talking with you\!<br>&nbsp;
