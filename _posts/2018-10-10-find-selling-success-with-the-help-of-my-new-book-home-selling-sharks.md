<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Following the tips contained in this book and in my seminars will set you on the path to home selling success.</em></p>

If it’s been several years since you last updated your home, you may encounter some issues when it comes time to place it on the market. **This problem, among others, is part of what my new book, “Home Selling Sharks,” seeks to address.&nbsp;**

Much like my Home Selling Shark seminars, this book was specifically designed to help you compete in the market and earn top dollar for your home. Following the tips contained in this book, and in my seminars, will set you on the path to home selling success.&nbsp;

Take, for instance, the listing experience of a recent client of mine. Under my guidance, this client was able to identify and resolve a major problem in their home: Their moldy, unfinished basement. They spent a large sum getting the issues taken care of, **but ultimately found the expense to be well worth it when they sold their property for $29,000 over list price.&nbsp;**

And this is just one example. My book covers many other obstacles (or “sharks”) that sellers might encounter during the listing process.

**In addition to this, the book also details the eight key strategies sellers should employ when they list, which are:**&nbsp;

1. Find a Realtor.&nbsp;<br>2. Get your home pre-inspected.&nbsp;<br>3. Get professional photos.&nbsp;<br>4. Get a room-by-room review.<br>5. Develop a marketing plan.<br>6. Utilize the “coming soon” listing strategy.&nbsp;<br>7. Develop a pinpoint pricing program<br>8. Schedule Saturday showtimes.&nbsp;

All of these tips are described in greater detail within my great new book, so you’ll definitely want to check it out. **To get a copy of your own, simply visit [www.homesellingsharksbook.com.](http://www.homesellingsharksbook.com){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;**
