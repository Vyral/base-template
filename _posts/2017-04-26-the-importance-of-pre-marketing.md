{% include youtube.html %}Does your listing agent do any sort of pre-marketing, sales, or advertising for your home prior to putting it on the market?

Those are important things that can make all the difference in getting your house sold quickly and for top dollar. We specialize in doing just that for our clients. We have vetted carefully chosen national and regional social media sites so that we help them get their house ready for the camera.

We also give our clients a little bit of space between the point that they actually market their home for sale live on the MLS. Prior to that is when we do our pre-marketing so that we can generate some excitement before officially listing the home.

We recently had an example of this occur with one of our clients who is moving out of state later this month. About six weeks ago, we went live on the MLS, but prior to that, we actually helped them get their house ready for the camera and did a lot of pre-marketing for their property on social media.

We generated enough buzz that we had a buyer contact their agent and want to get a preactive showing on the property on a Thursday night. They came back for a second showing, then, and the house was under contract by the time we went to the open house on Sunday.

My sellers were thrilled that they didn’t have to have their house exposed to the market for terribly long. The buyers were also thrilled that they didn’t have to compete with a lot of other buyers.

The next time you’re selecting an agent to help you market your property, remember all that you can accomplish by working with one who does a little pre-marketing.
