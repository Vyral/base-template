Today, I’m here with a quick market update for the first quarter of 2018.

**Right now, homes spend an average of 22 days on the market.** That is up from 12 days last year.

Our median sale price has also gone up from $359,000 to $369,000, and we’re looking at two months of inventory on the market.

So, is it a buyer’s market or a seller’s market? Actually, it’s both, and that is great.

**Our market has started ramping up a bit as the spring selling season approaches.&nbsp;**As a seller, this is a great time to put your property on the market because we have that two-month supply of inventory, which means you will be able to sell quickly and for the highest value in history in the Dallas area.
