So, you want to buy your first home and you’re ready to get out there and start looking at properties. I’m excited for you! I love working with first-time homebuyers. It’s a fun experience, but sometimes it can be a little stressful.

Today I want to share five tips that will help you during the process of buying your first home.<br> <br>**1. Pick a great agent.** You want to work with somebody who takes the time to understand what it is that you are looking for. It is important for them to know your needs and wants. You need to have a great working relationship since you are going to be working with this person for potentially several months.<br> <br>You will also need that person to be someone who listens to you. While Realtors know what you want, they still need to be willing to listen, so don’t work with someone who is pushing you.<br> <br>**2. Establish a plan.** You need to know where you want to be. Other important factors to consider are what kinds of things you want in your home, your commute time to work, or even schools in the area. You should have somebody who understands the areas you’re looking to buy.<br> **<br>3. Determine your financing.** How are you going to pay for this house? A Realtor’s job is not to know about your personal financial situation, but a good agent will have great lending firms they can introduce you to and who you can work with directly. The lender can help you understand the different packages and products to help you pick the right product for you. Then the agent will work with the lender to help you find the right place.

**4. Get to know the neighborhood.** Go out and find what neighborhood you want to be in. While I can give you an idea of the neighborhoods, it is still up to you to decide if you can live in a particular area.<br> <br>I recommend that you walk around at different times of the day and see if a neighborhood is comfortable to you. You should also schedule a visit with the schools, check out the shops, and go to the parks. It will give you a good idea of the community.<br> <br>**5. Understand the pricing and the seller.** A good agent is going to know the pricing in different areas. It can vary greatly, especially in cities. So, you want to make sure that you have an agent that understands the differences between the neighborhoods and how to come up with a comp plan on a particular home.<br> <br>Finally, you want them to understand the seller. Once you find a house, you want to make sure your agent understands the seller’s perspective. What do they want from the house to make sure that we are giving you the best negotiating techniques and tips possible to get you the home that you really want?<br> <br>If you have any questions or would like to sit down and go through a buyer’s consultation, please contact me by phone or email.
