As you may have heard, The Wolek Group has recently made a few additional services available to our seller clients. On top of this, we also occasionally run special offers—one of which being our offer to pay for a pre-listing inspection and appraisal.&nbsp;

We’re already seeing awesome results from this, which is why I wanted to share this update with all of you today. **Yesterday, for example, we helped a client close who had been on the market for seven months without any offers prior to meeting us.** They were financially and emotionally stressed, so when we were able to offer to pay for a pre-listing inspection and appraisal before re-listing their property, they couldn’t have been happier.

When the appraisal came in, we discovered that their house had been overpriced by about $57,000 during their previous listing attempt. This might not be what the seller wanted to hear, but it was important in helping them succeed. **This is exactly why pre-appraisals are so valuable.&nbsp;**

Hopefully, this message has helped open your mind to new ways you could potentially serve your clients. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
