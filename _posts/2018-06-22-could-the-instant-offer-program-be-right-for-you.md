Our instant offer program is not a joke. Here’s how it works and how it could benefit plenty of homeowners.

Today we’re answering a question about our instant offers program. Over the last several years, I’m sure you’ve heard about this program on the radio over the last few years. A lot of people wonder if it’s real. It definitely is.

**This program was borne out of a need that we saw in the community last year.** We went and met with a sweet elderly woman who wanted to sell her home with us. She mentioned to us that she was under a lot of stress about showing the house and keeping her cats out of the way. I happened to be making a move at the time and said, “What if I bought it?” Her eyes immediately lit up, and Toni sold the home to me and I live in it now.

<br>There’s a segment of the population like this. **They don’t have the time, the money, or the energy to prepare and show their homes.** Many are under a time crunch and need to sell quickly. That’s why we created this program.

If you’re interested in the program, here’s what we’ll do. We’ll do a side-by-side comparison of what your home would sell for by us preparing it for top dollar, or a cash offer that can close as soon as seven days. Yes, you’re going to get less money from the investment group, but it might be beneficial in your situation to sell this way. The offer will vary depending on the condition of the home.

If you have questions about selling your home or you’re interested in taking a closer look at our instant offer program, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email anytime. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
