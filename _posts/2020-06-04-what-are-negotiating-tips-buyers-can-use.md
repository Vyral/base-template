<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s how to survive in our highly competitive market as a buyer.</em></p>

It’s still a fast-paced seller’s market out there, so buyers need every bit of leverage they can get. Here are five powerful negotiating tricks to remember when you’re in a multiple-offer scenario and are serious about coming out on top:&nbsp;

**1\. Write a clean contract.** Cross your t’s, dot your i’s, and be sure to include a lender letter and/or proof of funds. Have everything concerning the price and terms clearly spelled out and neatly presented.

**2\. Offer to pay part of the title insurance**. I’ve seen this relatively small financial commitment help buyers win out in a particularly competitive situation.&nbsp;

**3\. Exclude home warranties.** While certainly nice to have, home warranties can sometimes be excluded from the contract to present the seller with an extra incentive for choosing your offer.&nbsp;

**4\. Write a letter to the seller.** Real estate transactions are as sentimental as they are financial; take the time to explain to the seller who you are and why their home—which they loved and treated with care—is a perfect fit for you and your family’s needs.&nbsp;

**5\. Fix small-ticket items.** When it comes to home inspections, it’s always a good idea to negotiate any issues found with costly big-ticket items. However, don’t sweat the small stuff; if you truly want the home, communicate to the seller that you’re more than willing to roll up your sleeves and address the smaller, more manageable issues yourself.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about negotiating or real estate in general, please reach out via phone or email. I would love to help you.
