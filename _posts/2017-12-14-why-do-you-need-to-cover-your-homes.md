Placing an insulated cover over your home’s outside spigots can prevent them from freezing over and possibly causing your basement to flood once you turn them on again in the spring.

One of the easiest, cheapest winter home preparation tips I always recommend is **placing an insulated cover over your home’s outside spigots.**

If left uncovered during the winter, they can freeze over, which can cause your basement to flood once you turn them on again in the spring. Repairing that kind of damage can cost you a couple hundred dollars to fix.

You can buy insulated spigot covers at Lowe’s, Home Depot, or any hardware store for as little as $3. As you can see in the video above, attaching them over your spigot is a simple process.

Most of us are almost done using our spigots anyway, so you might as well do this now. Putting a little bit of money toward your home’s preventative maintenance can go a long way.

If you have any other questions about preparing your home for winter or you’re curious about what’s going on in our Kansas City market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
