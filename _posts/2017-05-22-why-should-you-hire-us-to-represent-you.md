Why hire us as your Realtors?

We are the only company servicing buyers and sellers in the entire Sun Coast area, from Tampa Bay all the way to Charlotte Harbor. We know all the coastal communities and the different lifestyles they bring.&nbsp;

On the buyer side, **we provide our buyers with multiple home search options**, including HD Photo Viewer on our website and direct listing updates right from the MLS.&nbsp;

On the seller side, **we had zero expired listings in 2016**. We offer a no-nonsense, honest evaluation of your home’s market potential, we offer professional photography and ad copywriting, and we do worldwide Internet marketing. We also offer an easy exit listing agreement, which means if you’re not happy at any time, you can cancel your contract with no penalty.&nbsp;
