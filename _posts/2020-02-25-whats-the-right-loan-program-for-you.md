If you’re thinking of buying a home, **there are several different loan programs available to homebuyers, depending on what you qualify for.&nbsp;**

Conventional loans typically need more of a down payment, although there are some loan programs that offer 100% financing, such as the THDA, USDA, and VA loans. FHA loans, meanwhile, only require 3.5% down. If you have more cash to put down, there are conventional loan products you can opt for where you won’t have to pay private mortgage insurance.&nbsp;

A lot of people aren’t aware that you can also qualify for rehab loans, such as the FHA 203k rehab loan. These loans give you the money to fix up a house in the event that you want to buy a fixer-upper. You can qualify with a lower credit score, and they’ll give you the funds to repair the house. Afterward, you can convert your mortgage into a standard FHA loan.&nbsp;

As far as credit score goes, some lenders are willing to go as low as 580, but you may pay a higher interest rate in that case. Speaking of lenders, it’s always a good idea to meet with a local mortgage broker. I know there are plenty of online brokers you can use, but sitting down with a local broker means they can physically show you what your payments will be&nbsp;

**Even if your credit isn’t where you want it to be, it doesn’t take a lot to get it restored.** It all depends on what’s there and how long the process would take. We’ve never turned down anyone for a pre-approval, so if you contact us, we can outline a plan to repair your credit.&nbsp;

With all these programs available, your first step should be to get in touch with a local Realtor. They’ll point you in the direction of reputable lenders who’ll know what will suit your home buying needs.&nbsp;
