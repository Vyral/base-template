There are a couple of things you need to know in order to effectively plan for your first home purchase.

My team and I work with buyers all the time who are three, six, eight, or more months away from buying their home and they always ask us the same thing: “What can I do to get ready?” They wonder if it’s too early to talk to a lender or an agent, and oftentimes feel a little lost in general about how to begin preparing for the process of buying a home.

Whether you’re actively looking for a home or just starting to think about doing so, I’ve got two tips for you that will help you when it comes to planning for your first homebuying experience.

First and foremost you should talk to a lender. There are a few reasons that this is important. Not only will lenders be able to check out your credit and tell you how much you need to improve it if it is too low but they will also walk you through the steps to achieving a better score.

**Even small things like getting a secure credit card can help you get a better interest rate when you do move on to buy your home.**&nbsp;

Lenders will also help you plan your finances by determining a realistic price range based on your current job as well as what you’ll need for your tax returns.

Finally, if you’ve had something like a bankruptcy, foreclosure, or another potentially compromising circumstance it’s a good idea to talk to a lender so that they can talk to you about your best options moving forward.

The next tip is to talk to a real estate professional. First time homebuyers especially need to get in contact with someone who knows the ins and outs of the real estate business. &nbsp;Meeting with an agent can help you figure out a specific plan that you might miss out on if you rely on online resources like Zillow.

Additionally, having an agent to talk to will put you in a better position when it comes to not only finding homes with features you’re looking for but also when it comes times to making smart trade-offs in order to find the best deal for your needs.&nbsp;

**Realistically, no one home will likely check off every item on your list.** An agent will help you to maximize your options while discussing ways to work with your wants and needs. Of course this also depends a lot on the area in which the home is located. A Realtor will know all of these things and will be able to point you in the right direction.

So if you’re a first-time homebuyer looking for the next step in the process we’d love to help. If you have any other questions or want any more information feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
