I’m taking you for an exciting jet ski tour of one of Charleston's most private areas. It’s a property that is exclusive to members and can be seen by water. If you’re thinking it’s downtown, Kiawah, or Daniel Island, you couldn't be more wrong—we’ll be looking at Yeamans Hall Country Club.

This members-only golf course runs along a branch of the Cooper River known as Goose Creek, which is a brackish waterway that’s home to a ton of wildlife and serves as a great spot for fishing. Animals ranging from alligators and dolphins to catfish can be seen here. **The golf course was built on a plantation that was originally owned by Lady Margaret and Sir John Yeamans in the 1700s.**

In 1924, the owners transformed the plantation into an unbelievable golf course. The club was designed to attract wealthy financiers from the north, offering two to 300 home sites with stunning colonial architecture. The beautiful Southern style architecture became so popular, you had to be invited to become a member.

If you get a chance, check out Yeamans Hall Country Club. As always, if you have questions about this piece of paradise or anything real estate related, call or email me. I’m always here to help\!
