If you’re looking to buy a home in the current market, you should be prepared to face a multiple offer situation. Today I’ll give you some great tips on how to make sure your offer is the one accepted and you end up in your dream home.

Getting an offer accepted isn’t always about the price of the house. There are other factors that go into winning a multiple offer situation.

First, you need to consider the seller’s time frame. Find out what their ideal time is to move out of the home and craft that into your offer along with the price. The more you play into the seller’s needs, the better off you will be.

The listing agent is also going to want to know that they are working with a seasoned agent who has a good reputation and a great lender who can get things done on time. Make sure you choose people who are well known and respected to represent you.

If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m always happy to help.
