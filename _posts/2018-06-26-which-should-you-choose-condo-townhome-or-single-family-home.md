Many people ask me whether they should consider a condo or a townhome. Well, at the end of the day, it is really a personal preference as to whether you should consider one of those types of properties instead of a single-family home. If you do consider them, you should know that there are many advantages and disadvantages associated with these types of properties.

**The biggest advantage of owning a condo or a townhouse is the fact that you do not have to worry about expenses related to exterior maintenance.** The upkeep for the exterior of the house is fairly nonexistent. Many people enjoy lower maintenance and utility bills by owning a condo or a townhouse.&nbsp;

Another advantage is that moving to this kind of property provides an easier transition for those moving from an apartment. If you are thinking about buying a single-family home in the future, this is a great intermediary stage.

However, **it is important to remember that there is a price to pay for having the convenience of living in a townhome or a condo.** Monthly homeowners association (or HOA) fees can range from several hundred dollars to over a thousand dollars depending on the complex here in Southern California. And you will want to verify what amenities you are getting for that amount.&nbsp;

Depending on the price of the HOA fees, you may be better off applying that money toward a monthly mortgage payment and purchasing a single-family home instead.&nbsp;

Also, if you are considering a townhome or a condo, make sure your complex has earthquake insurance. Since we live in an active seismic zone, it is critical to have this type of insurance in Southern California. &nbsp;

If you have any questions about this or are interested in talking about buying or selling in general, please feel free to contact me by phone or email. I look forward to speaking with you.
