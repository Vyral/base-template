You want your home to stand out to buyers, but how can you do it without a seemingly unlimited supply of cash? After all, paint, flooring, and furniture can be pricey—**but how are sellers expected to compete without paying a fortune?**

Fortunately, you can prepare your home to sell without blowing all your money. It’s all about the prism of positioning; you want to position your home on the market so you can start negotiating, because negotiation is going to get the most money in your pocket.

**Preparing your home begins with staging.** If you don’t have (or want to spend) the money for shuttling furniture in and out, painting, etc., focus on making your home clean and crisp. People don’t feel good when they walk into a dirty and messy home; a clean one feels a lot nicer.

Next, you’ll need to declutter your home. Instead of paying someone to organize or declutter for you, look around at what needs to go. Keep no more than a couple items on any counter, surface, or table. Everything else needs to be packed up and hidden away. 

Get rid of the personal flairs throughout the house. Remove family photos, your awards, books, and anything else that directs the focus onto you. 

Make the finishing touches by cleaning windows, opening blinds, keeping animals out during showings, removing prints and patterns, and removing any foul odors from the home.

By using these cost-effective methods, you’ll be able to position your home as a great option for buyers. If you have any questions, need more information, or would like to learn other ways to get your home ready, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
