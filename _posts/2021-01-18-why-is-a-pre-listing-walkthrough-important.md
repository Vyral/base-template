<center><em>Before you sell your home, make sure you have a pre-listing walkthrough.</em></center>

<br>**A pre-listing walkthrough is essentially an opportunity for you to look at your home in detail, point out the pros and cons of the property, and uncover any necessary repairs**. A lot can be missed if you don’t schedule one, and that could affect your final sale price drastically.

It’s like creating a game plan for your house. We’re setting the timelines, expectations, etc. for your home sale.

**The pre-listing walkthrough is also key in terms of staging**. Walking through the home helps us get a much better understanding of the home. This step often gets missed in this market, and that’s a disadvantage to homeowners.

**When we are physically in a home and can analyze it this way, we can get a much better idea of the home’s value** and what we can do to maximize the sale price. Agents who miss this step suffer in negotiations.

If you have any questions about this topic or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
