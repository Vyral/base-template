Here at 1000 Calls A Day, how do we keep our remote employees accountable?

Since most of our employees work remotely, I want to explain how we keep our virtual assistants accountable and help them with their time management.

First of all, we have a **workforce monitor.** We just hired our second workforce monitor, and she is amazing. She is in charge of all tech support for our auto dialer and sending performance audits to our clients every month.

All of our clients and VAs also have a **Google chat thread running.** The VA uses the chat to clock in for the day, and we keep track of their breaks from there, depending on which auto dialer we use. If you use some of the professional call center software, then the VA has to insert a reason code if they want to pause the auto dialer for any reason. For example, they can enter codes in for a huddle session, coaching session, or restroom break.

Unfortunately, there are times when a virtual assistant goes MIA. When that happens for the first time, we issue a verbal warning. If it happens a second time, the VA will be removed. **We do not tolerate employees that aren’t accountable virtually.** It’s a very fine line that you have to run.

The management staff has their own chat thread where they keep in touch with one another, team leaders, and the operations staff. They let us know if someone has texted or called in because they are going to be late.

Sometimes, a large-scale event like a typhoon or earthquake can make VAs unavailable. If that happens, I will personally go on our Facebook page and email all of our clients to let you know that some of their VAs might be affected by this event.

That’s how we keep everyone accountable at 1000 Calls A Day. If you have any other questions or would like to learn more about 1000 Calls A Day, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
