Here are the five commandments you need to follow if you’re buying a home:&nbsp;

**1. Don’t apply for new credit.** You’d be surprised at how many times people apply for new credit without even realizing it. It could be for something as simple as signing up for a Best Buy credit card so you can save 10% on future purchases. If you apply for new credit during the home buying process, your lender will have to pull your credit, which you don’t want.&nbsp;

**2. Don’t make any large deposits into your bank account.** If you make a large deposit, your lender will have to verify where that money came from.&nbsp;

**3. Don’t change jobs.** If there’s a better opportunity out there for you that you want to take advantage of, that’s fine; just don’t do it until after you’ve closed on the loan for your new home.&nbsp;

**4. Don’t buy a new car.** If you make this type of purchase, it can delay the purchase of your home or prevent it from happening at all.&nbsp;

**5. Don’t buy any new furniture.** I know it’s easy to get excited about having new furniture for your home, but don’t start shopping for couches and loveseats until after the deal has closed.
