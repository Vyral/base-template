Many candidates have difficulty closing an interview. Here are three of the most effective ways to end the interview and impress the hiring manager:
<br>
<br>**1. Ask if there is anything else you can provide.**How do you phrase that question? Simply say, “Is there any additional information I can provide to help you make this decision?” They may ask you to clarify an earlier answer, provide work samples, or give them your references.
<br>
<br>**2. Ask questions about the opportunity and the company.**I cannot stress how important this is. Asking questions shows that you are interested in the opportunity and have done some research prior to the interview. Write down at least five questions before the interview. Inevitably, the hiring manager will answer the majority of your questions, so having them written ahead of time will give you something to fall back on.

<br>
<br>**3. Ask about the next steps in the interview process.** Ask what the next steps are and what the timeline looks like. That way, you can manage your expectations by knowing the hiring manager’s exact process. This question also gives you a reason to follow up with the hiring manager if you have not heard back from them in the time period they promised.
<br>
<br>These three questions will definitely help you close the interview and make a positive impression on the hiring manager. If you have any other questions about preparing for the interview process, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
