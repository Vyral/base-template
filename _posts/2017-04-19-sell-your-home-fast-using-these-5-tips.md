When selling your home, you want to make sure you sell quickly and for the most money. I’ll go over five tips that will help you do just that.

1. Update your landscaping. Curb appeal is crucial. When we take exterior photos, which is the main presentation that we have online, you want to make sure the beds are clean and the landscaping looks good in order to attract the greatest amount of buyers.

2. Move out of the house or make it appear as though you’re moved out. Declutter and rent a storage facility to store all of your belongings. Buyers want to be able to picture their own things in a home, which is much easier when your things aren’t there.

3. Add fresh paint or flooring as needed. If you don’t have neutral colors, have the house painted to make it look fresh. If your carpet is old, replace it.

4. Utilize professional photos and video. These are the best ways to attract buyers and get them to want to see a home in person.

5. Price your home to sell. Make sure you are staying competitive with your neighbors or even offering a better deal.

If you have questions about selling your home or if you have any other real estate questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
