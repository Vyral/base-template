If you’re looking at a home to purchase, you may be wondering why the seller is moving on. It’s easy to think that there might be something wrong with the property you don’t know about, but in reality, that’s probably not your seller’s motivation. Most people move due to new life circumstances, like marriage, a new job, or wanting to be closer to family.&nbsp;

**At the end of the day, what truly matters is what you want out of your new home.** If you have questions about this or anything else, please feel free to call or email me. I am always willing to help!
