The fall is a great time to buy and sell real estate in Tahoe/Truckee. Inventory is low, and buyers and sellers alike are looking to get a deal done soon.

The fall is one of my favorite times to buy and sell real estate. Inventory has started to drop off, and buyers who are purchasing seem more motivated in getting a deal done before the winter. The same goes for sellers.

Right now, we have 1,002 homes on the market in Tahoe/Truckee, with 626 of them being single-family homes. This number is actually up from last year, when there were only 473 homes for sale.

The average sales price right now is $950,000, which is up significantly from the average of $849,000 that we saw at this time last year. That’s a big jump. **In certain neighborhoods, we are seeing even more interesting trends.**

Last year during the month of September in Tahoe Donner, we saw 23 homes sell. Last November, we saw 30 home sales in Tahoe Donner. This last month, we had 38 properties sell. With only 70 homes currently on the market, this is great news for sellers in Tahoe Donner.

In Lahontan, there were over 25 homes for sale last year. Right now, there are only 15 homes for sale there. Inventory in certain markets is dwindling down to almost nothing.

**If you are a buyer right now, there are some really good deals.** There are sellers out there who would really like to get a deal done before winter. As a seller in this market, your competition is way down.

If you’re interested in buying or selling in the Tahoe/Truckee area, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.
