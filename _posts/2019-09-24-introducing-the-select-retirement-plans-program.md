If you currently have a typical 401(k) or 403(b) retirement plan, then you are almost certainly named as your plan’s trustee, and someone at your place of work has the task and privilege of serving on an investment committee as a fiduciary for your plan’s filing.&nbsp;

But this isn’t the only option. **After two years of hard work, I have developed a new, game-changing program called Select Retirement Plans.** This program, which offers a 401(k) and 403(b) option, uses a one-step process to reduce fiduciary risk and save you approximately 100 hours of administrative work. This plan also allows you to remove your company’s name off the document as the plan administrator, and instead have a 401(k) or 403(b) expert sign on your behalf and attest to the accuracy of your plan’s 5500 Form filing.&nbsp;

To top it all off, this program’s fees are typically 20% to 30% lower than the national average for similarly sized plans.&nbsp;
