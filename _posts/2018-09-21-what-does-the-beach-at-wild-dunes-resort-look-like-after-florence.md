Take a look at the coast in my video.

Today I wanted to give those of you who haven’t already seen it a glimpse at what the beach looks like following Hurricane Florence. Looking at the shore about 20 minutes from high tide, you can see **places in the sand where ridges were breached** by the storm’s massive waves.

The shoreline I visited during this update sits just beside the Grand Pavilion at Wild Dunes Resort, but I’m sure other areas of the coast are in a similar condition. To see my full message, watch this short video.&nbsp;
