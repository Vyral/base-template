*We’ve had an incredible year, thanks to all of you. With the little time we have left, I’d like to talk about an opportunity we have for you that will help a lot of kids.*

Thank you all for an incredible 2017! &nbsp;We had the opportunity to **serve over 367 happy clients,** and we wanted to thank you for helping us hit our goal of serving people and saving kids by selling real estate.

We had a big goal for saving kids; we wanted to earn $1 million, and we’re a little over $920,000. **We have an incredible opportunity for you.**&nbsp;If you know anyone who is thinking about buying or selling real estate in the next 10 days, contact us. Our traditional 10% that we give back to the organization is now going to be 100%. That’s right: 100%! Why is that? Because we really want to hit that million-dollar goal.

Most of all, thank you so much for coming out and seeing us two weeks ago at our client appreciation event and free Christmas tree giveaway. **We gave more than 200 trees away,** and over 400 people braved that terrible weather.

We can’t say it enough: **Thank you so much for allowing us to fulfill our mission.** It’s been an incredible year, and I can’t wait for 2018.

In January, we’ll talk about the new tax rules for real estate and what 2018 holds in store for our Portland/Southwest Washington real estate market.

If you have any questions at all, feel free to contact me or my team. We’d be honored to help you. Until next year, have a merry Christmas and a happy New Year!
