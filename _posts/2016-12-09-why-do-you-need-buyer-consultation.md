We are very excited to be joined today by Libby Sanders, our lead buyer’s agent, who is going to talk a little bit about buyer consultations and the role that they play in preparing those who are in the market to purchase a home.

**A buyer consultation is where a buyer meets with their buyer’s agent for the first time.** This is where your agent will go through the entire process with you, detailing the ins and outs of the whole process. It’s also an opportunity for you to ask any questions you have and get to know an agent to determine if they are a good fit.

It would make sense to have this meeting in a setting where the emotions are low-key. The ideal time is before you begin the search process. **You don’t want to just be meeting an agent when you’re under the gun and emotions are high.**

If you’re someone who thinks they will just call the agent on whatever sign they come across to help them buy, you might want to think again. Those agents work for the seller, not you, and they have the seller’s best interests at heart. Hiring a buyer’s agent will give you someone on your side who will have your best interests in mind.

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
