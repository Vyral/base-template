<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Need some help figuring out your taxes this year? Stay tuned for today's message.</em></p>

For today’s message, I’m joined by local tax professional Issam Aljaber of Advisory, CPA. We’re delighted that he’s here to give us some special insight into tax season for this year.&nbsp;

The enactment of the 2017 tax act gave rise to a lot of questions concerning how this legislation would affect taxpayers, and **it remains a topic of interest in the present**, according to Issam.&nbsp;

He says that taxpayer concerns are rooted in questions like, “Was the right amount of deductions applied?” and “Should my taxes be filed as standard or itemized?” He even says that many people are so surprised by their returns, they’re reluctant to believe their taxes were done accurately! But, as Issam points out, the fact is **90% of all Americans will pay less in taxes this year.&nbsp;**

As you ready your tax information, Issam has some advice: **Stick to a licensed professional—especially if your tax situation is complicated enough to warrant itemized deductions.** In this case, he notes, there are some ideal scenarios that you’ll want a professional to help you explore and sort through this tax season.

However, if you’re a simple filer (single status with one income), services like TurboTax may be sufficient for the job.&nbsp;

If you have any tax-related questions or you have yet to file and you’re looking for a tax preparer, give Issam a call at 818-245-8135 or visit his company website at AdvisoryCPA.com.

If you have any real estate-related questions or need help with any of your real estate concerns, you can contact me as well. I look forward to hearing from you!
