I was recently asked the question, “Should I list my home now or wait until spring?” I thought I’d offer my answer up today if you’ve been wondering the same thing.

Mortgage interest rates are still hovering around 4% for now, but the National Association of Realtors predicts they will go up three or four times this year. Once they reach 5%, we will start to see downward pressure on home values. **So the answer is yes, you should put your home on the market as soon as you’re able to if you plan on selling anytime in the next year.**

Another factor that makes now a perfect time to sell is the fact that inventory is incredibly low right now. In Jacksonville, depending on your price range, we have very low inventory. Other sellers have not brought their homes on the market yet. **That’s why you should get ahead of the market by listing now and taking advantage of these conditions.**

A balanced market is pretty rare, but that’s kind of what we’re seeing right now. Sellers can put their home on the market and get top dollar while still being able to find affordable inventory.

Listing now will help you net the most money possible. If you want to learn how we can help and what we’ll do to get your home sold, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help.
