  Today I’m taking a close look at all the different Waterfront markets. First,
  we’ll take a look at Flathead Lake. There are a ton of condos selling in this
  market, which is bringing down the average sale price. In places like Echo and
  Swan Lake, we’re seeing quite a few sales over that $1 million mark. To get
  all the latest details on these waterfront markets, watch this short video.
