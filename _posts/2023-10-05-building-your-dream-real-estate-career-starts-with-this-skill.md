Starting a career in real estate can be ironic. After completing your licensing process and gaining a wealth of information, including facts like the number of square feet in an acre, the sections in a township, the composition of the real estate commission, and how to calculate mortgage payments, you might feel well-prepared.

However, when you join a new brokerage, they hand you forms and business cards, and suddenly, you may find yourself wondering, "What's my next step?" **The critical skill needed to succeed in real estate is the ability to connect with people effectively, engage with clients, properly assess their needs,** and guide them through meaningful conversations about real estate.

This is the foundational training we provide on my team – teaching you how to communicate with clients. Because, let's face it, knowing how to fill out a real estate contract won't matter if you don't have clients. Let's focus on what truly counts.

If you want to learn how to connect with clients effectively or just have any real estate questions, call or email me. I’m happy to help.
