  Here are a few reasons why that might be a mistake.

In my last blog, I talked about a few of the reasons why I think it’s a better idea to sell now than in the spring. A lot of clients in our are are “snowbirds.” This means that they don’t live in Wisconsin from November through April or May. **Here are three reasons why the snow birds out there should also consider selling their home now as opposed to when they get back in the spring:**

**1. There is less hassle for you.** You’re gone. You only have to get your house ready to show when you leave. You don't have to constantly clean and get out of the home for showings at the drop of a hat.

**2. Your home is more accessible.** When you're not there, we can show your home at a moment’s notice to a buyer who is ready, willing, and able to make an offer. The more eyes we can get on your home, the better.

**3. We can delay the closing until you get back.** You don’t have to go through the entire sales process when you’re gone. If we get an offer, accept it, and finalize a deal, we can delay the closing and occupancy until March, April, or May.

If you have any questions for us or any thoughts about buying or selling your home this winter, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
