If you are planning on buying or selling a home, should you work with a solo agent or a real estate team?

Working with a team is very important because it gives you the best shot at reaching your real estate goals. If you’re a buyer, a buyer’s agent with a team behind them has the time and energy to focus on finding your perfect home. Every morning, our buyer’s agent scours the MLS for properties that match your preferences and sets appointments on your behalf.

Individual agents will be busy taking listings and doing paperwork for other clients. As a result, they will not be as attentive to the MLS and might miss your perfect home. Sometimes solo agents can get so overwhelmed that you will be lucky to find anything you like on the MLS.

When you’re selling, work with a listing agent who has a team behind them. These listing agents are able to work solely on your behalf. They won’t be distracted by representing buyers and finishing tedious paperwork like an individual agent would be.

Teams are also made up of specialists who work to ensure that each part of the transaction is handled well and in a timely matter. For instance, our team has a marketing specialist whose only job is to maximize your listing’s online presence and get your home in front of as many buyers as possible. Our team also has a dedicated transaction coordinator to handle all of that tedious paperwork.

There is a lot to the home selling and buying process. Many new individual agents get buried in paperwork and other behind-the-scenes tasks, which makes them unable to fully service their clients. Today’s market is awfully complex, which makes it all the more crucial that you hire a specialized team to handle your real estate needs.

If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. My team and I would be happy to help you!
