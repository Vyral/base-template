Interest rates are extremely low in our current market, which means now is a great time for homeowners to refinance. According to Jeff Martin of Fiber Mortgage, my guest in today’s video, there are four main benefits to doing this.&nbsp;

First of all, **you can lower your monthly mortgage payments.&nbsp;**

Second, **you can decrease the terms of your mortgage.** Jeff, for example, has owned his home for two years, and he was able to shave eight years off his mortgage when he recently refinanced.&nbsp;

Also, since most homeowners use an escrow account for their monthly tax and insurance payments, **refinancing allows you to get a rebate on your current escrow balance,** which can amount to upwards of a couple thousand dollars.&nbsp;

Lastly, **it gives you a longer period of time to make your next mortgage payment.**&nbsp;

If you have any more questions for Jeff about the benefits of refinancing, you can give him a call at (904) 878-2488.

As always, if you have any other real estate questions for me, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’d be happy to help you.
