It’s been a while since we’ve updated you on the market, so we wanted to give you one today as we head toward summer. Right now in the Anchorage municipality, **we have just 0.92 months of available inventory in all price ranges up to $2 million.**

As of the filming of this video, we have 562 homes under contract. It’s not that we aren’t getting any listings, it’s just that the listings we get are selling so fast. We recently listed a home that got 15 offers and sold for $115,000 over list price in just a few days. Our average sale price in Anchorage is just under $424,000 and our average list-to-sale price ratio is 100%.

**If you’re thinking about selling your home, you’re not going to find a better market than this.** Interest rates are starting to rise, which might slow the market down and push some buyers out.

If you have any questions for me about selling, buying, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
