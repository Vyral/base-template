  The advantage of a team is that they have people hired specifically to make

What are the differences between individual agents and teams? Today I am going to tell you about the advantages and disadvantages of both.

Most agents work individually. They work for a brokerage and run their business by themselves. The brokerage provides support for paperwork, answering phones, making appointments, and more.

Teams, however, normally have an admin or two who focuses on those kinds of tasks. When you hire an agent from a team, you are hiring that entire group or professionals.

Also, **you will pay the same commission regardless of whether you are hiring a team or an individual agent.**

With only so many hours in the day, **an individual agent may have trouble providing enough attention where needed.** They may also lack the necessary expertise on all various subjects within the transaction for it to go smoothly.

Working with an individual agent will most likely afford you more one-on-one time, but it will also cause you to lose out on the level of service a team could provide. You wouldnâ€™t expect to see a doctor or a lawyer answering their own phones and scheduling appointments. You would expect that to fall under the responsibilities of other professionals on their team. **This is also true in real estate, where everyone has a specific role to play.**

While you can see that there are a lot of advantages to hiring a real estate team as opposed to an individual, the decision is still yours. If you think that a team setting is what you are looking for and would like to speak with me about my team buying or selling your home, please feel free to call or email. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
