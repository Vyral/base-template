People often ask whether having solar panels can boost your home value, so let’s get to the bottom of this common question, today.

The first major thing to consider is whether you own the panels. If you’re leasing them, you’ll need to transfer the lease agreement to the buyer.

Oftentimes, such as in the case of a buyer we recently worked with, this can put a damper on the deal. **These lease agreements tend to be matched to the circumstances of the original owner, so the presence of solar panels can actually sometimes hurt a home’s value.**

If you already own the solar panels on your home, the potential for them to add value is much higher. However, solar energy is a personal preference.

Not all buyers will be interested in this home feature. So if you plan to purchase solar panels, do so for your own personal use. **There are many other ways to add value to your property, assuming that is your goal.**
