People often ask me, “When should I call you if I’m looking to sell?”

Call me now. You want a professional Realtor with you so that we can create a plan of what you need to do, book photographers, and schedule with the appraiser.

**In a market like this, there may be a lot less you need to do to sell your home, but you still want your home to look amazing.** There may be some repairs that you think you need to do that no one would even notice during a showing. Likewise, there'll be other things that I notice that you may not. Having somebody like me who works with buyers will tell you exactly what you need to do and help you be efficient.

When you're ready to sell, call me, and let's work together to create a strategy to get your home on the market. If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you and answer any questions you may have.
