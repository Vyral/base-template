You might cringe at the mention of the word, but at its roots, **accountability is a process and a mechanism by which we can get better**. &nbsp;It’s not about taking blame or feeling ashamed of yourself, but rather accepting the truth of whatever we’re working through and accepting our piece in it. And it’s relevant in all areas, whether you’re a coach, spouse, or business partner.&nbsp;

Is there anything that you’re not as accountable for as you need to be in order to have a breakthrough and grow to the next level? This week, I encourage you to find at least one area where you can achieve a higher level of accountability. Take a partner if you think you need to.

If you have any questions or need help diving deeper into this topic, give me a call. I’d love to talk through it with you.
