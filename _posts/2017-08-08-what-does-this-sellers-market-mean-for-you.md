{% include youtube.html %} Today I wanted to give you an update on the real estate market here in Boynton Beach. A common question I get, even when I'm out with family and friends, is: "How is the real estate market doing?"
<br>
<br>**Due to low inventory and interest rates being at a record low, right now it is a seller’s market.**If you’re a seller and you’re looking to move, now is the best time to list your property. There are not a lot of homes available and the ones that are in great condition and are priced right go pretty quickly.
<br>{% include pullquote.html %}
<br>If you’re a buyer in this market, you need to be a little bit more aggressive. Do your research before you make a decision and make sure you’re seeing the right homes that you can afford. More importantly, if you find a home you like, don’t wait to put an offer on the home. If you decide to sleep on the decision, you may find that the home has already been taken by another more eager buyer.
<br>
<br>**Make sure that you hire a Realtor.** We know the market and the local area, and we can sometimes find you homes that haven’t even been listed yet. That’s what we’re here for—to help you find the right home for you and your family.

If you have any questions or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, please give me a call. I’m always happy to help!
