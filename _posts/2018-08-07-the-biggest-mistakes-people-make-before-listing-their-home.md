There are two major mistakes home sellers sometimes make before listing. So if you plan to put your home on the market, be sure to avoid these easy-to-make errors.

The first is **making the wrong repairs**. Sellers often assume they need to make repairs to their home before listing it, which is mostly true, but I always advise consulting with a professional before deciding what to repair.

A couple of times, I’ve walked into kitchens of home sellers who proudly told me that they just refinished their cabinets. Unfortunately, just by looking at those cabinets, I could tell that they refinished them themselves instead of hiring a professional to do it. This kind of thing will hurt your home’s value rather than help it. All that time, energy, and money they spent was wasted.

The second mistake sellers make is **misjudging their current home’s value when they try buying their new home before selling.** If your current home’s value isn’t what you anticipated or you list it with the wrong Realtor, it will sell for a lower price and put you in a tight spot financially.

If you’re thinking of making a move, always consult with a professional first. Our team would be happy to give you a free consultation if you’re ready to put your home on the market.
