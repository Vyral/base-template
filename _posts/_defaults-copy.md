How long does it typically take to close on a home?

Our average real estate transaction is financed through the bank and generally takes between 35 and 45 days to close. This includes your inspection timeline, the appraisal, and all the documents the lender will require from you.

Cash transactions are far quicker and usually only need about five to 20 days. If there’s a tenant living in the home you choose to buy, it can significantly increase the time to close. I’ve seen transactions go from 90 to 180 days just because of the tenant.
