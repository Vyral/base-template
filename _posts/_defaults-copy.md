excerpt: 'How’s the Wasatch Front real estate market been doing these last two months? Single-family homes are entering market much more slowly than homebuyers would prefer. There are a lot more homes going off the market than coming onto it. Inventory is low for single-family homes, condos, and townhomes. To learn more about the state of our market and what you should do as a buyer or seller to take advantage of these conditions, watch my latest video.'

We’re excited to announce our team’s latest endorsement. This one comes from nationally syndicated radio host Glenn Beck. **He had some great words to say about our team and about our home sale guarantee program.**

{% include pullquote.html %}

In case you haven’t heard of it, here’s how it works. We guarantee to sell your home at a price and deadline that you agree to or we are going to buy it ourselves. **We sell a home every two days,** and have a large network of buyers that are looking for a home right now. We make this promise because we know we have the systems in place to keep it.

To hear the full radio endorsement, listen to the clip above.
