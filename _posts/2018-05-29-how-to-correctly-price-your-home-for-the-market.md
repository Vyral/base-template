*If your home is for sale, it needs to be priced correctly, not at an oddball number like $399,999. It all boils down to price bracketing.*

Today, I want to talk about price bracketing.

It drives me nuts to see how all these real estate brokers price their houses in the market. Wal-Mart uses a pricing system where they price everything at $9.99. Some brokers took that strategy into the real estate market, so we’ll see homes priced at $399,985. It’s a mistake to price your house like that.&nbsp;

Instead, we use price bracketing.&nbsp;

**For example, let’s say your house is worth roughly $400,000.** If you priced your home at $405,900, you'd be making a mistake. The buyer who might have paid you the most amount of money or even over list price never saw your home because they stopped looking at houses at $400,000.

Most people get approved up to even numbers. In the $300,000 to $500,000 range, they usually get approved up to $325,000, $425,000, or $525,000. If you priced your home at $399,999, that would also be a mistake because of all the buyers searching for homes from $400,000 to $450,000.&nbsp;

I don’t know why agents are pricing homes at $399,999 or other oddball numbers, because **that’s not how buyers search for homes online.**&nbsp;
