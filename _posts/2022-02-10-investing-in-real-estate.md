I'll let you in on a little secret: Real estate is the absolute best investment that you can make for the next three to six months.

Despite the two-year pandemic, the real estate market in the US has been stronger than ever. In the Charleston area, we have around 1,100 homes for sale right now. In a steady market, we'd have 5,000 homes for sale.&nbsp;

**Real estate is a great investment because with the reduced inventory, it's almost impossible for prices to fall within the next three to six months.** Inventory would have to quadruple for us to go back to a steady market. Global concerns like the pandemic didnâ€™t create a large shift in the real estate market, so that's why the next three to six months is the perfect time to buy or sell real estate and take advantage of this unique market.

If you have any questions, visit my website and reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
