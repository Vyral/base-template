Hi everyone, welcome back to my video blog. I wanted to bring up a question being asked by a lot of my seller clients. They want to know ‘should I be present during showings?’

A lot of seller clients think they may know about their home or know what to tell a buyer when they are looking. The truth is, though, often having the seller present can make the buyer and/or their agent uncomfortable.

We typically recommend being gone during the showing. The buyer will take longer to walk through, they’ll ask more questions and they’ll give honest feedback.

Another tip for showings is to make sure all the lights are on and the blinds open. You want as much natural light as possible.

So, again remember to leave your home during a showing. Let the agent sell for you.
