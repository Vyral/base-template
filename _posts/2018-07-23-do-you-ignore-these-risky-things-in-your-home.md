  Are you paying attention to your homeâ€™s emergency warning signs? If you are
  not, you may be creating unnecessary risks for yourself. For example, not
  paying attention to the state of your hot water heater could result in it
  rusting and causing water damage through your home. The good news is this can
  easily be fixed before it causes expensive damages. To learn more, watch my
  latest video.

Do you know about the risks in your house that you may be ignoring but probably should not be? Many of us walk by our home's emergency warning signs because they have been there for a while. We do not see what can become a serious and pricey repair. This is why I want to share with you the three red flags you do not want to miss.

**1. Old hot water heaters can fail and flood your house.** Most here in the Memphis area are in the attic, which can be a problem since water always follows gravity. A rusty pan or bottom of the heater indicates the beginning of serious deterioration. Pan alarms and automatic shut-offs can be purchased for about $125 to $150 from Lowe's and Home Depot.

**2. Clogged gutters.** Full gutters from fall leaves and debris create wood rot behind the gutter which can be a very costly repair. Gutters can be flushed out with a garden hose or you can hire a professional.

**3. Dirty dryer vents.** Lent is highly flammable. The danger signal is when it starts to take longer to dry your normal load. This means that the dryer lint has started to clog the vent pipe. The best solution is to take an old t-shirt and connect it to a long wire that can be pulled through the dryer vent from the outside toward the dryer. If your dryer vent is on the roof, you will need to open the vent in the attic and clean both up and down until you get back to the dryer.
