If you're buying a home at any point, you'll have to deal with a home inspection. So who chooses the inspector? What do they look for? How do you know if they're right for you?

**Want to Sell Your Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.com/list/" target="_blank">Get the Value of Your Central or Southwest Virginia Home</a>
**Looking to Buy a Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.net/" target="_blank">Search All Homes on the MLS</a>

There are some important things you need to know about a home inspection. **If you've ever bought or sold a home or you plan on buying a home at any point in the future, you'll deal with an inspector at some point.**

So who chooses the home inspector? It's simpleâ€“you do. I highly suggest that before choosing one, you call them and ask them some questions. You want to ask what they will check, whether they will actually get on your roof and check it, whether they have a septic or sewer camera, whether they do thermal imaging, etc. **You need to ask them whether they will look at something you're concerned about; don't just assume they'll do it.**

Not all home inspectors are created equal, just like not all real estate agents are created equal. Since it's your right to pick your home inspector, you need to pick the one that's right for you.

If you have any other questions about home inspectors or how to choose the right one for your specific situation, give me a call. I'd be happy to walk you through it.

Additionally, if you or anyone you know is thinking about buying or selling a home in the Roanoke area, give me a call or send me an email. I'd love to work with you!
