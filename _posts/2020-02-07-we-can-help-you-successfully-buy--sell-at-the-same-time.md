<center>Having to buy and sell a home at the same time has been called the &lsquo;catch-22&rsquo; of real estate. Here&rsquo;s how we can help you solve that dilemma with ease.</center>

&nbsp;

many clients want to know, “How do I sell my home and buy the next one at the same time?” Here’s how we help our clients out every step of the way.

**There are two common ways that we typically go about it.** The first option is to sell your home first, and find temporary housing while you look for your next home. The second is a concurrent close, where your home sale closes at the same time as your purchase.

**Before you attempt either of these methods, there are a few things you should know.** First, make sure to review your finances by sitting down with a lender and getting pre-approved. Then, we can sit down together to determine how much your home is worth in today’s market and what you can get for your sale, so you know exactly how much equity you’ll take from your sale to purchase your new home.

Finally, we’ll decide which strategy to take: sell first, then buy, or plan for a concurrent sale. If you decide to sell first and buy later, the good news is that you’ll know exactly how much equity you’ll have from the sale to put down on your next home. You’ll need to consider interim housing, whether that involves a short-term lease on another property, a leaseback on your current property, or moving in with family or friends for a little while.

**Buying and selling at the same time can certainly be done, but it does take some extra planning and flexibility.** It’s important that your home is show-ready when it hits the market so we can sell it quickly and find your new home at that time.

If you have any questions for me about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I would love to hear from you.
