Today, buyer agent specialist Mike Neidlinger is here to offer some insight on whether it’s better to buy a home or rent a home.

There are many people out there who haven’t purchased a home because they fear the obligation of paying a mortgage.

**However, whether you are buying or renting, you are paying for someone’s mortgage.** It’s better to purchase a home and pay off your own mortgage rather than paying for your landlord’s. You are already committed to paying for housing, and paying your own mortgage will increase your credit over time.

There are many times when we sit down with a potential buyer and discover that they have spent years and years paying someone’s else’s mortgage. That’s thousands of dollars they’ve paid to benefit someone else. So, why not benefit yourself?

Many clients fear that their credit isn’t good enough or they lack the funds for the down payment. However, you need to invest in yourself and make the commitment to go forward and get a mortgage.
