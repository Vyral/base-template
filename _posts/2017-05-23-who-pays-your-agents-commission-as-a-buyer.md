When you work with a buyer’s agent, do you have to pay them commission?

**Believe it or not, the answer is no.** The buyer’s agent’s commission has already been figured out and agreed upon by the seller.

A lot of first-time homebuyers may worry that their Realtor’s commission will cut into their savings for the down payment. Some homebuyers even skip hiring a buyer’s agent for that reason. However, that’s the beauty of hiring a buyer’s agent: when it’s all said and done, the seller pays for your agent’s commission.
