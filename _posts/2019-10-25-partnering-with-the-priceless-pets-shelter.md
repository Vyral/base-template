Recently we partnered with Priceless Pets, a no-kill shelter, at a local community event. As a team, the only thing we enjoy more than helping people find homes is helping pets find homes. I interviewed Becca to assist in explaining what Priceless Pets is all about.&nbsp;

***“Priceless Pets’ motto is ‘Saving one by one until there are none.’*** *So, I feel strongly about finding pets great homes as well. We love to work with community partners to help our animals find the right home, just like those in real estate help families find the right home. We are a&nbsp; 100% no-kill shelter. We have dogs and cats mostly, but we do get some rabbits, turtles and other great animals as well.”*

*"We accept volunteers, donations, and 'of course' adoptions. All of our animals are spayed, neutered, microchipped, and have their shots. We love them all, they all have wonderful personalities, and rescuing is a strong choice to save a life. Our animals are unique, many of them are potty trained and trained in other ways."*

**At 1:25 in the video above****, you'll see****&nbsp;some footage from our event,** complete with cute animals that can be adopted today\!&nbsp;

For more information about Priceless Pets or anything concerning real estate feel free to reach out to us by phone or email, we would be happy to help you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
