  If you’re getting ready to sell your home, don’t list it with a “yes-man”.
  Instead, list it with an agent who will tell you what you need to hear.

The other day, I met with a seller who has their home listed on the market with another agent but isn’t making any progress on their sale. When I looked around their house, I saw that it was dirty, cluttered, and unstaged. On top of that, it was overpriced.

This seller's home has been on the market for a couple of months. After I was done looking around, they asked me why their listing agent didn't tell them what they needed to know to get their home sold. They also asked what they could do moving forward.

If you’re getting ready to put your home on the market and you don’t want to end up in this same situation, don’t list it with an agent who’s just going to stick a sign in the yard and write a number on it. **Work with someone who has your best interests in mind and will tell you what you need to know about the market, how to position your home in the market, and how to price it.**

In other words, don’t work with a “yes-man.” Find out what you need to know, not what you want to hear.

If you need an agent who will tell you what you need to know to sell your home quickly and for top dollar, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d love to help you.
