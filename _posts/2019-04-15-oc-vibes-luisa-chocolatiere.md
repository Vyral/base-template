You’re in for a sweet treat today. **For this episode of “OC Vibes,” we’re here at Luisa Chocolatiere** to show you how happiness is something you can eat at this magical place. This is one chocolate factory you don’t need a golden ticket to get inside of.

Luisa has an amazing story. To keep it simple: She was born in Mexico, moved to California, worked as an accountant, and eventually became a French-trained chocolatier. **She studied under a master chocolatier in Paris after culinary school and learned how to handle chocolate in many different ways.**

Luisa originally started doing wedding favors for brides. **From there, it went to corporate favors, then to holiday chocolates for Christmas, Passover (their chocolate is kosher), Valentine’s Day, and more.**

Luisa specializes in custom work and has a collection of over 1,700 molds. All of their chocolate is unique, handmade, and absolutely delicious. **They only use pure American chocolate.**

This art is going out of fashion around the world, but Luisa is keeping it alive. They’re located right in Laguna Hills at 26491 Cabot Road, Suite \#106, and you can even order online at <u><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.luisachocolatiere.com/store/">www.luisachocolatiere.com</a></strong></u>.
