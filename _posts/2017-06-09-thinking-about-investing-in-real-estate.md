A few of my clients have been speaking with me recently about the fact that the stock market is at an all-time high and they are worried that a market correction is imminent. No matter when or if this correction comes, it’s smart to have a balanced portfolio. **That means having money in the stock market and in other places, like real estate investments.**

There is a lot of information to understand when investing in real estate and it can get confusing. Knowing about cap rates, gross rate multipliers, and how they affect your numbers is important but can be tricky. I’ve been dealing with these types of investments for 37 years now and have many investment properties myself. If you have any questions about them, I can surely answer them. **I’d be happy to sit down with you and explain to you how these things work and how you can use the information to make a smart decision.**

If you have any questions for me or just want to talk, give me a call or send me an email. I would be glad to hear from you.
