We’ve been having a lot of conversations lately with people who want to sell their homes, but they are waiting until the day before they want to list to contact us. **The challenge here is that it really takes time to get a home ready to list for sale and sell for top dollar.** Here’s what the ideal process looks like.

First, we’ll want to have a professional designer take a look at your home and determine how we can show it in its best light. It could be something as simple as a pop of color or some furniture rearrangement, or as complex as new windows, paint, or flooring. **We want to take the time to make sure your home is presented as perfectly as possible.**

Second, we’ll send out our marketing team to make sure they take great photos, great video, and have everything they need to showcase your home online to the highest number of potential buyers possible.

**While this is all happening, we also want to build hype for your home online.** On social media, Zillow, and other websites, we can let people know that the home is coming soon and they should come see it.

If you are thinking about selling your home this spring when the market heats up, now is the perfect time to get the ball rolling. If you have any questions or want any advice at all, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email today. I would love to hear from you soon.
