I want to talk to you about a real estate mantra today that could change everything in your business for the better. Since I entered the business, I have adopted this simple mantra that has served me very well: **Grow your database and market to your database.**

Your database is simply your list of contacts. It’s a list of people you know personally or other people who have been identified to you as having a real estate needs. Those people should go into your database, along with every different way to contact them.

**Once you have your database, you need to begin marketing to them.** You need to reach out with a consistent message that says you are a caring and competent real estate professional and demonstrate that with direct mail marketing, video marketing, and social media marketing.

In my experience, **if you send that message consistently through a variety of means over time, you are going to build a very robust real estate sales business**. If you have 100 individuals or families in your database you are marketing to consistently, that will create a GCI of $100,000 each year. You can scale up this metric to any level of financial aspiration.

This is the most efficient and cost-effective way to build an abundant real estate sales business. If you have any questions about growing or marketing to your database in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you soon.
