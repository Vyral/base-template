You want to make sure during the first two weeks that your house has already been prepared. You don’t want to start showing your home if you’re still getting the painting done or your carpets cleaned. You want to make sure that everything is finished before listing your home because the **first two weeks after listing is going to be when you get the most activity on your home.**

Your agent will want to have a professional photographer come out and take photos of your home, so **make sure that the outside of the house looks just as good as the inside.** If you’re showing during the spring, summer, or fall seasons, make sure that the landscaping looks crisp and the leaves are picked up. During the winter, make sure the walks are shoveled and free of snow.

**Because you’re going to see the most traffic from buyers in the first two weeks after listing, you want to make sure that your home is shown in the most positive light.** During this period, you want to allow as many showings as possible. If you restrict any showings, you’re doing yourself a disservice by not letting as many people as possible see your home.

In the first two weeks, your home should be marketed in as many places as possible. It will be listed on the MLS, agent websites, and broker websites. If you list with us, we can also do something called a mega open house, which will open the home to as many buyers as we can get so that you get the best exposure possible.

If you follow these instructions and the home is marketed properly, and you’re still not getting enough showings in the first two or three weeks of this house being on the market, you’re going to want to look at the price. **Usually a lack of showings in the first two weeks indicates that the price may be what’s causing buyers to avoid seeing your home.**
