In our 12-part “Shift” coaching video series, we’ll be covering how to deal with a shifting real estate market. When applied, the techniques we discuss will allow your business to thrive during a shift—or in any market, for that matter. **For our second episode, we’ll be talking about the first tactic to use in a shifting market: changing your mindset and action.**

Andy Andrews, author of “The Traveler’s Gift,” says, “Our very lives are fashioned by choice. First, we make choices. Then, our choices make us.” So, let’s think about shifting our mentality; your life is either about problems or about opportunities, and you get to choose which.

**There are three types of people who emerge from a shift**: those who fear the worst and are pessimistic, those who wish for the best and are unrealistic, and those who understand they may fail but prepare for the worst and strive for the best.

Failure is always a possibility, but the best agent is action-oriented and does whatever they can to avoid it. You can’t control the market, but you can control your outlook and response.&nbsp;

You’re in the market of the moment; it’s always been this way, and it always will be. While not everyone will succeed in a shift, someone will—and anyone can. **You must believe you can be in the “anyone can” category.**

Once you are looking at things realistically, you need to start making the right actions, and when you realize the right actions are less about knowing than it is about doing, you can leave fear behind you.&nbsp;

**What must be done right, and what must be done now?** Efficiency and effectiveness are essential contributors to your bottom line. The critical actions you identify must be done or at least overseen by you on a daily basis. You need to generate and convert leads, and when business gets tight, you must master the fundamentals of this process—think scripts, conversion, generation, follow-up, contracts, appointments, closings, etc.

Stay tuned to future episodes for a deeper look into how to survive and thrive in a shifting market. In the meantime, if you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
