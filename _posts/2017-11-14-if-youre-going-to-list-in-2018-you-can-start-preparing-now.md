If you’re thinking of selling your home in 2018, you can start preparing now.

One easy improvement you can make is to alter your paint color. Buyers like neutral colors, so try to tone down any brightly colored walls.

Buyers will also want to be able to envision themselves in your home. To help them do this, **depersonalize your home by removing family photos and similar items from the walls.**

In terms of the home’s exterior, there are a few different things you can do. Sprucing up flower beds and clearing away fallen leaves are just two things you can do to make a big difference in your yard.

Freshening your landscape so that it’s ready to be tackled in the spring will really help.

There are a number of other, larger projects you might want to take on. Bathroom and kitchen remodels are two of the most popular renovations you might make, but I recommend seeking the advice of a professional before taking on any major projects. You don’t want to overimprove for the neighborhood.

**Having a conversation with your agent now about which projects to tackle before you list will help you be better prepared to sell in 2018.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
