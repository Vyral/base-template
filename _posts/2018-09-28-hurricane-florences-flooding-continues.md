&nbsp;

Today I want to give you a quick update on the effects of Hurricane Florence.

Although the storm is long gone, **we are still dealing with flooding in certain areas of South Carolina**, which is why I wanted to explain why the flooding comes so much later. The water in North Carolina, where Florence hit directly, has to make its way downriver to South Carolina.

The Intracoastal Waterway usually crests within a week after the storm leaves the area, although this can sometimes take longer. The areas surrounding these bodies of water end up flooding because of the higher water levels.

If you have any questions about the affected areas, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
