I just wanted to thank our Realtor community for everything that they’ve done this year to help us achieve our goals. With the help of the community, we were able to make all of our transactions a win-win for all parties involved.

With the new year approaching, I just wanted to ask you one question: based on what you’ve done this year, **have you achieved all of the goals that you set for yourself?** Were you able to meet or exceed the number of home sales that you set out to sell? Were you able to service the number of families that you wanted to? Did you bring in the income that you desired?

**My team and I were able to service over 800 families this year, which is absolutely tremendous. We hope to push this number toward 1,000 or 1,100 this coming year.**

If you have any interest in chatting a little bit more about a potential new real estate career with our team, I’d love to talk with you.

With the support of the Realtor community this year, we were also able to open our Johnnie Dodds office this year, located at 311 Johnnie Dodds Blvd. in Mount Pleasant. This is in addition to our offices on 821 Orleans Rd. in West Ashley, in the Oakbrook/North Charleston area, and in downtown Summerville. **We have three or four positions available at each of these offices, and the agents in our office are rewarded with leads, a steady stream of contacts, as well as a business plan that allows them to reach the income level that they desire.**

If you have any interest in joining our team, simply give me a call or send me an email and I’ll keep your response 100% confidential. I would love to chat with you to see if we can get your real estate career to take off in the coming year. I look forward to hearing from you!
