Today I have three tips to make sure that the offer your agent drafts for you is going to stick the landing.

**1. Talk about things other than price.** The details in the offer are important. Your agent should call the listing agent and get as much information as they can. Oftentimes they’ll only consider the price as a negotiating term and not the appliances. Get those details before drafting the offer so that you can write the strongest offer possible.

**2. Make sure that your offer is clean.** Make sure that it’s easy to understand and digitally produced. Get the answer to as many questions as possible before the offer is presented. That way, you are shortening the lag time that the seller will have to respond because you addressed their concerns in the initial offer.

**3. Choose the right lender.** We can recommend you to some. It’s incredibly important that your lender understands how strong you are as a buyer. In some cases, they may advise waiving that financing contingency to make the offer stronger. Your lender should verify your employment and handle any objections before you present the offer. That way, you can keep it clean and close as fast as possible, or at least on time for the seller.

If you have any other questions about buying a home or preparing an offer, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you.
