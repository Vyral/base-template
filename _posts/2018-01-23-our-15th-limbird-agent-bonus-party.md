  We recently celebrated our 15th Limbird Agent Bonus Party! When you list your
  home with us and choose to use our LAB program, it gives your home a boost to
  Realtors in our area, helping us to get your home sold FAST and for the most
  money. This party marked $150,000 in bonuses that we've given to local agents!
  Plus you are supporting the community we all live and work in. With our LAB
  program, we've given $22,000 to charities in NWA. This time, we raised money
  for the American Diabetes Association. To see a recap of our latest party,

We just had our 15th Limbird Agent Bonus party! This means that we’ve given back $22,000 to charities in the Northwest Arkansas area.

When you list and sell your home with us, **you are supporting the community we all live and work in.**

This party featured a double giveaway, so that’s $20,000. It’s our 15th party in just under three years, which means that after this party, **we’ve given away $150,000 in bonus commissions as a thank you to agents for all their hard work.**

Check out the video to watch some hardworking agents win some great prizes.

**Giving back to the community is something we love to do!** We recently had the wonderful opportunity to help out other people in the Arkansas area through the Kiss a Pig Program. Check out our other video [here](https://youtu.be/BOS6oW8N1TA) to see how we teamed up with Patty La Pig to raise money for the American Diabetes Association.

If you list with the Limbird Team and participate in our LAB program, I bet we’ll get your house sold, too.

If you have any real estate questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out ot us. We would be happy to help you!
