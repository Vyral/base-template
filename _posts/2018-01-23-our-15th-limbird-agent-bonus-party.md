We just had our 15h Limbird Agent Bonus party! This means that we’ve given back $22,000 to charities in the Northwest Arkansas area.

When you list and sell your home with us, **you are supporting the community we all live and work in.**

This party featured a double giveaway, so that’s $20,000. It’s our 15th party in just under three years, which means that after this party, **we’ve given away $150,000 in bonus commissions as a thank you to our agents for all their hard work.**

Check out the video to watch our hardworking agents win some great prizes.

Giving back to the community is something we love to do! We recently had the wonderful opportunity to help out other people in the Arkansas area through the Kiss a Pig Program. Check out our other video [here](https://youtu.be/BOS6oW8N1TA) to see how we teamed up with Patty Lapig to raise money for the American Diabetes Association.&nbsp;

If you list with the Limbird Team and participate in our LAB program, I bet we’ll get your house sold, too.
