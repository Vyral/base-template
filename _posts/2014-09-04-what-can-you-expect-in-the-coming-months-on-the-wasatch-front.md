With summer coming to an end, many buyers who wanted to find a home before school starts have left the market. Because of this, sellers have a tendency to leave the market as well - they feel it's better to wait until the spring selling season.

However, we've found that in the late summer and early fall months there are more serious buyers in the market. These buyers typically have either recently sold their home and are looking to find a new one quickly, or are moving from an area outside the Wasatch Front. These folks are very determined to purchase property - in fact, we often need fewer showings to sell a home.

The early fall months see a decrease in competition among sellers and an increase in serious buyers, which makes now a great time to put your home on the market.

If you have any questions about this interesting selling season, don't hesitate to give us a call. We would love to chat about conditions in your particular area.
