Whether you’re coming on your own or with a company, if you’re thinking about relocating to the Twin Cities area, you’ll want to begin planning far in advance. Luckily for you, Edina Realty is relocation-certified—we can help make your relocation process easier, especially for those who don’t know the area well. Here’s how we do it:

**First, we’ll have a consultation with you in person or by phone** where we’ll discuss where you’ll be working, what your timetable is like, and what your approved budget is like so that we know what price point and neighborhood you’ll be looking in.

We’ll also want to learn a bit more about you and your family. Are you going to be enrolling kids in school? What do you want your commute to be like? What is your desired lifestyle?&nbsp;

Once we’ve discussed those items, **the next step is to identify some of the neighborhoods that work for you.** We can take you on a tour to see the area, meet with school districts, and so on. We have many resources and maps that we can provide to help you understand the different things the Twin Cities have to offer.

**After we’ve covered all that and narrowed down your mortgage options, the fun part begins—searching for a home you love.**

If we can answer any of your questions about relocating to the Twin Cities area, please reach out to us. Let’s have a conversation so we can start the plan for your transition.
