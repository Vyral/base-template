Being average in today’s world will not cut it. To be competitive you have to deliver exceptional service with unbelievable value. Your clients have got to understand how important and valuable you are to them. So, I want to talk about how you can differentiate yourself from all the competition out there by delivering a quality experience with each client you work with.<br>&nbsp;<br>The reason that it is important to be above average is because **clients have all the information they need at their fingertips.** YouTube, Zillow, and Realtor.com provide clients with the knowledge to be educated resulting in many clients believing that they know more than you. This is why the experience is crucial.<br>&nbsp;<br>You need to know what kind of experience and service to offer your clients that you want to be known for. You then must be able to duplicate that, so you can **deliver it to every single person you come in contact with,** so they know that you will have consistent, exceptional service.<br>&nbsp;<br>After you know what type of service you want to provide you need to create a loyal client base with fans of you for life. **I utilize a “100-Touch Past Client Program”** to let my clients know that I want to work with them forever. You can do calls, text messages, handwritten notes, special calls or cards for birthdays, holidays, and anniversaries, postcards, newsletters, etc. to keep you in their minds. Whatever you do, create a system that once you serve them at the highest level, you are staying in touch with them for life.

{% include pullquote.html %}<br>&nbsp;<br>To create a great initial experience with buyers, you need to do some very important things.<br>&nbsp;<br>**1. Have a buyer consultation.** Meet one-on-one and educate your clients about the market, neighborhoods, how to be successful, and the different steps and what to expect in the homebuying process. This shows them that you have value for them.<br>&nbsp;<br>**2. Create a buyer packet.** Go into appointments organized with a folder of color printed MLS sheets that show you are professional and prepared.<br>&nbsp;<br>**3. Talk to your clients after showings.** See what they liked and what they did not like because it shows you care about their wants and needs. If they do not want to make an offer, you will know what to show them and what to avoid showing them next time.<br>&nbsp;<br>**4. Give your clients permission to make an offer on a home.** Educate your client that they do not have to see more homes if they like the home. This gives them confidence in their choice and helps them to not miss out on the home that they fall in love with.<br>&nbsp;<br>**5. Communicate with your clients in a timely manner.** Stay in touch with them so they have peace of mind that they need you working with them. This will differentiate you from 95% of the agents in the market and will earn you the business, respect, and loyalty of your clients.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you are interested in finding out more about this process or what we do during our buyer consultation, I would be happy to share more with you. I look forward to your calls and emails.
