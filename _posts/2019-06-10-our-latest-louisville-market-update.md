Today’s market update comes to you straight from the ancient Incan city of Machu Picchu. Why is our team here? Well, we’d be happy to explain, but first, let’s go over a few market statistics:

The Louisville area real estate market is red-hot right now, with homes selling in not just days—but mere hours. Home prices in some areas of our market have increased up to 5.8% year over year, with average home prices increasing 4.7% over that same time. The projected appreciation rates for our area say values could jump even higher over the next several months.

This is why 66% of all millennial renters plan to take the plunge into home-ownership soon. So if you’re looking to make a move this year, please give my team a call. We’d love to talk about your goals.

With that said, let’s talk more about our team’s recent trip to Peru. \*\*To hear all about it, check out today’s video starting at 2:40. \*\*

Overall, our trip to Peru was absolutely incredible. As always, I love being able to bring you all these updates on my life and our market.
