Summer is here and it is a great time to buy or sell property, but partnering with the right agent will be crucial to your success.

If you want great results, you will need to consider the education, experience, reputation, and expertise of your agent. There are a few key attributes that indicate the quality of an agent.

**1. An educated agent focuses on the solution, not the problem****.** The ability to anticipate, resolve, and handle problems quickly and professionally defines a high-quality agent.
