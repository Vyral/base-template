What are your goals for 2023? There's a difference between resolutions and goals. Resolutions tend to come and go from December 31 until about the third week of January. If you go to the gym on January 1, you will see every machine occupied. After the first three weeks, you'll see those spots open up because a resolution is not concrete, and it doesn't stick with us. We often see the commitment level for a resolution be much lower.

So what are your goals? **What are you truly committed to for 2023?** In fact, I would ask you, do your goals for 2023 align with your someday goals? If you're not used to thinking out someday goals and working backward to figure out what you need to do to ensure you're on track to hit that goal, there's an opportunity to get clarity there.

As we go into 2023, clarify what you’re focusing on and commit to supporting your long-term plans of where you want to be in life. If you have any questions, please give me a call, text, or email. I'd love to help you.
