Calling all Frog-eaters!

Abby Realty is launching two high-producing teams and we still have openings for a few motivated agents. **We call them the S.O.F.E. teams which stands for Society Of Frog Eaters.** The teams are essentially a one-year internship under the guidance of an experienced and knowledgeable broker.

Each team will meet from 8:30 to 12:30 each morning, Monday through Thursday. During that time **each team will be guided through a series of lead generation activities including outbound calling, social media marketing, and promoting first-time homebuyer seminars.**

The minimum expectation is that each team member will close 25 transactions during their internship year and **put at least $75,000 in their pocket.** The brokerage is paying for all marketing expenses. After graduating from the S.O.F.E. teams, **team members are expected to earn over $150,000 in their second year.**

If you’re interested in learning more please complete the contact form on this page or call Abby Realty owner, Frank Gray directly: 713-702-6978, frank@frankgray.net.

Let’s go there, together!&nbsp;
