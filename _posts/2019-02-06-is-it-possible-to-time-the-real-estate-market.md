People often ask me if it’s possible for them to time the market. The answer is yes, and here's the time frame you need to follow in order to do so.

I’m sure you’ve heard that trying to time the stock market is not a good idea. **When it comes to the real estate market, however, that’s far from the truth.**

From the day you list your property to the day of closing, selling a house typically takes anywhere from 60 to 80 days. If you take into account the few weeks you’ll need to prepare your property for the market, you'll need to start the process two to six months before your desired closing day to properly time the market.

**Contacting an agent earlier will allow you to put the pieces together with the least amount of stress**. If you contact me and my team right now, for instance, we can walk you through the process and pinpoint the exact time frame that it will take for your home to sell. We'll also discuss improvements you can make to your home and what price you can expect to sell for.

If you're thinking about taking advantage of the spring or summer market conditions, now is the time to get the ball rolling. If you have any questions for me or want our assistance to help you begin the home selling process, don’t hesitate to reach out to me via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
