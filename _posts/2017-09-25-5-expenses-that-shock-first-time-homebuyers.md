A lot of homebuyers fail to realize that their home expenses don’t start and stop with their mortgage payment. There’s much more to being a homeowner than that. Here are five expenses that all homeowners have in addition to their mortgage:

**1. Closing costs.**When you decide on a home, you’ll get an estimate of the closing costs. The estimate will break down what you need to bring to closing and what the mortgage company is giving you.

**2. Maintenance costs.** This can vary depending on the home, but you should budget for at least 1% to 2% of the home’s value each year to be used on maintenance costs.

**3. Utilities.**The national average is nearly $3,000 per year. If you want to get a better idea of what the utilities will cost in the home you’re interested in, you can always ask your agent to get that information from the seller.

**4. Taxes.** These will be escrowed into your mortgage.

**5. Homeowners insurance.** The national average for homeowners insurance is around $1,100 per year. Check with your insurance agent regarding the coverage you have.
