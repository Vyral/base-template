Your kitchen is the heart of your home, and buyers will always gravitate towards it during a showing. Before you sell your home, you can squeeze out a little extra money by investing in some kitchen repairs. Here are a few things you can do that won’t require an entire remodel of your kitchen but will still net you a decent return.

1. Amp up your appliances. Buyers want to see upgraded stoves, ovens, microwaves, and refrigerators. Stainless steel is all the rage right now, and it looks great when all of the appliances match.

2. Refresh your cabinets with a new coat of paint. White is a nice touch and it can brighten up your kitchen for a welcoming feel.

3. New countertops are always great. This is especially true if you still have laminate or vinyl. There are many cost-effective alternatives to granite that have the same look and feel.

4. New flooring is also something that can change the look and feel of your kitchen. Tile is preferable, and shoot for 18x18 instead of 12x12. Wood floors are also desirable.

5. An updated faucet is always a nice edition. Go for oil-rubbed bronze or brushed nickel.

An updated kitchen will certainly attract buyers. You know that people gravitate towards the kitchen in a home, so pay attention to yours. It might be as simple as replacing knobs on cabinets. You would be surprised what just a few small changes can do for the overall feel of your home.

Please contact me or anyone on my team. We’re willing to come see your home and suggest improvements that will bring you the maximum return on your investment.
