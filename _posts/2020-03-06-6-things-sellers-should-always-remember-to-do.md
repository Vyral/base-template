Selling a home can be a complicated process. As such, there are a few things that many home sellers simply forget about as they prepare their home for sale. Here are six things to keep in mind when selling your home:

**Focus on staging.** You may already like the way your furniture is arranged, but does it appeal to buyers? Your home should be set up in a way that shows off your living areas and opens up the space.

**Improve your curb appeal.** The outside may just be as important as what’s inside. Your home’s exterior is the first thing buyers see, so make sure it is maintained well and looks inviting.

**Show off your smart-home tech.** If your home has smart locks, thermostats, carbon monoxide detectors, or any other smart-home technologies, make sure buyers are aware of them. Many people consider them necessary home fixtures in today’s digital age.

**Tackle home odors.** Unpleasant smells can be a dealbreaker for buyers. Make sure your home is free of any uninviting aromas.

**Update lighting hardware and fixtures.** Buyers love brightly lit rooms, so make sure your bulbs are all working. If your fixtures are outdated, consider replacing them for a more modern feel.

**Minimize decor.** The goal is to depersonalize your home so buyers can see themselves living in it. Though vibrantly colored walls may be your style, not everyone has the same tastes as you. It’s better to stick with neutral colors such as gray, white, and taupe.
