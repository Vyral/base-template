There are a lot of up-and-coming areas here in Columbus, but we wanted to focus on three of them in particular today. These are the areas where we’re seeing a ton of increased activity as of late.

**1. Weinland Park.** Besides all of the new development there, the university is putting a lot of money in this area by buying vacant buildings and renovating them. First-time buyers have been offered grants to purchase in the area at a discount.

**2. Nationwide Children’s.** This area is east of Parsons Ave. on the south side of Columbus. There’s a ton of money being invested here and a lot of good subsidies are being offered to investors to encourage them to come in and renovate some of the older buildings in this area. You can get a great deal on a home here too. It might need some work, but it will be cost effective.

**3. Olde Towne East.** This historic neighborhood is just east of downtown Columbus. Some of the oldest and largest homes in town were built here in the late 19th century.

If you have any questions about any of these neighborhoods or you’re curious about what kinds of homes are for sale here, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you soon.
