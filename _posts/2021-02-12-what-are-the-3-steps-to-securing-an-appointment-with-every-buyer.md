<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s a quick look at how to convert more contacts to appointments.</em></p>

Here are the three steps you can take to ensure you secure an appointment with every qualified homebuyer who reaches out to you:

**1\. Respond quickly.** If you get an inquiry on a home, the most important thing is to respond quickly, preferably in under five minutes. The largest study of internet inquiries ever done revealed that if you can’t call the inquirer back within five minutes, you’re better off not calling at all.&nbsp;

**2\. Ask them if they have any questions and when they can preview the property.** This immediately helps drive the conversation to the two things that 99% of homebuyers want: answering questions and setting up a time to preview the property. Framing it like this starts the conversation right out of the gate.

**3\. Make sure to qualify them.** Part of qualifying is rapport building, finding common ground, and understanding their core motivation. Make sure you’re complying with the oral consumer notice and connect them to a lender if they need help.

**When you cover all of these things first, you’re setting up the conversation to give them what they need first (value) and asking for something in return (getting qualified).** Our motto is to give consumers twice the value you ask for, and arranging the conversation like this does just that.

If you have questions about this process or anything else related to the real estate business, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I would love to connect.
