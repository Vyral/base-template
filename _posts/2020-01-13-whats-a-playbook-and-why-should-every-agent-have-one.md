What in the world is a “playbook” in the real estate world and why is everyone talking about it all the time? I was recently at a Mastermind, and it was definitely the buzzword of the event, so I figured I’d quickly touch on the value and power of having a playbook for your business.

A playbook is just a fancy name for a plan. You are going to document all of the events and marketing that you’ll do in your business to make sure that you are getting in all the proper touches to your database. They include all of your digital touches, marketing pieces involved in events, and more.

Your playbook has three main purposes: It’s a plan, it allows you to budget, and it holds you accountable. You make your plan based on your goals, and in order to achieve those goals, you need accountability behind them. At the end of the day, you have to be able to afford the plan and it has to produce a return on your investment.

Many teams and agents have a playbook. We do too. It’s on an Excel spreadsheet, where we can always see what’s coming up on our timeline to stay ahead of the curve.

I’d be happy to share our playbook with you if you’re interested in seeing what one looks like. If you want to take a look or if you have any other questions, feel free to reach out as well. I’d love to hear from you.
