What do the latest statistics look like in our Clarksville market? Let’s compare where they are now to where they were at this time last year.

Currently, we have 963 active properties on the market, which is down from the 1,238 properties that were on the market at this time last year. Year to date, we’ve closed 4,169 properties, which is about a 13% increase from the 3,695 properties we’d closed at this time last year.

**This decrease in inventory and increase in closed sales explains why we’re in more of a seller’s market.**

The average sale price has increased 5% from $174,400 to $182,700.

The average days on market for homes is about 55 days.

The hottest price range for listed homes is between $180,000 and $240,000. This range represents about 26% of all the closed homes on the market. **All price ranges are selling fast, though, and if a home is priced right and in good condition, it doesn’t stay listed for very long.**

If you’re interested in selling your home and doing it quickly or you’re looking to buy a home, give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to help you.
