Lately, we’ve been getting a lot of questions from home sellers who have<br>been trying to sell their home with other area Agents.

They say, *“I’ve had my home on the market with this other agent, and it’s not<br>selling. Why isn’t it selling? What’s wrong with my home? Is this the wrong<br>time to be on the market? Is it my agent?”*

These are all valid questions. Let’s figure this out together.

For context as to whether we are a proper “authority” to be answering this<br>question: In 2016 The Larkin Group sold 56 homes in <u>1 day or less!</u>

In 2017, <u>we sold 73 homes in under 25 days</u>. I say this not to impress you but<br>rather to impress upon you that we have a system that routinely beats the<br>market and routinely works. I am approaching your questions as an<br>experienced real estate specialist who has sold over 1,100 homes.

The likely remedy to your home sale problem falls under one of these 5<br>options:

1. Check your price. You need to be quite honest with yourself about<br>your price. Is your home overpriced for the market? Do you love your<br>home so much that you’re willing to “buy it back” (overprice it) daily?

   Your listing price is not about what you need or want, and it’s not what<br>the appraiser or grandmother told you. Ask yourself, “What is the market<br>value of my home? What would a real Buyer pay for this home? What<br>would I PERSONALLY pay if I were in the market and had all sorts of other options?” You need to be very honest with yourself. This is a real<br>“man (or woman) in the mirror” moment.

2. **Look at the condition and staging.** Did your agent give you any<br>feedback about your house prior to listing? If so, did you ignore that<br>feedback? Perhaps there is overlooked clutter or you need to update or<br>neutralize the paint.

   It’s fairly likely that there is something you felt you neede3d to fix but<br>didn’t, and that is what’s keeping your home from selling.

3. **Marketing?** Did you hire a real estate agent who spends thousands of<br>dollars on radio, Zillow, Trulia, Realtor.com, and Homes.com? Have you<br>seen exactly what the agent is doing to attract Buyers? If not, find out!

   Is your agent marketing to other real estate agents and incentivizing<br>those agents to bring buyers to your home? There is a good chance you<br>don’t know what they are doing, so ask your agent about their marketing<br>plan.

4. **Needed repairs?** This goes back to my second point. You may need to<br>spend some money to fix up your home. I don’t mean decluttering, this<br>could mean replacing tattered flooring or even more significant repairs.<br>It will cost you in the short run, but might cost you the entire sale in the<br>long run.

5. **Quit.** You always have the option to quit and take your home off the<br>market.

In most cases, the reason a home doesn’t sell is due to pricing. Be honest<br>with yourself and your agent.

This market has been great for sellers. INCREDIBLE even. And a good agent<br>should be able to sell your home in 30 days or less. If your home is still on the<br>market, it’s time to have a heart-to- heart with your agent.

If you have any other questions or need help selling your home, just give me a<br>call or send me an email. We’re happy to share our observations free of<br>charge, and definitely will not solicit your listing if you happen to be actively on<br>the market with another agent. Our suggestions may even help them get it<br>sold!
