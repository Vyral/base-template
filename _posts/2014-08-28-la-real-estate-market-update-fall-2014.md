Happy Fall, everyone. It's hard to believe that the summer is nearly over. We thought that now would be a great time to give you the latest real estate market update for Los Angeles so you can know what's going on.

The market is still fantastic, we have had houses going on the market this week and have some set up for next week as well. For some reason, people think that the market slows down in the fall because of the weather, but we are in LA, and we really don't have your typical fall (or winter for that matter), so our selling season never really stops.

We are still seeing extremely low interest rates down near 4.25%. Properties in this market that are showing well are selling and we are going to have beautiful weather for showing homes here for the next couple of months.

If you have any questions about the market, or about real estate in general, please give us a call. We'd love to help you out!
