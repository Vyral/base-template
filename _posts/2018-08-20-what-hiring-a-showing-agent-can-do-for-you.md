How do you get your life back with the help of a showing agent?&nbsp;

If you have become busy and are away at work all the time, including nights and weekends, one of the things that might be helpful is a showing agent. But, what is a showing agent? A showing agent is a licensed real estate agent that oversees the search and service portion of the sales process.

What is the sales process, then? Well, every industry has a sales process. On the buying side of our industry, this typically is a five-step process:

* Prospect or customer generation
* Prospect or customer conversion into a client
* Search and service
* Negotiation
* Contract to close

There is actually a sixth step which is after the transaction, but oftentimes we don't pay close attention to that portion. Today though I want to talk about the middle stepâ€”search and service. Again, a showing agent can oversee and help with this portion.

**Showing agents can contact buyers once they have decided to work with you as a buyer's agent.** They are also probably going to be a designated agent on the buyer's agency. These people will partner with you to help serve the client. They will set them up, set criteria so they can search for homes, schedule and oversee tours, and answer basic questions.

You will still advise, write and negotiate offers, and act as the advocate for your client, the buyer, but **having a showing agent will help you get some of your time back with your family on nights and weekends.** The showing agent simply assists with that portion of showing homes and answering questions in the search and service portion of the sales process.

A great showing agent should not only be able to give you your night and weekend time back, but also free up some of your day. This will allow you to generate more business so that you can pay for that person and still have more time and money.
