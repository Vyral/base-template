We might be in a seller’s market now, but that doesn’t mean sellers can get away with being complacent and not doing everything they can to raise the value of their home. **If you want people to pay top dollar for your property, you have to make sure that your home is in top condition.**&nbsp;

Keep in mind that firs impressions matter. By cleaning and properly staging the home, buyers are more likely to fall in love with it, and they’ll have an easier time imagining themselves living in that house. Sellers may have the leverage during the offer phase, but the buyers gain back that leverage once the offer is accepted. If they feel like they’re getting the short end of the deal, they may start to have some remorse that will cause the negotiations to fail.

The reality is that you have to do your best to make your home look amazing so that it becomes very attractive for buyers. If you need help with this, or have any real estate related questions, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’ll be happy to help\!
