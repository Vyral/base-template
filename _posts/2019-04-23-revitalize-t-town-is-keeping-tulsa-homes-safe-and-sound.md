Recently I had the opportunity to speak with Jennifer Barcus-Shafer of Revitalize T-Town to talk about her organization and what makes it so great. Having been in business for almost 22 years, Revitalize T-Town (formerly Rebuilding Together Tulsa) is an incredible force for good in our community.&nbsp;

**“Revitalize T-Town, or ‘RTT’ as we call it, makes homes safe, secure, and weather-proof for homeowners within the Tulsa city limits,” says Jennifer.** The majority of RTT’s clients are seniors or individuals with disabilities, and these people generally find out about the organization through word of mouth. The more people RTT helps, the more their reputation grows in our community. And the more their reputation grows, the more effectively they’re able to achieve their mission: revitalizing Tulsa.

The first step RTT takes after receiving and reviewing an application is to assess the person’s home and determine what must be done to improve its condition. After that, the various improvement projects a given home needs are ranked by priority so that local contractors can handle the most urgent areas first. You can check out the video above at 1:13 for a slideshow of some before and after photos from RTT’s previous projects.&nbsp;

Even more impressively, the money that funds RTT comes straight from our community. That said, monetary donations are always welcome. Still, there are many other ways to give back. If you’re a local contractor like an electrician or plumber, RTT would be happy to connect you with projects that fit your skill set.&nbsp;
