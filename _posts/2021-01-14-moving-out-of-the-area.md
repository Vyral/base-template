<p style="text-align: center;"><em>No matter where you’re moving, I can help you connect with the right agent.</em></p>

These days, people are realizing that they can live and work anywhere because they school and work from home. I’m still here to help you with your buying and selling needs in Portland, but **if you’re moving to another state or even country, give me a call.** I can help you move anywhere; I have a wonderful network of agents that are like me and there to be a resource. They’re not going to push you to buy or sell buying or selling if you’re not ready, but they can show you market data, connect you to trusted vendors in their area, and help you find the home of your dreams wherever you want to be.&nbsp;

If you have any questions, large or small, call or [visit my website](https://asksarita.com/). I’m here to help you and be your real estate resource.
