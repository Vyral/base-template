When we meet with sellers this time of year, **we usually advise that they have their homes ready for the spring market around the time of the Super Bowl.** It still feels like winter, but about that time is the opening of our Minnesota real estate market. This year we’re seeing more historically low inventory levels than ever before; in some price points, there are almost no homes for sale.

On New Year’s Eve, Sara showed a $400,000 home in the South Metro, and it was crawling with people. There was nowhere to park, people were all over the back and side yards, and though they were respectful of others’ space in the home, it was chock full of people. That proves how active this price point is and that there aren’t enough homes to see.

One of the most frequent questions we hear is how sellers can prepare their homes for sale when they have no competing inventory. We address that valid question on a case-by-case basis because, **in this environment, some things you would have had to do in the past aren’t needed now.** We’re also commonly asked how to begin the process of selling in this fast-paced market. That starts with you giving us a call; we’ll come out to see your home, discuss the market, what needs to be done to prepare, and make a plan for your goals.

If you have questions about preparing for the spring market or any other real estate matter, please give us a call or visit our website. Also, if you have a topic you’d like us to discuss in a future blog, please let us know. We’d love to help you.
