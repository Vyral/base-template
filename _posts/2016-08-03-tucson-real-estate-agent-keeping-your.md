If you aren’t from Southern Arizona, you are probably in for a bit of a surprise. Our listings here have heating and cooling, just like any other home in the country. However, some properties have evaporative cooling in addition to regular air conditioning.

What is evaporative cooling? Evaporative cooling dumps a high volume of moist air into the house. Since our area has low relative humidity, the moist air evaporates and cools the home. You don’t see this in other parts of the country because our area is so dry.

Evaporative cooling can save you a lot of money on utilities. In fact, you can run an evaporative cooling unit at 25% of the cost of a standard AC unit. The downside is that once monsoon season starts in July, our humidity goes up and evaporative cooling doesn’t work as well. 

However, you can still use evaporative cooling during the first half of the summer. When monsoon season hits, you can use your regular air conditioner.

If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
