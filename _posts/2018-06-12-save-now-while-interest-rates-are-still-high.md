With values at literal all-time highs right now, many clients have come to me looking for opportunities to save.

And when they do so, they’re definitely finding success. I recently saved a client $1,400 by strategizing his financial situation.

If you, like him, have a high-interest loan or credit card, now may be the time to pay those off. Now is a great time to access your equity while still getting a tax-deductible mortgage as a result.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want to discuss the possibility of earning similar savings feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
