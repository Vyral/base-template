I’ve got two very exciting things to talk to you about today.

First off, we have been nominated as the best real estate company in Charleston for the Post & Courier. They have a “Best of” competition each year and we were nominated once again. However, we really need your votes to follow through and win.[ You can click the link here, which will take you to the voting page.](http://pnccontests.secondstreetapp.com/2018-Charlestons-Choice/gallery/109633660/){: target="_blank"} **We need your vote by July 25!** Every single vote counts, so we appreciate all of your support.<br><br>{% include pullquote.html %}

Secondly, I wanted to tell you about our upcoming client and community appreciation event. **On August 8 at Joe Riley Stadium, we’re giving away free tickets to you, your friends, and your family for the Riverdogs game.** All you have to do is RSVP at [Davesevents.org](http://www.davesevents.org/){: target="_blank"} to make sure that we get enough tickets!

We’ll have your tickets out in front at the game and f**or every ticket that you guys redeem through us, we’ll donate $5 to the MUSC Children’s Burn Fund.** We’re really trying to level up our game by setting a goal of $22,000 in donations. I’ll be donating a large portion of that, but additional donations are always appreciated (but not required).

With that, I look forward to seeing you on August 8 and I look forward to our team winning the Post & Courier “Best of” competition.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime about the real estate market or about anything else, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
