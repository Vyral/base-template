<p style="text-align: center;"><em>What should you ask an agent before hiring them to list and sell your home? Today let’s go over 10 crucial questions.</em></p>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

Before you hire an agent to help you sell your home, **there are 10 critical questions you must ask them.**

1. How much do you spend on marketing your properties each month?<br>2. Are you full-time right now?<br>3. Have you done a detailed market analysis?<br>4. Do you have a strategic, written marketing plan?<br>5. What technology do you use to list and sell homes for your clients?<br>6. What is your list-to-sale price ratio?<br>7. What percentage of listings that you take actually sell?<br>8. How many homes have you sold in your career?<br>9. How many homes did you sell last year?<br>10. How many years have you been in the real estate business?

As is highlighted by the last three questions, **experience is one of the most valuable attributes an agent may have.** However, it’s important to keep in mind that time spent in the industry does not necessarily equate to experience. &nbsp;

It’s possible that you may encounter an agent who has been in the industry for years but has only sold a handful of homes. On the other hand, you may encounter a newer agent who has sold a good many homes in just a short time. Ideally, you should choose an agent who has a balanced level of experience in terms of home sold and years spent in the industry.&nbsp;
