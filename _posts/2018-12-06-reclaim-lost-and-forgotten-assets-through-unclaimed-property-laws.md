Did you know that, because of unclaimed property laws, there are billions and billions of dollars out there just waiting for people to claim in terms of lost and forgotten assets?

You see, **every state has their own unclaimed property program that actively looks for owners of lost and forgotten assets.** The purpose of unclaimed property laws is to protect consumers and ensure that any money that’s owed to them is returned to them.

I recently checked online to see if I had any unclaimed money waiting for me, and after I filled out the required paperwork, I got a check in the mail from the state of Arizona for $88. This was unclaimed money from several years ago!
