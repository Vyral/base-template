There is a home burglary every 15 seconds—or about 2 million homes are broken into every year.

Here’s what a reformed burglar has to say about the mistakes people make most often\! And, most of these ideas won’t cost you a dime\!

* **Mistake \#1 – Not locking doors or leaving the alarm off while running an errand.**&nbsp;Even if you plan to be gone for 15 minutes, that’s enough time to for a burglar to ransack your home.
* **Mistake \#2 – Posting an alarm sign that identifies the name of the alarm company**. You have just notified the burglar that you have a specific type of alarm system so they know exactly how to disable it. it’s better just to post a “generic” notice that that says, “This House Is Protected by an Alarm System”.
* **Mistake \#3 – Hiding your valuables in your bedroom.**&nbsp;That’s the first place burglars look.&nbsp; Keep them in the garage, in a fake soup can, above a removable ceiling tile.&nbsp; Also, don’t hide them all in one place.
* **Mistake \#4 – Thinking that a big dog will deter burglars.**&nbsp;Unless your big dog is trained as a guard dog. Most small dogs are “yappers” and will make much more noise.
* **Mistake \#5 – Leaving the lights on when you are gone for several days.**&nbsp;Use “timers” that will turn lights off and on in different parts of your house.
* **Mistake \#6 – Stopping your mail or newspaper delivery.**&nbsp;Have a neighbor or family member stop by to pick them up.&nbsp; The more activity a burglar sees around the house, the less likely they will target your house.
* **Mistake \#7 – Leaving on outside lights when you are out of town.**&nbsp;This just allows the burglar to see better at night.&nbsp; A better solution is to buy a motion detector (about $20) so your lights turn on when someone tries to enter your home.
