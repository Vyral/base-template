*With lots of people moving into the Austin metro, the market is still moving fast. With the summer season over, home builders are looking to sell off inventory.*

It’s been a very busy summer in our market and there are a lot of people moving to the Austin metro area.

In areas like Cedar Park and Williamson County, we’re seeing a massive amount of new construction happening as well. Many of the builders are offering fantastic incentives to purchase their homes, so if you’ve ever thought about buying a brand-new home, now is the time.

**The back-to-school selling season is over, so builders really want to get the inventory that didn’t sell during that time off the books as the end of the year approaches.**

In our market, we’ve seen average home sale volume go down for the second straight month, according to the Austin Board of Realtors. However, the average median sales price continues to climb. Across the Austin metro, the median sales price is $285,000, with the median price in Williamson right around $265,000.

As we end the year, I expect to see the market soften up just a little bit. Interest rates are still very low, so we’re still going to see a lot of people moving here and buying a home, and at the same time, it looks like inventory is building.

If you have more questions about the local market or you’re interested in new construction homes, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help you!
