You and I both know that the barrier of entry into the real estate profession is very low as we move into 2018. All it takes is $600 and 120 hours of schooling, and there’s a line of folks signing up for their exam as fast as you’re completing it!<br><br>The next thing you know, your neighbor, mechanic, or garbage man might all have real estate licenses. Good grief!<br><br>This is why we want to help every agent grow their business, whether they’re on our team or not. The Larkin Group closed a total of 207 home sales in 2017. Over $55 million in sales volume and $1 million in gross commission income!&nbsp;<br><br>This is not boasting, it’s to articulate that clearly we’re doing something right. We have rare culture, a beautiful office and we’re selling a ton. Sometimes people wonder how we do it.

One of the reasons is we’re a “reading team.” We’ve all heard the phrase, “readers are leaders,” and I have four books that had a great impact on our team in 2017 that will do the same for you in 2018:<br><br>1.&nbsp;[**“The 4 Disciplines of Execution”**](https://www.amazon.com/Disciplines-Execution-Achieving-Wildly-Important/dp/1451627068/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516809782&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=the+4+disciplines+of+execution+by+sean+covey)&nbsp;by Sean Covey, Jim Huling, and Chris McChesney. This book is about getting out of your own way and getting out of your own head. It focuses on taking all of the complexity out of your business by focusing in on just 4 key steps daily and weekly to execute on the most important! &nbsp;<br><br>2.&nbsp;[**“The 12 Week Year”**](https://www.amazon.com/12-Week-Year-Others-Months/dp/1118509234/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516809855&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+12+week+year+by+brian+p.+moran)&nbsp;by Brian P. Morgan and Michael Lennington. This book is my new favorite. It’s like “The 4 Disciplines of Execution,” but a much easier to read. Unlike that book, it focuses on the “why” of execution in addition to the “how.”&nbsp;<br><br>What is it that motivates you to get up and come to the office in the morning and build your career? The premise of this book is to get more done in 12 weeks than others do in 12 months by treating a 12-week period like a 12-month year. With this plan, you no longer set annual goals—you set 12-week goals. Everybody at the Larkin Group is now working toward 12-week goals. 12 weeks from January 1, we’ll review our goals and set new ones.&nbsp;<br><br>3.&nbsp;[**“The Power of Habit”**](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-Business-Charles-2012-02-28/dp/B01LXU7KHG/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516809898&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=the+power+of+habit+by+charles+duhigg)&nbsp;by Charles Duhigg. This book concentrates on the science and emotion behind how habits are formed and broken. If there’s something you know you need to start or stop doing to improve your life, (and who doesn’t?), I strongly recommend you read this one.&nbsp;<br><br>4.&nbsp;[**“Shift”**](https://www.amazon.com/Shift-Estate-Agents-Tackle-Tough/dp/0071605266/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516810004&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=shift+by+gary+keller)&nbsp;by Gary Keller. The market is shifting. Always shifting. We might think that it will stay the way it is forever, but it’s not. The fact that it has been this way this long tells us it will be shifting. I’ve read this book many times, and our team is already exercising this book’s tactics.<br><br>A challenge for you in 2018?
