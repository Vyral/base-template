As a buyer, how can you make your offer as strong as possible once you’ve found the home you want?

Your first step should be to **have your agent call the listing agent and ask them what’s most important to the seller in terms of selling the home.** This way, both parties have all the key points they need and are working together to cross the finish line.&nbsp;

From an emotional standpoint, another key tip is to write a letter to the seller detailing what you love about the home and why you want to buy it.&nbsp;

Other ways to strengthen your offer include:

1\. Putting more earnest money down<br>2\. Offering a quick closing date&nbsp;<br>3\. Including very few contingencies<br>4\. Having strong financing

On our team, we also have our agents call the listing agent before the offer is sent and tell them how strong our buyer is. This tactic has helped us win out in many multiple-offer situations.&nbsp;<br><br>{% include pullquote.html %}

Nowadays, many loan officers tell buyers to give them a call after they receive a contract for a home, but that’s the wrong approach because it adds more stress to the transaction. This is why **we have our buyers meet with a loan officer before they make any offers**—so they can review different loan programs, provide their documentation to an underwriter, and verify from the lender themselves that they’re a strong buyer.&nbsp;

At the end of the day, our goal is to take the stress out of the transaction and make the transition smoother for you.&nbsp;
