*Often people are confused about the difference between an investment property and a second home.*

Many of my clients who have lived in their homes for a while will eventually contact me about a potential second home purchase, whether it’s a beach property, a mountain resort, a lake house, or other.&nbsp;

Often people are confused about the difference between an investment property and a second home. Investment properties have higher down payments and interest rates—**second homes don’t have any of that. &nbsp;From a mortgage lender's standpoint, second homes are largely treated the same way as a primary residence, meaning the terms are fantastic.**

If you and your family are looking to enjoy a second home, please reach out to me and my team. We’ll take great care of you or anyone you know who could use some expert advice on how to plan for the future and to accomplish your real estate goals.<br>&nbsp;
