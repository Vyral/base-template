Today we’re going to be tackling a million-dollar question: Should sellers make home repairs before putting their property on the market?

In my experience, **it’s always best for sellers to remember the homes they’re up against when they list.** You have to take the competition into account. &nbsp;Buyers should want your property—not your neighbor's property.

Of course, this doesn’t mean you should go all out and take on expensive projects that won’t bring a return. You should ideally earn a $1.25 or $1.50 for every dollar you spend. In short, **you should absolutely make a few repairs before listing, but only the ones that will help put money in your pocket.**

This brings up another interesting question: Which repairs are worth it? Well, if your home is the only one in the neighborhood that doesn’t have granite countertops, adding in such a finish might be a good choice. Other more obvious repairs, like repainting or removing stained carpet, are also a must.

Our team works with hundreds of clients each year. We know what buyers are looking for, and **we’d be happy to offer you the necessary advice to help you earn top dollar.**
