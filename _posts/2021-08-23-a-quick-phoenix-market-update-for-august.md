Coming into the fall, there is less of a frenzy in the Phoenix real estate market than there was earlier in the summer. Instead of seeing 20 offers on every home, we’re seeing closer to five.

This is still a very strong seller’s market, and **I predict that buyers who got burnt out in the spring or summer will circle back to the market this fall**. With less competition and more inventory, this could be a great time for you to buy too. It’s still cheaper to own a home than it is to rent with today’s interest rates.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
