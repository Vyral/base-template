The question of “Are we headed toward a market correction?” is one of the most common inquiries I’ve been getting lately. So today **I am going to talk about the three things you should be focusing on if we are indeed headed toward a correction.**

First, make your investments with a five to seven year outlook. With a long-term plan, you’ll be just fine.

Secondly, California real estate has historically appreciated for over 7% if you hold the asset for at least five years.

Finally, the power of compounding. Real estate is one of the only asset classes that you can invest in with as little as 10% down. You can buy a million dollar asset for $100,000 in cash value and when you combine that with the fact that homes appreciate so rapidly around here, **you have a recipe for building wealth.**

 If you have any questions for me or you’re looking to get into real estate investing yourself, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to hear from you.
