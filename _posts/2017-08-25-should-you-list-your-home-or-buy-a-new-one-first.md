A question that’s come up quite a few times in the last few weeks deals with buying and selling at the same time. Which comes first? Do you list your current home or buy your new home first?

In most cases, you really have to list first, and here’s why.

If you consider the current market, many sellers are getting multiple offers on their homes. **Most homeowners won’t even consider an offer where a buyer has to list and sell their home first.** This is especially true if the buyer hasn’t even put their home on the market yet.

If the house is already listed or under contract, it really changes the offer in the seller’s eyes. If you find a home and then wait to put an offer on it so that you can list your own home, that property will be gone. The seller will have accepted an offer from a buyer who’s ready to move in.

There’s really no other way around it: you have to list your home first.

We understand that this is a really stressful situation for you. We do this type of transaction every day, and we help people through this scenario all the time. We’ve found over the years that there are three key things that we can do to put you into the best position.

The first thing we do is **pre-market your home for several days before showings.** While you’re looking for the home you want to buy, we’ll get the marketing set up. We’ll get the listing written, get all the paperwork together, and let other agents know that your home is coming for sale.

The second thing we do is **let buyers know that you’re selling and looking to buy.** We can get you as much time as you need to search for your home if we’re up front about your situation.

Finally, if an offer comes in then **we can negotiate how much time you will need** in order to make a smooth transition into your new home.

If you’d like to discuss this topic more in detail or you’re looking to buy or sell a home in our area, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to helping you.
