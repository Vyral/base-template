Today, I’m here with an update on an important statistic: where investors prefer to put money for a 10-year investment. This will show all of us where investing is trending, which is an important thing to know. You can see the graph of this information at 0:40 in the video above.&nbsp;

**According to this Bankrate survey in June 2022, 29% of investors said real estate was the best way to invest.** From there, 26% said the stock market, 17% said cash, 9% said gold and precious metals, 9% said bonds, 6% said Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and 3% said something else.&nbsp;

From 2021 to 2022, the number of people who said real estate and the stock market went up, but fewer people said cash. In addition, gold went up while cryptocurrency went down. I will continue to monitor how these things change.&nbsp;

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out. You can call or email me anytime, and I would be happy to hear from you.
