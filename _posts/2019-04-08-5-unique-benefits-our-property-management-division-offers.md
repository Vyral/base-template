Are you thinking of renting out an investment property? If you’re looking to hire a property management company to help you, you need to consider what kinds of benefits they offer before making a hiring decision.&nbsp;

Here are five unique benefits our new property management division offers to property owners who rent through us:&nbsp;

**1. We’ll find a tenant for your property within 30 days.** If we fail to find a tenant within this time frame, we’ll waive the leasing fee.

**2. No eviction guarantee.** If we find and place a tenant for you, but they stop paying rent and need to be evicted, we’ll cover the cost of that eviction. We’ll then find a new tenant to replace them without charging any leasing fee.&nbsp;

**3. Pet damage guarantee.** If you allow pets in your property and we place a tenant with pets in your property and they cause any damage that’s worth more than the security deposit, we’ll cover up to $1,000 of the cost.&nbsp;

**4. Cancelation guarantee.** If you’re not happy with our service, you can cancel at any time—there are no long-term contracts involved.&nbsp;

**5. Free property management program.** This guarantees that we’ll refund all the fees charged to you when you sell the property.&nbsp;

If you’d like to know more about what we offer if you rent your property through us or you have any more questions about our property management division, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
