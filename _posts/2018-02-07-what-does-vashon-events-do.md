  I recently got to sit down with Pete and Allison of Vashon Events. They are
  responsible for booking a number of live music events in our area. This is
  probably my favorite interview because music is so important to me. Pete and
  Allison are dedicated to our music scene, helping musicians, and helping those
  who may not have the resources to buy their own instruments. To learn more
  about Vashon Events, watch this short video.
