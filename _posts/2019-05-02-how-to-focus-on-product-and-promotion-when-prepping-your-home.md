&nbsp;

As we know, product and promotion are two of the four keys to marketing your home (the others being pricing and distribution), but how can you make sure you focus on these two keys so that your home sells quickly and for top dollar?

If you follow along in the video above, I’ll show you how you can by using these tips.<br><br>First, **start with a clear palate, which means you need to declutter and depersonalize**. Remove any oversized furniture and pack up any personal items, knick-knacks, and fragile items. Also, remove your valuables and any items that aren’t going with you to your new home. Make sure you keep your countertops and surfaces clear of any portable electronics, and if you have a pet, try to minimize any evidence of their presence.

When it comes to your deck and patio areas, bring the outside in by laying down some carpet and sitting up tables and chairs. Don’t tell buyers you have a great outdoor space—show them.

Also, don’t cheap out. Hire professionals to help you do the job. We have professional stagers and photographers on our team who would love to help you.

Lastly, **if you really want to turn your home sale into a blockbuster, you have to promote it well in advance**. Can you imagine if the producers of the next Star Wars film only started promoting it after it hit theaters? In this regard, your home’s marketing should happen both online and offline.
