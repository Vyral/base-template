Today I want to give you an update on the latest numbers and trends that we’ve seen in our real estate market. According to [chandlerreports.com](http://www.chandlerreports.com/Site/Default.asp), June was a great month and we saw a lot of promising trends, such as:

* Overall home sales are up by 8%.
* Average sale prices are up by 5%.
* Bank-owned property sales are down by 20%.
* Home sales over $500,000 are up over 30%.

**As far as that steep drop in bank-owned property sales is concerned, it’s actually a good sign for our market.** A drop in the number of foreclosed properties is good for your resale value. There are still foreclosures available out there, but they are a little harder to find now.

There is a chart below that shows the numbers for all the different municipalities in the area. As you can see, the average sale price has increased in Arlington, Bartlett, Collierville, and Germantown.

**The market is still very strong for sellers, but we aren’t seeing as many multiple offer situations.** If you have any questions about the market or about your home specifically, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I would love to hear from you.
