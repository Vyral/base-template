I recently had the pleasure of appearing on Pat Hiban’s Real Estate Rockstars Radio, where Pat interviews the top voices in the real estate industry. On this episode, you’ll learn:

1. A bit of my business background.
1. Why I decided to build a real estate team instead of becoming an individual agent.
1. How I close a deal per open house.
1. How long it took me to build a team.
1. How my ISA helps drive my business.
1. How many appointments I get thanks to the systems I set up within my team.
1. The biggest part of my business.
1. How to break through your goals.

That is just a sample of the great conversation I had with Pat HIban. You can listen to the **[full episode here](http://hibandigital.com/davefriedman/)**.

If you are interested in any of the resources we mention on the show, here is a complete list:
