I have an amazing home for sale on 12 1/2 acres with breathtaking views of Holy Hill, one of the most beautiful basilicas that you'll find anywhere in the country.

**The home is custom-built, and it's a 4 bedroom, 4.5 bath, 8,300 sq. ft. property**. The architecture is unique, with multiple A-frames and a copper roof that make it feel modern and quaint but also rustic and homey. There is also an in-ground swimming pool and an attached 4-car garage.

This property was built in 2011 by Wisconsin Log Homes, and you can see the beautiful mahogany woodwork on the front door. It's apparent that **a lot of love went into furnishing this home**.

There is a wet bar in the great room, and the kitchen is outfitted with all of the latest and greatest appliances. The ceilings are all vaulted, making this large property feel more like a castle than a home! The mudroom is large, which is perfect if you have kids. There's even a shower in the mudroom designed specifically for your dogs!

The master bathroom has a large Jacuzzi tub with dual fireplaces on each side, and the floors are heated. There is also a large walk-in shower with multiple shower heads, allowing for the **ultimate spa experience**.

The lower level has a theater room that can house up to twelve people, and there are an extra three bedrooms on that level with walk-in closets. There are also rooms that could be used as wine cellar or storage for hunting purposes. **A fully-equipped gym is also situated on the lower level**, and it has a sauna and a steam shower attached to it. Last but not least, there is a home gymnasium that attaches to a two-car garage.

This home also uses a geothermal heating system, and there are two tankless water heaters that were both installed very recently.

In the back of the property there is a fully-stocked pond that's 20 feet deep, and it's stocked with bass, panfish, and even walleye! On top of this, there are two deer-hunting stands.

**This home is listed at $3.25 million, but for someone who loves the outdoors, this is quite the steal**! Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you're interested or if you know someone who might be!
