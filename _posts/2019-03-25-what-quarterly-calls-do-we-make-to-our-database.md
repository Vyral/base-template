As agents, we know that we need to reach out to our database many times throughout the year. No matter how many database touches you shoot for, they need to be consistent, persistent, and strategic. 

To give you an example, I’ll talk about some of the quarterly calls my team and I have done in the past to stay in touch with our database. **Our goal behind this process is to reach out to everyone in our database (i.e., everyone we have a phone number for) four times a year. **

During the first quarter, we’ve picked a call that’s generic, informative, and provides value. In it, we’ll say something to the effect of, “Do you have any real estate plans this year? We’re just planning out our calendar, so we want to make sure we’re available and ready when you are.” It’s a simple, easy call inquiring for business in a nice way.

Another call we’ve used follows the “I’m in a contest” script from the BOLD class. This is an easy script that’s also a fun way to talk to people.

A call that we’ve used during the third quarter is our “concierge call.” For this, we just ask them if there’s anything we can do for them. We also share our HomeKeepr app with them in case they’d like to download it. 

Lastly, the easiest and most fun call to make is the “gratitude script,” which also comes from the BOLD class. Here, we simply tell them how grateful we are and thank them for helping us have a great year. 

Another thing we’ve done is combine these four calls with events we have already planned for the year that they’re invited to. Every single event is a way to give back to our database, and some examples include: 

* A pizza pie giveaway, happening March 14
* An upcoming Tulsa Drillers game
* A Thanksgiving pie giveaway, for which we’ll use the gratitude script

**The goal for these is to invite people we haven’t officially met yet so they can work their way into our inner circle. **

If you’d like to talk more or share ideas about how to connect with your database, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d love to speak with you.<br>
