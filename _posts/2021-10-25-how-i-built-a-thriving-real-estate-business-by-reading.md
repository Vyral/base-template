Last year, we did about $65 million in real estate sales, and we’re on track for $100 million in 2021. I didn’t wake up as the man I am today. I was fortunate enough to consume tons of content.&nbsp;

They say that you are what you eat. The same thing applies to what you read. Today I’m taking you on a journey through the 10 books that made my real estate career and business. They fall in the personal development realm, but they’ve all made an impact on my life and career:

**1\. “The Big Leap” by Gay Hendricks.** This book is about the limiting beliefs we have and how we limit ourselves. We have a thermostat at which we’re comfy, and if we go past it we push ourselves back.&nbsp;

**2\. “You Are a Badass at Making Money” by Jen Sincero.** This is all about the excuses we use that stop us from having enough money.

**3\. “The Power of Habit”by Charles Duhigg.** This is incredible. This talks about the actual science and power behind habit and how it makes or breaks us.

**4\. “Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?”** by Seth Godin. This is probably the first one that seriously impacted me. This is about being the best you can possibly be at your job and being the very best at what you're doing.

**5\. “Crucial conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High”** by Kerry Patterson. This is about the fact that most of what we want in our career and life is stuck behind some tough conversations with ourselves, our families, and our teams.

**6\. “Raving Fans” by Ken Blanchard.** This absolute classic is about how raving fans are the key to getting the most referral-based business.

**7\. “The Road Less Stupid” by Keith J. Cunningham.** This is made up of 40 bite-sized chapters and is phenomenal to listen to. It will prevent you from many self-sabotages as you build a business.

**8\. “The 4 Disciplines of Execution'' by Chris McChesney and Sean Covey.** This walks us through a simple four-step process to create success in your life.

**9\. “The Millionaire Real Estate Agent” by Gary Keller, Dave Jenks, and Jay Papasan.** As you’ll see, I actually bound my copy so I could take better notes. I use it all the time and the key to building a real estate business no matter what brokerage you’re working for. Most of the top producers in the industry use this as their model. It walks you through all the necessary steps to building a real estate company that endures.

**10\. “Shift” by Gary Keller, Dave Jenks, and Jay Papasan.** They wrote this book because of a crashing bubble, but it’s absolutely as valid in today’s market as it was in 2009. I have two copies of this book, and the first two real estate professionals that reach out to me, I’ll send you a copy. I highly recommend it.

**These are the 10 books that built our real estate company and saved me from mediocrity.** If you have any questions for me, head on over to [stegeorgerealestatecareers.com](https://stgeorgerealestatecareers.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and I’ll answer them for you.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.
