What happens on a listing appointment? Typically, sellers who contact us have a general idea of what the house is worth. Thanks to different sites like Zillow and Redfin, you can get a good approximation of what the home is worth. So why have us walk through the house?

First, we give our professional opinion. We let you know exactly what to do to net the most money for your home and sell it the fastest.

We also tell you what not to do. We have saved sellers thousands of dollars by letting them know what mistakes to avoid. Not long ago, a seller contacted us and we went on a listing appointment. He talked about renovating his entire kitchen and redoing a bathroom. We advised him to hold off on those major repairs and recommended some smaller fixes instead. Not only did he not have to invest all that time and money on renovating his kitchen, he also got $20,000 more than he expected thanks to our advice.

After the walk through, we send you a listing agreement. From there, we take professional photographs of your home. We have a great, unique marketing system that allows us to get multiple offers for our sellers.

At our listing appointments, we cover everything from A to Z. We have contractors and vendors available to help with the necessary repairs that will sell your home for top dollar.

If you have any other questions, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you.
