Here are a few different ways that you can win as a buyer in today’s market.

As you already know, our real estate is getting more competitive each day. A lot of buyers are worried about being able to find a home with limited inventory, but we’ve seen some bright spots recently.

**COVID-19 certainly dampened and delayed our market this spring, but in the last month, we’ve seen more people listing and showing their homes, and we're getting more access to more properties.**

Another thing that’s keeping our market active is interest rates. They’ve dropped in the last 30 days, and are historically low at this point. Homes are selling in an average of less than eight days, so you've got to be prepared as a buyer to make an offer right away.

**To find the right home in this market, the first thing you should do is hire a local, expert agent.** Do your research and find someone with lots of experience. The same goes with your lender. Local lenders know the market much better, can structure an offer to win, and provide greater peace of mind to buyers.

How you structure the offer is critical, and there are things we’re advising our clients to do that are really helping them be successful.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We’d love to hear from you.
