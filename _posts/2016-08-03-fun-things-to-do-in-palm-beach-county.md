People ask me all the time what my favorite things to do are in and around Palm Beach County. **There is so much to do that I don’t know if I’ll be able to get to it all, but I’ll try.**

 One place I love to go that’s great for the whole family is Lighthouse Cove Adventure Golf. They have two 18-hole courses, which are both beautifully maintained. They are North Palm Beach County’s premiere mini-golf courses. After you’ve played a round, you can go have a burger or ice cream sundae at their fast casual restaurant inside. They do corporate events as well as children's parties.

**South Florida has no shortage of great restaurants.** One of our favorites is <a href="http://www.roccostacos.com/" target="_blank>Rocco’s Tacos.</a> They even have multiple locations in the area, so you’re never too far from one. They make delicious tableside guacamole. <a href="http://www.utikibeach.com/" target="_blank>U-Tiki</a> is a great place too. They are right on the water, so you can arrive by car or boat.

 Another great restaurant is <a href="http://www.jupiterlighthouse.org/" target="_blank>Guanabanas.</a> At this place, you’ll enjoy beautiful views, outdoor dining, and great entertainment. When you’re done eating, you can head on down to their dock and hop on a paddleboard or kayak, which you can rent right there.

 If history is more of your thing, check out the <a href="http://harboursideplace.com/" target="_blank>Jupiter Inlet Museum.</a> It’s an amazing place, and you can even take a tour of the lighthouse.

**One of my favorite parts about Palm Beach County is the abundance of shopping, restaurant, and entertainment options available.** <a href="" target="_blank>Harbourside</a> in Jupiter, Downtown West Palm Beach, and City Place in Clematis are all great hotspots. Downtown Delray Beach is a great place, too, and has some of the most beautiful beaches around.

<a href="https://www.lioncountrysafari.com/" target="_blank>Lion Country Safari</a> is Florida’s only drive-thru safari where animals roam free and humans roam in cars. It’s really a special place.

 Our tour wouldn’t be complete without a trip to the beach. Many of our beaches in the area are world-famous. There are quiet beaches, touristy beaches, or pet-friendly beaches. You’ll love it.

 If you have any questions for us about any of the places we’ve talked about today, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
