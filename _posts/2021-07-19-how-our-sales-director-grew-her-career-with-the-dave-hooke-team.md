With the help of our hard-working team members, we’re able to make all of our clients’ buying and selling dreams come true. There’s so much that goes on behind the scenes, so today we’d like to introduce you to someone who plays an instrumental role in our business: Sales Director Drue Richmond.

**Drue wanted a job that allowed her to help others, so she was drawn to real estate and began her career in 2012.** She’s been with us for around nine years, beginning as a buyer’s agent and working her way up through numerous roles. Drue has always done a fantastic job, and her career trajectory reflects that.

Drue loves the challenges that each new day brings, as they give her a chance to learn, grow, and thrive. She’s helped us guide the team to where it is now—a real estate group that serves over 300 families each year—and she’s excited to help her fellow members grow throughout the future as well.

**We’d like to thank Drue for being such a valuable leader in our team—we truly appreciate everything she does.** If you’re looking to begin a career path in real estate that allows you to grow in a similar way, The Dave Hooke Team is always looking for new agents to add to our team. If you’re interested in joining our business, or if you’d like to learn more about what a real estate career is like, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
