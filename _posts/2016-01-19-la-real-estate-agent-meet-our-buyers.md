Today, we want to introduce you to James Lester.

James is a buyer specialist who joined the Brad Korb Real Estate Team in 2013. He left a nationally recognized real estate company and was able to sell two times the national average once joining the team.

By working with the Brad Korb Team in a team atmosphere, he was able to be mentored by a top-tier Realtor, coached by some of the top coaches, and provided the best systems available to agents.

The Korb Team's market introduced James to many clients, but there are a few that really stand out. One was a first-time home buyer looking to get into the highly desirable Burbank area of Los Angeles. James showed them a few homes, introduced them to a lender, and helped them settle in their dream home in the area they desired. He would love to do the same for you!

If you want to reach James directly, shoot him an email at James@BradKorb.com or reach out to the Brad Korb Real Estate Team. We would love to hear from you!
