What exactly is a home inspection and why is it important? We’re going to answer both of those questions today.

**A home inspection occurs when a licensed home inspector thoroughly inspects a property from top to bottom.** They will then give you a through report, preferably with pictures, that detail the problems and imperfections they found in the house.

A home inspector is very knowledgeable on city and state codes, and will let you know whether the systems in a home are in proper working order and up to date. **This also gives your Realtor a bit more negotiating power when it comes time to get a deal finalized.**

Why do you need a home inspection? Quite simply, this is one of the biggest purchases you’ll make in your life. Why not have an expert take a look and let you know exactly what you’re getting yourself into.
