*I’m sharing a few updates about how Kauai is doing amid the pandemic. Learn about unemployment, safety, and more here.*

Aloha, I have a quick update about Kauai amid the pandemic. If things continue to go as positively as they have been the last couple of weeks, soon the island will consider what our next steps will be concerning opening things up again. With an unemployment rate at 50% here, there’s a lot of concern about how to get back to tourism while keeping our island safe. We actually faired better than all the other islands in Hawaii, in terms of how we responded to the health crisis. Lately, our mayor has enacted stricter rules to keep the coronavirus at bay.
