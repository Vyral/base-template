Whatever you do, don’t start the new home building process without an agent’s help. You could be setting yourself up for failure without even trying.

We’ve been noticing that a lot of our clients over the years have misconceptions about how buying new construction homes work. We wanted to go through the process and clarify any questions you may have today.

**If you’re considering building a new home, it’s always best to go into the process with an agent who has experience working with and negotiating these kinds of deals.** You might think that you could save some money as a buyer by not using an agent, but you would be completely wrong.

If a builder knows you don’t have representation, they are going to run you over and you will end up overpaying for a property. Until you have an agent who knows what they’re doing when it comes to negotiating with these builders, you won’t have as successful of a home purchase as you could have had.

By working with an agent, you can get a lower interest rate, better upgrades, and other discounts that you wouldn’t be able to get on your own. **The expertise of an agent really pays off in situations like this.** If you’re working with one of our buyer’s agents here at the Dan Jones Team, let them know if you’re interested in this kind of property.

Speaking of our great agents, let me give a shout out to one of our new agents, Karen, who has been doing fantastic as of late putting homes under contract and is working with several new construction buyers right now.

In the meantime, if you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
