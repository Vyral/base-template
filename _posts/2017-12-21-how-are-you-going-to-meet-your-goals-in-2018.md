Whatever your goals for your business are in the coming new year, I’ve got a great tool to share with you that can help you achieve them.

This tool is a spreadsheet that will tell you exactly what your activities must be throughout the year to reach a certain income. **I’ve used this goal calculator for years and am actually going to be teaching a course on it soon**. If you’re interested in joining that class, let me know so I can get you enrolled.

Here’s how it works. You input your income goals into the calculator along with a breakdown of your business and a couple of easy conversions. For example, what percent of your listings go under contract?

This calculator breaks down your lead generation activities on the seller side of things as well as the number of clients you’ll need to work with on the buyer’s side to reach your goals.

I have all the metrics we’ve been measuring on my team for the last four years, so I can share those metrics with you if it would help. I can also give you some tips and tricks on leveling up your conversions.

**This calculator gives you an exact plan for meeting your goals.** It will also help you budget all the necessary expenses to run your business. &nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
