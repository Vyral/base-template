The new year is a time for changes in the market. I wanted to reach out today with a few tips about some changes that you should be aware of. I also wanted to give you a quick look at the current state of the market for buyers and sellers.

**The first thing you should be aware of in this market is some tax law changes that have taken effect.** Before I go any further, let me just say that I’m not a CPA and you should most certainly check with one before filing your taxes, especially regarding the changes to the mortgage interest rate decision.

Secondly, it’s time to file your homestead exemption if you purchased a home in 2017. The time frame you have to file the exemption goes from now until April 30. You can learn more about the process of how to do that in this video that I recently did on the topic.

For buyers out there, we still have a hot market where we’re seeing multiple offers. **I’m working with several buyers right now who are having a hard time finding properties to meet their needs.** Hopefully, more sellers will list their homes as we move into the spring. If you’re buying, you need to have all your ducks in a row and be ready to make an offer when you find the property that suits your needs. There will probably be several other buyers competing for the home as well. If you need any advice on how to win out in multiple offer situations, let me know and I’d be happy to give it.

As for sellers, this hot market makes it an incredible time to sell for top dollar. I think the market will continue to climb and continue to be strong for the foreseeable future. With the growth that we have here in the Austin metro, everything is looking strong.\*\* I’d be happy to share some of the strategies that I like to implement with sellers to increase demand and create a multiple offer atmosphere.\*\*

If you have any questions about the Austin real estate market or if you’re thinking about buying or selling, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
