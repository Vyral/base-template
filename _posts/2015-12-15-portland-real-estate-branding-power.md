Today I am going to talk to you about the power of a brand. There are so many studies out there that show you can see a symbol for a brand, and then recall the brand based on its marketing and your personal connection to it. To show you the importance of branding, I’m going to talk about my brand, “The Ask Sarita Team.”

As you can see in the video above, I have a circular business card, almost like a coaster. On this card in big letters it says “Ask Sarita,” which is my personal brand. I came up with this when I first started in real estate. I chose this specific phrase because I wanted to be a resource for my clients for any question they had about real estate.

Of course, we are always here to answer questions for those interested in buying and selling a home, but I have the knowledge and expertise to do so much more for you. Whether you’re building a deck and looking for the perfect material, or you’re needing to hire a plumber or electrician, I’ve got answers for them all. My scope goes well beyond just buying and selling homes.

If you have any questions at all, or someone you know has questions about real estate, I would love to answer them. I have lots of experience and knowledge, and I’m always willing to share. The power of the brand is the promise we deliver to our clients, and I’d love the opportunity to do that for you. I look forward to hearing from you!
