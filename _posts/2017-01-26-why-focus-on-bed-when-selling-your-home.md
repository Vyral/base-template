Bedrooms are one of the most important rooms for potential buyers to see. Here’s a tip to stage your bedroom properly.

**Want to Sell Your Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.com/list/" target="_blank">Get the Value of Your Central or Southwest Virginia Home</a>
**Looking to Buy a Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.net/" target="_blank">Search All Homes on the MLS</a>

The two things people look at first in a home are the kitchen and bedrooms. So how can you make your bedroom look more appealing to potential buyers?

**If you’re selling, the most important thing to remember about your bedrooms is to have the proper size bed in them.** Oftentimes, we go into a house with a regular sized bedroom that has a king bed in it. Frankly, I don’t even know how they got it in there. It may be how you want to live, but you don’t want the buyer to think that the room is too small. That’s what an oversized bed does.

In most standard houses, a queen bed is usually as large as you should go. If you can’t walk on either side of the bed comfortably, you probably don’t need a king bed in there. **If you have a trunk or bench at the end of your bed for storage, make sure that’s an appropriate size as well.**

If you have any questions for us about staging bedrooms or anything else related to real estate, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
