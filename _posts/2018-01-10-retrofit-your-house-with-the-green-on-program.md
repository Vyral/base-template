As you can see in the video above, I’m wearing my winter jacket inside. That’s because the windows behind me are old, leak cold air, and it happens to be -27 &deg;C out there!

If your house is anything like this, you’ll be really excited about a new program the government recently released called Green On. **This program offers a lot of rebates for any retrofitting you might want done to your home.** You can receive $500 per window up to a total of $5000. That’s a fantastic rebate!

If you’re interested in installing a geothermal system in your home, you can get up to $20,000 in rebates for that, as well as some insulation rebates and incentives. Another exciting part of this program is its air source heat pump incentive. You can get air source heat pumps for smaller areas like an office or an apartment you may have. They can provide both heating and cooling, and you can receive up to $4,800 per unit.

This is a wonderful time to put some money back into your home, which brings me to an important question we received after our last email: If I replace my windows, will it increase the value of my home?

The short answer is yes and no. A buyer may not see the value right away, but it helps in the negotiation process to maximize the value of your property.

If you need some windows or sliding doors, call a professional in your area or contact me and Ill put you in touch with one of my trusted professionals. These programs don’t last forever and they’re not around very often. I know I’ll take advantage of it, and I’ll be nice and warm in my office, just like I hope you’ll be nice and warm in your home.

Stay tuned for our upcoming market year-in-review for 2017. In the meantime, if you have any questions or you know of anyone looking to buy or sell real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
