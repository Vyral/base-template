*To know how much home you’re qualified to buy, there are several factors to take into consideration.*

If you’re thinking of buying a home, how do you know how much home you’re qualified to buy? Today I’m joined by Jake Bernhard (NMLS \#870775) of United Heritage Credit Union (NMLS \#630601) to answer that question.&nbsp;

First, **you need to know how much you’re comfortable paying each month mortgage-wise.** Then, look at how much you have for a down payment. The key is to find a house that fits within these parameters. You might be able to qualify to buy a certain home, but it may cost way more than what you’re comfortable paying each month.&nbsp;

Everybody is different—some don’t mind buying a house for the maximum mortgage amount they qualify for because they just want to get into that house; others prefer to keep a certain lifestyle (going out to eat, taking expensive vacations, etc.) after they buy a home. The question is, what’s most important to you?

Keep in mind that **there are other costs included in your monthly payment besides your mortgage payment.** For example, you may also have to pay escrow fees or your taxes and insurance costs. If you’re doing a loan with an escrow account, your lender pays these fees at the end of the year (or whenever they’re due). Each month, you pay a portion of these fees along with your mortgage payment. This all-encompassing payment is referred to as PITI (principal, interest, taxes, insurance).&nbsp;

There’s another payment referred to as PITIA, where the 'A' stands for assessments, or your HOA fees. This might be collected separately from your HOA instead of grouped into your mortgage payment.&nbsp;

When taking into account what you’re comfortable paying, Tax rates can differ depending on where you’re buying, and all HOAs are different so be aware of these factors when buying. If a lender qualifies you to buy based on your PITI but you decide to buy somewhere that requires a large HOA fee—say, a few hundred dollars per month—you might not be able to afford the home you want anymore.&nbsp;
