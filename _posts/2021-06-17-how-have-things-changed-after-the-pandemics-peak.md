What’s going on in the market now that we’re moving back toward pre-COVID conditions?

One of the main things we’re seeing industry-wide is **a return to many of the pre-COVID activities that were temporarily prohibited**. For example, we’re seeing more overlapping showings occur again when those were outright banned for part of the pandemic.

We’re also noticing more in-person closings where buyers and sellers can meet with the closer face-to-face to sign documents. We agents are also able to attend closings, which we haven’t been able to do for over a year. This is great for clients who have questions as we go through their documents. Additionally, we’re seeing in-person meetings between agents, which are networking opportunities that were put on the back burner.

In terms of the market, certain things haven’t changed all that much, like the low inventory and high demand for lakeshore properties, houses with pools, and vacant land. If anything, demand for those has only heightened since last year.

Not only are people now looking for homes that have different options for remote work and study, but **the recreational appeal of properties has also become increasingly important.** We’ve been getting a lot of requests from buyers looking for cabins, hunting land, camping land, and more.

In the end, some things are returning to normal, and some are staying just as they were during the height of COVID. We’ll keep you updated on any further developments in buying and selling trends as we see them.
