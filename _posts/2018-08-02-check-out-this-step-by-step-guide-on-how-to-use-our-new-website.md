Our new website is here, and today we are excited to give you a look at how to navigate all the features it includes. **Feel free to follow along in the video above for a step-by-step demonstration.** Even more so than in the past, our new website makes it easy to find the valuable, current information you need to pursue your real estate goals.

**As a reminder, you can find our website at [www.kauairealestatesearch.com](http://www.kauairealestatesearch.com){: target="_blank"}.** Once you’re at our home page, the first thing you will see is our convenient search feature. This tool allows you to look through properties in any area you’d like, whether you want to browse an entire ZIP code or just see a specific address.

After inputting your search, you’ll be shown all listings that match that criteria. You will also be able to see which properties are new, which have recently had a price reduction, which are pending, and more. The website will show you the most recently listed properties by default, but if you click the arrow at the top left-hand corner, below the Margolis Team logo, a drop-down menu will appear. This menu will let you customize how you’d like your results to be sorted, allowing you to sort homes by lot size, price, number of bedrooms or bathrooms, the year it was built, or square footage.

**By clicking on any of these search options, you can filter listings shown to you by any specific features or criteria you’re interested in.**

And just like on our previous site, you can still save all of your favorite listings by clicking on the heart icon displayed over each listing. These listings will then be compiled into one convenient “favorites” folder that you can access at any time.

Of course, **our website has great features available for sellers, as wel**l. Whether you’re seriously considering listing or are just curious about the market, clicking on the Home Valuation link at the top of our website will allow you to enter your street address and get an instant home-value estimate.

When you use this feature, you will be given a very accurate value range that reflects where your home stands compared to other comparable properties. If you would like a more in-depth analysis, though, please get in touch with me so I can give you a more thorough valuation.

Finally, **buyers, sellers, and homeowners alike will be interested in the last feature of our website we’re going to highlight today: our blog.** Clicking on the blog link will lead you to all our past posts, which include videos and articles just like this one. There are new entries twice a month, so be on the lookout for updates. We love bringing you valuable information so that you can stay on top of your real estate goals.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
