*In California, HOAs can’t unreasonably restrict condo owners from installing electric vehicle charging stations in their parking spaces.*

If you’re thinking of buying a condo, can you install an electric vehicle charging system in your parking space after you’ve purchased the property?

In California, Civil Code &sect;4745 says that an HOA can’t unreasonably restrict or prohibit a homeowner from installing an electric vehicle charging system in their designated garage or parking space (you’d still need to pay for the installation, however).&nbsp;

**This law also places time limits on how quickly the HOA must respond to your request** to install the charging system. They have 60 days to either approve or disapprove of your request, although this time frame may be delayed by a reasonable request for additional information.&nbsp;

In short, you absolutely can install an electric vehicle charging system, and HOAs are encouraged to act promptly to respond to your request.&nbsp;
