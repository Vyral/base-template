This video is especially for the buyers out there trying to compete with multiple bids. I wanted to give you a couple quick tips to help you obtain a home with multiple offers.
 
One thing that home sellers love seeing is letters. Write a letter to the seller of the home and include some pictures of you and your family. Let them know a little about you and why you love their home. If the owner is actually living in the house, you can always stop by and drop the letter off in person, and thank the sellers for considering your offer. A little personal touch can go a long way in a deeply emotional transaction like this.

Just wanted to share that quick tip with you today! If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, we are only a phone call away. Talk to you soon!
