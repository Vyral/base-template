Today I’d like to address an all-too-common myth that fools a surprising number of homebuyers: **“Forgoing the help of a buyer’s agent and working directly with the seller’s Realtor will allow me to secure a better price.”**&nbsp;

**That’s not at all the case.** I’ve brought this up in past videos, but when you work with one of our buyer specialists, it won’t cost you a penny. Unlike a lot of other agents in the area, we don’t charge buyer fees and no, you won’t end up paying more for the house.&nbsp;

If you’ve never sold a home before, take note: **When a seller meets with and subsequently hires a listing agent, they’re agreeing to pay a certain amount of commission to that listing agent.** Per our local board of Realtors and our MLS board, our mandate as agents is to cooperate with one another throughout the course of each transaction.

If I’m representing a seller and another agent in town has a buyer who’d like to purchase my seller’s property, assuming we close on the home, I’ll share half of the commission with that particular buyer’s agent. The buyer has no part in paying commission fees. The same is true for you if you’re working with a buyer specialist on our team. So as a buyer, you might want to think twice before you opt to work with a listing agent instead of hiring your own representation.&nbsp;

In addition, the listing agent's duty is to the seller, and no matter what, they’ll always place their client’s interest above yours. The truth is that the seller will pay the same commission to their agent, irrespective of a buyer agent’s involvement in the process. **Not having someone on your side who’s representing your interest will you put you at a major disadvantage in negotiations.**&nbsp;

Instead, **work with a buyer specialist on our team who will take their fiduciary duty to you seriously and will advocate on your behalf.** Since it won’t cost you anything extra, you literally have nothing to lose\!&nbsp;
