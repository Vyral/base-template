Recently, one of my team’s listings received two different offers within a few hours of each other. Receiving multiple offers is always a great thing for sellers, but only if the buyers who made them stay in touch. And, unfortunately, in the case of this particular listing, the first buyer to submit an offer went completely MIA afterward. Their agent couldn’t reach them, and it wasn’t until we had reviewed the second offer (and realized that it was a much better deal) that our team noticed the first buyer hadn’t even signed their offer. Of course, we went ahead and went under contract with the second buyer. So if you’re a buyer and want to make sure you don’t lose out on the home you want, you need to make sure you’ve crossed all your t’s and dotted your i’s before sending an offer to the seller. And, of course, stay in close contact with your agent throughout the process. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon. To learn more, watch this short video.
