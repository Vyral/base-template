<center><em>Here&rsquo;s a quick tip to help you present offers in a more personal way.</em></center>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

&nbsp; I get asked about how to present offers all the time. Because I deal with both buyers and sellers, the most common way I see offers presented is through an email with an attached offer and no narrative.

**Instead of simply sending over a digital version of the offer, I recommend taking a physical document over to the sellers.** Some of you may be thinking I’m crazy, but trust me that it works.&nbsp;

In our world of building relationships, actions like this matter. You’ll stand out to the seller and their agent because not a lot of other agents will take the time to present their client’s offer in person. It could end up being a game-changer for you.

If you have any questions for me about winning with your buyers or the real estate business in general, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
