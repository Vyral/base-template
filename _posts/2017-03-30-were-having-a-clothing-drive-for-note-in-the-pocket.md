Our guest Shelly works with Note in the Pocket, a small, local organization that provides two weeks of school clothes to children in our county who are living below the poverty line.

Unfortunately, there are over 53,000 children who are living below the poverty line in our area. Last year, Note in the Pocket was able to serve nearly 2,600 of those children. They are hoping to do more this year, and they need lots of school-appropriate clothing for both boys and girls.

If you don’t have any clothes to donate, you can visit NoteInThePocket.org to make a monetary donation, or send Shelly an email at shelly@noteinthepocket.org.

rare Properties will also be having a clothing drive from May 28th to June 4th. We will have bins set up at our office and we will gather clothes from friends, family, and clients. We can even pick up your donation if you don’t have time to deliver it. Again, if you don’t have any clothes, checks are always welcome.

We want to help these children, and we appreciate anything you can do.

If you have any questions, check out NoteInThePocket.org or give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
