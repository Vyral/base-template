There are a lot of benefits to building a new home in Mansfield, especially right now when we have low inventory.

Instead of waiting around to find the perfect home, you could build your own custom dream home! However, it does take 4-8 months to build a home, so if you're in a hurry, it may not be your ideal option.

When you buy a pre-owned home, it is a lot more cost-effective because you get a lot more home in terms of cost per sq. ft. New homes are often more expensive, but you have total control over the price when you're picking materials and amenities.

However, sometimes with resale properties, the previous owners have already customized the home and barred the expense, so you have to pay nothing for those upgrades!

If you're thinking of building a new home, I would advise you to use a Realtor when you're working with a builder, and I would be glad to represent you.

As always, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact me in regards to Mansfield real estate.
