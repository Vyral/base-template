It's that time of year when Santa Claus is coming to town! Regardless of whether you've been naughty or nice, **we want to invite you to join us at Lone Peak Park in Sandy, where we've traditionally held our events.** The date for this festive occasion is December 7, running from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. To ensure you can avoid the long lines at the mall, we're offering a sign-up slot this year. So, you won't have to wait for ages to see Santa â€“ you can skip the mall and create wonderful memories with us. We guarantee that we'll have the best Santa Claus in town each year.

In addition to getting your photos taken, you can savor gourmet hot chocolate and gourmet cookies. We'll also have prizes and giveaways for you. More importantly, **we encourage you to bring blankets, coats, and sweaters because we'll be donating them to the Road Home,** an organization in great need of these items during this time of year. Once again, don't forget to mark your calendars for December 7, from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., at Lone Peak Park.
