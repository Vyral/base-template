Santa Clarita is a great place to live. How do I know? I’ve lived here for years and there are a ton of great benefits to owning a home in this area.&nbsp;

**The main reason I moved here was for my kids.** I wanted them to grow up in a safe environment with a great school district. That was my No. 1 concern, a concern I share with a lot of people that choose to move here.&nbsp;

In terms of home value, you get a lot of bang for your buck in Santa Clarita. It’s an affordable place to live, which is always near the top of homebuyers’ lists.&nbsp;

A lot of people think that Santa Clarita is way off the beaten path, but it’s really not. I have season tickets to the Lakers and I’m able to get to the Staples Center in around 40 minutes. There are also a lot of great shops and restaurants here, so you aren't really missing out on anything in the city. **If you feel like you are, the good news is that you are still close enough to enjoy everything LA has to offer.**
