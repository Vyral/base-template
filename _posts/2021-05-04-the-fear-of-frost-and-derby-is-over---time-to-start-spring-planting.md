Today I’m at one of my favorite places in Louisville this time of year: *[Starview Greenhouses.](https://www.starviewgreenhouses.net/)* I’ve been here many times, and I love the amount of life in this area. I just can’t get enough.&nbsp;

**Starview Greenhouses is made up of 2.5 acres undercover, an acre of trees and shrubs, and another greenhouse with nothing but house plants, succulents, and cacti.**

They’re basically the same size that they’ve always been but were not allowed to grow as many plants last year due to the pandemic. As a result, they’ve amped it up for 2021. I usually come here to get tomato plants, which they have in several different varieties.

I always wonder what I should be doing now when I start to get ready for planting. According to Theresa Rahm, I should be mending my soils, getting my garden tilled, my containers ready.&nbsp;

If you’re just starting on planting, you might be wondering about a good plant that might not take a lot of maintenance. Starview has many different options. **They have tropical plants, plants that bloom during the day and close up at night, and window boxes that all flourish during the spring and summertime.**

If you want to come to Starview Greenhouses, head on down to La Grange Rd. right near the Oldham/Henry county line. If you love nature, what you’ll find here is spectacular.

If you have any real estate-related questions or needs I can assist with in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
