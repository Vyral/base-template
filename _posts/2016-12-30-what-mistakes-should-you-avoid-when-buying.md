We have just released a brand-new report that identifies the six most common and costly mistakes home buyers make when moving up to a larger home. When you are ready to move up, certain factors can make a situation more complicated than a first home purchase.

**Aside from the issue of financing, you also have to time the sale of your current home to avoid the real estate catch-22.** This is when you have to either bear the financial burden of paying for two mortgages, or have to find a place to live temporarily between closings.
