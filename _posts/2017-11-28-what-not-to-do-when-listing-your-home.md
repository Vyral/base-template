As you can see from our video bloopers, we all make mistakes. But some mistakes are more critical than others.

There are a lot of ways to succeed when listing your home, but there are just as many ways to fail. Today, we’d like to share the three major mistakes you should avoid when selling a house.

**1. Asking too much.** While you never want to sell your home for less than it’s worth, setting your sticker price too high can leave your property sitting on the market for months. If you aren’t sure how to price your home, an agent can give you their expert opinion on your property’s value.

**2. Advertising too little.** Your home isn’t going to sell itself. In this buyer’s market, you’ll need to do more than hire an agent and take an ad out in the paper. Make sure that you promote your listing on social networks and elsewhere online to maximize its exposure. {% include pullquote.html %}

**3. Not making your property presentable.**&nbsp; If you want to sell your home, it must look its best every single time it’s shown. Even a little bit of clutter can turn buyers off from your home.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
