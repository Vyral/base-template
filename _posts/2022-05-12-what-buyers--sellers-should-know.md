What impact will rising interest rates have? These increases affect not just real estate, but just about every other aspect of the economy. We brought in our residential real estate mortgage expert Ali Reda to break it down.

We’ve seen a lot of movement with respect to interest rates in the first quarter of 2022. We anticipated rates to go up—just not this quickly. As a result, **buyers are going to lose quite a bit of their purchasing power.** A buyer’s monthly payment for a house just a few months ago is now the same for a much less expensive house.&nbsp;

Likely, buyers are going to slow down their activities and weigh their options. Some of them might even exit the market temporarily. In the long term, **this slowdown will create a more balanced market,** since the presence of fewer buyers will increase available inventory.

If you’d like to get pre-approved for a new home or refinance your current home, contact Ali directly at (612) 940-6722 or by visiting [his website](https://www.envoymortgage.com/loan-officer/ali-reda-edina-mn/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

If you’re looking to buy or sell a home, give the John Schuster Group a call or send us an email. We’d love to help you get going.
