Today we’ll be answering a question for real estate agents: What do you need to know or learn when it comes to real estate investing? Here’s what you’ll need to keep in mind as you move toward a career in property investment:

1. **Don’t lose money.** The biggest principle we stand behind is that we won’t lose anyone’s money. Wealthy investors and those who have lost money before try to adhere to this rule.
2. **Work with a good team.** You want a team of people who can acquire properties at a good enough margin to accomplish your goals.
3. **Do the research.** Before investing in a property, you need to have a plan. Is it a home you’ll be renovating and selling for a higher price? Find out what you’d be able to make on a home, the cost of renovation, and if there’s enough margin to make a profit in the first place.
4. **Decide your marketing.** For good marketing, you’ll need professional photography, home staging, and minor home improvements. **You want to do what is needed to ensure your investment will sell for top dollar.**

We work with agents who are currently investing or wanting to start. Some want to weigh out investment amounts, and others want to do contracting, design, or marketing services. We also help clients acquire cash-flow properties for passive income. **There are many types of ways you can become a real estate investor.**
