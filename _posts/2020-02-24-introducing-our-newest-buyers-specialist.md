<center>We're proud to introduce you to Dana, the newest ISA on our team. Here's what she had to say about joining Team Lally.</center>


Dana, a lifelong Oahu resident, possesses refined customer service skills and in-depth market knowledge. As Team Lally’s newest ISA, her strengths have become tremendous team assets. We asked Dana some questions so that you can get to know her a little bit better, and here’s what she had to say:

**How did you hear about Team Lally?**

I first heard about Team Lally through my husband and sister-in-law, who’ve each had multiple transactions with the team. I was able to experience firsthand the expertise and quality of service that Team Lally exemplifies.

**Why motivated you to join Team Lally?&nbsp;**

I was motivated not only by my personal experiences with them, but also by their reputation in the real estate industry. My career history has always had an emphasis on customer service, and after seeing the great service Team Lally bestowed upon my family countless times, it was clear that service was a top priority for them as well.

**What do you enjoy most about working on the team?&nbsp;**

I enjoy that there’s constant learning and growth happening. There are so many talented people here on the team, which only benefits the level of service and expertise that we provide to our clients.

Now that I’ve shared a little bit about why I joined Team Lally, I look forward to helping you find the perfect home\! I’m here to assist you with any real estate needs you may have on the island, and I hope to become your favorite agent. If ever you need help, reach out to me at any time.
