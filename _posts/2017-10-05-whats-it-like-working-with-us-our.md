We want to share a few client testimonials we recorded from a viewing party of our guest feature on HGTV’s “Beachfront Bargain Hunt.”

 We recently had the pleasure of working with HGTV to film an episode of “Beachfront Bargain Hunt” right here in Atlantic Beach. We had a great time filming the show, and we’d love for you to tune into episode 13 of season 15 to see us on TV.

**Here are a few client testimonials from our recent viewing party of this experience:**

 From Bill and Fossie Latham:

“Lugean closed three properties with us in the course of about 60 days—one we bought, and two we sold. The thing I appreciated the most was, you know, whether you’re buying or selling can be a bit frustrating and emotional. I mean, there’s a lot of money involved, and Lugean, through the whole process, was very calm. She didn’t let you get too optimistic; she didn’t let you get too pessimistic. She kept everything on an even keel and things worked out wonderfully. We really appreciate what she did for us.”

 From Mahilda Barbee:

 “I worked with Lugean to buy my house when I was transferred here to open the state police credit union four years ago. She was so gracious to sell me a house in her neighborhood that not only did she sell me a house, but now I’m her neighbor.”

 From Dale and Norma Coley:

 “Lugean helped us find the absolute perfect condo in Atlantic Beach. She showed us at least 40 different condos and was very patient with us, and we ended up with the perfect condo. Lugean is the best.”

 From Sharon Pietzrak:

 “My husband and I met Lugean in August of 2014. She helped us buy our home, which was a foreclosure and was the first one she had done. She was just tenacious and got it done. Even after we lost it in an auction, she put in a backup bid, which we didn’t know she did, but it was a good thing because the deal fell through and she saved the day with that backup bid, and we’re so happy.”

**To see a few clips and photos from this viewing party, watch the video above.** It was great having the support of Bluewater Real Estate, our friends, family, and many of my clients.

 If you have any questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home here in paradise, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d love to help you.
