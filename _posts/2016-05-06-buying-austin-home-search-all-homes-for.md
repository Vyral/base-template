On average, about 1 in 10 real estate transactions will have an appraisal that does not meet the home’s market value. That can be a messy situation when you have certain deadlines and contingencies involved. **Luckily, there are a few options for buyers and sellers in this situation.**

It’s important to know **there’s not an exact science for appraisals.** You can hire 10 different appraisers and get a 10% to 15% difference in value on either end of the spectrum. The appraisal is only another person’s opinion of your property’s value, anyway.

**A buyer will pay true market value for your home. However, a bank can’t lend on whatever a buyer is willing to pay. The bank needs some way to protect itself in the instance a buyer defaults on the loan and can not make the payments. Appraisers are hired mainly to protect the bank.**

Here’s an example of an appraisal gone wrong.  A few weeks ago, an appraiser valued a property much lower than the actual market value should have been according to the comparable homes in the neighborhood. **The appraiser was from Dallas and trying to appraise a property in the Austin area.** That doesn’t make any sense, does it?

There were plenty of comps in the neighborhood and he used comps outside the neighborhood. In this case, **the buyers had to switch lenders and get a new appraisal done.** There are other options if something similar happens to you.

As a buyer, depending on the loan, you can **make up the difference, renegotiate with the seller, or terminate the contract.** On the seller side, **you can’t terminate the contract**. However, you can negotiate or drop the purchase price down to the appraised value. You can also decide to proceed with the agreed upon price.

**Sometimes we can get the appraiser to correct the report if something is blatantly wrong.** Other times, the appraiser won't admit a mistake. I’ve seen an appraiser not include the value of a pool on the property. That’s a lot of money that went unaccounted for. Sometimes, the bank will reject a report that is obviously wrong, but more often than not, they’ll go ahead and accept the appraisal.

There are some things we can do up-front to prevent any appraisal issues, so give us a call if you’re concerned about appraisal issues or if you have any other questions. We would be happy to help you!
