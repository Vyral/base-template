*The power of the mastermind is undeniable. We’d love for you to join us on the last Friday of the month for one.*

<a href="https://www.teamlally.com/open-positions.php">Check Out Our Career Opportunities</a>

Today we want to talk about the power of the mastermind.

Dr. Napoleon Hill calls the mastermind “the key that will open the door to your desires,” whatever they may be. He defines it as two or more people that work in perfect harmony for the attainment of a definite purpose.

**We want to bring this to you, so we’re holding a mastermind session in our Kapolei Business Center.** We do this every month on the last Friday of the month from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. The agenda is filled with topics that, if implemented, will make you more money in 2017. The invitation is to anyone interested in learning our secrets of success.

These secrets helped us generate over $82 million in sales in 2016 and we are going to share them with you. Now, we know that you’re thinking we won’t really share our secrets, but you’re wrong. **We have learned that it is good to be abundant-minded and that sharing is caring.**

If you still don’t believe us, <a href="https://www.teamlally.com/kw.php">RSVP here</a> and bring your questions to us on the last Friday of the month. In the meantime, take a look at <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/chicceo/2013/10/21/7-reasons-to-join-a-mastermind-group/#38b986e817ab">this recent Forbes article</a> we found that will give you seven better reasons to join a mastermind.

If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. Thanks and aloha!
