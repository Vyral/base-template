&nbsp;

After a hail storm hits, there are a few steps all homeowners will need to take.

**The first step on this list will be to contact a local contractor and ask for a free property inspection**. During this inspection, the contractor will be able to identify and assess the extent of any potential damage.

If any damage was found, the contractor will submit a property damage report. Regardless of the findings, **your next step will be to contact your insurance agent**. They need to be made aware of the fact that an inspection took place, whether or not any damage was found. Contacting your insurance agent directly, rather than calling the company, will make sure the call isn’t immediately counted as a claim.

Once you’ve made this call and have scheduled a time for your agent to visit **the property, the third and final step you should take is to educate yourself on which repairs you’re entitled to**. If feasible, having your contractor there during the appointment will greatly enhance the experience.
