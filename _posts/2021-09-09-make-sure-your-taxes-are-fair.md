Today we want to discuss how to appeal your property taxes. Some people were shocked when they received their property tax notice. We want to address how we can help you appeal if you feel like your taxes are a little too high.

Along with your property taxes, there should be an appeal form. Look it over and fill it out; that form will ask you for a few things. **You can't just appeal your property taxes if you feel that your condition is bad, your carpet is worn out, or you haven't mowed the lawn in a while.** You need to have verifiable evidence, which is either an appraisal or comparables in the tax year. Real estate professionals can provide you comparables. If you go to an appraiser, they'll charge you $600.

Take that appraisal or those comparables and either mail or email them to the county. They'll look them over and either issue an approval of that tax appeal or a denial. If they issue a denial, you have another opportunity. You can appeal that denial and meet with the county representative in person to discuss what your values are and see if you can come to a reasonable agreement on where your taxes should be.
