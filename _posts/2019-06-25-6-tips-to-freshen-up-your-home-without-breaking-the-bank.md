<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you’d like to improve your home’s saleability, I have six tips to help you.</em></p>

Here are six tips to help you freshen up your home and improve its saleability in buyers’ eyes:&nbsp;

**1\. Rearrange the artwork and decorations.** You can shuffle things around, for instance, to direct people’s view toward some of your home’s nicer features.&nbsp;

**2\. Replace your simple fixtures.** All you need is a screwdriver to replace your cabinet hardware and give it a more updated look. Your kitchen sinks are another area you could focus your attention on in this regard.&nbsp;

**3\. Repaint.** This can include toning down a certain color or giving your walls a warmer feel. Fresh paint always looks good, and it leaves behind an appealing scent for buyers.

**4\. Add new caulk to the shower/tub areas.** This will keep these areas from looking old and unkempt.

**5\. Change your linens.** If you use newer, pleasant-looking colors, this will make your home look dressed-up without coming off as too “loud.”

**6\. Add plants around the house.** Potted plants and flowers make a home look like the owner enjoys living there.&nbsp;
