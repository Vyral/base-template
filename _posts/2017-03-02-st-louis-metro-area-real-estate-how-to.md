Making an offer on a home is a delicate process. Here’s how you should go about it.

Buying a home? <a href="http://www.stlouispropertysearch.net/" target="_blank">Click here to perform a full home search</a>

I often get asked the same question by buyers who are unaware of what a home’s value really is. They ask me, “How much should I offer on this house?” **They love the house and don’t want to lose it, but they don’t want to overpay for it, either.**

One of the first things I do after going through the home a few times is finding comparable properties in the neighborhood. I take a look back at least six months to determine what similar homes have sold for in the area. I look at the house like an appraiser, comparing its features and condition with the other homes that have recently sold.

Let’s say a home is priced at $300,000. If you try to apply a percentage to that and say you’re going to offer 5% or 10% below asking price, you could end up paying more than you need to. What if the home is already 10% overpriced? You’re not really getting a deal in that case. **By knowing what similar homes in the neighborhood have sold for, you will be able to make a valid comparison and a fair offer.**

If you’re going to live in the house for seven or more years, don’t let the price keep you from making an offer. **If you really love the house, you should go for it.** In the long run, you’ll be significantly happier with the house you love than a house you had to settle on because of budget constraints.
