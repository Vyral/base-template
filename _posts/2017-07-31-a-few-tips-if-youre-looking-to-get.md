How can you stand out in this competitive market? We have the answer.

**Want to sell your home?** <a href="http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/free-home-value/" target="_blank">Get a FREE home value report.</a>
**Want to buy a home?** <a href="http://www.vegascapital.com/index.php/homes-for-sale-search-advanced/" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale.</a>

We’re lucky enough to be joined today by Monica with CrossCountry Mortgage. She is here to give us some more information about what’s going on in this crazy market.

As you’re probably already aware, Las Vegas is a strong seller’s market right now. With many more buyers than sellers, what’s the best way for a buyer to prepare to get the home they want? According to Monica, it’s getting a pre-approval. Don’t settle for a quick pre-qualification. A fully underwritten approval with verified income and assets is what you’re looking for. **It only takes a few days, and then you can go home shopping with confidence.**

If you’re a seller in this market, Monica says not to accept an offer from a buyer who doesn’t have a fully underwritten approval because they might not actually be able to buy your home. Their income and assets should be verified as well.

If you have any questions for Monica, you can give her a call at (702) 339-8221. If you have any other questions for us, you can always give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
