Why are pre-listing inspections great, positive things for home sellers to do? There are three main reasons.

First, **a pre-listing inspection will uncover things you may not know about.** If these surprises are eliminated, it could keep the buyer at ease and make the whole transition go smoother. Many times, inspections uncover things that could have been prevented fairly easily and can scare buyers. During a pre-listing inspection, if something like a leaky roof is discovered, you can get that taken care of so it doesn’t come up again during the buyer’s inspection.

**Pre-listing inspections can also save you a lot of money.** Whatever issue shows up in the pre-listing inspection can be remedied ahead of time by the right contractor for a reasonable fee up front. If the same issue comes up later, that might send the buyer into a panic mode and turn it into a huge expense.

Lastly, **a pre-listing inspection also increases your home’s marketability** and separates you from your competition because most other sellers haven’t done a pre-listing inspection.

If you have any other questions about the benefits of pre-listing inspections or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
