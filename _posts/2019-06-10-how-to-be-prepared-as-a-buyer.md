With many buyers competing over the limited number of listings available in today’s market, is it even worth starting a home search today?&nbsp;

Actually, it depends. If you’re not serious about finding your next home, you can go ahead and wait if you wish. However, if you’re truly ready to make a move, then don’t let today’s competitive market conditions deter you from your goals.

**The key to successfully finding and securing a property today is simple: You’ve got to be prepared.** This means getting pre-approved before you ever start looking at homes. Then, once your finances are in order, you can start checking out properties you’re interested in.&nbsp;

When you start choosing homes you’d like to make an offer on, however, realize that you’ll likely pay more than the list price. The kind of value a given home can command in a competitive market will be a better measure of what you can expect to pay than the list price, itself.

**If you know the market and are prepared to compete, your chances of succeeding as a buyer will be much higher.** You can’t be afraid to put yourself out there. If you want to win, you must come to the table with your highest and best offer from the start.
