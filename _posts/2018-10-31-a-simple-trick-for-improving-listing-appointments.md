One of the secrets to our team’s success is the fact that we send out pre-listing video emails to our potential seller clients. **This not only helps them to put a face to our brand, but it also helps demonstrate that we have the tools they’ll need to succeed with their home sale. **

And to give them an even more thorough understanding of what we do, we also like to send out our listing manual. The reason we do this, along with asking clients to list the features they love about their home, is to help guide our clients through the smoothest possible listing process. For this same reason, we also ask that they fill out a listing disclosure at this point. That way, **clients can be set on the right track before we ever meet for our listing appointment. **

In addition to these materials, we also send out links to our online reviews. People these days almost always do their research online before making a commitment to a given professional. So, why not direct clients straight to the information that’s out there about you and your team? This is sure to instill a high level of confidence in your service.

The last thing we ask in conjunction with what we’ve already touched on is that our clients complete some “homework.” When your clients give you relevant information about their home right at the beginning of the process, you will both be in a better position to succeed. Getting all of this out of the way before you meet up at the listing appointment allows you to spend more time when that time finally does come **on building rapport and asking key questions, instead of trying to convince them to work with you. **

Best of all, putting this plan into action yourself doesn’t have to cost you a thing. Making a pre-listing video to send out can be as simple as filming a video on your YouTube channel and attaching it to an email with the links and materials we mentioned earlier. 

**You can see what our team sends as our pre-listing video on our private Facebook page “Journey with Jennie.”** If you aren’t already a member of that group, go visit and ask to join. You will find a wealth of knowledge and resources there, so don’t miss the opportunity to see what this page has to offer. 

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
