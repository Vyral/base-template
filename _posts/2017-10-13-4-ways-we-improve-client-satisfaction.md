What is the number one thing that affects customer or client satisfaction?

It’s the same thing that affects all interpersonal relationships from friendships and marriages to business partnerships.

In fact, if all else is equal—meaning that the agent is honest, genuinely works hard, and is knowledgeable about the market—**this one thing goes the longest way to define customer satisfaction.**

If you guessed that I’m talking about communication, then you are correct.

On my team, one of the things we focus on is checking in with our listing or buyer clients once every seven days. When we contact them, we cover these four things:

1.) Here is what we did last week.

2.) Here is what the results were.

3.) Here is what we’re doing next week.

4.) What can we differently or better?

**If you can ask those four things every seven days, you will be a proactive agent** rather than a reactive agent. By being proactive, you will run your business instead of allowing your business to run you.

Communicating with your clients this way creates happier relationships, happier customers, and more referrals for you and your business down the road.

If you have any other questions or if you would like to share something that you do to grow your business, just give me a call or send me an email. I would love to have a conversation with you.
