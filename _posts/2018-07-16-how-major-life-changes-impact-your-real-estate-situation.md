Today I want to share with you a few tips for dealing with your home through major life changes. Try as you might, you can’t plan your life out fully. Sometimes things just happen, which is why I have a few scenarios where life makes a decision for you and how you should respond.

**1. Losing your job.** If you find yourself in this position and can no longer afford to pay your mortgage, there are some options. The first is finding another job quickly. Even if you don’t, there are multiple avenues that you can pursue. Don’t just list right away or walk away from your home.

**2. Divorce.** Unfortunately, this situation is more common than we would like. If you’re in this situation, you have options as well. You can sell the home, or one of the spouses can offer the other a buyout. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all deal here. It’s important to contact a real estate expert before making any irrational decisions, which can be tempting in this situation.

**3. Losing a loved one.** You need time to grieve, but the real estate market isn’t always so empathetic. If you or someone you know has this happen, we would be happy to help explain your options and help make things just a bit easier at this tough time.

If you have any questions for me about any of these unfortunate situations and what you can do to remedy them, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
