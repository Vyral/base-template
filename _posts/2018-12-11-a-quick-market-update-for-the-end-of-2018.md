Our market was great this year, and here’s why.

Today we have a quick market update to share with you. **Our area had a great market this year with strong sales in all price ranges.** We have 810 homes currently on the market, which is an increase from last year where we saw a range between 650 and 710. We have 241 pending sales at the moment, which equals 241 excited families who are able to move into a new home over the holidays.&nbsp;

**If you’re looking to buy or sell in the near future, reach out to us**; we can get you ready to go for the spring housing market frenzy (which begins January 2).&nbsp;

In the meantime, happy holidays!&nbsp;
