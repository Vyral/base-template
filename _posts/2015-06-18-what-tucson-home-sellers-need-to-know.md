It's June right now, which is a fantastic time to sell a home in Tucson. Today I'd like to speak to the home sellers in the area and let them know how to take advantage of this market.

Homes that are priced above $300K are seeing a buyer's market right now, meaning we have a lot of supply and not enough buyers to respond to the supply. This is great news for home buyers, but sellers will have to be strategic because buyers have the upper hand right now.

If you're trying to sell in this price range, I recommend speaking with a Realtor who knows your area and who can pinpoint an attractive price for your home. If you can price it right at market value, you have a chance to sell quickly and for top dollar.

I would love to help you with this, so please don't hesitate to contact me if you're looking to sell your Tucson home this year.

I look forward to speaking with you!
