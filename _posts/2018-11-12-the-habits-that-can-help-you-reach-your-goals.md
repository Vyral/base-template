Do you know what it takes to reach your goals? Our team recently had a meeting that helped answer that question for all of our agents by outlining the specific habits of highly successful people that we can all implement in our day-to-day lives in order to reach our goals.

**For your convenience, I’ve provided timestamps of our meeting so that you can jump ahead to the section(s) that interest you the most:**
