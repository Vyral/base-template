This fall, we’ve seen a lot of contingent purchase agreements. While most purchase agreements have built-in contingencies for financing or association documents, the contingency we’re referring to here is the home sale contingency.&nbsp;

Despite not being particularly common during the rest of the year, **the past five purchase agreements we’ve received this year have come with such a contingency.** One of the reasons we believe this has been the case is that buyers today have a strong desire to secure a home before sellers begin to pull their listings off the market for the holidays.

The increased frequency of contingency offers may also have something to do with the low inventory we were seeing in the recent past. While supply was depleted, it was difficult for contingent buyers to compete. Now that things have cooled down a bit, contingent offers have a far better chance of succeeding.&nbsp;

From a seller’s perspective, though, the question remains as to whether such offers should be accepted. As Realtors, we can honestly say that at this time of year, accepting a contingent offer can be a good idea. Ultimately, though, it will depend on the time of year you’re selling and on your specific market. With that said, **sellers who receive a contingent offer should realize that they have the steering wheel in their hands.&nbsp;**
