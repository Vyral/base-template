Instead of talking about real estate today, I wanted to introduce you to our newest team member: My 6-month-old daughter, Charlotte.

I just wanted to show you one of the biggest reasons why we’re in business. My daughter, Charlotte, is only 6 months old, but she is going to be with us for a very long time. Hopefully, she’ll be answering some of our phone calls in the near future.

She is my big reason why we do all that we do for our friends, family, and clients. To see her full debut, watch this short video.

In the meantime, if you have any real estate-related questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
