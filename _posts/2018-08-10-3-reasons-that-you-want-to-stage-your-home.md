Today we are going to talk about the three reasons staging your home is one of the keys to getting it sold quickly and for top dollar.

**1. Staged home helps you have better listing photos.** The very first showing is not whenever potential buyers come into your home to look around, but instead when they look online. By having your home staged with furniture, it allows us to showcase your home better online so that buyers are more likely to come and look at it.

**2. It helps buyers know how they would live in the space.** Buyers want to see how they would live in your home. However, they sometimes have a very tough time trying to imagine where to put their own TV and bed. By having your home staged, it allows buyers to easily see where they may be able to put their own things, which helps sell your home faster.

**3. A staged home helps you stand out from the competition.** Whenever a home is vacant, there are more nicks on the walls because there are no pictures and the carpet looks more worn. At the end of the day, a home that is vacant does not get the best showcase either online or in person. By having it staged, you will get top dollar.

I encourage you to get your home staged. We have a wonderful vendor list for this that includes Miss Shannon Hawkins of Refresh Your Nest. You can visit her website [**here**](https://www.refreshsc.com/){: target="_blank"} to learn more.

If you have any additional questions about staging or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to contact me by phone or email. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
