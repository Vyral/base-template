Carpeting can be a hotspot for germs and allergens for homeowners. Many choose instead to furnish their homes with **flooring**, whether it’s wood, vinyl, tile, or laminate. To help you gain an understanding of what there is to choose from, we’re joined today by **Brandon Craft of Floors & Interiors** to talk about four types of hard-surface flooring:

**&nbsp;1. Tile.** Porcelain tile flooring is very popular in homes today. Once it’s installed, it’s highly unlikely it will ever crack or break. The tile we showcased looked exactly like wood—Brandon himself has tile flooring throughout much of his home. It’s a worry-free flooring to have.

**&nbsp;2. Vinyl plank.** This is a more economical solution for customers, and we actually put this type of flooring in our rental houses. Vinyl plank comes in pieces so it’s very easy to change out parts damaged by tenants—there’s no need to tear up the entire floor. We keep the extra product for when we need to make a quick fix.

**&nbsp;3. Hardwood.** Hardwood is a very desirable type of flooring—it’s the real deal.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Scratches and scuffs to the wood end up looking like part of the flooring.

**&nbsp;4. Laminate.** This has a lot of similarities with hardwood but is about half the price.

These samples were just a small selection of the flooring you can choose for your home.
