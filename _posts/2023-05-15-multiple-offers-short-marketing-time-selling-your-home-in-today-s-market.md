If you are thinking of selling your home but are a little hesitant about getting into the market, then it's time to wake up because spring is here, and the housing market is really starting to stir. Some of our busiest months are March through May, so once June and July set in, we slow down a bit because of the fishing season and going into hunting season in the fall.

**This is the perfect time for any of you thinking about selling your home to get it done.** Right now, we would say that as sellers, you're probably in the best place you've ever been in this market. As soon as we put a property on the market, we see multiple offers coming in. Marketing time is very short, and most homes are typically going for higher than the full price.

We have so many ready buyers in our pockets right now that want to buy homes. If any of you are thinking about selling but don't want to deal with the listing of the house, going through all the showings, and the cleaning and decluttering, please get in touch with us. We may have a buyer that fits your needs, and we always like to run things through MLS, **but the more important thing is not having to do tons and tons of work.**

We all know that selling a home is a lot of work because you have to get it prepared. At times, TV shows like HGTV have somewhat ruined our lives because everybody expects homes to look like they belong on HGTV. If any of you want to take a shortcut and are thinking about it, give us a buzz. We understand that some people are holding back because they don't know if they're going to have a place to look. But with us, you can start looking and find the right place before putting your house on the market.

That's what we do best at the Dar Walden Team. We specialize, with our buyer's agents only working with buyers and our seller's agents only working with sellers. If any of you are thinking about selling your home or buying a new one, please give us a call at (987) 240-2804 or reach us at dar@darwalden.com. Have a great week!
