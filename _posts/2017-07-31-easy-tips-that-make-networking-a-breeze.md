Networking is an essential part of any career. However, it can also be a task which some find overwhelming.&nbsp;

Like trips to the dentist, networking is something you know you’re supposed to do, but would really rather not. This is especially true for people are simply introverted by nature.

But today I have some tips that can help you become proficient at networking. First of all, **make yourself the kind of person that people want to meet.** There are a few ways to do this. One way is to become an expert in your field. You can also be someone who is highly aware of the changing dynamics in your industry.&nbsp;

Offering your help to people who need it is going to be a great way to put yourself out there as the kind of person people want to meet and know.

This leads into our next tip, which is to be more interested in other people than you are in yourself. Many people you’ll encounter in both life and business will be happy to have the opportunity to talk about themselves. When you show genuine interest in the people around you, they’ll be much more interested in you in turn.&nbsp;

Networking is about quality, not quantity.

However, with that being said, you should put yourself out there in as many ways as you can. A great way to do this is by using business cards. But merely going out and handing your business card to everyone you meet will not be effective. **The best way to use your business card is to give it out as part of a trade.**

When you give out your business card, it should be to someone from whom you are receiving one. When you get that business card, write down something relevant to the conversation you had with that person so that when you follow up with them it’ll be much easier to reconnect.&nbsp;

Finally, joining a club can be another great way to network. Pick a club you are genuinely interested in, and you are sure to meet members with similar interests.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
