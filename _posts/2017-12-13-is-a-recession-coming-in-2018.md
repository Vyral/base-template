Let me get this disclaimer out of the way first. I’m not a CPA or an attorney, nor do I have a crystal ball. That being said, you’ve probably heard some rumors that our market is headed for a recession. It’s definitely possible. Historically, we see one every eight to ten years. Right now, we’re overdue.

**If a recession is coming, you need to determine whether or not you can see yourself in your current home for the next five to ten years.** If you can’t, it’s a good idea to take the equity and buy a new home that you like now. Buying now will allow you to lock in a low interest rate and an affordable monthly payment. If you’re happy where you’re at right now and can see yourself there for a while, you can keep building equity.

If you’re not a homeowner and want to continue renting, that’s fine. However, homeownership is a fantastic opportunity to build wealth. If you keep renting over the next 30 years, you’ll keep paying $2,000 for rent every month and not a cent of it will go toward your net worth. If you choose to buy a home and make a similar payment each month, you will eventually pay off the home and have an asset worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. **Where do you want to be in 30 years?** Still renting? Or debt-free and with a valuable asset?

If you have any questions for me about the market or about buying or selling a home, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
