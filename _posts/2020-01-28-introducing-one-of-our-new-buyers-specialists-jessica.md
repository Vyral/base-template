Jessica was born and raised in The Windy City and moved to Hawaii back in 2006. As one of Team Lally’s newest buyer’s specialists, she’s eager to give back the same level of expertise she’d received as a client. We asked Jessica some questions so that you can get to know her a little bit better, and here’s what she had to say:

<br>**How did you hear about Team Lally?**

I learned about Team Lally back in 2006 when Adrienne walked me through the purchase of my very first townhome on Oahu. Since then, the team has represented my family in six other transactions, so you can definitely say that I discovered first-hand Team Lally’s expertise and outstanding customer service.

**Why motivated you to join Team Lally?&nbsp;**

The long-term relationships that the team maintains with their clients, along with their efficiency and professionalism, drove me to join this amazing group. Over the years, I’ve witnessed Team Lally absolutely thrive, and I’m honored to be a part of the No. 5 real estate team in the state of Hawaii.

**What do you enjoy most about working on the team?&nbsp;**

We’re all working toward the same goal here. We truly do help and rely on each other to provide the greatest level of service to our clients. I love that I’ve experienced a full circle: First, I was an impressed client, and now, I’m a determined agent.&nbsp;

For anyone out there interested in buying or selling a home, I’d love to be your No. 1 agent\! Feel free to reach out to Team Lally if you want to know exactly how I can help with your unique situation.
