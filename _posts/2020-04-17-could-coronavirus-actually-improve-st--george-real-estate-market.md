<p style="">Friends and
clients –&nbsp;

<br><br>

Is everyone
maintaining at least a <i>shred </i>of sanity? We’re doing our best at The
Larkin Group but it ain’t easy!&nbsp;

<br><br>

Coronavirus
kicked pretty much everybody’s butt even if we never get within 6 feet (did you
see what I did there?) of the actual virus.&nbsp;

<br><br>

And because the
last economic meltdown still haunts our memories, folks are asking questions
about what this all means for our home values and whether another housing
crisis is looming.&nbsp;<br>

<br>
We don’t think so. But we’ve got real answers. Unvarnished. And I think it will
help. First, our video on the topic of Coronavirus potentially <i>helping </i>our
market!<br></p>

{% include youtube.html %}

<p style="">At the Larkin
Group we are BOTH <i>taking this crisis seriously</i>, and at the same time, <i>staying
optimistic</i> about the future of our St. George real estate and economic
markets. <br><br>

 
Contrary to
what loads of unprepared, airy-fairy Realtors believe, it’s possible to <u>do
and feel both</u> at the same time!<br><br>

 
<b>Here’s what
you need to know:</b></p><ol><li>People are still
buying and selling homes. Every day. Thankfully, we’ve closed 21 transactions
for our real estate clients since March 1, and we’re just a tiny percentage of
the total market. If you’d like a list of those homes I will be happy to share.
<br><br>

</li><li>That said, FEWER
people are <i>currently </i>buying and selling, and why wouldn't they be? The
world is closed. Your gym is shut down, you can’t go to the movies and the major
media is on a 24/7 fear broadcast. It’s going to affect sales volume
temporarily. <br><br>


<i>Any
Realtor who pretends it’s not affecting the market may be well intentioned, but is sailing down
“denial”, and trying to take <u>you </u>with them!</i><br><br>

 
</li><li>This is NOT a
housing crisis. It’s a health crisis that's affecting everything. The housing
market, and the economy, came into this crisis strong. The housing market is
actually <i>still </i>strong.&nbsp; See our last video on this <a href="https://youtu.be/Ol-aP8YyIcA" data-type="url" data-name="Strong Housing Market">HERE</a>.<br><br>



</li><li>If you're selling
a home right now <u>you don't get to ask an extra 5-10%</u> "<em>just to
see what happens.</em>" This is a time to be SERIOUS about your pricing,
which is still likely much higher than it was 2 years ago, and <u>take
advantage</u> of current values. <br><br>

 
We
can help you set the right price so your home actually sells whilst the rest of
the market is sitting around wondering what the heck happened. <br><br>

 
</li><li>This too shall
pass. The big economic "<em>theys</em>" like JP Morgan and company are
predicting a quicker <a href="https://www.simplifyingthemarket.com/en/2020/03/23/economic-slowdown-what-the-experts-are-saying/?a=230975-fd0905f6e0a07e5db6729e559fe88897" data-type="url" data-name="&amp;quot;V&amp;quot; shaped recovery">"V"
shaped recovery</a> rather than a slower "U"
shaped recovery. <br><br>

In
other words, they’re predicting a “bounce back” over a slower,
“l-a-b-o-r-e-d…recovery.” This is because historically, economic “incidents”
that happen rapidly then to repair themselves rapidly, and the opposite (see
2008 crash) is also true.<br></li></ol>

<p style=""><b>Could
COVID-19 actually <em>strengthen </em>the St. George Real Estate Market? </b><br><br>

 
This may sound
nuts, but as I articulated in the above video, demand isn’t going away. If
anything, more folks from major metros will start looking at the calamity this
pandemic inflicted on their lives and say, “<i>you know Marge / Bob / Fido,
we’ve been wanting to get outa’ dodge for a decade. I think it’s time to set
sail!</i>” <br><br>It’s one
theory. A positive theory. We need positivity in this world. <br><br>

 
We are prepared
to do whatever it takes to adapt to the changing market, and help you buy or sell
your property. Period. <br><br>
