Do you know what the most powerful marketing tool ever invented is?

If you haven’t guessed, **it’s the MLS.** That’s right—the “lowly” MLS.&nbsp;

Think about it: As real estate professionals, we know that over 90% of all buyers use the MLS when looking for a home to purchase. More importantly, 100% of real estate professionals who represent 95% of buyers in the market go to the MLS to show properties to their clients.&nbsp;

So many of us get distracted and spend money on strategies and gimmicks that don’t work. I recognize that some of this stuff has to be done—if nothing else, to differentiate ourselves from other Realtors—but let’s not fool ourselves into thinking that any of that stuff sells houses. **The MLS sells more houses than any other marketing strategy ever invented.**&nbsp;

Why is this important? If you want to sell more homes, you need to pay attention to how your listings are presented on the MLS. Do they have professional-grade photos? Video tours? Virtual tours? Have you attached great captions and compelling descriptions to your properties so that they attract both agents and buyers?&nbsp;

That’s where you need to be focusing your effort: **presenting your homes in the best possible light on the MLS, where the highest number of buyers will see it.** If you put your marketing attention and dollars toward improving your MLS listings, you’ll sell a lot more houses and make a whole lot more money.&nbsp;
