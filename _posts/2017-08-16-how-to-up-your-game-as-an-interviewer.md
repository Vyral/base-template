As a manager, how can you be an effective interviewer?

A majority of people spend somewhere around five minutes preparing themselves for an interview. For some managers, this preparation may not even be done until right before the interview itself.

Giving a quick glance at someone’s resume before you interview them simply isn’t enough. However, **taking even just 10 to 15 minutes longer to prepare yourself will make you much more effective at selecting an ideal candidate.**

First of all, make sure you have a firm understanding of the job description. Whatever position you are interviewing candidates for, it is always a good idea to look back at past employees who performed well in that specific role.&nbsp;

Ask yourself what soft and hard skills that prior employees had that made them the best fit for that position. As a reminder, soft skills refer to things such as one’s ability to communicate well whereas hard skills are concerned with technical adeptness.

Next, remember to have questions in mind that will help you determine specific attributes in a candidate. Asking a candidate about obstacles they have overcome in the past and how they were able to do so is a good way to start.&nbsp;

It’s important to remember, too, that a candidate must fit in with company culture. Determining how well a candidate will be able to act on a team, and how well you think they will act on your team specifically, is critical.&nbsp;

**No matter what skills a candidate has, they will not be a good fit if they are unable to match company culture.&nbsp;**

Finally, you should pay close attention to whether or not the candidate appears interested and motivated throughout the interview. An ideal candidate should be excited and well-prepared for the interview and should be able to express that they are enthusiastic about the position.&nbsp;
