Should you fix up your home before putting it on the open market? If you want to get the most money possible, **yes**.

<br>When Buyers inspect your home, small issues add up. Although your property's minor issues might not be deal breakers, Buyers often assume that if there are a few small things they **can** see, there are likely others they cannot.

Instead, I recommend contacting a trusted real estate expert to give you honest feedback about what is and isn't worth fixing when selling your home.
