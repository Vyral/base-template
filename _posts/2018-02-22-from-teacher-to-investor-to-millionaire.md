Today I’d like to share an inspirational story with you about real estate. It’s about a successful investor who comes from humble roots.

<strong>I recently got a call from a buyer who was looking for a home in Downtown Charleston.</strong> He was looking for a home in the $2.5 million range. After talking for a while, I asked him a little bit about what he does. He told me that he was a teacher, which was a little bit confusing to me. I wasn’t sure I heard him right.

I had to hear more about his story. I came to find out that he’s a retired teacher who has been investing in real estate since he was very young. <strong>Over the years, he has owned almost a dozen properties.</strong> The way he started was simple. Every time he could get approved for a home loan, he would buy that home. Once he kept the property for awhile, he would then sell it for a profit and buy a new one. He repeated the process so many times that now he’s living in a beautiful oceanfront home in New York looking for a multi-million dollar home in Downtown Charleston.

<strong>I just wanted to share that story with you today to show you that anything is possible through real estate and investing is the best way to make the most out of your money.</strong> Even if you don’t have the biggest paycheck, you can create something huge if you consistently invest over time.

If you have any questions for me about real estate investing or anything else, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
