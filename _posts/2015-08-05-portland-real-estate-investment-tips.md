While commodities and stocks can be volatile and dangerous investments, real estate is a relatively safe one. It’s actually quite easy to get involved in investment real estate here in Portland, and it can have huge benefits if done correctly.

 Why would someone want to invest in Portland? There is a company out there called Protech Valuation Services, which goes around measuring the best and worst markets to invest in. Believe it or not, Portland is #1 on their list.

In addition to this, Money Magazine recently discussed how rent has been steadily increasing at a much higher rate than mortgage rates. Rent increased by 8.6% last year, and is currently growing at twice the rate of property values. Portland is an expensive market to rent in, but can be lucrative if you are a landlord.

 It takes about a 20% down payment to invest in a property today. Now you can have a property that you can rent out to give you positive cash flow, where someone is paying your principle down for you. On top of that, the home will appreciate in value and the tax benefits are substantial.

Another thing that comes into play is the 1031 exchange, where you can take your equity to invest in even more properties. Hopefully this has been of some help to you. If you want to dive deeper, give us a call or send us an email and we’d be happy to talk to you soon!
