Though Hurricane Harvey is months behind us now, its lasting impact has been a continuing presence in the lives of Houston families.

Today, I’m coming to you from “A Heart for Houston”—a partnership with (NOT SURE WHAT HE SAYS AT 1:15) and Tackles4Cancer, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit based out of Houston. It was an amazing experience to see so many people band together at this event.

**Singer, songwriter, and actress T&aacute;mar Davis joined in on the show of support. “There’s so much love in this city,” she remarked during our conversation together.**

If you want to get involved, yourself, there are several ways you can do so. One of the ways is by donating to the GoFundMe page that I’ve created, which you can find **[here](https://www.gofundme.com/5kj5jz-houston-hurricane-harvey-relief)**. All the funds raised there will go toward Harvey relief efforts.

**I also had the opportunity to speak with Dominic Austin of Tackles4Cancer. Tackles4Cancer primarily focuses on transportation for cancer patients.** In the wake of Hurricane Harvey, the organization is providing financial grants, meals, and other essentials to people in need. If you would like to learn more or donate, you can visit **[www.Tackles4Cancer.org](https://tackles4cancer.org/)**.

Along with those from the community who attended as a show of support, others in attendance were victims, themselves—this includes one woman I spoke to, in particular: Tequila Phillips.

**Tequila, a mother of five, told me that many of the items of her home were lost or damaged in the storm.** However, what made things most difficult, she says, was that her property had already sustained damage from another flood the year prior to Hurricane Harvey.

Another major difficulty was the impact this has had on her children, two of whom have sickle cell anemia. After Harvey, Tequila’s other three children also became ill. Due to the damage to their home, Tequila and her children sought shelter in a facility which was over-capacity as a result of the hurricane. **Tequila’s story is just one of many, which is exactly why relief efforts are so important.**

Finally, I would like to highlight one last attendee: NFL wife and Houston native Tammara McDonald, who is also known as “The Game Changer.” This nickname is one she also bestowed onto her 501(c)(3) nonprofit: The Game Changers. She also sits on the board for the Off The Field Players’ Wives Association, an organization of NFL wives.

Tammara told me that she has teamed up with Porsha Williams along with some former and current athletes and entertainers to raise funds and support for the relief efforts. **Tammara tells me that she truly wants to highlight the importance of community support.**

Toya Jones, former NFL player for the 49ers, Broncos, and Texans, also spoke with me about the work he, Tammara, and others in their circle are doing.

It has been amazing to see how the city has pulled together. It was clear to see at this event that the community really is “Houston Strong.”

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
