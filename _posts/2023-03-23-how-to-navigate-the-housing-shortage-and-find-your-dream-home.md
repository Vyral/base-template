The pandemic had an undeniable impact on the housing market. Although there are more homes for sale now than there were at this time last year, there is still an undersupply. While the number of homes for sale is increasing, it is still 43% lower than it was before the pandemic from 2017 to 2019. This means that there are still fewer homes available to buy on a typical day than a few years ago. **The current housing shortage will have an impact on how you search for a home this spring.** With limited options in the market, buyers who consider what's a necessity versus what's a nice-to-have will be more successful in their home search.

The first step in your home search is to get pre-approved for a mortgage. Pre-approval helps you better understand what you can borrow for your home loan, and that plays an important role in how you'll put your list together. After all, you don't want to fall in love with a home that's out of your reach. Once you have a good grasp of your budget, the best way to prioritize the features you want and need in a home is to put together a list. Here's a great way to think about them before you begin:

**Must-haves**\: If a house doesn't have these features, it just won't work for you and your lifestyle.

**Nice-to-haves**\: These are features you would love to have but can live without. Nice-to-haves aren't deal-breakers.&nbsp;

If you find a home that hits all of the must-haves and some of the nice-to-haves, it's a clear winner.

Once you've created your list and categorized it in a way that works for you, discuss it with your real estate agent. If you don't have an agent, consider reaching out to one for assistance. They will be able to help you refine the list further, coach you through the best ways to stick to it, and find a home in your area that meets your needs.

Prioritizing what you need in a home is a critical first step in the buying process. If you're ready to find the one that's best for you, it's time to get started. Reach out to us by phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
