Today I’m going to show you some of my favorite parks around my home, Daniel Island. We have a lot of great parks here, and I have a few that I want to share with you.

**Edgefield Park** is on the south side of the island. It has great picnic areas, a couple of swings, and a huge green space which is perfect for kids to play ball in. **Center Park** is surrounded by beautiful brick townhomes. It’s home to a fun train-shaped playset that has plenty of places for kids to climb and play.

**Etiwan Park** its another great place to play, and it’s right next to Bishop England High School. The next one is **Codner’s Ferry Park.** It was the first subsection created on Daniel Island, and there are still so many things to do in this little area.

**Daniel Island Park** is a great place to play some tennis with its expansive courts. It’s a great park to live next to. **Fallen Oak Park** is a great playground with a lot of green space. There’s a lot of beautiful trees to enjoy, and they give plenty of shade when it gets hot outside.

The last one is Ralston Grove Park, but we call it “**Bamboo Park**” after the climbing toy that sits at the center. It’s one of the newest parks on the island, and it’s a fun place for people of all ages to come and climb. There’s also plenty of green space.

That’s it for our Daniel Island parks. If you have any questions about Daniel Island or anything real estate related in the Charleston area, reach out to me and my team. We’d be happy to help\!
