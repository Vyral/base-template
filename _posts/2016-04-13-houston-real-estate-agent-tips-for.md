Tax season is here, and the biggest questions we’ve received lately have to do with protesting your taxes. If you’ve seen what I’ve seen, property tax assessments in the Houston area have gone up again. My short answer? Yes, you should protest your property taxes! I do every year because I want to keep my bases low.

There are a few options out there for people who want to protest their taxes. First, you can do it on your own, which means you’re going to go, sit down with HCAD, and try to convince them why your property taxes are too high. I don’t have the time to do this, so I usually hire a third party to do it for me. I have had some mixed success going that route, but I feel it’s worth it.

Although we’re in a normalizing market, property taxes have continued to go up. If you have a homesteaded property, they can go up no more than 10% plus any improvements you’ve made. In some cases, improvements to your home can increase your tax burden substantially. Even if you haven’t made improvements, these higher assessments will cost more and more money as the years go by.

In short, we highly recommend that everyone contests their property taxes, especially if you have the time. If you’re interested in a third party to protest your taxes on your behalf, I would be happy to put you in touch with a great company I use. They typically charge 50% of what they end up saving you; if they don’t save you any money, you don’t have to pay them anything, so it’s not a bad deal.

If you have questions about this or any other topic, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to hear from you soon!
