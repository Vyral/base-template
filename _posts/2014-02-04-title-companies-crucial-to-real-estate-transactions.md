{% include youtube.html %}Title companies are often misunderstood by consumers, but don't be frightened by what you don't understand. They're here to help you! - Title companies dig up information about a property such as: finding all former owners & sellers to ensure a 'clean' property without any unpaid mortgages, or unpaid taxes or bills that would affect a sale.

* They interact with lots of different parties, like title insurance companies to ensure coverage against hidden defects not found in the title search. Realtors, buyers, sellers, loan officers, surveyors, and homeowner's associations are coordinated with to ensure that all fees have been paid off.

* Choosing a good title company is important, so be sure to communicate with your realtor often about making the right choice.
