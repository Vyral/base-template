Should you trust Zillow’s Zestimate tool? The short answer is no, but today I will explain why.<br>&nbsp;<br>A lot of people go to Zillow for real estate information. The website has home evaluations called Zestimates and, while this feature is a good barometer for general information, the truth is that Zestimates cannot account for certain key differences between homes.<br>&nbsp;<br>**Zestimates do not take home upgrades, for example, into consideration.** They also don't factor in what kind of views you have from your home.&nbsp;

{% include pullquote.html %}<br>&nbsp;<br>It really takes a professional to go through all of a home's features and compare it to what is going on in the market, what has sold, and more importantly, what is going to be on the market - because the market is constantly changing. At the end of the day, **what you need is an “exactimate” which you can only get from a licensed real estate professional** such as myself.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you want more information about this or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to me by phone, email, or through my website. I look forward to getting you the right value for your home soon.
