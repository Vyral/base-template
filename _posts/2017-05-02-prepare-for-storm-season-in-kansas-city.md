We recently had a pretty nasty storm here in Kansas City. With storm season on its way, there’s one thing you need to make sure you do.

With the storm season fast approaching, it’s essential to take a look at the trees around your home. What condition are they in? Are you worried a storm could potentially knock down a tree and cause damage to your property?

**Now is the time to have a certified arborist come take a look.** Power lines are also a huge concern when it comes to trees and storm season. Kansas City Power and Light will trim back foliage around the main power pole, but the lines running to your house are your responsibility as the homeowner.

An arborist will come out to give you a free evaluation and provide you with an estimate for trimming. Being proactive about your trees now could save you time, money, and a large amount of stress.

If you have any questions about getting ahold of an arborist, or if you have any real estate questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m always happy to help.
