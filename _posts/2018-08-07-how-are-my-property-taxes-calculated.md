Today we’re going to talk a little bit about property taxes. The big question people have is, “How are they calculated?” We’re going to answer that for you right now.

The county you live in assesses the value of your property every year, typically in late spring/early summer. There are also taxing entities that are associated with your property, such as the school district, community hospital, community college, and sometimes a water district. Each of these entities taxes at its own rate.

To determine which entity taxes your property or a property you want to buy, you can go to your county’s assessor’s website (ex. [Dcad.org](Dcad.org) or [dentoncad.com](dentoncad.com)). This will help you figure out what the taxes will be on your current property or on the property you are thinking of buying.
