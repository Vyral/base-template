## Tweaking Your Withholding Taxes: Filing a New W4 Form with Your Employer

&nbsp;

Remember filling out a W-4 form when you were first hired?&nbsp; It’s the form that determines how much money your employer withholds from your paycheck to pay federal and state taxes—based upon the number of “allowances” that you claimed.&nbsp;

However, have you checked to see if it’s still applicable?&nbsp; Consider adjusting your W-4 form if the following applies:

You owed the IRS money – You may want to have more money withheld from your paycheck.&nbsp; In fact, if you owe too much, the IRS can assess you and add a penalty for not depositing enough money into your account.

You’ve experienced a “life change,” such as:

* Marriage
* Divorce
* Birth or adoption of a child
* Purchase of home
* Refinance of mortgage
* Retirement
* You expect to earn money from your home-based business or other source that does not withhold income taxes from the check.
* You have a change in itemized deductions
* Medical expenses
* Gifts to charity
* Dependent care expenses
* Education credits
* Child tax credit

To INCREASE the amount of taxes from your paycheck, you will need to DECREASE the number of dependents.&nbsp; You can also specify a dollar amount—like $50 per pay period.&nbsp; Likewise, to have LESS money deducted, INCREASE that number.&nbsp;

I recommend that you check your withholding every year—right after you’ve filed your income tax return.&nbsp; The IRS offers a withholding calculator at [www.IRS.gov](www.IRS.gov){: target="_blank"} and you’ll need your most recent tax return and current paycheck stub.&nbsp; Or, ask your tax preparer to help you adjust your withholding so you don’t owe too much—or get a large refund from the IRS—at the end of the year.&nbsp;
