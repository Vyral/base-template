Does your agent have cool tools to keep you in touch with your home sale every step of the way? We wanted to give you a little information today about one of the tools we have in our toolbox right now.

We are implementing a program that will provide sellers with a weekly report letting them know exactly what we have done to get their home sold.

Once we go under contract, we keep our sellers in the loop every stage of the way from contract negotiations to settlement details. We don't want to leave anything to chance and we want our clients to be informed every step of the way.

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. After 29 years in the business, we have a lot of experience that we are excited to share with you. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
