If you’re looking to increase your average sale price and sell more high-end luxury homes in your market, **it’s very important that you have a strong, dedicated luxury division.** What does a strong, dedicated luxury division look like, though?

The old way of maintaining a luxury division (which many franchises still ascribe to) is to just have a different logo or sign for your luxury homes or your luxury division’s office. That’s not a luxury division.

The new way that I recommend involves better training and resources, **better-qualified agents, and, perhaps, the Luxury Listing Specialist certification** (or any strong certification). That’s what a strong luxury division is all about—giving your agents an advantage over other firms in your area when selling high-end properties.

Remember, it’s not the market—it’s the marketing. Continue to prove others wrong, and remember to always keep a strong luxury division, whether you’re the head of a franchise or brokerage or you’re a single agent.

As always, if you have any questions about this topic or you have a topic in mind you’d like to see me discuss in a future video, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to speak to you.
