When you are looking for an agent to help with your real estate transaction, how can you know if they will do a good job?

With the recent influx of agents into our area’s market, a lot of people have come to me asking, “How do I find the right agent?”

The answer depends on what kind of real estate transaction you’re about to undertake. If you are in the market to purchase a home you should be looking for a lender.

But don’t settle for your first encounter, be sure to shop around to get the best rates and the best terms and conditions on your mortgage. You should also get a buyer’s roadmap. A buyer’s roadmap will show you how we get priority access to all the best deals on the market.

This will help you win out against the competition. Having the roadmap will be your guide to success as a buyer, but you’ll still need a quality agent. When looking for the right agent, be sure to ask how many homes they sell per year, how well they know the area, and how well they know financing.

Sellers will need a game plan, as well. Having a selling guide and using high-quality marketing will be key. **My team and I offer a 151-step marketing guide that can help you have as smooth and successful a transaction as possible. **

Full-disclosure, full-detail marketing strategies are also something we do. From 3D tours to aerial drone shots and more, we have all the resources to help our sellers make their listing as attractive as possible. We also offer a 75-point photography checklist designed to ensure that your home is being presented in the best light.

Very few other agents, or teams of agents, can do what we can—let alone at such a high level.

To find out if an agent will be able to get you top dollar, there are a few questions you should ask as a seller. How many homes have they sold this year? Do they have a resume?  

With as many agents as are coming in our area, we’re seeing a few of them underpricing homes and therefore only selling between two to four properties a year. **Selling quickly isn’t worth it if an agent is undercutting their client’s profit by thousands.**

One of the things that sets my team apart is that we only accept full price offers for our clients. You need an agent who has a game plan for getting you at or above list price.  

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
