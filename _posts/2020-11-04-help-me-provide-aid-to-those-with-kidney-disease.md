<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help me help those who suffer from kidney disease. Here’s how you can.</em></p>

For this week’s blog post, I’m going to step out of my comfort zone and ask you for help. **We need your support for the Northeast Kidney Foundation.** The Foundation is a tremendous organization where 97 cents of every dollar donated goes directly to patients and the research being done to help them.

I had a friend from high school who ended up needing a kidney transplant right out of college. Fortunately, his sister was a match and gave hers to him. That lasted about 15 to 20 years before it failed and he needed another one from his brother. He was fortunate that he had multiple family members who were a match.

I love all my clients, but sometimes, with all the problems we deal with on a daily basis, we lose perspective about what’s really important. I didn’t realize it until I went to my first Kidney Foundation fundraiser years ago. I met the families, heard the stories, and saw the impact that kidney disease has on people.

Generally, you’re waiting on a list with thousands of other people. Your donation can help end this cycle of waiting and worry. Our Catwalk Fashion Show fundraiser is coming up, and even though I don’t necessarily want you to watch, it is for a good cause. Click <a href="https://secure.frontstream.com/catwalk-for-kidneys2020virtual/participant/KevinClancy4" target="_blank">here</a> to find out more about the event and how you can help.

Thank you so much in advance for your support. If there’s ever anything I can do for you, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I’d love to help you.
