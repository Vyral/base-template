You just finished watching a show on HGTV or a video on YouTube and now you want to renovate the kitchen and bathroom in your home. Should you do it yourself, or should you hire a professional? Today I want to talk about the three biggest challenges that youâ€™ll face if you try it on your own:

1.&nbsp;**Overestimating your skill and time.** It is my job to deal with your home and it is your job to deal with your job and family. You may be able to pick up a lot of information from YouTube videos, but once you start tearing walls apart and dealing with electrical and plumbing work, you really should have a professional on your side. You may be thinking that you can save time and money, but it usually costs you more of each.

2.&nbsp;**Underestimating your budget.** Everyone goes into a project thinking they are going to spend X amount of money and it rarely ever happens. There are always things that are going to come up. Any contractor will tell you once you open a wall, you do not know where the project will lead. For this reason, it is good to estimate about 20% over what you are expecting so that you can get a grasp on your true budget.

3.&nbsp;**Minimizing your timeline.** If you want to tackle a project in your new home or before you sell your old one, know that timelines rarely ever work because other things come up in life. Your job, family, etc. all affect your timelines and that project you thought you could finish in four weeks before your family comes to visit may be unrealistic.

The final thing you need to remember is that your time is valuable. So, although you may save your money on a contractor, you may spend more overall.

If you have any questions or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
