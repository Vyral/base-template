June 4, 2018 will be a big day in the mortgage world. It’s the day that the new maps from the USDA come into effect for the 2018 fiscal year.

As you may already know, the three main qualifications for a USDA loan are:

* You must have at least a 620 credit score
* You must be purchasing in a USDA-eligible area
* You must meet annual household income requirements

**Until June 4, we’ll be working based on the old maps**. In Lake County, the entire county is still eligible. However, this change means that you have until June 3 to get your purchase contracts in under the old eligibility maps to guarantee that we can close your client’s new home under those parameters.

**<br>Anything that comes in on June 4 or after would be subject to the new USDA property maps.**<br><br>If you or anyone you know has any questions regarding this change, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to sort out any confusion.
