I’m taking a quick break from my Mastermind in Scottsdale to give you a tour of some luxury homes and provide a quick market update.

Today I’m in Scottsdale, Arizona for a RE/MAX Mastermind for elite RE/MAX agents, and I’ve got a couple homes to show you and a quick update to give on our Louisville market back home. **Follow along in the video above to get an intimate look at two gorgeous properties. **

The first home belongs to former Major League Baseball pitcher and Hall of Famer Randy Johnson. This 25,000 square foot property is listed at $20 million, and as you can see, you’ve really made it when you can afford to live here.

The two rooms that really sell homes are kitchens and master bathrooms, and both areas in this house are enormous. On the outside, you’ll find a pool and a walking garden with an overhanging trellis. The garage holds three Ferraris, which unfortunately don’t come with the house.

The second home was built in 2007 and is listed at $7.5 million. At 10,000 square feet, my wife describes it as “more welcoming.” From the back of the property, you get a nice snapshot of Camelback Mountain and a faraway view of downtown Phoenix.  

Whenever I tour homes like these, I feel like Robin Leach from “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.”

What about our market back home? **The Louisville and southern Indiana market is as hot as we’ve ever seen it.** The problem is there isn’t enough inventory, so there’s a strong need for more homes to come on the market. This means now is the time to list your home. If you’re a buyer, we have 18 agents ready and waiting to help you find the home of your dreams.

If you have any questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call. We’d be happy to assist you.
