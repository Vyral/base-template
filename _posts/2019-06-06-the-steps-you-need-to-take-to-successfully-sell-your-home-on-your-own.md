If you’re thinking of selling your home on your own, there are several steps you need to take to make it a successful sale.

If you’re thinking of selling your home on your own, the first thing you need to do is think about some of the agent services you’re giving up, including:

* Pricing the home
* Listing it
* Marketing it
* Organizing and scheduling showings
* Negotiating contracts

Still committed to selling on your own? In that case, here are the steps you need to take to do so quickly and for a great price. &nbsp;

First, **prepare the house for sale.** Look at it through the eyes of a buyer and make sure it’s cleaned, decluttered, and features a lot of open space.&nbsp;

Next, **price it reasonably.** You don’t want to underprice it and give it away, but you don’t want to overprice it and scare buyers off either. Look up all the recent comparable sales of the other homes in your neighborhood and find a price that’s reasonable and will help it sell.&nbsp;

After that, **gather up all your information and draft a description of the house.** For this step, it’s a good idea to look at descriptions of other homes that agents have written. Be sure to highlight any special features or upgrades you’ve made.&nbsp;

Also, remember that the best place to list your home is on the MLS. This is something a Realtor can help you with even if they don’t list it for you. If you want us to help you with this step, we’d be happy to accommodate you.&nbsp;

Next, **get your house shown.** If you’re not getting any inquiries, hold an open house. The weekend is always a good time to do so, and yours should last at least three hours. If you have any valuables or fragile items you don’t want sitting around while people are walking through your home, put those items away.&nbsp;

Finally, **be prepared for an offer.** Take your time to understand what’s in that offer and consider all the costs you’ll incur and what your net takeaway will be. This is where you might want to consult with a lawyer or a Realtor. You’ll need to prepare the closing documents anyway, and they can certainly help you with that too.&nbsp;
