As a senior real estate specialist, I work with more and more baby boomers entering retirement age each year. The question of whether or not they should sell their homes and move is a hot topic in today’s housing market climate. With low available inventory in the starter and trade-up home categories, it makes sense to evaluate your home’s ability to adapt to your needs in retirement.&nbsp;

In light of that, I want to share with you the seven factors that you should consider when choosing your retirement home.

**1. Affordability.** It may be easy enough to purchase your home today but think in the long-term about your monthly costs. Account for property taxes, insurance, HOA dues, utilities, and all the things that will be due whether or not you have a mortgage on the property. Would moving to a complex with HOA fees be cheaper than having to hire all the contractors you would need to maintain your home? Would your taxes go down significantly if you relocated? What is your monthly income going to look like in retirement?<br><br>**2. Equity.** If you have equity in your car at home, you may be able to apply it to the purchase of your next home. Maintaining a healthy amount of home equity gives you a source of emergency funds to tap into, via a home equity loan or a reverse mortgage. The equity you have in your current home may be enough to purchase your retirement home with little to no mortgage. In fact, homeowners in the U.S. gained an average of over $14,000 in equity last year.

**3. Maintenance.** As we age, our tolerance for cleaning gutters, raking leaves, and shoveling snow can go right out the window. A condo with low maintenance needs can be a literal lifesaver if your health and physical abilities decline. Would a condo with an HOA fee be worth the added peace of mind of not having to do the maintenance work yourself?&nbsp;<br><br>**4. Security.** Unfortunately, elderly homeowners can be targets for scams or break-ins, so living in a home with security features such as a staffed gatehouse, resident-only access, and other security features can allow you to rest easy.<br><br>**5. Pets.** Renting won’t do if the dog can’t come too. The companionship of pets can provide emotional and physical benefits. Evaluate your options when it comes to bringing your furry friend with you to a new home. Will there be necessary additional deposits? Is there a fenced-in backyard? How far from your vet will you be?<br><br>**6. Mobility.** A home’s layout must be able to accommodate limited mobility. Even though 60 may be the new 40, you’ll still want to plan ahead. Having to install handrails and making sure your doorways and hallways are wide enough may be a good reason to look for a home that suits those needs.<br><br>**7. Convenience.** Do you have amenities nearby? Will relocating make visits with family easier or more frequent?

When it comes to your favorite forever home, evaluating your current house for its ability to adapt with you as you age can be the first step to guaranteeing your comfort in retirement. If after considering all these factors you find yourself curious about your options, let’s get together to evaluate your ability to sell your house in today’s market and find you your dream retirement home.
