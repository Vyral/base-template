What’s been happening in our market over the last year and beyond? I’ll answer that today by bringing you our year-to-date (YTD) Limbird Report. Let’s start by looking at home sales and prices. Hint: They’re both up. In the last 10 years, home sales have increased by more than 90% and prices by more than 50% in Northwest Arkansas. In fact, the average home in our market costs $15,000 more today than it would have just two years ago. If you’re planning to buy a home sometime soon, delaying any longer could cost you\! Additionally, interest rates have fallen, so if you’ve been thinking about selling, you may be able to use your appreciation and our current low rates to your advantage. And in Benton County, the price per square foot is $3 higher than that of Washington County, which means more bang for your buck. Whether you’re looking to buy in Fayetteville, Bella Vista, or somewhere nearby, these are just a few points to consider.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

If you have any questions about buying or selling a home, please contact the Limbird Real Estate Group. We’ll run a specific report for the area or neighborhood you’re in or looking at to help you make the right decision for you. We look forward to serving you\!<br>&nbsp;
