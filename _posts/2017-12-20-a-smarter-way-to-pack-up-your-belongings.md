I’m back with part three of our series on selling your home. Today I’d like to discuss the benefits of using clear plastic bins to store your belongings as opposed to cardboard boxes.<br><br>Not only are cardboard boxes fire hazards, insect attractors, and susceptible to mice and other rodents, but you can’t see anything either. You have to unpack the whole box just to find one thing. **Oftentimes, those boxes don’t get repacked and just end up making a mess.**

{% include pullquote.html %}<br><br>The use of clear plastic bins allows you to see if something is in there right away. Then you can reach in and grab it because you know exactly where it is.<br><br>Even if you only do it for a few weeks or while you’re selling your home, when you have a highly organized basement or garage with labeled bins like this, it will appear to potential buyers like you’ve been living like that the entire time. It will help make the selling process much easier and enjoyable. **It will likely get you a higher price for your home, too.**<br><br>If you have any questions for me at all about selling your home, including where you can find these plastic bins, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
