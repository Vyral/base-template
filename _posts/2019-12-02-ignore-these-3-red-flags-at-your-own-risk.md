Many of us walk by the warning signs our home is giving us each and every day without a second thought, simply because we’ve become used to them. However, continuing to ignore what may seem like a minor issue can quickly leave you dealing with a major (and likely very expensive) problem. To help make sure this doesn’t happen to you, we’ve compiled a list of the three most common red flags homeowners often (but shouldn’t) ignore:

**1\. An old water heater.** Most water heaters here in Memphis are located in the attic, and leaking water will always follow the flow of gravity. Old water heaters aren’t just more likely to stop working altogether, they’re also more likely to spring a leak and create water damage in your home. If the unit in your property has seen better days, it’s time to get it replaced—or at least serviced. A heater with a rusty bottom is almost always near the end of its life. If you suspect your unit is at the beginning of the end, you may want to install a pan alarm or an automatic shut-off valve—both of which are available at most hardware stores.&nbsp;

<br>**2\. Full gutters.** Speaking of water damage, keeping your gutters clear of leaves and debris is a must. Neglecting to flush out your gutters could lead to wood rot, which is very expensive to repair. &nbsp;<br><br>**3\. Dirty dryer vents.** If your laundry is taking longer than usual to dry, your vents may be dirty due to the build-up of lint over time. The best way to fix this dangerous fire hazard is by taking an old t-shirt, connecting it to a long wire, and pulling it through the vent toward the dryer. If your dryer vent runs through the roof, you’ll need to open and clean the vent in your attic—both up and down.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
