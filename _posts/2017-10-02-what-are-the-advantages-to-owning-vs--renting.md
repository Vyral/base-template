Today we’re going to talk about the advantages of owning a property versus renting one.

Q: **If you own a property, can you update, improve, and remodel it?**

A: Yes, if you own it, it’s yours, and you can do what you want to with it. Rentals have restrictions that will prevent you from treating your space like it’s your own.

Q: **Are there appreciation benefits to owning a home?**

A: Yes. You can enjoy the appreciation of value over time, and you also get to pay your mortgage instead of paying your landlord. Plus, if you decide to sell, you get to enjoy the profit as well.

Q: **Are there tax benefits to purchasing a home?**

A: Yes. Compared to being a renter, you will enjoy a number of tax benefits from owning a home, and it will ultimately save you money.

Q: **Does my mortgage stay the same?**

A: Yes. You’ll more than likely get a loan to purchase your home, and your mortgage payments are structured to be the same amount for the length of the loan, even while your property appreciates. Rent payments are subject to change all the time.

If you’re a first-time buyer, the process could seem a little overwhelming, but it is well worth the time spent to be able to enjoy the benefits of being a homeowner, as opposed to renting from a landlord.
