Recently, my sister Amanda Abbott was featured on Wyndham's [website.](http://www.vacationdifferently.com/we-travel-for-adventure-a-locals-take-on-northwest-florida-adventure-part-1/) Amanda is a fantastic real estate agent who enjoys exploring all that Northwest Florida has to offer.

Our dad and our uncle started one of the first real estate companies in the area—Abbott Realty. I jumped into the real estate business soon after college, but Amanda explored a little before returning home and becoming an agent in her own right.

Somebody once called her “the Surfing Realtor,” which is a good fit. “My favorite thing is to be in the water,” says Amanda. “That’s when I feel most at peace.”

If you grew up in Northwest Florida like we did, it can be easy to take the beauty around us for granted. **However, Amanda is constantly exploring.** She surfs, paddleboards, and motorbikes all around the area. “I’ve traveled all over the world, and I still think it’s one of the nicest places to be,” she says.

Amanda really believes in finding a balance between working hard and taking time for herself. She tries to encourage everyone else to do that, as well. She also does a great job helping her clients find amazing homes that encourage a wonderful lifestyle.

You can see a little of how Amanda spends her days in the video above. **Congratulations on such a wonderful spotlight, Amanda!**

As always, if you have any real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you.
