Airbnb has become increasingly popular with homeowners who like the idea of renting out their place and making some income without having a tenant for a full month or year. You get flexibility with renting and can still use the property.

The simplicity of it is one of the biggest benefits, too. It's app-driven, so it's easy for renters to come to you. All you have to do is post pictures of your place and they'll come find you.&nbsp;

**There are a lot of investment properties that I as a real estate agent can situate you with to create the best investment opportunity for you.** Here in the Santa Clarita market, you want to consider the proximity to the areas where people are likely to use Airbnb, but also how you can situate yourself to make the most money possible on an ongoing basis.&nbsp;

You don't just want to think about the rental income, but also the appreciation of an area in terms of real estate value.

Finally, you need to be aware of all the restrictions with Airbnb. Many community CC&Rs will regulate against this type of rental, so you really want to make sure you know about any restrictions before buying a property. Otherwise, you could end up in some real hot water because a community board won't allow Airbnb properties.&nbsp;

Make sure you do your due diligence and can legally have an Airbnb rental without any issues. If you have any questions about investment properties and the opportunities with Airbnb, give me a call or send me an email. I'd love to speak with you!
