{% include youtube.html %}Are you using professional photography in order to market your home for sale? If not, you need to listen up.
<br>
<br>I recently received an email with the subject line “worst photos ever.” Boy, they weren’t kidding. I couldn’t resist clicking on the link, and what it showed was actual, terrible photos from real home listings.
<br>
<br>**It was interesting to see what some Realtors thought good marketing for their homes would be.** I’m talking dirty dishes in the sink and on the counter, laundry on the floor, and unmade beds. In my humble opinion, marketing a property like that is akin to malpractice. The agent who posted them should be ashamed.

<br>**Buyers make decisions on which homes they want to see in person based on what they see online.&nbsp;**Clean, professional photography is one way to get them off the sofa and get them to pick up their phone and get in the car to come see the house.
<br>
<br>Professional photography sells homes. It’s imperative in this day and age if you hope to compete against other listings on the market that are utilizing it.
<br>
<br>If you have any questions for me about professional photography or anything else relating to real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
