When you’re selling your home and juggling multiple offers, is the highest offer always the best?

Not necessarily. There are a lot of other variables in play, including the terms of the loan, whether or not it’s a cash offer, some contingencies, and the length of the closing. You should consider four things before accepting a buyer’s offer:

1. Their financing
1. The length of the closing period
1. The terms of the loan
1. Any contingencies

Sometimes cash buyers are better than financed offers; however, cash buyers usually come in lower. A qualified professional can help you select the right offer by recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of each one.
