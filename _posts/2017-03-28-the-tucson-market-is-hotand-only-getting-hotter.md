What's going on in the Tucson market?

As you may have seen, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by another 0.25% a few weeks ago; the second increase in three months. They're projected to rise twice again this year and up to three hikes in 2018. **We might go from record low interest rates in the low 3% range to the 6% range depending on the economy.**

The economy, the Tucson real estate market, and the Tucson business economy are all heating up.&nbsp;

{If you're selling your home, you're in a prime position.}

In the past month here in Tucson, half of our home sales were on the market for fewer than 30 days, so homes are moving quickly. A year ago, homes spent an average of 66 days on the market. Today, that's down to 50 days. Active listings in our market are down 26% compared to last year as well; **inventory is moving faster and there's less to choose from.**&nbsp;

If you're looking to buy a home, you need to be prepared to move quickly. Interest rates will also rise for things like auto loans and other revolving lines of credit. It's a good time to lock in the lowest rate possible soon.&nbsp;

<br>If you're selling your home, you're in a prime position. If you're considering selling your house in the next year or two, consider looking at the market today, for a few reasons. For one, mortgage rates are still very low, but we know they're going up. Secondly, **inventory is shrinking, which makes prices high for homes.** Additionally, Tucson's economy is improving, which will only cause consumption to move at a faster rate. Lots of major U.S. companies here are hiring, some unemployment will go down.&nbsp;
