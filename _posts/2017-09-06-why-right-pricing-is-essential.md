A lot of people ask me, “What’s the best pricing strategy? Should I just price the home a little high so we can leave room to negotiate?” That strategy may work in certain markets, but not in this one.

**The most important thing when selling your home in this market is setting the right price.**To do this, we take a look at other properties that have recently sold and are similar to yours. We compare things like the square footage and home additions/improvements to get the right price.

If you overprice a home in this market, the listing will simply sit there because people will see better value in other homes that aren’t priced as high. After a while, the home will sit on the market because buyers will start to get a sense that there’s something wrong with it. Even if you reduce the price, the days on market will be a red flag for buyers.

On the other hand, it’s virtually impossible to underprice a home in our market. If you underprice a home, the market will determine that it’s an amazing deal. **The market typically responds with multiple offers, sometimes even with bidding wars.**

If you have any questions about pricing strategies or anything else related to real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
