What do our VAs actually sound like on the phone? That’s one of the most common questions that we hear from prospective clients. They want to know if our callers sound professional, if they have a thick accent, etc.&nbsp;

As you’ll see, our callers speak English very well. **Anybody we hire has to have at least three to five years of experience in an English call center.** We hire all of our callers out of the Philippines, the No. 1 market in the world for English speaking call centers outside of the U.S.
