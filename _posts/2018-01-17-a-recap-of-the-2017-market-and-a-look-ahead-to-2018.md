First off, let me take this opportunity to wish you and your family a happy 2018. We hope that your year is filled with abundant success, health, and wealth. If you worked with us in 2017, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. **Our business is built on great clients like you.**

As we start the new year, I thought it would be a great time to look back on what we saw in the Secaucus real estate market in 2017 and what we can expect in 2018 as a result.

In 2017, our market was still very strong and robust. There were 5,450 total sales, which is up 2% from 2016. Home values are still rising at a steady pace, too. The $537,000 average sale price is up 6% from 2016.

Homes are selling faster, too. The average days on market dropped from 61 days in 2016 to 51 days in 2017. That’s a 16% drop in just a year!

All signs point to a continuation of our strong seller’s market. **However, due to factors such as tax reform and interest rate change, there may be some areas of the market that will be affected.**

For home sellers, this is possibly the best time that we’ve ever had to sell a home. Inventory is still very low, and the lack of competition allows you to take advantage of rising prices.

**As for buyers, interest rates remain low for the time being.** When they go up, the amount you can afford will go down.

For investors, inventory may be tight but there are still some great opportunities for you to build your portfolio or fix and flip.

If you have any questions for me about the market or about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.
