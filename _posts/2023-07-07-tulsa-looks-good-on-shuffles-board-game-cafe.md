Tulsa Looks Good on You and Shuffles Board Game Cafe!

Jennie caught up with owner, Eric Fransen to hear about everything Shuffles has to offer.

Who doesn’t love a board game…located downtown in the Archer Building on the corner of Detroit, Shuffles is not just a restaurant, bar, and coffee shop, it’s a space you can go and work through a library of over 1,000 games as well!

With one of the best patios in Tulsa, Shuffles offers a variety of seating options to grab a bite of Americana fare and gives you a reason to stick around after your plate is cleared.

With a variety of classic and modern games, Shuffles is sure to appeal to all ages and interests. And if that wasn’t enough, Shuffles offers a space for private events as well as a summer camp geared to kids ages 9-15.
