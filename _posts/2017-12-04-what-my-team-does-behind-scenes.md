How is my team so successful in our industry? Well, it all comes down to the behind-the-scenes work my team members do each day.

<div class="post-cta">
Buying a home? <a href="http://www.capitalregionhomesearch.com/" target="_blank">Click here to perform a full home search</a><br>
Selling a home? <a href="http://www.albanynyhomevalues.com/" target="_blank">Click here for a FREE Home Price Evaluation </a><br>
Call me at <a href="tel:518-861-7016">518-861-7016 for a FREE home buying or selling consultation</a>
</div>

Today, I want to talk a little bit about how we sell so many homes. Most of all, I want to talk about the efforts of my team. The work they do behind the scenes is truly to thank for our success.

**My team members are averaging 30 sales a piece, when the average agent in our area tends to average just seven or eight homes.**

While I absolutely appreciate the credit I receive for my team’s success, I want to make it known that each and every one of my team members plays a huge role in what we do.

In 2016, we were named the No. 3 team in the state of New York in terms of sales.

Our team makes it a priority to take care of buyers and sellers in today’s market. For example, if you are a buyer and are unhappy with your home within your first year of residing there, I will sell that property for free.

Don’t just take my word for it. You can hear a testimonial from one of our past clients, Nicole Cohen, in the video above.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
