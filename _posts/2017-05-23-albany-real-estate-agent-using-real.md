Real estate investing is one of the best ways to save for college. I have a personal example to show just how well it works.

 Today I wanted to take a moment to talk about saving for college. To add to that, I also wanted to tell you about an opportunity to earn $1,000 easy.

I'm happy to announce that after lots agonizing, my daughter has finally decided to go to Marist in Poughkeepsie. I'm a conservative guy and I've been saving for her college since the day I found out my wife was pregnant. I set up a 529 plan 18 years ago. **Even saving over 18 years, I still couldn't save enough to pay for her college.**

Fortunately though, I bought a small, two-family college rental property that I've rented out and managed for the last eight years. I just sold that house this week. Over the last eight years, it had positive cash flow and positive appreciation, as well as equity built-up from the payments I made over eight years.

Between the sale of that house and my 529 plan, I'm able to pay for my daughter's college. **I think it's important to consider real estate for college savings because I don't think all families today can save enough for college alone.** My cash on cash return on investment for that property alone was probably 40% or 50%.

If you're thinking about saving for college, I'd love to talk to you about how real estate can be a part of that portfolio for a reasonable down payment.

So how can you earn that $1,000? Our team is growing and the market is very hot. Our team is small, close, and functions like a family, and we're looking to add two partners.

If you know of anyone unhappy with their job and is looking to get into sales, is honest, and has integrity, I'd love to hear from you. **If we hire that person, I'll write you a check for $1,000.**

Even if you refer yourself and we hire you, we'll give you $1,000. You can email, text, or call me with someone you think is a good fit. We're looking for a good culture fit who wants to be part of our family.

 If you have any other questions or you know someone who would be a good fit, I hope to hear from you soon!
