Today we’d like to tell you a story about home staging. 

When we first started our real estate career, we knew very little about staging. We watched a few shows that touched on the process, but this was basically the extent of our experience with it. 

Eventually, though, this all changed. 

We once had a listing that was large for its neighborhood, yet still priced below the average area home. We had about 80 showings, but all of them ended in the same result: The buyers thought the floor plan was terrible. Once buyers entered the home, they lost interest due to how it appeared from within.

The issue? **The tenants that were still living in the home had left it very cluttered. **

When we discovered that this was the root of our problem, we changed our approach. The tenants moved out and their clutter was cleared out with them. After that, the home was painted, deep-cleaned, and given new carpet.

From there, we had about 80 more showings but were surprised to receive basically the same feedback. **The now-empty home wasn’t having any more success than it was when it was full of clutter.** People still didn’t like the floor plan. 

We knew at this point it was time for yet another change. Our client, who was a bit of an amateur designer herself, had some furniture shipped in for us to place. We staged the house, took new photos, and by that weekend had four offers. Best of all, there was no price reduction whatsoever. 

And interestingly enough, the main selling point that buyers cited when submitting their offers **was the very thing so many potential buyers had critiqued before: the home’s floor plan.** Staging works. It can make a bad floor plan into a great floor plan, and it can take a home from zero to four offers in just one week.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want to know how we can use staging to create a success story for your listing, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
