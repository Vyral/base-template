<p style="text-align: center;"><em>2018 was a great year for sellers, but 2019 looks to be evening things out for all.</em></p>

Today we’ll be taking a quick look at our latest market, as well as share what we’re predicting for 2019.

**The market had a strong year in 2018, starting the first quarter off in a definite seller’s market.** Homes were on the market for an average of 30 days, and many listings were seeing multiple-offer situations in the spring and summer months. We tend to see the market slow down as we head into August, which happened as expected this year.

As the year progressed, interest rates were on the rise. This has led to homes selling slightly slower than in previous months, but they’re selling nonetheless.&nbsp;

If you’re currently in the market to buy a home, know that it’s currently a buyer’s market in these winter months. Homes that have been on the market for more than 60 days are an opportunity for you to find and negotiate a great deal.

If you’re a seller, homes are still being sold successfully. However, you’ll need to make sure your home is in excellent condition, as well as appropriately priced.

We’re expecting a steady market in 2019 that moves away from favoring sellers alone. **This coming year should be great for buyers and sellers alike.&nbsp;**
