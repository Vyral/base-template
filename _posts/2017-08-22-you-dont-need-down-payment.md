There are a lot of loan options out there with low down payment options. There are even some that don’t require a down payment at all.

What's the biggest obstacle to homeownership?

According to a recent survey, "saving enough for a down payment" comes at the top of the list. A whopping 55% of prospective homebuyers cited this as their main stumbling block.

And with the continuing growth of home prices, things aren't getting any easier. **In fact, homeownership rates reached a 20-year low last November.**

It wasn't always like this.

A decade ago, many lenders were offering easy, no-money-down mortgages.

However, after the financial crisis, mortgage standards have become more restrictive. A typical mortgage now requires a 20% down payment.

Here's the good news.

If you have decent credit and a steady income, you might be qualified for a number of specialized programs that require no or very little down payment. Here are a few of the top options.

First, there's **the USDA loan, which is valid for homes in certain regions, such as rural and suburban areas.**

With zero money down and lenient credit requirements, the USDA loan can be a great choice for many homeowners.

Second, there’s **the VA loan, which you can apply for if you or your spouse served in a branch of the military.**

It's possibly the most generous zero-money-down mortgage because of low-interest rates and low closing costs.

Third, there's the FHA loan. It does require a 3.5% down payment—**still drastically more achievable than the 20% required for a conventional mortgage.**

Finally, there are a number credit unions and first-time homebuyer programs that might apply to your particular situation.

There’s one important thing you should know.  

If you get one of these no-money-down mortgages, chances are good you will be required to pay private mortgage insurance, which can drive up your monthly payments.

Fortunately, **private mortgage insurance will disappear after your mortgage balance is under 80%.** Also, the money you do pay will be tax deductible in most cases.

In short, there are lots of options to make owning a home a reality for you, even if you haven't saved up tens of thousands of dollars.
