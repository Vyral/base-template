<center><em>Today we have a special guest with us&mdash;Jen from Bill&rsquo;s Plumbing and Drain Service&mdash;to help give you three tips that homeowners should know about the plumbing in your house.</em></center>

&nbsp;

**1. What is the best solution for tackling smelly drains?**

Sometimes when I go into a home, I register a smell coming out of the drains. My first instinct is to pour some Drano in them to try to get rid of whatever is causing the odor. Jen, our expert from Bill’s Plumbing and Drain Service, says that Drano is a pretty harsh chemical; if you pour it down the drain, it will eat away at whatever is clogging the pipes, but it will also eat away at the pipes themselves.

A better solution is actually just water, Jen says. You can fill a big pitcher with warm water and throw a little bit of lemon juice or vinegar in there, then pour the solution down your drains—especially unused drains like your floor, guest bathroom, and laundry drains. Sometimes those don’t get wet, causing the P-trap to dry out and create an odor. Sealing the drain with a bucket of warm water will help take care of the smells.

**2. Why is it important to have a sewer scope when you purchase a home?**

Jen says its importance is for checking the integrity of the sewer line to make sure there aren’t any issues with it. Spending around $150 dollars for peace of mind is will worth it when the alternative is an $8,000 to $10,000 repair.

**Is it necessary for newly constructed homes?**

Jen says there’s a common misconception that, for new homes, everything is new, so why check it? But actually, it’s always a good idea to check for potential issues, even in new homes. &nbsp;A sewer scope can help you discern if debris from the construction process is causing problems in your system. You’d be surprised what can get in your sewer lines; you don’t want to buy a home and move in only to discover a costly issue. Make sure to check it out before signing those papers.

**3. What’s the difference between a sewer scope and an actual clean-out of a sewer line?**

Sewer clean-outs are done when you have such problems as root intrusions or other blockages in your sewer lines. Though many people think that a sewer scope is the only thing they need to do, you do need to make sure that the lines down to the sewer main are clear. It’s important to do an annual maintenance check, especially if you live in an area with lots of trees, to be sure you won’t have any backups.&nbsp;

Staying on top of your drain maintenance with these tips should help make your life as a homeowner easier, safer, and cheaper, as well.
