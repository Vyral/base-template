If you’re selling your home next spring,
you need to take pictures of your home now before it’s too late.

If you’re thinking of selling your home sometime in the spring, you’ve got to go out and take pictures of it now.

Fall is coming, and soon the foliage will be gone. Right now, your home looks better than it will in March. When the time comes to put it on the market, you’ll have a whole catalog of beautiful pictures ready to go.

**You only have a week or two at best to get this done, so don’t delay any longer!**

If you have any questions about taking listing photos or would like to enlist the services of a professional photographer, don’t hesitate to get in touch with me. I’d love to help you.
