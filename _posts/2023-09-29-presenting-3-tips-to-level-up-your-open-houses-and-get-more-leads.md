Are you ready to host a wildly successful open house? If you've been in the real estate business for a while, you might have experienced the frustration of empty open houses with minimal visitors. You may have even concluded that open houses don't work, as buyers prefer to schedule online showings. But what if we told you that you could attract 20 to 30 prospective homebuyers during your two-hour open house? We'll guide you through the process in a few simple steps:

**1\. Choose a high-traffic location.** The first step is to select a property in a high-traffic area. Rural homes tend to draw fewer visitors, so opt for a property located in a neighborhood or within walking distance of other attractions. If you don't have a listing, consider reaching out to someone in your brokerage to inquire about hosting an open house at one of their properties.

**2\. Ramp up your advertising efforts.** Prepare by investing in extensive free advertising in the days leading up to your open house. Utilize multiple platforms, including the MLS, various websites, and social media. Make sure to target community pages in the area where the open house is situated. As a bonus, consider creating a video of yourself in front of the property to boost engagement. Next, market to neighbors in the area. Craft a simple flier and personally visit the neighbors to introduce yourself, extend an invitation to the open house, and encourage them to bring friends. Mention that there might be increased traffic in the neighborhood on the day of the event.

**3\. Place directional signs.** Finally, on the day of or the day before the open house, strategically position 20 to 30 directional signs throughout the vicinity, guiding potential attendees to the event location. While it may sound excessive, repetition is key. People tend to ignore what they see once, but if they encounter the same message multiple times, they're more likely to follow the signs to your open house.
