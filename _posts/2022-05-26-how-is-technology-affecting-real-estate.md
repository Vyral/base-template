Today we’ll talk about how technology is affecting real estate. The Super Eye Box is a great example.

The Super Eye Box is used by our local board of Realtors. It basically functions as a timestamping lock. It’s designed so that only real estate agents can get into the property. Every agent has a four-digit pin, and every entrance into the property is logged.

**This product keeps your home secure so you can know exactly what’s happening inside your property.** We use these on every personal property listing with the homeowner’s approval because we want to make sure the home-selling process is simple and secure.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us by phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
