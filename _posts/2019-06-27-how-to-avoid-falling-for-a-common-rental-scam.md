Did you know that, if you’re looking for a rental property, there are scammers (or “goobers,” as I call them) out there trying to take your money?

Before we get to that, let’s quickly talk about the Louisville/Southern Indiana market. Our market is still very hot. **There are more homes available than there were a couple months ago, but there are more buyers out and about too.&nbsp;**

Part of the reason buyers have come out of the woodwork is because interest rates are so low. Rates were predicted to increase this year, but that hasn’t happened, so buyers are trying to lock in a low rate before the predicted increase takes place next year.&nbsp;

In short, this makes now a good time to buy or sell a home.&nbsp;

Now, back to our main topic—scammers in the rental market. These scammers look for listed homes that are vacant, then list an ad (often on Craigslist) for them claiming that they’re the owner and they want to rent them out. If you respond to these ads, they’ll claim that they’re “out of town” and that they’ll send you the keys to the home after you send them a deposit check.&nbsp;

Needless to say, **after you send that money, you never see it again, and the keys never arrive.** You would not believe how many people fall for this scam. Unfortunately, these scammers are hard to trace. If you get the authorities involved, they don’t have a lot to work with.&nbsp;

If you suspect that someone you know is being taken advantage of with this scam or you see a suspicious ad, get in touch with me and I’d be happy to verify whether the property in question is an actual rental. In the meantime, share this video with your friends and family so they don’t fall prey to this scam.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this topic or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, call or email me anytime. I’d love to help you.
