Hurricane season has arrived here in North Houston. And, especially after Hurricane Harvey, it is common for residents of our area to feel a little uneasy. Because of this, our team has put together a hurricane preparedness guide.

**This guide is full of useful information about how to prepare for a hurricane, as well as what to do and where to go if a hurricane hits.** The guide also contains tips on what to do following a hurricane if your area was impacted.

In putting together this guide, we wanted to be extremely thorough. This is why we’ve included information about how to keep children, pets, and elderly family members safe and sound before, during, and after the storm.

**You can download this guide for yourself here.**

Our team and large volunteer network were able to help many families and provide several resources during Hurricane Harvey, so we hope that if you need similar assistance in a future storm, you won’t hesitate to reach out. Hopefully the need for help doesn’t arise, but we will be here for you if it does.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
