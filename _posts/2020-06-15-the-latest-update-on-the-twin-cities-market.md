<p style="text-align: center;"><em>How is our market doing amid the COVID-19 pandemic?</em></p>

Now that we’re in the first part of summer 2020, we can all look back and say it’s already been quite a year so far. Obviously, there has been the issue of COVID-19 shutting down the country (and the world) for a while, but nevertheless, our real estate market has been humming along. Most people are still buying and selling homes, so our market wasn’t really affected all that much.

**Single-family homes between $300,000 and $500,000 are still selling very quickly,** but one thing that has changed in the Twin Cities market is that lower-end properties are selling slower than normal—especially townhomes.&nbsp;

Our absorption rate, or how quickly homes come on and off the market, is currently under two months. Given that six months is a balanced market, **we’re in a pretty extreme seller’s market.**

This past week, we had scheduled six showings for an out-of-state buyer, but by the time they got into town, there were only two properties left—everything else had sold.&nbsp;

We’re even seeing some multiple-offer situations, which raises the question of why some properties sell in a day and some don’t. As always in real estate, location is a big factor in a home’s sale. Condition and price matter too of course, and usually, **a good-looking home with a competitive price can overcome other unchangeable issues the home has, like its location.**

If you have any questions about the market and how it affects your personal situation, don’t hesitate to give us a call or shoot us an email. We’d be glad to help you.
