We are so excited to invite you to our annual Colemere Realty Associates "Pumpkins Against Hunger" event, to be held on October 6, from 4:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. Come join us for a fun and meaningful Halloween event. This year at "Pumpkins Against Hunger" we will have refreshments, face painting, kidsâ€™ activities, prize drawings, a sawdust pool with prizes, and of course pumpkin cleaning and pumpkin carving. A major part of this event is the food drive. We will be collecting food for the food bank as they stand in great need this time of year, so please bring your nonperishable item and we ask you to be generous as we will match donations. For more details about the charity event, watch this short video.
