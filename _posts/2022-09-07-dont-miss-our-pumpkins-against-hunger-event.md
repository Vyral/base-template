Enjoy a Halloween event for a great cause\! We’re so excited to announce our annual Colemere Realty Associates Pumpkins Against Hunger event. We look forward to seeing you on **October 6 from 4:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. at Sandy Lone Peak Park.**&nbsp;

We’ll have refreshments, face painting, kids’ activities, prize drawings, and the best part—pumpkin carving. We’ll clean them, so you don’t have to worry about the mess and can just focus on carving\! You can even take it home with you. Please also bring a can of food for the local food bank\! We love to give back at this time of the year. Let’s make this a fun and meaningful occasion\!
