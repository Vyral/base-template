Before you try selling your home on your own, you may want to learn about the many aspects of a sale that real estate agents handle for you.

Though you’re able to sell your house on your own, it’s not the best idea. Foregoing the help of an experienced real estate agent can actually be detrimental to your home sale.

One of my current clients first came to me with the intention of selling his home without an agent. He believed he knew what his home would be sold for, which was funny\! **Even the most experienced Realtor doesn’t know precisely how much a house will sell for.** He found his price by using a Zillow Zestimate, looking at what his neighbors’ homes are listed for, and getting an appraisal.

These resources showed that his home was worth less than he hoped, so I asked him more about the house. After learning about his home’s updates, it became obvious that a lot could still be done. There were also a lot of factors involved in selling a house that he hadn’t considered, such as investing money into his home to get it sold quicker and for more money.

Eventually, he realized that I had all the answers he was looking for and that I could help him sell his home much more easily than he could on his own. **Because most for-sale-by-owner homes stay on the market longer, it was a good choice.** People often overestimate the value of their homes because they’re emotionally involved. It’s easy for them to believe their home is the best one on the street.

Your agent is not involved emotionally, so they can help you make well-informed decisions that bring you to a better outcome. As agents, our job is to price your home correctly, market it, and get it sold. It’s in our best interest to do so—we aren’t paid until the home is sold. We can look at local market trends to figure out how your home should be priced, and we can help you find updates that can increase your home’s value.

When selling your home, you want a good agent on your side. If you’re looking to buy or sell a home or you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
