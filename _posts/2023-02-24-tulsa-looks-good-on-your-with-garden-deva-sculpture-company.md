In the market for some whimsical garden art?? You‚Äôre in luck, because this week Tulsa Looks Good on You is highlighting, Garden Deva Sculpture Company!

Jennie had a chance to chat with co-owner, Bobby Babcock, to hear about the evolution of Garden Deva, since founder, Lisa Regan sold the business in 2017. *Spoiler alert* it ends with a love story üíï.

Located at 1326 E 3rd Street, this shop sparks the imagination the minute you step in the door! Garden Deva offers an array of pieces from large sculptures all the way down to a small piece to decorate your garden pot. With a variety of events, attendees have the opportunity to sip wine and create a wind chime with friends. Or maybe you want to stretch your creativity a bit further with their beginner or intermediate metal sculpture workshops.
