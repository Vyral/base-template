Today we’re bringing you some quick tips on how to prepare your home for resale.&nbsp;

The first thing you need to do is go walk a model home. Builders spend a lot of money staging their model homes. What better place to get ideas? Best of all, this is free.

**Next, declutter. Less is more.&nbsp;**

You have definitely filled your home with lots of love and memories. But when people enter your home, they want to see themselves in it. You’re going to be moving anyway, so decluttering can help you expedite the process.

Third: **clean, clean, and clean some more.** Focus on faceplates, light fixtures, bathrooms, and any other spaces that need it. What are buyers going to notice when they walk into your home?&nbsp;

You want to make sure your home is sparkling before buyers go through the door.
