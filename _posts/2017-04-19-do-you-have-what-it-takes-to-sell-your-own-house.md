If you don't need a Realtor, how do you sell your home on your own?

It might sound like I'm about to give away all my secrets, but the truth is that we really want to serve the community. **If you think you're experienced enough to sell your own house, I absolutely think you should.**

There are four main things a Realtor brings to the table, so here's how you might be able to do them on your own:

**1. Guidance through the process with paperwork and documentation:** If you've done this before, you might be familiar with disclosure agreements, the agreement of sales, and the contracts needed. If you haven't done this on your own, you should consult with an attorney and pay them hourly to help you with the documents to give you peace of mind.

**2. Setting a pricing strategy:** It's best to hire an appraiser for a valuation which you can use to set the price for your house.

**3. Exposure and marketing:** This is the primary reason to hire a Realtor because without them, you won't get the exposure of the MLS and other agents bringing buyers to your home. However, you can create some demand with high-definition photography, compelling advertising, and things like social media, Craigslist, and Zillow to get the word out.

**4. Negotiation:** Most people think this is all about a line in the sand, but we call that competitive negotiation. Collaborative negotiation is more complex and used less, but can often get you much further toward what you want. It's about asking the right questions, learning about the other party, and crafting a proposal that's a win-win for both. Come up with a list of questions to ask buyers to find out why they're moving, their timeline, and what's important to them.

If you have any questions at all for us—even if you're thinking of selling on your own—we're always happy to help. Just give us a call or send us an email and we'd be happy to help you soon.
