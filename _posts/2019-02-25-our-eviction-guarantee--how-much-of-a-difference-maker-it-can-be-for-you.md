Property management companies can be distinguished by the services they offer. One add-on to our services that we offer you, the owner, that you won’t find just anywhere is the **“eviction guarantee.”**

If you’re unfamiliar with how this guarantee works, allow me to explain: **If we put a tenant in your property, and they must be legally evicted by way of Hawaii’s landlord-tenant code, we promise to pay all legal fees.** &nbsp;

This puts a check on us and ensures that we don’t become complacent in our selection of tenant applicants. In fact, this is a chief reason why I got into this business—I could never find a property manager that could be held responsible for this painstaking process.&nbsp;

It’s our job to be diligent in conducting background checks and to make the necessary calls up front. Otherwise, we risk letting in a tenant in that is evasive about rent payments or worse. Ask yourself: Who pays for that? **If you’re with any other property manager, you’ll be on the hook for legal costs relating to the eviction, and I’ve seen that run anywhere from $1,000 to $6,000.&nbsp;**

What will you get with us?&nbsp;

**We’ll run checks on their background, credit, income statements, LES statement, their job contract, and we’ll also check with their last two landlords.** These sorts of checks are all very important, and, along with our eviction guarantee, they’re part of the package when you work with us.&nbsp;

If you have any questions regarding the eviction guarantee and what we can do for you, as an owner, please give us a call at 808-445-9223. I look forward to speaking with you and answering your questions directly!
