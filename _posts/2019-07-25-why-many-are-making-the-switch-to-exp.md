Today I sat down with The Caul Group’s operations manager, Pam Saxman, to chat about a movement in the real estate industry

In real estate lately, we’ve noticed that many agents are moving from traditional brokerages to either independent firms or to other brokerages. In light of this trend, I sat down with The Caul Group’s operations manager, Pam Saxman, to chat about what’s next for our own team.

**I’ve provided time stamps for you below so that you can navigate our conversation at your leisure:**

0:50—What has us excited about possibly making a move?<br>2:04—Why many of our peers across the country are joining with the national brand eXp<br>3:00—The top three reasons why we’re considering making the switch to eXp ourselves<br>4:23—There are no boundaries to building a team with eXp<br>5:20—About eXp’s referral-based system that rewards agents for inviting others to join<br>6:02—How eXp’s revenue-share systems work for and benefit agents<br>6:55—eXp’s agents are also rewarded with stock options

Our whole team is excited about the prospect of making the switch over to eXp. If you’d like more information about it, simply reach out to us. We’d be happy to share what we know with you.<br>&nbsp;
