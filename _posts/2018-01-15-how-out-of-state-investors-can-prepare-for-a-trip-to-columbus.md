Columbus is a highly popular city among real estate investors. Nevertheless, **many investors still have a lot of questions about what sets Columbus apart.**

They’re curious about how Columbus differs from other cities, like Dayton or Cincinnati, and they also want to know how they should best prepare for putting forward an offer here.

Investors from outside the city also commonly ask that we help give them some insight into the property they’re interested in before they fly in themselves.

Really, all of the questions these investors ask boil down to a curiosity about Columbus.

To get to know Columbus, there are a few resources and factors to consider.

**One major aspect of any city is its school system.**I personally recommend visiting [www.GradeSchools.org](www.GradeSchools.org) for further information on the area you’re looking to invest in. This website will show you rankings of different school districts to help you make an informed investment decision.

Crime statistics are another important factor. The number of crimes per capita and the amount of violent crime that typically occurs in an area are two factors to consider when choosing your investment. There are multiple places online to find this information. Alternatively, **you can contact the local police department to inquire about these statistics.**
