Usually when we sell a property, we list it in the Multiple Listing Service and advertise it globally using our cutting edge marketing techniques.

**However, there is another way to sell your home.**

We realize that some of our clients would rather sell their property and maintain a higher degree of privacy. That’s why we use hip pocket listings.

If you want to sell your home with some discretion, **we are members of an exclusive group of local Realtors** who will cooperate with us to sell your property quickly and for top dollar while maintaining your privacy.

If this seems like the best option for you or you have any other questions, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
