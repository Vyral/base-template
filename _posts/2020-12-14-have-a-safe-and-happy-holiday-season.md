<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We here at Clancy Real Estate wish you all the best this holiday season!</em></p>

I want to wish you all a happy holiday this year, whichever one you celebrate\! While I’m always happy to chat with you about real estate (especially amid this crazy market), stats and trends are not what I want to focus on today. First, I want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart\! For those of you who came out to our Thanksgiving pie giveaway, it was a pleasure delivering pies to your cars so we could keep the spirit of gratitude alive in a safe manner.&nbsp;

Back in March, I shot a video where I said that dealing with this health crisis will be a marathon, not a sprint. We may be looking at another six months until the vaccines take effect, so let’s just stay strong. **We can’t give up now in this critical stretch.&nbsp;**

Most of you know I’m a marathon runner. Runners are a different breed—we just like pain, I guess. Recently, I was thinking back on my first marathon; I’d never run more than 20 miles before, and yet there I was on race day, preparing to go six whole miles farther. I remember the pacesetter saying, “At mile 20, the big boy pants come on,” and I suddenly felt a huge psychological block: What’s going to happen at mile 20? Are my legs going to fall off? Well, I hit miles 21, 22, and 23 in stride, but at the 24th mile my legs turned into bricks; the last two miles were just absolutely brutal.

In a sense, that’s where we are with COVID. Let’s get together for the holidays, but let’s be safe because we’re so close to the last mile. In the spring, I personally knew no one who had contracted COVID-19. Now, I’ve lost count of how many people I know who have had it.&nbsp;

The race isn’t over, so I implore us all to push a little harder and have as safe of a holiday season as we can. I truly believe that we’ll come out of this stronger than when we went in. **Thank you for all of your support this year**; it means the world to us.&nbsp;

If there’s anything my team or I can do to help you as 2020 takes its final bow, just give us a call. We’re always here for you. In the meantime, have an amazing holiday season\!
