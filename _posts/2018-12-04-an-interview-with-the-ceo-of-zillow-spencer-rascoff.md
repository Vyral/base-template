<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Zillow’s CEO discussed the upcoming features we can look forward to as Premier Agents.</em></p>

I had the wonderful opportunity to interview **Zillow’s founder and CEO, Spencer Rascoff**, at this year’s Zillow Premier Agent Forum in Las Vegas. He shared with me the upcoming innovations we can all look forward to from his company.

They’ve announced some powerful new services for Premier Agents, such as expanded abilities for tracking how well we serve our clients. It’s similar to receiving a report card, and as a former teacher, **I’m all about the grades.** They’ll also introduce a new email-forwarding service where we can notify clients of listings they’d be interested in.

Spencer explained that we, as Zillow Premier Agents, have invested digitally in the future. It’s a badge that demonstrates we’re forward thinking, we understand and utilize technology, and we seek to meet our clients’ needs. **Being Zillow Premier Agents is one way we can set ourselves apart from our contemporaries.&nbsp;**

In his podcast, Spencer has had the chance to interview leaders of other high-profile companies. In one of his favorite interviews with **Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella**, he learned about Satya’s efforts to reboot Microsoft and prepare the company for the future.

It was great to speak with Spencer and learn what Zillow will be providing us in the near future. We’re definitely looking forward to the new abilities we’ll be able to take advantage of as Zillow Premier Agents.

If you have any more questions about how we’ll be able to better serve you moving forward, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak to you.
