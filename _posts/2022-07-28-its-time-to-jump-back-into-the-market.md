If you've tried to buy a home in the past two years, you've probably faced your fair share of challenges. Two big challenges that stand out are the limited number of homes for sale and the intensity of bidding wars. However, I have some good news now that things have started to shift.

**Housing inventory is increasing, which means that you have more options in your home search.** More homeowners are listing their homes for sale right now, and rising mortgage interest rates are moderating the market, so some of the frenzy is cooling off. If you put your home search on pause, it may be time to re-enter the market. It still won't be easy since inventory is still relatively low, but it won't feel as impossible as it has in recent years.

In Louisville, there are currently 1,903 homes on the market compared to 1,100 a month and a half ago. If you’re ready to find your dream home, give me a call at (502) 376-5483. I look forward to hearing from you.
