Whether you plan on selling your home in a month, six months, or a year, it’s never too early to talk to an experienced real estate agent like me.

The home selling process can be broken down into three separate phases: the pre-listing phase, the listing (or marketing) phase, and then the escrow phase that takes you to closing.

During the pre-listing phase, I get together with a homeowner to put the listing agreement together. However, we don’t put it on the market yet. We work with the homeowner to fix some things up around the house. Whether that means painting or bringing a landscaper or interior designer in, **we will get the home ready for the market.**

Next is the marketing phase, where your home is on the market and we use marketing to attract buyers from your home. After that, the final phase is going into escrow.

Today, I want to focus on the pre-listing phase. It’s never too early to talk to a real estate agent and start the pre-listing phase. We can talk about simple, cost-effective things you should do to your home to maximize the sales price, get a good return on investment, and get it sold as quickly as possible.

**It’s especially important to talk to a real estate agent before you start making upgrades yourself**. Sometimes the things homeowners do won’t get a good return on investment. As Realtors, we have access to studies and lists of which projects will get you the most bang for your buck.

Ultimately, it’s never too early to engage a good Realtor who’s in the market day in and day out selling homes. Whether you plan on selling your home two, three, or four months down the road, we can help you pick paint colors and projects that will add value and help sell your home.

If you have any questions about selling your home or would like to talk about how to prepare your specific property for the market, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
