<center><em>Thinking of selling your home this winter? Here are a few tips to keep in mind.</em></center>

&nbsp;

Most people think that the best time to sell a house is in the spring because that’s when a ton of other sellers put their homes on the market.

However, because of that influx of activity, there’s a lot of inventory on the market, and demand can’t keep up with the rate that new homes hit the market.

{% include pullquote.html %}

In December of 2018, around 1,681 homes hit the market, and 92% of those went under contract that same month. In January of 2019, just under 2,500 homes hit the market, and only 75% went under contract in the same month.

So, **if you’re thinking about selling your home, I recommend that you don’t wait until after the holidays.** Though there are fewer homes available and less activity in general, this can actually work to your advantage.

If you’d like to discuss in more detail why that is or if you have any real estate-related questions at all, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to speak with you.
