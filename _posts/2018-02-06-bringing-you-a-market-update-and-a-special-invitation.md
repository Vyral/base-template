At this point in the year, there are a couple of reminders and updates I’d like to share with all of you. First of all, our next client appreciation event is coming up soon.

**We hope you’ll join us for a movie day on February 24 at 1:30 p.m. at Arundel Mills Theater.**

We’ve already sent out invitations online and through the mail, so please reach out if you haven’t already received yours.

Now, onto a brief market update. We have somewhat of an inventory crisis on our hands right now. Right now, we’re seeing the lowest amount of homes on the market for a decade in our area.

{% include pullquote.html %}

**For example, there are 61 homes on the market in Catonsville, 74 available homes in Ellicott City, 43 in Columbia, and 74 in Eldersburg.**

Overall, our local market has just 2.9 months of inventory. This means that if no new homes came on the market, all inventory would be gone in just 2.9 months. So if you’ve been thinking about selling your home, now is the time to do so.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
