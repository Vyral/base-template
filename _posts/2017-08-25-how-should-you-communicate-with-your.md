As an agent, your database is the core of your business. Even though we talk a lot about the database, it can be hard to truly grasp the significance of what it does for you and your real estate career.

Your database is something that you’re interacting with every day. So, how do you communicate with it in a systematic way?

Systematic communication with your database is going to be key to your success, and I’ve got an amazing way to achieve it: **the updated 36 touch system and the 19-to-connect from the Millionaire Real Estate Agent 2.**

These slides are from our great Keller Williams class called “Business by the Book.” This class teaches you all about how to connect with your database, and these are the same tools and systems that our top agents utilize all the time with their databases.

These systems and tools help our agents to stay in front of their databases and **close hundreds of transactions per year.**
