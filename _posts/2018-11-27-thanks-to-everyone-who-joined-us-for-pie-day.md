I hope you all had a great Thanksgiving. **Thanks to all of those who were able to come out to our annual pie day**. We bought a lot of them and were so happy to be able to give them out to all of you.

We wanted to take you inside our offices to take a closer look at everything it takes to make this pie day succeed. We also wanted to go around and ask everyone what they are thankful for this year and answer some of your great questions about the market.

**Expect the market for 2019 to be rather hot**. The beginning of the year generally starts off slow, but by February, things will start to heat up. Think about getting on the market sooner rather than later to beat the rush. We take your trust in us very seriously and love working with all of you. So many old, dear friends and clients joined us and we would love to see you at next year’s giveaway.

If you have any questions for us in the meantime or need our help in buying or selling a Louisville home, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I hope to hear from you soon.
