How would you like to save 30% on a Florida vacation this summer? I’m here to show you how.

We’re heading into the “off-season” here in Florida, but **summertime may just be the best time to come down to Florida for a family vacation or to look at homes if you’re interested in buying here**. The hustle and bustle of winter is over and we’re on island time now.

Airfare and lodging are going to cost you about 30% less in the summer than it does in the winter. Home prices also tend to drop off a little bit heading into summer. Let’s just say sellers are in more of a laid-back negotiating mood. This time of year is when the golf is beautiful, the water is nice and warm, and Florida is a fantastic place to be.

So come on down and see me; I’d love to help you plan your summer vacation. I can show you the best spots to visit, the best beaches, and more. In fact, **I have a full list of my favorite beaches, restaurants, tiki bars, and more**. Let me know if you want me to send you a copy.

If I can do anything else for you (including helping you buy or sell a Florida property), give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
