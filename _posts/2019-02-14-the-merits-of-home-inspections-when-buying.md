A popular question that comes up in the home buying process is: **Should I have an inspection carried out on this property or not?** My emphatic answer is always “yes”—**no matter what the condition of the home is like, having an inspection done is a must.**

**An inspection will uncover unknown or major issues present in the home that, if not identified, might be financially burdensome down the road.** If you’re buying a resale property, the inspection is sure to discover at least a few minor issues, but those can be addressed after closing.

* Areas of major concern might be:
* The roof
* The AC unit or furnace
* The foundation stability

These are all areas that your inspector will carefully examine to determine functionality and whether or not repairs or replacement are in order.

It’s important to know what issues (if any) you’ll be up against when it comes time to purchase your home, and **an inspection will make all the facts about the home's condition known to you and prevent surprises at a later date. &nbsp;**
