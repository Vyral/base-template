{% include youtube.html %}Welcome to my video blog. I wanted to wish you a happy beginning of fall! And what a great fall it is.

Normally the months following summer slow our market down. Since interest rates have been on the rise, though, weâ€™ve seen an influx of buyers. Buyers understand that as rates increase, they continue to lose purchasing power.

We are seeing aggressive buyers who are motivated to make great offers. Now is a great time to sell your home! So give me call and we can get your home on the market!

Thanks for watching!
