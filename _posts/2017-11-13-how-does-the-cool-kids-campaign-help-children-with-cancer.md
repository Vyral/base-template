Today I’m joined by Kristen Rutherford and Mackenzie Wieder from the Cool Kids Campaign. Kristin is the Community Relations Coordinator, and Mackenzie is the Operations Coordinator.

This is a local charity that we partner with. We contribute a portion of our commission from every settlement at Keller Williams to the campaign.

**The Cool Kids Campaign helps improve the quality of life for pediatric oncology patients and their families.** The Cool Kids Campaign focuses on academic, social, and emotional support.

They have many great programs in place. During the summer, there is a “Mommy and Me” drop-off for the kids to come and hang out. They also have a camp for all of the kids and their siblings, as well as a condo in Myrtle Beach, where they send the families for vacation.

The Cool Kids Campaign also sends care packages out across the country with all of the kids’ favorite things.

Take a look at the video to see their great facility in Towson, Maryland.

**We are on track to donate $10,000 to the Cool Kids Campaign this year**, and we are proud to help such an amazing organization.

Thanks to Kristen and Mackenzie for joining me today. You can learn more about the Cool Kids Campaign at their [website](http://www.coolkidscampaign.org/).

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
