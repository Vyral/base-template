We want to help you sell your home faster and for more money in 2017. Here’s how we can help ensure a successful home sale.

2017 is going to be a great year for real estate, and if you’re thinking about selling, we want to help you sell your home as quickly as possible.

There are a couple key factors in making sure your home gets sold quickly and for top dollar.

**The first is pricing.** When we price a home, we look at the market data and figure out the range, low, median, and high. We then price the home on the lower end of that spectrum to make sure we don’t end up chasing the market or scare off any potential buyers. This pricing strategy combined with our marketing will likely increase demand and result in a bidding war which will drive up the price.

**The second factor that will influence a successful home sale is maintenance.** You want to make sure you have all those repairs or upgrades done before you list. Get new paint on the walls, make sure your yard looks great, and complete any other projects that will get your home in tip-top shape.

**Finally, make sure your home is decluttered and have it staged.** One of the biggest complaints we hear from buyers is how much clutter is present during a home showing. So, it’s very important that you have decluttering taken care of. As far as staging goes, a staged home sells 88% faster and for 20% more than a non-staged home on average, so it’s something you definitely want to consider doing.

If you have any further questions about this topic, or if you have any other real estate-related questions, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help!
