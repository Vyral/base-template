Canada’s top banking regulators from the Financial Institutions of Canada are making it more difficult for Canadians to qualify for a mortgage. **Starting in January 2018, the most significant changes will come to the affordability test guidelines**.

All new applicants will be subject to this, regardless of their down payment. Financial institutions will require all borrowers to qualify for the greater of these two: 1) The 5-year Bank of Canada benchmark rate, or 2) The contractual mortgage rate plus 2%.

The new guidelines will also prevent all federally regulated institutions from arranging unsecured loans that make it look like a borrower has more of a down payment than they actually do. **The good news is that if you’re a homeowner and you’re renewing your mortgage, you will not be subject to any of these changes if you stay with your current bank.**

This is really an attempt to protect Canadians from overextending themselves. They say these guidelines will be reviewed as the economy dictates and how the housing market evolves. I always prefer to err on the side of caution, so I always advise my clients to make prudent decisions well within their budget.

I’m not in the business of forecasting, but **I can always share the current Toronto market conditions with you**. If you have any questions or want to know more, give me a call or send me an email today. I would be delighted to hear from you.
