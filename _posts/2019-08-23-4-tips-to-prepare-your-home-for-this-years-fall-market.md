Spring might be known as the peak selling season in our market, but fall isn’t far behind. If you're planning to sell your home this fall, your preparation should begin right about now. These four tips will help you stay ahead of the competition and ensure an easy, fast, and profitable sale: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

**1\. Spend a few weekends attending open houses for homes in the same price range you believe your home will be in.&nbsp;**

**2\. Tour your own home to pinpoint pre-sale fixes, structural or operational issues, cosmetic flaws, and excess furniture and personal effects that can go into storage.** &nbsp;&nbsp;

**3\. Get into the selling frame of mind by securing your valuables, scheduling a getaway for the first week your home is on the market, and strategizing how to live in your property while keeping it show-ready at all times. &nbsp;**

**4\. Prepare for your sale and subsequent move with a room-by-room checklist.&nbsp;**
