The cold weather is coming - is your home prepared? If not, you've come to the right place.
Before the cold weather sets in, we recommend turning off your water spigots and draining the lines. This will protect your home from bursting pipes and costly water damage.
Next, you want to check your outside lights. The days are getting shorter, meaning the early mornings and early evenings are darker. Make sure your outside lights are working properly before the cold weather comes along.


Another thing you want to do before temperatures drop is check your furnace. You want to make sure it's working properly now so that you can call someone out to fix it before everyone else does.
