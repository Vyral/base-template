We at the REllis Group at Key Realty wanted to let you know about some exciting events that we have coming up over the next six months—events you’ll be invited to!

Recently, our team moved offices to a much larger space in Grandview Heights, and our team has grown to eight members. With all that momentum, **we’re really getting excited about what we have in store.**

One event in particular will be a monthly event involving different topics and guest speakers. This will typically be a s**maller event held at our office that’s geared towards the topic of real estate investment**—focusing on agents, what it’s like to work with investors or commercial financing, how to stay on top of direct mail, agent accountability, and more.

We also have a **monthly happy hour** at different restaurants and venues around town where we focus on introducing our team to you, networking, and getting to know us personally in an informal setting.

The dates for these events have yet to be announced, but if you’d like to hear more and get updates as the dates are announced, feel free to inquire by phone or email. **We’ll let you know when new events are coming up.**

Even though it’s almost over, we hope you’re having an exciting year. We’d love to hear about your growth and what you’re working on. Feel free to reach out to us to let us know.
