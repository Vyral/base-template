**It turns out that the FHA will no longer implement a reduction in fees.** Because of this change, there are some things you should know about buying a home in 2017.

 If the FHA fee reduction had gone through, it would have saved the average FHA buyer $500 to $600 a year. **That means the loss of that reduction won’t impact your ability to buy a home.**

 Also, Realtor.com reported that in December 2016, the number of people looking at properties increased from 40% to 80% compared to December 2015.

 Many buyers are trying to purchase a new property before interest rates rise, which is smart as increased interest rates would greatly impact buying power. That’s why if you’re looking to buy, you need to hire the right agent to ensure a quick and successful home purchase.

I’d also like to talk to you about how $20 can have a huge impact on our community. The Treu Group is doing a diaper drive to help assist the one out of every three families who are struggling to buy diapers. Many members of those low-income families would like to go back to work, but children are not allowed to go attend daycare without diapers.

**Our diaper drive will be taking place in three different locations: Lighthouse Cove Adventure Golf in Jupiter, iHeart Media in West Palm Beach, and the Treu Group Real Estate office in Del Ray Beach.**

 If none of those are convenient, we can come pick up your donation or even buy the diapers for you if you prefer to make a monetary donation.

 If you’re looking to buy or sell a home or if you would like more information on our diaper drive, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I would be more than happy to help.
