<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Putting your home on the market this fall is a great idea, and there are two reasons why.</em></p>

If you’re a home seller, putting your home on the market this fall can lead to selling quickly and for top dollar.

This time of year, a lot of sellers are getting their kids ready to go back to school and wondering if they’re better off taking their house off the market and waiting until spring to relist. Sometimes, doing the exact opposite will give you the results you’re looking for.

One of the best advantages of putting your home on the market in the fall is the fact that **everyone else has taken their home off the market.** This means there will be lower inventory throughout the rest of the year.

Think about how many homes come on the market in your subdivision during springtime. You probably see “For Sale” signs everywhere. During the fall, that’s not the case. The buyers walking through your home will have to choose between one or two other homes instead of as many as 10.

The second advantage is **there won’t be as many buyers in the marketplace.** There won’t be as many buyers walking through your home, but the quality of those buyers will be the highest quality you’ll see all year long. Think about it—if a buyer is looking to move during the holiday season, that’s not someone who wants to move. That’s someone who **has** to move.
