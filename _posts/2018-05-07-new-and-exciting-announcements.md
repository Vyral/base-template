We have a couple exciting announcements from our team to make as our spring market moves along. 

First, we want to thank you if you were able to join us at the Malibu Café for our Earth Day event this past April. We had such a blast meeting all of the clients who joined us, and with that in mind, we want to remind you to mark your calendars for our next upcoming event—**our Summer BBQ Bash on July 28 from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m..** We plan on having lots of fun, and you’re officially invited.

We'll release more information about the event in coming weeks, so be on the lookout for updates.

In addition to this announcement, we’d like to introduce you to the newest member of our team, Ruth Cavanah. **Ruth has become a great addition to our team.** She's been adjusting seamlessly into her permanent role as a showing agent while also temporarily covering for another team member, Heather, who is taking time to enjoy her newest baby girl. Ruth will be out every day previewing and showing properties for us, which will enable us to see homes the minute they hit the market and meet with you so you can get the first look at them. 

We’re excited to have Ruth on board. You can reach her by calling 805-990-8900 or emailing ruth@radkeagency.com.

As always, if you have any questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you.
