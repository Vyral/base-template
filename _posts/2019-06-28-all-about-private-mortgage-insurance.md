Today I want to talk to you about **private mortgage insurance,** or PMI. Whether it’s your first or fifth time buying a home, it’s an important term to understand before making your purchase.

With the number of loans you can get to buy a home that don’t require 20% down payments, you’re seeing more PMI. **Freddie Mac describes PMI as an insurance policy that protects the lender in case you default on the loan.** For every $100,000, it can charge you between $30 and $70 per month.&nbsp;

**Once you reach 20% equity in your home, you can have your PMI removed.** You’ll have to hire an appraiser to assess your home’s value, but the few hundred dollars you spend on doing that can save you thousands on the life of your loan.
