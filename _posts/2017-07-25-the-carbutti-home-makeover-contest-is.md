*The Carbutti Home Makeover Contest is now open! If you’re a frustrated home seller, you have a chance to win a free home makeover that will help you finally sell that property.*

Today I’m excited to announce that we are running a small contest.

We are looking for frustrated home sellers. If you’ve had your house on the market for awhile and it hasn’t sold yet for one reason or another, this contest is for you.

**We will do a complete home makeover on your property. Our treat.**

We’ll bring in a professional home staging company who will bring in new furniture and beautifully redecorate and rearrange your home. We will even paint and make small repairs—with your permission. Remember, all of these updates are on us.

We will document the whole process from start to finish. Our goal is to succeed very quickly and sell your home, even if it failed to sell in the first place.

So, how do you enter the contest?  

**Simply send an email to <a href="mailto:jonathan.carbutti@gmail.com">jonathan.carbutti@gmail.com</a>** and include the subject line, “Carbutti Home Makeover Contest.” In the body of the email, briefly explain your situation and include your address and a valid phone number.

Then, we will reach out to you to ask a few more questions and interview you for the contest.

I look forward to reading your submissions and working on your home!
