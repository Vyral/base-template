In our current market, many properties are getting multiple offers. So how do you handle multiple offers as a buyer or seller?

As a seller, it is very important to get multiple offers in order to drive up the price. With our pricing strategies, we can get you a great offer and promote it to other agents so they have the opportunity to bring other bids in. Drawing multiple offers is a great way to get top dollar for your home.

As a buyer, consider writing a personal letter to the seller. Warm, fuzzy letters about your family, kids, pets, and how you connected with the house or neighborhood can really appeal to sellers. It also helps if you introduce yourself to the seller and talk about how much you love the house.

Recently, one of my buyer’s agents created a fantastic letter that really won the seller’s heart. The property had 10 offers on it, but we were able to help them get their dream home!

If you have any questions about how to navigate a multiple offer situation, just give us a call or send us an email. My team and I would be happy to help you!
