{% include excerpt.html %}&nbsp;<br>Do you know what home equity is? In a nutshell, **equity is the current value of your home minus your outstanding loan balance.** With recent increases in home prices, your equity has significantly grown in the past few years.

In fact, according to CoreLogic, the average U.S. homeowner now has over $274,000 in equity, up from $182,000 before the pandemic. This substantial increase has also contributed to home values increasing nationwide. If you've owned your home for a while, you may have more equity than you realize.
