There are so many tremendous values in the high-end market here in St. Charles and the surrounding area that I just had to share a few with you today. 

We are lucky enough to represent many of those sellers, and these values are a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. **Interest rates are still low, so now is the time to act.** 

One of the homes we’re representing has a basketball court in the basement, and all of these homes are gorgeous. Check out the video above for a slideshow featuring these amazing properties.

* 39W179 Longmeadow Lane 
* 5N266 Prairie Lakes Blvd 
* 6N538 Brookhaven Lane
* 39W485 Longmeadow Lane 
* 5N369 Fairway Drive 
* Lot 1 Kim Lane 
* 38W220 Heritage Oaks Drive 
* 5N287 Switchgrass Lane 

Again, this is the opportunity of a lifetime. If you are considering jumping into the high-end market, you need to act now. Otherwise, you will look back and say, **“I wish I had bought a home in 2018.”** It’s just such a fabulous time to buy. 

Give me a call or send me an email if you have any questions. I would be happy to help you!
