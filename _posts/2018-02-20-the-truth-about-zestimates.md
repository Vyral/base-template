Have you ever had a friend or someone that you know who, when they’re sick, will use a website like WebMD? They always end up having a horrible disease.

In my opinion, Zestimates are kind of like that. You go online and get just a ballpark figure of what your home is worth. You’re not really getting the truth.**Zestimates only come from an algorithm of public information.**

**The best way to get the truth is to contact a Realtor and have them come over to do a fair assessment of your property by looking at it.** That way, you’re finding out if, say, the upgrades you’ve made in your house help improve the value. They’ll also consider the neighborhood condition, which also affects property value.

Those are things that Zillow can’t do.

If you want a fair estimate of your home’s value so that you can get a better price for it or if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help.
