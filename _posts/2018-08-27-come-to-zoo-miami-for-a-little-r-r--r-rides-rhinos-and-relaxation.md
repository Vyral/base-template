If you didn’t know, **Zoo Miami is the largest tropical zoo in the United States.** Home to over 3,000 animals, this park is about three miles around and features over a hundred exhibits. Due to the unique climate in South Florida, you’ll find a wide variety of animals from Asia, Australia, and Africa.

There are five main exhibits:

* Florida: Mission Everglades
* Dr. Wilde’s World of Discovery
* Wings of Asia Aviary
* Critter Connection
* Amazon & Beyond

Whether you want to **catch a show, feed the animals, check out the rides, or relax as your kids play,** you will not be disappointed with this park. Zoo Miami gives you the opportunity to experience the up-close-and-personal feedings of animals you’d normally only see in the wild: Giraffes, rhinos, camels, tortoises, and parrots. The Global Realty Team decided that feeding the giraffes and parrots were our favorite activities.
