I have another great aerial tour to take you on today, and this time we’re flying over Watersound Beach, a world-class beach destination along scenic Highway 30A. Sitting on 256 acres of land and featuring over a mile of beach frontage, it provides a perfect blend of master-planned, ultra-luxurious homes and tons of bicycle trails, walking paths, and some of the most beautiful nature you’ll find in our area. It also neighbors Deer Lake State Park, which makes it a great place for families to explore the outdoors. Just outside the gates of Watersound, you’ll also find the Hub, which is a great place to go out to eat, listen to some live music, and enjoy all sorts of fun family entertainment.&nbsp;
