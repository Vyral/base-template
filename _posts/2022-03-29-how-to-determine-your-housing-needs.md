We receive this question almost daily: “How do I determine my housing needs before I start my home search?” Today we’ll discuss the key things to consider.

The first and most crucial step is to **see if the current market conditions match what you need.** How competitive is the market at the moment, and how much inventory is there? Are there homes available in the area and price range you want to be in? If that answer is no, then you may need to reevaluate what you want in a house and try to make something else work. If you’re willing to make what’s currently available work for you, then it’s time to look at what your future payments will look like and what the taxes are in that area.

The second step is to evaluate what your future needs may be. Is your family growing, or will you have children moving out of the house? Will you need a bigger home, a smaller home? **Then** **see if your budget is going to support what you’re looking for in a property.**

Something we mention all the time because it’s so critical is discussing your situation with your trusted Colmere Realty agent. Having a professional opinion, facts, and what would be best suited to your circumstances will help you make the right decisions. Everyone’s needs are different, and the market is constantly changing, so having someone on your side who knows the market can help make the process less emotional and stressful. Making decisions based on facts and not emotions is essential in real estate.&nbsp;
