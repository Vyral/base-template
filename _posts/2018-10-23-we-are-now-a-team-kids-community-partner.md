Julie Hudash started Team Kids 18 years ago in part because of her own children. She wanted them to have the opportunity to know that they were powerful, to understand that the community was counting on them, and to be exposed to critical issues in the community. She started the organization to let all children learn that they’re strong enough to make a difference in the world.

Since its founding right before September 11, 2001, Team Kids has accomplished a lot. Julie’s proudest achievement in that time has been orchestrating the **Team Kids Challenge Program, a month-long early-intervention program run in public elementary schools by both staff and trained police and firefighters.** They spend the during of the program learning about homelessness, hunger, kids with terminal diseases, and how to support our troops. The program is run in Orange County, Los Angeles, and Arlington, VA; just this spring, they launched the program in New York City.

**Julie is proud to mobilize our youngest citizens to become change-makers, to connect with social issues, and to create a country that truly invests in our kids** and puts our resources where our words are.

We have recently partnered with Team Kids to develop a new program here in Orange County: the Superhero Program. Modeled after the Team Kids Challenge Program, the Superhero Program serves to involve children with their communities to create a positive impact by **learning how to support their heroes, the hungry, the homeless, and those who have undergone tragedy.** With each project, they earn stickers and are eventually launched as superheroes to address key issues.

If you’d like to learn more about the Team Kids organization and see what they’re doing to create change in their communities, visit **[www.TeamKids.org](http://www.teamkids.org/)** and follow them on **[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/teamkids)**, **[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/teamkidsorg/)**, and **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/teamkids)**.

If you think your children would be interested in participating and becoming superheroes themselves, if you have general questions for me about real estate, please feel free to reach out to me. I hope to hear from you soon.
