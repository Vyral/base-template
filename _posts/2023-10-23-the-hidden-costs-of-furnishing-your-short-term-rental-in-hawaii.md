Is your home furnished or unfurnished? If you plan on renting your home out in Hawaii, this is a critical question. Generally, furnished homes (especially if you are renting them out as a short-term rental, like an Airbnb) come with tons of problems, including broken furniture, missing items, bedbugs, and more. Plus, many renters like to pick and choose which pieces of furniture they want to keep and which ones they want to replace.&nbsp;

**This all adds up to a much higher repair cost for you.** Hawaii Pacific Property Management doesn’t take on short-term rentals, and this is part of the reason why.&nbsp;&nbsp;
