Do you know who pays the commission in a real estate transaction?

We had a buyer a couple of months ago who was very hesitant to buy because of the low-inventory situation in this seller’s market. They had the money for a down payment and closing costs but no money to pay the commission.

I told them that that’s okay because **the seller traditionally pays the commission fee.** The buyer pays for the property, and the commission for both the buyer’s and listing agent comes out of the seller’s profit.
