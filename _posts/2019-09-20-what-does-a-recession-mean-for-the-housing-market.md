Is a recession coming?

The short answer is yes, but the word “recession” has become somewhat taboo because of the last recession back in 2008. A lot of people assume this recession will be as bad or worse as that one. Many buyers and sellers, in particular, are choosing not to enter the market and instead wait on the fence.&nbsp;

Here’s the thing, though: A recession doesn’t automatically mean the housing market will crash. Follow along in the video above for my full explanation of what this recession means for buyers and sellers. **For your convenience, I’ve provided timestamps so you can skip ahead to various sections at your leisure:&nbsp;**
