We wanted to take a moment to reflect back on 2016 and how you helped us make it great.

We really appreciate all of our new and repeat clients that helped our business this year. I also want to thank everyone who sent us referralsâ€”I can't even begin to tell you how important they are to us!

This year was an amazing one for the Portland real estate market. We saw some of the most extensive price appreciation that our country has seen in some time. In fact, we led the nation for most of the year in percentage-based appreciation. We expect 2017 to be a very similar year, even though I think the appreciation rate will slow a little bit.

If you or anyone you know is interested in buying or selling a home in the Portland area as we head into 2017, send them our way and we'll treat them well. We appreciate you thinking of us.

Happy Holidays!
