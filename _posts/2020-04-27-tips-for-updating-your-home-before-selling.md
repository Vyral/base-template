I hear a lot from home sellers who tell me that they don’t have the money to make expensive updates and repairs. They’re unsure of what their next move should be, so today I’d like to offer my advice.

**One option is to offer an allowance to buyers for repairs.** We can figure out how much it would cost to make the necessary updates and repairs, then offer an allowance to buyers based on that amount.&nbsp;

Another option is selling the home as is to an investor. **If you just want the house sold and aren’t too particular about the price, this is a quick option with little hassle.**

One thing I always recommend is deep cleaning, decluttering, and depersonalization. This makes your home more attractive to people and allows them to see the strong bones of your property.

**If you don’t have a ton of money, even simple and inexpensive repairs like painting can make a difference.** Anything you can do to make the home move-in ready will help you maximize your sale price. By investing a little bit into your home, you can reap the benefits and increase your sale profits.

If you have questions for us about preparing a home for sale or about your personal situation, feel free to reach out via phone or email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
