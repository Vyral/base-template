How accurate is a Zestimate?

Before we answer that question, let’s review what a Zestimate is. According to Zillow, it’s a starting-point algorithm that helps determine a home’s market value. The problem is, buyers and sellers alike don’t use it as a starting point—they take it as fact.

Now, let me ask you a question: When’s the last time Zillow came to your house for dinner? Also, why didn’t you invite me?

I’m kidding, but I’m also serious—**how could one of Zillow’s Zestimates determine the market value of your home if they’ve never been inside it?** In 2016, the CEO of Zillow himself sold his home for 40% less than it’s Zestimate.

Zillow uses two pools of data to formulate their Zestimate. The first is public data, which includes things like the home’s square footage and lot size. The second (and more critical) is user submitted data, which is something you as a homeowner can actually influence.

How? You can go into Zillow, claim your house, and tweak all of the facts listed about it. If you make sure all the facts are correct or add an upgrade, that will change your home’s Zestimate. If Zillow wanted this to be an appraisal, they would’ve called it a “Zappraisal,” but they didn’t.<br><br>Another fact you should know about Zillow is they publish an accuracy chart, or what I like to call an “inaccuracy chart.” This chart calculates the difference between the home’s Zestimate and its actual sale price. In Bergen County alone, more than 26% of all homes sell for a price that’s more than 10% off their Zestimate.**<br><br>If you’re really interested in understanding the market value of your home, it makes sense to hire a local, trusted real estate advisor** who will give you an honest answer about how much your home is worth. If you like, you can send me your home’s Zestimate and I’ll do my own free walkthrough of it and provide you my interpretation of its current market value.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>**<br>Why should I claim my home?**<br>The Owner Dashboard also allows you to edit your home facts, which factor into your Zestimate&reg;. The Zestimate home valuation is Zillow's estimated market value for your home, calculated from public and user-submitted data. Updating your home facts can help make your Zestimate more accurate.&nbsp;<br>***[https://www.zillow.com/sellerlanding/claimyourhome/](https://www.zillow.com/sellerlanding/claimyourhome/)***

**Zillow's Accuracy Chart**<br>The Zestimate’s accuracy depends on location and availability of data in an area. Some counties have deeply detailed information on homes such as a number of bedrooms, bathrooms and square footage and others do not. The more data available, the more accurate the Zestimate value.<br>***[https://www.zillow.com/zestimate/#acc](https://www.zillow.com/zestimate/#acc)***
