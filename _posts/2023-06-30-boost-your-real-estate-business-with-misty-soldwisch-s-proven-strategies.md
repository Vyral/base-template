Today, I want to share my secrets on how you can excel with Be Better DSM. Often, I hear agents mention that they received leads from their broker, but upon closer examination, it turns out to be a forced registration lead from a website, typically containing only a name, phone number, and email.

Now, let me tell you the secret sauce of my team. We not only provide you with the opportunity to prospect from various lead sources, but we also have an exceptional client services team. This team plays a crucial role in setting qualified appointments for our sales team. **In fact, they scheduled 1,100 appointments for our agents just last year.**

But it doesn't end there. Our client services team goes above and beyond. They have meaningful conversations with potential clients, gathering their motivations, past experiences, preferences in an agent, aspirations, and any other relevant information. They even connect them with one of our preferred lenders. After that, they coordinate with you to find a suitable time on your calendar and set the appointment.

Once the appointment is scheduled, they send confirmations to both the client and you. Behind the scenes, we also create a comprehensive client file that includes all the necessary materials for the appointment. **This level of support and organization is far more valuable than a simple forwarded email with just a name and phone number.**

With our approach, you can focus on delivering a top-notch experience to your clients while our client services team handles the administrative tasks and ensures that you have everything you need. It's a winning formula that sets us apart.

If you're ready to take your real estate business to new heights, learn from my experience and leverage Be Better DSM. For more information about this topic or the business of real estate in general, please feel free to reach out to my team by phone or email. We would be happy to help you.
