Don’t let your yard go to the geese—it’s much easier to take care of landscaping projects yourself.

It’s very important that you keep up with landscaping this time of year.

**You don’t want to let your yard get out of control.** Good, clean landscaping adds value to your house. Plus, it just looks nice.

Don’t let crabgrass take over your yard or garden beds. Your house will benefit so much from your steady upkeep. After all, it’s much harder to track down some geese to do your weeding for you than it is to just take care of it yourself in the first place.

If you have any questions or need a referral to a landscaping company—I do not recommend these geese—just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
