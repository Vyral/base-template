<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are two easy ways to prepare your home for the real estate market.</em></p>

When it’s time to prepare your home for the market, there are a couple of simple fixes that make a huge difference and get you more than your money back:

**1\. Make it sparkling clean.** This is the easiest way to improve your house for the market and the most crucial. For some, this may seem obvious, but others don’t realize just how much of a difference this makes. People generally also acquire a ton of stuff, so you must also depersonalize the home.

**2\. Paint.** The most popular colors right now are soft grays, and many are even moving to whites again (I know, five years ago that would have sounded crazy). “Agreeable gray” is the current go-to ultimate neutral paint color that stagers and builders use. If anything looks a bit dull or scuffed up, painting can help.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about preparing your house for the market or real estate in general, I’d love to speak with you. Call or email me at your convenience.
