Today, we are thrilled to highlight another small business in our Community Spotlight series: [Green Kettle Coffee](https://www.greenkettlecoffee.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}! **This new business is located in the vibrant downtown area and we highly recommend it.&nbsp;**

This coffee shop is a small, cozy place with around eight tables. It’s clean and has great coffee! We recently had the pleasure of hearing from the owner, Kristen Gilbride. She opened in this area because of the great foot traffic and parking opportunities.&nbsp;

**Green Kettle focuses on supporting local businesses**, so Kristen makes sure to get all of their coffee roasted locally—they even get their pastries locally! They have a fairly extensive coffee menu with a lot of seasonal drinks, and people are loving it. Kristen is very grateful for the tremendous business and support they have gotten so far.&nbsp;

We are proud to support this great business with top-notch coffee. Plus, we always encourage supporting local businesses! Green Kettle can be found at 208 Center St. in Wallingford. If you have any questions about this or anything related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out. You can call or email us anytime and we’d be happy to hear from you.
