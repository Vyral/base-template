Let’s take a look at the first quarter real estate market for 2018. How did it shape up compared to last year?

Right now, it looks like **we have about 10% more homes on the market this year than we did last year.** What is interesting is that our sales are up by 9% over last year.

Our days on market seem to be trending down right now; the average in our area is 87 days, whereas last year, it was 119 days.

**Our average sale price did go up.** Now, it’s at $1.1 million, compared to last year’s $968,000.

We can see that in the first quarter, there are pockets of supply here and there while others have no supply at all. **There are very few homes priced under $600,000,** and the same is true for homes under $1 million. As we creep up above the $1 million mark, we find that there is quite a bit of selection. Closer to $2 and $3 million, there’s even more selection.

This year, there has definitely been a little bit more supply for buyers to choose from, as well as more sales for sellers to take advantage of.<br><br>If you have any questions regarding the market, please feel free to reach out to me. I hope to hear from you soon!
