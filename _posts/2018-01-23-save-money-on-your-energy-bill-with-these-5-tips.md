Did you know that there are five things you can do to reduce your energy costs this winter?

We’ve seen some record-low temperatures these past couple of weeks, and these tips can help you save money on your bills for the rest of the season.

**1. Reverse the direction of your ceiling fans.**This will draw the cool air upwards and push the hot air down. Make sure that the fan is on a low speed, not high speed.

**2. Check your doors for drafts.** If you feel air coming through, especially on a windy day, get a door sweep to block that air flow. Also be sure to check your weather stripping.

**3. Make sure that your air filters are clean** to help hot air flow. If the filter is blocked, it will reduce the amount of warm air that reaches each room, increase in the amount of energy it will take to heat your house.

**4. Insulate your outlets.** This will require an electricians help, but you can remove the covers on your outlets, install insulators, and then put the cover back on. This is another area where cool air from the outdoors can seep in.

**5. Check your ductwork and insulation.** You can purchase special tape and sealants at most hardware stores that you can use to cover voids in your ducts to promote flow, so that warm air isn’t just leaking into your basement.
