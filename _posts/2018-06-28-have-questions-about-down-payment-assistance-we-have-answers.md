**What are the income and credit requirements for qualifying for these programs?**

For the local programs, your credit score must be at least 580, and your income cap depends on how many people are in your household. For statewide programs, your income cap is $86,000 if you have three or four people in your household. There is also a conventional down payment assistance program that allows you to make as much as $114,000 per year and still qualify.&nbsp;
