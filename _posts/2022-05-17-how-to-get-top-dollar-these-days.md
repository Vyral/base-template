In this spring market, we’ve been hearing the same question from everybody we’ve talked to: “How can I get top dollar for my house?” Here are some things you can do to ensure you get the most value out of your home sale:

**1\. Make sure your house is marketable.** The photos need to look good, and it has to be move-in ready. Buyers coming to the market right now want to move in immediately, and they're willing to pay more for the house to be move-in ready.

**2\. Preparation consultation.** We can come by and create a list of the things that need to be done to your house to get it ready to sell. For example, a fresh coat of paint is a great, inexpensive upgrade.

**3\. Staging.** We also offer staging as part of our services, which will make sure the house looks presentable and attractive.

**4\. Photography.** iPhones cameras are good but nowhere near as nice as a professional photographer's photos. Hiring a professional photographer to show your house in its best light will attract better buyers with better offers.

If you have any questions, reach out to us by phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
