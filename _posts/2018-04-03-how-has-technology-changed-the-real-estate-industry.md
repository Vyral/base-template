Many of you know that photography is one of my favorite hobbies. I love taking pictures. Photography is just one way that technology has changed the real estate industry, and virtual tours have made a huge difference.&nbsp;

We take professional photos and do virtual tours of our listings for all of our sellers. We also use Matterport 3-D cameras to create dollhouse tours so that buyers can sit in their pajamas at three in the morning anywhere in the world and get a good idea of what the house looks like.

We used to have broker tours and open houses, but **the technology has gotten so good that you have a really good idea of what these homes look like before you ever see the home in person.&nbsp;**

In fact, one of my favorite stories is when I helped an out-of-country buyer. They were from India and the husband was being relocated. I showed him the house and had my iPad so that I could Skype with his wife and show her the house. She knew exactly what they were buying. Between the virtual tours, the Matterport, and the walk-throughs with FaceTime and Skype, she felt like she was right there.

The real estate industry is so different now than when I started. When I got into real estate, everything was on paper and everything was faxed. Now, with photography, digital signatures, and more, everything has become so high-tech that **buyers have very few surprises during their transaction.&nbsp;**

Does all of that technology replace the agent? Absolutely not. You still need our expertise and our experience, but it is great to know that we are one step closer to eliminating any surprises that you will face throughout a real estate transaction.

If you have any questions about real estate or about buying or selling a home, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
