{% include youtube.html %}Have you ever wondered why some homes fail to sell? Typically, there are four reasons for this:

1. Poor marketing. Gone are the days when an agent simply puts up a yard sign, enters your home on the MLS, and waits for a buyer to come along. These days, savvy buyers are cruising the web for homes. In fact, according to the NAR, over 90% of buyers find homes online before they go out looking. We invest over six figures to get our listings  seen by the highest number of buyers!
2. Bad photos. You can’t take photos of your home with an iPhone and expect it to sell. The first showing is online, and if you don’t have professional photographs, buyers won’t even waste their time clicking on the listing. We send out a professional photographer to all of our listings and create a virtual tour for them as well.
3. Incompetent agent. Homes often fail to sell based solely on the agent. There are great agents, in-between ones, and horrible ones. A bad agent will price the home incorrectly and fail to return phone calls. You need an agent who is going to be with you every step of the way!
4. Pricing. Many sellers think they can price their home high and just negotiate down if necessary. However, putting the right price on the home from the start is crucial if you want to sell quickly and for top dollar. It’s not an exact science, but our team has mastered the pricing process!
