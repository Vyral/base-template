Today we’re going to go into the details of the costs of selling your home. If you’re ready to get your property out there, **these are some of the costs you can expect:**

**1. Paying for upfront repairs.** This isn’t always the case for home sellers, but more often than not, it is. When I visit a home for the first time, I look for any glaring repairs that need to be done before listing. This will ensure the home is shown in its best light. I’ll make recommendations for staging as well.

**2. Commissions.** You can anticipate an average commision rate of 6% to 8% depending on the type of service you opt for.

**3. Closing costs.** Depending on the state you're in, closing costs may vary. In Pennsylvania, these costs are split 50/50 with the buyer. That would include a transfer tax, a mortgage and deed recording tax, etc. If you're in New Jersey, the seller typically pays that transfer tax on their own.

**4. HOA fees.** If your home is a condo or part of an HOA, you are going to have to order a resale certificate and association documents for the buyer prior to closing. This is an upfront cost you’ll have to pay.

**5. After-repair costs.** After the buyer has had their home inspection, it’s possible they might ask you to repair certain items or ask for a credit for those repairs.

**6. Payoffs.** If you have a mortgage, any kind of lien, or utility balances, you’ll need to pay those off at closing as well.

**7. Moving expenses.** You might have to pay for some storage as well.

**8. Cleaning expenses.**

Those are the basic costs of selling your home. If you have any questions or want to discuss any of these things further, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email anytime. I look forward to working with you.
