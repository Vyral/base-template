<center>There are no good online leads, but they can still be extremely valuable.&nbsp;</center>

&nbsp;

If you’ve ever worked online leads, you know the frustration of calling numbers only to never get a call back, or getting a wrong number, or an email address that reads [mickeymouse@gmail.com](mailto:mickeymouse@gmail.com).&nbsp;

You pay good money for these leads and put in a good effort to generate them, but the majority of them are junk. This is what drives agents to start asking themselves: Where can I find good online leads? In that quest, they may start buying leads from Realtor.com, Trulia, or Zillow.

Here’s the thing, though: **There are no good online leads.** Whether they’re self-generated or cost a lot of money, the truth is that even world-class, leading conversion rates are only about 5%. This doesn’t mean you should work online leads—even though they’re generally not good, they can be extremely valuable.&nbsp;

Why? Because if you generate or purchase them at the lowest possible cost, you can generate or purchase a significant quantity of leads. This way, even at a low conversion rate, you can make a fortune.&nbsp;

It all starts with a mindset shift. **Don’t look for good leads—look for a quantity of leads.** You’ll find those extremely valuable.&nbsp;

As always, if you have questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;
