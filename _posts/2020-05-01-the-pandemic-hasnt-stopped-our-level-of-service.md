<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Sokoler Team is here for you every step of the way, even if those steps looks quite different than what we’re all used to.</em></p>

We’re continuing to sell and list homes here in Louisville and Southern Indiana, following more closely than ever the CDC guidelines. You may remember from a previous video message the types of safety precautions our team is taking when we show properties: gloves, shoe guards, disinfectant wipes, and avoiding direct contact with doorknobs and light switches. Home inspectors haven’t taken a break either, and Brad Lawler, the owner of HomeTeam Inspection Service, recently shared a video showcasing the measures they’re employing to do their job safely. Though our processes look quite different, it doesn’t mean you can’t still buy or sell a home right now. To hear how my agents and I are leveraging some of the most advanced virtual technology to help clients, watch the short video above.
