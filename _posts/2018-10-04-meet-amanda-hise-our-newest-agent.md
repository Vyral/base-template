Today I’m excited to introduce you to the newest member of our team: Amanda Hise. Amanda grew up in Carroll County and moved to the Evansville area to attend UMBC in 2013 and study biology and psychology. Originally she planned on practicing medicine, but she discovered it wasn’t her passion and changed career paths. She’d always been interested in real estate, and she finally took the plunge and got her license in May of this year. We’re excited to have Amanda on board, and with our training and technology, we think she’ll be able to do great things.
