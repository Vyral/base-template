*This is just a reminder for California property owners to send out your exemption notices to tenants if you want to remain exempt from rent control in California.*

Tenant-occupied properties like single-family homes, condos, townhomes are exempt from the new California rent control law. Additionally, duplexes where one unit is owner-occupied and the other is tenant-occupied are exempt as long as one of the units remains owner-occupied.

Regardless, in order for these properties that are supposed to be exempted from the rent control law to stay exempt, **the property owner must give an exemption notice to the tenants or they could become subject to rent control**, which details both limitations on how much you can raise rents as well as how you can terminate a tenant’s lease. For example, if the tenant has lived in the property for over 12 months, the owner can no longer terminate that lease without just cause under the rent control law.

Many people aren’t aware of the full extent of this new law change. If you’d like, I’d even be happy to send you a full copy of the law so you can look it over yourself.
