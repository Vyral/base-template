To make sure your personal property is adequately protected, there are a number of insurance coverage options available.

I recently sat down for a conversation with Micah Patterson of Patterson and Associates Insurance to help explain a few of these options, and I’d like to share a few highlights from this conversation with you today.<br><br>One of the first things we touched on was a personal experience I had late last year when my own home had flooded. With this experience in mind, Micah pointed out that flood insurance is not included within regular home insurance policies.

Therefore, anyone who may potentially find themselves in a position like what I went through last year should consider seeking this additional coverage. **Even homes outside of flood zones can experience flooding.**

Another additional coverage option Micah recommends is earthquake insurance. Natural disasters may not be something you think about every day, but this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t protect yourself against them.

So, if you would like to get in touch with Micah about these or other insurance options, give him a call at (214) 253-2577 or email him at [micah@piainsure.com](mailto:micah@piainsure.com).

And, as always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
