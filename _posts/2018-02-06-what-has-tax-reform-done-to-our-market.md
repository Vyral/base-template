How will the new tax laws impact homeownership in 2018?

There have been some significant changes to the tax reform bill since it was originally proposed. For this reason, we highly recommend you speak with your accountant about how you may be personally affected.

On a wider scale, though, there are some things we should all be aware of.

The No. 1 rule change people have been talking about is the one pertaining to interest deduction. Now, interest deduction will be capped at $750,000. So&nbsp;**if you’re purchasing a home in 2018, keep in mind that you won’t be able to deduct interest on any property priced above that cap.**&nbsp;If you are buying a second home, then the $750,000 cap pertains to the combined value of the two homes.

Another important change is that you can now no longer deduct interest corresponding to finances such as tuition. Moving expenses are also no longer deductible. However, you can still reduce moving costs if you are an active duty military member. Also, **deductions from real estate taxes are now capped at $10,000.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
