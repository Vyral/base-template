Lately, a lot of people are asking, “Are we approaching another real estate bubble?”

**Here in Hoboken, the market trends are not point to another bubble**. Right now, there is enough equity built into homes that we should be able to sustain any interruption in the market or any decrease in pricing.

Historically, real estate trends on a seven-year scale. Since we are reaching the latter end of the scale, it makes sense that we’re starting to see a bit of a slowdown in the market, as well as an increase in the absorption rate this year as opposed to last year.

In the higher end of the market, specifically above the $1.25 million price point, properties are staying on the market longer and the list to sales price ratio has gone down over the last year and a half. We are starting to see a similar trend in the higher hundred-thousand dollar price range, too.

**Interest rates will also play a major part in our market** for the next six months to a year. The Fed is expected to raise rates again in the third quarter. However, positive job numbers should ease off some of the bond buying in our market.

There has been a slight uptick in inventory. Due to a huge build up in rental properties along River Road and in downtown Jersey City, investors and landlords have seen a negative impact in their bottom line, as some of these investors have had to lower their rental prices.

That said, every situation is different. If you have any questions about buying, selling, or investing in our market, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
