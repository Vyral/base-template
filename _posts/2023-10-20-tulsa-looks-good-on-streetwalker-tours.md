Jennie connected with owner, Ellen Stanley, with Streetwalker Tours to learn all about this budding Tulsa business!



Having done tours and hikes for various organizations for over a decade, Ellen finally decided it was time to open up her own tour business!



With various tours ranging from a stroll around downtown Tulsa to Name That tour to help you become an expert on all things Art Deco…and not.



Being a business owner isn’t always easy, but Ellen said she loves the variety her business brings, recently adding some urban art tours to the lineup.



“There are hidden gems in Tulsa and we just like to grab people and take them down those alleys if you are just willing to look,” Ellen shared.
