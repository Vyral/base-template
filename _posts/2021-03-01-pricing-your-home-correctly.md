*Here are three things to consider when pricing your property for sale.*

**It’s crucial to price your home correctly when selling because you don’t want it to sit on the market for very long**, as this causes other issues. First, consider the condition of your house; make sure it’s clean and all major repairs have been done. Second, think about your property’s location; is it on a cul-de-sac, a corner lot, or in a desirable school district? Third, consider what’s happening in the current market; what is it dictating?&nbsp;

If you have any questions concerning pricing your home or real estate in general, feel free to give me a call or send an email. I would love to help you.
