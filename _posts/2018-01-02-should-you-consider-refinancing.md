Mortgage rates are still at historic lows. For many homeowners, **it's a great time to refinance.** Refinancing allows you to pay off your current mortgage with a new mortgage at a lower rate. Refinancing means lower monthly payments and more money left in your pocket.

But here's something important that many people don't know: **Refinancing can affect your credit score negatively.** You see, when you refinance, the new creditor will do a "hard inquiry" about your credit history. This inquiry can actually lower your credit score. Looking for new credit lines (like a new mortgage) equates with greater credit risk.

**How much will a hard inquiry actually lower your credit score?** This depends on several factors. In some cases, **a hard inquiry might not lower your credit score at all.** However, if you've recently opened up multiple new credit lines (auto loans, credit cards, etc.), then a hard inquiry **could decrease your credit score by up to five points.&nbsp;**This is true if you only have a short credit history. And if you shop around for the best rate for more than 45 days, **you will get multiple hard inquiries**. Each of them will contribute to the total effect on your credit score.

So what does this all mean for you? Unfortunately, there's no simple answer. It's going to be a part of the calculation you have to make for yourself, which will also include the refinancing fees, your own credit history, and how much you could be saving with a refinanced mortgage.
