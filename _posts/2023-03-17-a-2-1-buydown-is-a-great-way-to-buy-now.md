Are you wanting to buy a home but are worried about affording it with these high interest rates? Today, I’m here to show you how to lower your payments with a 2-1 buydown. This is a relatively new product that has now become very popular. The nice thing is that it can be used with an FHA loan, VA loan, and even a conventional loan.&nbsp;

To show you how this product works, I’m going to give you an example. Let's say the rate at the time you lock in your loan is 6.5%. **With a 2-1 buydown, the payments start 2% lower.** That means the first year of payments will be at 4.5%. Then, during the second year, the rate will be 1% lower, which is 5.5% in this example. Therefore, this product can make a huge difference in your house payment and get you to a time when rates may start to go down.&nbsp;

One great thing for buyers is that only the seller can pay for this. Plus, **many financial gurus are predicting that in the last quarter of 2024, rates will begin to tumble.** Therefore, you’ll get some relief in the next couple of years and be able to make it to that time.&nbsp;

There is no penalty for refinancing before the two years is up, and the rate is not higher than usual at the beginning if this product is used. I truly believe that it’s smart to buy a house now and take advantage of this lower payment, especially before home prices rise.&nbsp;
