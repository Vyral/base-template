{% include youtube.html %}A question I’m often asked is, “How accurate is Zillow’s Zestimate?” Well, the truth is: they aren’t.

Spencer Rascoff, the CEO of Zillow, put his home on the market with a Zestimate of $1.75 million but only ended up selling for slightly over $1 million. The information he got from the Zestimate led to him getting 40% less than he believed he would from the sale of his home.

Personally, I would think twice about trusting the Zestimate. **If the CEO himself lost money from it, it isn’t hard to see why buyers should be wary of the tool.** Contacting a Realtor is the only reliable way to know, and work with, your home’s true value.

<br>But the Zestimate isn’t the only thing that wrong with Zillow. Their listing data is also very inaccurate. I’ve received several phone calls from people interested in a home they’ve found on Zillow, **only to find out that they are under contract, sold, or sometimes not even on the market at all.**

This is frustrating to buyers and Realtors alike. If you are thinking seriously about searching for a home, take the what you find on Zillow with a grain of salt.

As a consumer, you may use Zillow as a place for research. You can see aerial views, data, and trends for certain areas. However, knowing how to distinguish what is useful from what isn’t on the website is going to be key.

Once more, Realtors are going to be your best resource when buying a home.

So if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email, I look forward to hearing from you, soon.
