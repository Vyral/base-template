Most first-time homebuyers have no clue what earnest money is because nobody tells them about it. Earnest money is essentially a buyer’s collateral. It shows that the buyer is serious, has cash to put up to buy the home, and wants the house.&nbsp;

Most times, earnest money deposits are between $500 and $1,000. However, the price is usually higher in new construction homes.&nbsp;

**It’s basically a credit that’s used at the end of the transaction to assist you with closing costs and other expenses.** The earnest money is credited back to you once the deal closes.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about earnest money or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
