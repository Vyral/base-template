There is a common misconception that you need a down payment of 10%, 15%, or 20% in order to purchase a home. However, there are actually a few options out there that allow buyers to put zero down in their home purchase.&nbsp;

The first option pertains specifically to people who are serving, or have previously served, in the military. As a way to thank our veterans and active duty military members for their service, **the VA loan allows them to purchase a home for no money down and with a very low interest rate.**

For those who aren’t in the military, there are still options.

The USDA loan, for example, is a great route for anyone considering living in a rural area. There are a few different applicable areas around the outskirts of Charlottesville. Belmont, Mount Holly, Troutman, and certain other places all qualify.&nbsp;

This loan is a great option, since it has low interest rates, no down payment, and requires no PMI—which is mortgage insurance.&nbsp;

If neither of these programs are applicable to you, there are still options.&nbsp;

Certain programs exist that allow you to pay as low as 1% down. A couple of our in-house lenders **actually allow buyers to qualify for a conventional loan with just a 1% percent down payment.** To qualify for this, you do need a credit score above 640 to 660 depending on your job and assets.&nbsp;

Finally, grant programs through the state can also provide down payment assistance. **The North Carolina Grant Program is still offering $15,000 for first-time homebuyers.** This is a great program. If you are a new buyer or haven’t bought a home in a few years, we’d love to help you look into this product.
