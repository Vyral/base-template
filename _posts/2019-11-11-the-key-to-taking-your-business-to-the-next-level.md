What is holding you back from selling more real estate? Is it the market? Is it your brokerage? Is it the fact that your spouse doesn’t want you working as much? What do you need to happen in order for your business to move to the next level?

To be honest, **if your business isn’t reaching the next level, it’s because of you.** This is a hard reality to face, but the fact is that, somehow, you’re not putting in what’s needed to take you there.

It’s probably not so much the time or effort you’re putting in; I know a lot of people who spend a ton of time and effort who are still struggling. One reason so many agents fail is that they lack the proper education.&nbsp;

Have you analyzed yourself to figure out what your strengths and weaknesses are? Improving your business will only happen once you dig deep and consider your successes and failures honestly. **Once you do, you’ll have a platform on which you can build your future success.**

People who have had really hard times in life and have had to build themselves back up again tend to end up stronger because they know who they are and where they are at. For my part, I write down notes about my life, including what I’m doing poorly and what I’m doing well. It’s hard, but it’s a good foundation to get to know yourself better and improve your skills as an agent.

From there, start educating yourself. **Listen to podcasts, read books, and talk to other agents to grow from other people’s experiences.** Once you do, I have a feeling that you’re going to be much more successful.

If you have any questions or would like to speak with me, reach out to me. I promise to take the time to listen to you and to guide you toward making the best choices in your real estate career.
