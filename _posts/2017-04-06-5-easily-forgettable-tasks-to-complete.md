Moving to a new town can be difficult. There are just so many different things to keep track of that it can get confusing. There are probably even a few things that you’ll completely forget about until the moving truck is all packed up and ready to go. Here is a list of five things you might not have thought about, but you should definitely complete before you leave:

1. Banks. Check to see if your bank has a branch in your new city. If they don’t, you may need to find a new one.

2. Medical needs. If you can, have your doctor call in your prescriptions to a pharmacy in your new town. Keep your old doctor’s number handy in case you need to contact them to forward any paperwork in the future. If you’re keeping your health insurance plan, look for doctors in your new area that accept your insurance. If you need to switch providers or update your plan, try to do it before moving.

3. Things to transfer. Transfer memberships from local organizations, gyms, associations, and clubs. Be aware that you may have to pay an early termination fee on some of those. Factor that into your moving costs.

4. Raid the kitchen. About a month before moving day, start using up frozen or canned goods so you don’t have to let anything go to waste. Donate any unopened, non-perishable food to a local food pantry.

5. Check the car. Give it a tuneup to avoid a breakdown on the way to your new home. If you have a trusty mechanic, ask that they refer you to another one near your new home. Pack a first aid kit just to be safe.

These are just a few of the things that you should do before you move. If you have any questions or want any more tips, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
