We are experiencing a strong real estate market, both locally and nationally. Interest rates are continuing to stay low, demand is continuing to stay high, and homes are continuing to be very affordable. Job security and consumer confidence are up as well, which has made this market all the more impressive.

**Homes are getting snatched up by buyers just as soon as they hit the market, as long as they are priced correctly.** A lot of homes are selling within days, if not hours, of being listed. If you’re in the market to sell a home, there hasn’t really ever been a better time.

If you’re in the market to buy a home, there are some things you should know as well. With homes selling so quickly, you need to be pre-approved for a mortgage before even looking at homes. It’s a necessity to be able to make a quick decision in this market, and you can’t do that without knowing what you can actually afford.

We also have a bit of good news to share with home sellers. If you list your home with us between now and June 30th, we will waive our half of commission. **You’ll still have to pay the standard 3% to the buyer’s agent, but you won’t have to pay us a cent.** It’s just one of the ways we are showing our gratitude to the community and to those who entrust us with helping them make this important decision.

If you are curious as to what your home is worth in this strong market or if you just have any questions, give us a call or send us an email at any time. We look forward to hearing from you.
