In our market, the homes that are still hot are those in the lower price point—**the sweet spot is between $250,00 and $550,00.** The reason this price point is still so hot is because of home affordability; this is the range in which most people will qualify for a mortgage.

At higher price points **above $750,000, it seems like homes are staying on the market a little longer.** The same is true of homes that aren’t yet in market condition, like those that haven’t been decluttered, depersonalized, or staged well. Price and condition both make a huge difference in whether or not buyers will make an offer on your home in this market.

The median home price for San Diego County remains between $585,000 and $630,000. For a 2,000-square-foot home, you’ll end up paying around $575,000, depending on upgrades and the condition of the home.

Many buyers and sellers on the fence about entering the market have been asking about whether the market is shifting or not.

My answer is yes, the market is shifting, **moving from a complete seller’s market to more of a balanced market**. In the end, it’s a win-win for both buyers and sellers. Interest rates are still historically low and you’re getting a lot of bang for your buck.

If you have any questions about the market or about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
