When preparing your home for the market, there are four areas you need to really focus on:

**1. Curb appeal:** Whenever sellers ask me where they need to start to get their home ready for the spring market, I tell them the front yard. Clean your flower beds, rake and clear away all the leaves, and remove any overgrown bushes and replace them with something smaller.

**2. The kitchen:** The kitchen is the heart of the home, and every Realtor can get excited about featuring a great kitchen on a listing. Start with potentially replacing old or mismatched appliances. Stainless steel appliances are still popular with today’s buyers, and we can help you also pick out some inexpensive appliances if that’s what it takes to do the job.&nbsp;

You also want to look closely at the cabinets in your kitchen. Sometimes we will list a beautiful home, but buyers will still say that it feels dated. What they’re really saying here is they’re not finding the look they’re after. We have painters on staff who can transform your kitchen’s look into something that will appeal to more buyers.&nbsp;

**3. The paint:** It’s a good idea to pick colors that are drawing buyer attention these days, which are the greys and light neutral tones.&nbsp;

**4. The flooring:** You definitely want to make sure your flooring looks amazing. If you have hardwood floors, they should look polished. Nobody wants to see scratched-up hardwood floors. If you have carpet, it’s a good idea (and a cheap one) to replace it to make everything look fresher.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
