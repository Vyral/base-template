Communication in real estate has changed dramatically over the last 20 years. 20 years ago fax machines were king. As real estate agents, we had to wait for faxes to come through before a deal could be signed and ratified.

However, today, **we're hyper-communicators**. Agreements can be sent in the blink of an eye via text, and contracts can be signed on cell phones. Electronic signatures are making the process much easier and faster.

If you don't have a tech-savvy agent backing you up as a seller or buyer, you could miss out on a sale or purchase. **When choosing an agent to help you, it is important to understand how they communicate so you don't miss out.**

If you have any questions about communication in real estate or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
