Did you know that Brad Pitt makes $20 million on average when he films a movie? Whether you did or not, you’re probably wondering what this has to do with real estate. Well, let us explain.

Imagine that Brad Pitt showed up on set without ever touching a script. Things probably wouldn’t go so well. So **why don’t we, as agents, put this same emphasis on knowing *our* scripts?&nbsp;**

It’s time to make an adjustment in the way we treat our scripts. And agents who aren’t using scripts at all have even more of an adjustment to make.&nbsp;

**There are tons of scripts out there, so take the time to learn one first and build your skills from there.** Being able to nail your script when you step onto the real estate “set” will make your role as an agent the part of a lifetime.&nbsp;
