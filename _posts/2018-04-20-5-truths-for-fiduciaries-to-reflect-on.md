  There’s been a lot of news circulating recently about the F-word. Of course,
  I’m talking about “fiduciary.” Today, I’d like to share my thoughts on recent
  developments, as well as list five truths I think we should all reflect on.
  The first of these truths is that there must be a fiduciary standard. To learn
  more, watch this short video.

**\*Please Note: As I predicted, shortly after this was filmed the SEC took the next step and did choose to release proposals for new standards. [Click here for an update.](http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20180420/FREE/180429987/sec-advice-rule-may-give-rias-leg-up-over-broker-dealers)&nbsp;**

Today I'd like to talk about the F-word. By that, I mean “fiduciary.” This word has been in the news a lot lately.

We all know by now that the DOL rule was shot down by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. To tell the truth, I agree with this ruling. I think the DOL rule truly deserved to die. Why? Well, I think it’s absurd that we’d have a standard for retirement assets that’s different from the standard for non-retirement assets. From a pragmatic sense, any rule that is 1,000 pages long will be very difficult to enforce.

Looking to the news, certain media outlets seem to believe that somehow a title will be sufficient in protecting the investing public—as if it is better to have an advisor title. Personally, I think this is ridiculous. So let’s talk some truth. There are five points I’d like to share.

**1. It is imperative that there be a fiduciary standard.** You wouldn’t go to a doctor, lawyer, or accountant without a standard of care that places the consumer’s needs first. Why should wealth advising be any different?

**2. Not all RIAs are saints.** Some RIAs are actually crooks. If you’re going to be a crook, you’re going to pretend to be a fiduciary. Just because someone says they’re a fiduciary, it doesn’t mean they are. A simple Google search will show that what I’m saying is true.

**3. Not all brokers are crooks.** The old stereotype of a broker who is pounding candidates and pushing products no longer holds true. In today’s world, there are many practitioners who care passionately about their candidates. Crooks and saints exist on both sides.

**4. Commissions, by themselves, are not evil.** There are many candidates who actually prefer to pay commissions. There are many candidates who are best-served by paying commissions. Let’s not treat the Investment Advisor Act of 1940 as if it were the 10 Commandments. Today’s world is different. We must be pragmatic about what is truly best for clients.

**5. The fiduciary standard is coming.** In today’s non-regulatory environment, the SEC is going to come up with some kind of fiduciary standard. It may not come tomorrow. It may not even come this year. But, it will come. We are moving forward to a fiduciary standard. What does this mean for individual practitioners? Well, the first thing is to recognize that coming regulations are not the only answer. For example, I still set my alarms and lock my door when I leave home, even though robbery is illegal. It’s imperative that the industry educates the public, because regulation alone will never be sufficient. The standard is coming. You can either get on the train or get run over by it.

It's important to remember not all financial advisors are equally affected by the Fifth Circuit's decision. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.
