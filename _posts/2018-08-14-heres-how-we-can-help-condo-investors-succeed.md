I have some pretty amazing news to share with you today. We just rolled out a program that is going to help so many of your investors when trying to buy a condo.

How many of you have lost a transaction when dealing with an investor because the condo restrictions were too heavy? I have, and I’m sure many of you have as well.

**Here is a game changer for you.** When an investor has 25% of their own money to put down on a property, we will no longer hit you with that crazy owner-occupancy requirement, which says that you can’t have more than 49% tenants in the building. In fact, we just closed a transaction with a property which was 80% tenant occupied.

One more big thing to mention is this:&nbsp;**If one entity owns more than 10% of the condo complex, you’ve probably lost a transaction as a result of that.** Well, we just upped that requirement to 20%.

If you have any questions or need any help getting a condo deal done with your investor, please feel free to give a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
