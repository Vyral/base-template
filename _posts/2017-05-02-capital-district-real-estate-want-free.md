I'm excited today because I just received the first shipment of my book, "What Every Person Needs to Know About Selling a Home in the Capital District."

My team and I have sold over 7,000 homes here in the Capital District for well over a billion dollars in real estate sales. In my new seller book, I will share with you my experience and knowledge to help you sell your home fast and for top dollar. Unfortunately, I talk to many homeowners who really have no clue about what it takes to sell their house for top dollar.

There's a book for both buyers and sellers. In the seller version, for example, **you'll get tips on how to sell your house for top dollar, staging, the questions you should ask a real estate agent, preparing for home inspections, and setting a price for your home.** Pricing your home is one of the most important aspects of your sale.

If you're even thinking about selling your house here in the Capital District in the next one to two years, you definitely want to get a hold of your free copy of this book.

If you'd like to receive your free copy, visit <a href="http://518sellerbook.com" 518sellerbook.com</a> or call me directly.

I look forward to hearing your feedback!
