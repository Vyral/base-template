As a mortgage lender, people always ask me which factors will most affect their credit. Today, I’d like to share a list of these key factors.

**1. Making your payments on time.** You may not realize what a dramatic impact missing even just a single payment can make on your credit score. The effect can actually be between 20 to 60 points, so make sure you are always punctual with your payments

**2. The length of your credit history.** The longer you have an account open, the more points you’ll rack up over that time. As a side note, if you want to pay off an account and credit card, never cancel that account. If you do, all of the credit history will disappear and cause your score to go down.

**3. Your balance against the limit.** As a rule of thumb, you should always keep your credit card balance 30% below your limit.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are interested in free credit counseling, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
