{% include youtube.html %}Today we want to reach out to you to talk about home protection policies. We recently sold a few homes belonging to senior citizens who hardly ever used their appliances or air conditioning. Not all home buyers will be lucky enough to move into a house like this with rarely used appliances and A/C. When things break, rather than going back to the seller with a broken A/C, if you have a home protection policy, you can get it fixed easily for as little as $55 or $60.

If you don't have that policy, you could be looking at spending between $1500-$3500 to fix it. Having your appliances covered by a home protection policy gives you great peace of mind. If something goes wrong, you can give us a call and we'll help you call the home protection company and get you taken care of.

If you have any questions, please give us a call. We would be happy to help you out.
