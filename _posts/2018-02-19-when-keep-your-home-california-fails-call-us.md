What happens after you work with Keep Your Home California?

I have a client that called me about a week ago who was obviously struggling with keeping her mortgage. She had worked with Keep Your Home California for about three months, faxing her information to them. They just weren’t being responsive.

She was getting nowhere, and the lender was still putting pressure on her to do something with her home; she was **on the verge of foreclosure**. At that point, she asked me to step in and take care of the problem. Now I’m working with her lenders as opposed to Keep Your Home California.

As we were talking and looking at the reviews for Keep Your Home California, **we found that the program has done a great job with many people**; they’ve helped 79,000 homes. However, **there are those that they haven’t helped.**

From what we’ve seen, for every one person that they’ve helped, there are about three people that they’ve not been able to help. That’s where people like me have been able to help. Just like Keep Your Home California, we do not charge any fees. **We just want to help people stay in their homes**.

So, what are your options after Keep Your Home California fails you?

You don’t need to immediately sell. You need someone like me to come in and help you consider all your options and contact your lender on your behalf; not every lender works with Keep Your Home California.

We are able to structure your plan and talk to your banks to keep you in your home so that you’re not forced to sell immediately.

If Keep Your Home California has failed you or you aren’t satisfied with the service, feel free to give us a call. We’d love to help you.
