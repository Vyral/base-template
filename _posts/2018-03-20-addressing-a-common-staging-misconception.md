There are a few misconceptions surrounding the home staging process. These misunderstandings often become apparent during staging appointments with sellers.

This can cause sellers to become somewhat standoffish. After all, this is the home they’ve lived and made memories in. To have someone come in and advise them on things to change can be uncomfortable, and even insulting.

However, sellers must remember that the purpose of staging is to make the home appealing to a wide audience. **Buyers want to be able to envision their own lives in the property, and seeing reminders of the seller’s life distracts from this goal.**

When stagers adjust, remove, or add to your home furniture and decor, it isn’t anything personal. It’s simply their job to maximize the space and make sure the home will photograph well.
