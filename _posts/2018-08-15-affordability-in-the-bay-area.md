Today I want to talk about how affordable it is to live in the Bay Area. I have some staggering statistics that I will jump right into.

There is an app called Blind that a lot of tech workers use to communicate with each other anonymously. Recently Blind sent out a survey to 2,326 tech workers across different companies including Google, Facebook, Oracle, etc., to ask if they could afford a home. 59% of respondents said that they were unable to afford a home in the Bay Area.

This is not surprising seeing as how the median home price in San Francisco is $1.6 million. At this price, **only 12% of people in San Francisco can actually afford to buy a house.**

It’s not just the everyday, average worker that can't afford to live in the Bay Area—59% of tech workers can’t either. This is exactly why we are seeing so many people sell their homes and leave the Bay Area.

If you have any questions about this or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to contact me.
