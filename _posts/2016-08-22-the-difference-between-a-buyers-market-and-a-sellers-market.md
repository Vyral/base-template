Do you know what a real estate agent means when they say “buyer’s market” or “seller’s market?” Do you know the difference? People are always asking what kind of market we are in, but it’s tough to answer for Northern Virginia as a whole.

For the most part, we are in a seller’s market, which means we have at least three months of inventory available on the market. In other words, if we stopped putting houses on the market today, it would take about three months to sell all the properties currently on the market. A balanced market has about six months of inventory available, and a buyer’s market has over six months of inventory on the market.

Since we are in a seller’s market, that means it’s a good time to sell your home. Many people think that since we’re in a seller’s market, it’s not a great time to buy, but that’s not true. It’s a great time to buy because interest rates are so low. Your purchasing power is determined more by interest rates than home prices.
