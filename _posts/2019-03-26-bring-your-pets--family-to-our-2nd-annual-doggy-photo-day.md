<p style="text-align: center;"><em>It’s almost time for our second annual Doggy Photo Day, and you’re invited to join us.</em></p>

Our second annual Doggy Photo Day is coming up on April 6 at Porter Ranch in Viking Park, and you are cordially invited.&nbsp;

**From 9 a.m. to 11:30 a.m., we’ll have a professional photographer on hand to take photos of you and your family pet.** We’ll even provide costumes so every pet looks sharp.&nbsp;

If you plan on attending, you can register online at [www.doggyphotoday.com. ](http://www.doggyphotoday.com){: target="_blank"}We’ll also be raffling off prizes, including a gift basket from [Nectar of the Dogs winery](http://www.nectarofthedogswine.com/){: target="_blank"}, a local winery that donates a portion of their proceeds to local pet charities, a $50 gift card from [Petitude](https://www.pet-i-tude.com/){: target="_blank"}, which is a local pet store, and a $50 gift card to Best Buy.&nbsp;

The proceeds of every sale will be donated to an animal rescue organization. We hope to see you there!

In the meantime, if you have any questions about this event, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to speak with you.
