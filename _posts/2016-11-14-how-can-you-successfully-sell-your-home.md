Today I’m here with the top tips to sell your home in the fall or winter.

**First of all, you need to pay close attention to curb appeal.** Don’t get too excited and buy every pumpkin, gourd, or fall decoration out there. There is a fine line between having a nice, decorated farmer’s porch and a full-blown farmer's market. Go easy on the exterior decorations.

 Although people expect the leaves to fall, you should work to keep your yard somewhat clear, especially during a showing or open house. The same thing holds true for the winter. We all expect snow, but you need to keep your driveways and walkways clear. Your home should look nice and accessible in either season.

**Next, go easy on the holiday decorations.** Having some nice decorations for the fall or winter can make your home feel warm, inviting, and cozy, but going crazy with decorations can be a turnoff. Don’t buy every blow-up snowman from Lowe’s and throw them in your yard. Don’t get three different Christmas trees and scatter them throughout the house. You can absolutely decorate for the holidays, especially if you have small kids, but just make sure it’s tastefully done if your home is on the market.

**Let there be light.** As it starts to get darker outside, it’s important to make sure that your blinds are open during the day to let in the natural light. In the late afternoon or evening, leave your lights on. Set exterior lights to a timer and light up the inside of your home before you leave. If you have energy-efficient light bulbs, make sure you turn them on early so they have time to warm up. You want people to walk into a home that is warm and bright, not dim and gloomy.

**Finally, make the fireplace a focal point.** If there is peeling paint, repaint it. Clean it out, get a new grate, and make sure the wood is neatly stacked so that it looks fantastic. If you are comfortable leaving your gas or wood burning fireplace on for showings, go ahead. Just make sure the screen is in place. That way, buyers will walk into your warm, inviting home and think, “Wow! I would love a fireplace.”

 These are just a few things you can do to make sure your home sells in the fall and winter. If you have any other questions about preparing your home for the market, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
