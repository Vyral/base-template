<i>"It was really nice working with the Vallee Gold team because they werenâ€™t pushy at all. We were first time home buyers and they were really good about working with us and making sure that we were comfortable and had the house we wanted. It was perfect! Don even went out of his way on a Sunday and came to show my dad some of the houses we were considering while he was in town. He answered all of our questions and really showed that he cared about us."</i><br /><br /><b>-Kaitlyn Rieth, Home Buyer</b>
