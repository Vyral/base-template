How can you get a fresh start for 2018?

I do a lot of coaching with Tom Ferry, and one thing he always stresses is to find your “why.” Whether it’s business-related or personal, find out what motivates you and keeps you going every day.

Within that, **you have to set both long-term goals and short-term goals.** What are the little steps you’ll take every day, every week, and every month to achieve those goals? Make those goals visual—have them in front of you so you have something to strive for and you see them every day. Our brain is like a sponge—you don’t want to leave it sitting on the shelf, you want to keep it saturated. Read books and find something that will motivate you and help guide you down the path you’re looking to go.

Ask yourself: What is the legacy you want to leave at the end of the day? Whether it’s with your family or career, at the end of the day, what is it that you want people to say about you?

In that regard, **who you spend time with is extremely important.** There’s a famous Jim Rohn quote I’d like to share with you that applies to this principle: “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” Make sure you’re spending your time wisely.

In the meantime, let us know what you’re doing and what motivates you. If you have any questions or there’s anything we can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you and keep you on track.
