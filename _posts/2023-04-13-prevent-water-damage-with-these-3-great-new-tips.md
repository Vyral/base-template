It's the time of year when we typically experience a lot of water issues. Therefore, you need to make extra sure that you’re clearing your roof and preventing water from getting into your crawl space. Today, we are sharing a few suggestions for accomplishing this.&nbsp;

**Start by making sure that your sump pump is working and doing a test run.** Sometimes sump pumps get gravel or dirt in the float, which causes them to malfunction. Also, make sure that water is being carried away from the foundation of the house. Most of the time, a pipe will be coming out the side of the house with a sump pump, probably five to 10 feet long. Then make sure your Visqueen barrier is well taped down, as that keeps moisture from seeping up into the crawl space.

Also, make sure to turn your gutter downspouts away from the house. If you've taken them off, make sure to put them back on, and go buy them if you don't have them. I'd even recommend getting a splash block to put underneath it. **As things start to melt, water coming down off the roof goes straight down into the foundation,** and you will end up with water seeping through your cement blocks, even though they're sealed. Then you will end up with water in your basement or ruined sheetrock and mold.

Therefore, double-check that everything is set up. Keep in mind that since the pandemic, contractors have been hard to come by, so it will take several days to get someone out to you if something goes wrong. It is far better to be proactive than reactive. Then if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us by phone call or email. We would be happy to help you!
