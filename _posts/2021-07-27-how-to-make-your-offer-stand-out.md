With the real estate market so tight, it is more important than ever to write a winnable offer. Today, I’ll be going over my tips to help you write the best offer you can.&nbsp;

**When you find a home you love, there are a few things you need to take care of.** You should talk to your home inspector and write your pre-approval letter as soon as possible. You want to be organized and ready to go in case of a multiple-offer situation.&nbsp;

Once you’re ready, your offer should focus on a few things; namely, price and contingencies. Most people know that a winnable offer often has the highest price, but you also want to limit your contingencies. For example, no seller wants an inspection that lasts 10 or 14 days. Our team has also partnered with another company that can give you cash as long as you are pre-approved for a mortgage. Cash offers are more attractive to sellers, so it could be the leg up you need to buy a home you love. They charge a small fee, but it won’t make or break your offer.

We are really excited to be partnering with this company, so do not hesitate to reach out with any questions. We can help you write a winnable offer that gets you the home you want.
