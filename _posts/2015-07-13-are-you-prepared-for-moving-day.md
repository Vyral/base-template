Moving is absolutely one of the most stressful parts of the buying and selling process. In order to reduce stress, you should start preparing at least 60 days in advance.

The first thing you should do is get quotes from three different movers. After that you should begin to pack up all of the little things around your home that you don't necessarily need in your daily life. If you're selling your home as part of the move, the decluttering process is important.

If you don't know what to do with all the things you've accumulated, you can take them to the Goodwill or donate them to charity.

Also, keep in mind that moving-related expenses are tax-deductible, so keep a file of all of your expenses during the entire moving process.

About two weeks before the move you'll need to complete a change of address form to ensure that all bills and important documents will make it to your doorstep and not someone else's.

Don't forget to call all of your utility providers to let them know when you'll be leaving your current home and when you'll be moving into your new one.

Moving can often be a nightmare, but if you plan and coordinate the process carefully, it doesn't have to be so traumatic. It's actually quite easy when you do calm down and take it one step at a time.

If you need any assistance coordinating this process, please don't hesitate to contact me. I can even recommend some good movers here in Salt Lake City!
