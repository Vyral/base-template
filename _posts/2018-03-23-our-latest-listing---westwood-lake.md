This house is in the premiere school district Ladue.  It is also just 1.5 miles to 2 of the top hospitals in the St Louis Metro area.  Westwood is the municipality which is VERY small but next door is Frontenac and there's Frontenac plaza nearby.  being on a lake is not heard of in St Louis.  There are also no HOA fees for this tiny subdivision of just 3 other homes.
