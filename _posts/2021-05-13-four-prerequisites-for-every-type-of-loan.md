I'm here today with our preferred lender and my husband, Abel Tejeda, to discuss loan requirements. We have three different types of financing products: conventional, VA, and FHA. FHA will generally be the most popular option. Buying a property is probably easier than you think. There are four prerequisites:

**1\. Good credit.** You need at least a 620. Credit repair companies exist, and we can run a simulator that will help clients get to 620. We recommend you get a secure credit card and lower your balances.&nbsp;

**2\. Two years of employment.**

**3\. A down payment.** There are down payment assistance programs, but most loans allow you to only come in with 3.5%, which is known as the first-time homebuyer program.

**4\. At least two trade lines open for 24 months.**

If you have questions about loans or anything real estate-related, please feel free to reach out to me.
