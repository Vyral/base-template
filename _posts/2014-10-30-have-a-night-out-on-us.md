We've had the privilege of working with so many great people over that last few years, and today we want to say thanks for all the support. We are grateful you, your families, and your friends have chosen us to represent you during your real estate transactions, so we want to show you how much we appreciate it.

But first, we ask that you please go over to Zillow and give us a review. If you enjoyed our services and we helped you find success buying or selling, it would mean the world to us if you could go [here](http://www.zillow.com/profile/jstern1/Reviews/) and let us know what you think of us. It will only take a minute, but will help us to continue to grow and improve our ability to serve our clients.

By filling out a review, your name will be entered in a drawing to win a $250 gift card to one of the nicest restaurants in Salt Lake City, [Faustina](http://www.faustinaslc.com/). We'll draw on November 21, so head on over to Zillow and tell us what you though of our service. We would love to hear from you! Thanks, and good luck!
