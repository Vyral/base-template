When you come to meet us to discuss our Strong Tower blueprint process, we'll start by emailing you some information in a small workbook to be filled out beforehand. That helps us know as much info about you as possible when you come in, as well is which forms to bring with you. This could include things like you investment statements or social security statements.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>We follow a three-step process that starts with talking about your vision. In our first appointment, we just want to get to know you. We'll discuss what you're trying to accomplish, your concerns, your current plan, and which areas of help you're looking for. Occasionally we'll provide some advice you can follow until the next meeting, but for the most part, I'll hold off on the advice since I haven't performed my analysis at that point.&nbsp;

Then, the purpose of the second meeting is to go through and assess you current position and figure out if it meshes well with your concerns and goals. We'll also offer suggestions for tweaks and adjustments to help you reach that goal sooner.&nbsp;

We'll discuss implementation at the third meeting; what needs to happen in order to get those issues fixed? We spread this out over three meetings since by the end of the initial analysis, most people's brains are pretty fried. We like to take our time and leave our recommendations and solutions for the third meeting.

It's important to understand that it's not a one-time meeting but rather a process that we engage in to really discover the best solutions. Frankly, we should focus more time on your financial future than preparing for a vacation or trip somewhere. That's precisely why we want to take our time and give you a lot of value in our meetings with us.

If you have any questions in the meantime, don't hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to speaking with you soon!
