I recently appeared on WLBT’s “Ask the Experts” series to talk about the very first step someone must take when buying a home, and I wanted to share a portion of this discussion with all of you today. So what is this step? Actually, the answer probably isn’t what you expect. The very first step you should take is to go get pre-qualified with a lender. By doing this, you can enter into your home search with a concrete idea of what you can afford. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&nbsp;
