One of the main problems that we run into with clients who are in the market for short sale and foreclosure homes is the utilities. **At the time of the appraisal inspection, it is required that the utilities be on in the property** so that the inspector can make sure the home is safe, sound, and habitable.&nbsp;

Also, remember that **when making an offer on a home that’s been occupied by the seller, the owner has to provide a seller’s disclosure.** This report will give you a summary of the property’s condition from the seller’s standpoint. A foreclosed home will not have a seller’s disclosure statement, since the bank that owns it has never occupied the property. You won’t get any inside information about the condition of the home you’re buying.

**Sometimes repairs are needed on short sale and foreclosure homes.** Banks don’t usually want to spend more money to make those repairs, so you might have to pay for them yourself.

There are a few ways you can get around some of these barriers, but it’s important to consider these points if you’re thinking of purchasing a foreclosed or short sale home. Even still, **buying one could be a great way to get a property for well under market value**, whether it be for your primary residence or investment property.
