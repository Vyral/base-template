If your home didn’t sell the first time you listed it, you certainly aren’t alone.&nbsp;

When you’ve been on the market for months and activity has completely stalled, it’s common to wonder what you’re supposed to do next. The truth is that if your home simply didn’t move off the market, it was probably because of one of these three reasons.

1. **Condition.** When listing your home, the first thing you need to take care of is curb appeal. Curb appeal is a critical first impression and will make a massive impact on a buyer’s opinion of your home. Taking care of landscaping and other exterior maintenance items will immediately make a difference in your home’s appearance. The interior of your home is important as well. Make sure that rooms are decluttered before buyers enter to the property. Additionally, make sure that you’ve strategically staged your home. We can give you advice from experience and can recommend you to professionals who can help.
2. **The marketing.**In today’s modern market, 95% of buyers begin the search for their next home online. Your agent must be able to help you create a strong online presence for your property in order to draw in interested buyers. Using professional photography will also make a huge difference. You need to make sure your property is being featured properly and is being presented in the best light.
3. **Pricing.** This last step is actually among the most important. A home that isn’t priced correctly will face massive difficulty in selling. Your Realtor must be knowledgeable, experienced in your area, and able to assist you with pricing your home competitively. Setting a price too high can ultimately cause you to lose out on a ton of qualified buyers.&nbsp;
