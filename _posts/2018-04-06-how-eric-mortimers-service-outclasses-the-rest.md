Why do people choose to work with Eric Mortimer as their Realtor? Just ask Kimmy, a client who worked with Eric to get her home sold. Here’s what she had to say:

"Eric was different from other agents. He was calm and centered about everything. What matched him with me is our shared spiritual beliefs in the way that we approach life, the belief that everything is connected and that are things that you can do to help set up the intention and have it just work out right for the house. He was very positive about how we were going to set the price and about how the process was going to come along.

**Eric helped me get the most I could from my home sale.** Certainly, the house that I was selling was very unique in that we had renovated it and put a lot of extra, special items in it. Eric was actually the last of the Realtors that I had interviewed. A lot of them had brought the same data that he had concerning the pricing for the house, but because this was such a unique house, we actually went with getting an appraisal, per his recommendation.&nbsp;

We set the price based on that. I knew that I wasn’t going to get the full cost of the renovation out of the house, but it was certainly a much higher price than what any of the other Realtors had come up with. They were strictly basing it on market analysis instead of looking at the unique features the house had. The statistics didn’t really speak to the value that was in this house. Eric knew that once he got people in to see the house, they would definitely see the value at the dollar amount we were asking for.

His negotiation skills definitely showed up when we had an offer on that Saturday night. We basically had it pretty much all signed except for the final signature from the buyer, who waited until Sunday, so the offer was still pending. Just before the open house that Sunday, we had another offer come in. Eric had been speaking with the Realtor of that second offer, letting them know that we did already have another offer on the table. **The second offer came out to be for full listing price.**

Eric and his team went above and beyond just the home sale process. My initial intent was to sell the house and then go on to rent. When I wasn’t finding anything to rent, I asked Eric if he would help me look at a couple properties I could possibly buy. He arranged the showings, and even though one of the properties had a conditional sale on it, we were able to just go in and look through it. That gave me a little more sense of what I wanted to do; as it turned out, I didn’t want to buy in Calgary. I ended up finding a place on Cooper Island. **He went over and beyond what any other Realtor would do.&nbsp;**

Living in the electronic age made this process amazing. I could be on my computer in a coffee shop when an offer came in, and I could just electronically sign in acceptance of the offer or counteroffer. Other Realtors don’t even use the DocuSign system yet. It’s really great for getting work done quickly and efficiently anywhere you are in the world."
