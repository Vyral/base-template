<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are looking to buy a property and use it as an Airbnb, it is important for you to know the new rules which Charleston is going to enforce. So, <strong>w</strong><b>hich new rules are being imposed on short-term vacation rentals?</b></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a great article in The Post and Courier from April 11 about the new rule that's being imposed. Here’s an excerpt:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Four years ago, as short-term rentals were just sprouting up throughout Charleston, one of the city’s only options to enforce its ban on them was to set up online sting operations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A handful of livability officers would pose as visitors on booking platforms, such as Airbnb and HomeAway, to find listings where short-term rentals weren’t allowed.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, short-term rentals got out of hand. Everybody was Airbnb-ing, and there just wasn’t enough manpower to crack down on people using Airbnb illegally in our city. So, the city decided to go ahead and enforce some rules.</span>

<b>The new rule states that full-home rental is not allowed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> except for in certain areas. To rent out a space otherwise, </span><b>you have to inhabit the property while the tenants are there,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> except for the areas of Elliotborough and Cannonborough, where the property also has to be commercially zoned.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are looking to buy a property that has these rules in place, keep in mind there are some taxes that are going to be imposed. </span><b>You also will have to get a city business license and pay accommodation taxes.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of our clients look outside of the City of Charleston to Isle of Palms, Folly Beach, Kiawah Island, and Seabrook Island, which do allow short-term rentals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any further questions about this, you can contact the City of Charleston directly, or you can just contact my team. As always, if you have any further real estate questions, don’t hesitate to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you.</span>
