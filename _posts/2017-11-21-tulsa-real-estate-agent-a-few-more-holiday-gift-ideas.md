I’m back again to highlight another great business here in town. We’re getting into the holiday spirit today at Saks Fifth Avenue. Candra Monck joined me to discuss holiday gift ideas, style advisors, and some fun events they have coming up at the store.

**First, let’s take a look at some great holiday gift ideas, all of which are available in the store:**

• Artis makeup brushes. Not only is this set of brushes gorgeous, they are light and easy to use as well.
• Dyson hairdryer. This is a brand new product from Dyson. They have taken their air circulation and noise-canceling technology to the hairdryer market.
• Chanel skin regeneration set.

If you have somebody on your list that’s a little bit harder to buy for, **Candra recommends giving one of their style advisors a call.** They know the ins and outs of everything that the store carries. Candra even uses these advisors herself.

There are a ton of great events coming up at Saks Fifth Avenue Tulsa. They include visits from national makeup artists, spa days, complimentary makeovers, makeup lessons, and more.

The best way to contact them is through their Facebook page, which they are constantly updating with events, deals, and more.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call at (918) 706-9845 or send me an email at Info@TheWolekGroup.com. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
