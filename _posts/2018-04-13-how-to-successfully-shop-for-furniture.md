Setting out to buy new furniture always starts on a high note, as you’re excited to enhance your living space with stylish and functional pieces that will be part of your home’s environment for years to come.

Then reality sets in.

A multitude of factors combine to make your shopping experience stressful, expensive, and unfulfilling.

However, there is a method to the madness. Here are five important tips that can make shopping for furniture a positive experience all around:

**1. Focus on one room at a time.** If you have multiple rooms to outfit, complete one room at a time. Doing so will not only help you focus on the design of one space, but it will also help you focus on your shopping outings.

**2. Shop online first.** If your shopping trip is taking you to a name-brand retailer, pursue the inventory online first to narrow down the selection. Check out available fabrics, finishes, and measurements before making that visit to the store, and call ahead to see if your selections are in stock so you don’t waste a trip.

**3. Measure access points.** Before you get your heart set on that super-sized sectional or California king bed, make sure there is a way to get it into your house. Don’t just measure the spot where the piece will reside. Measure doorways and stairwells to make sure it will fit around the corner, and find out if the piece can be broken down into separate pieces for delivery.

**4. Find out about assembly.** Be sure that you’re clear on whether or not the furniture item you’re buying requires assembly. Decide if you are ready, willing, and able to take on the task if it does.

**5. Time your buy.** According to NerdWallet, you’ll find the best deals for standard premade furniture right before the spring and fall seasons, when new product lines are introduced. President’s Day, Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, and Labor Day are especially good for sales.

Most importantly, make sure that you slow down. Shopping for furniture is a marathon, not a sprint. Ideally, these should be items that are part of what makes your house a home for years to come. Avoid overpaying and dissatisfaction by taking your time.

I hope these tips will help make your furniture buying experience a little better. If you have any other questions about home maintenance or real estate in general, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
