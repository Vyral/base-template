If you’re getting ready to sell your home, first impressions are huge. You want to make the best possible first impression, and you can do that through great curb appeal. **Here are some great, inexpensive ways to have a huge impact:**

**1\. Clean out mulch and rock beds.** Put some nice annual flowers in there to add a pop of color.

**2\. Cut your grass.** If you’re on a two-week rotation, you might want to bump it down to one week. If people see an unkempt lawn, they might think the inside of the house is similarly untidy.

**3\. Pressure wash the home.** This is another easy way to make your home shine from the curb.

**4\. Pick up stuff in the yard.** You want to declutter your yard just like you’d declutter the inside of your home.

If you have any questions for me about what else you can do to improve your curb appeal or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
