Today I would like to tell you a success story of how a now long-time investor reached the point he’s at today. He has built an incredible portfolio over the last 16 or 17 years, so let’s take a look at how it all started.

Before his life as an investor, he was a sophomore at Boise State. He and the person he lived with had been paying rent month after month for some time when they made the major decision to purchase a home. They thought, **“We are paying all this money anyway. It might as well go toward a house.”**

This was when he reached out to me to advise him on the real estate process. So, I gave him a list of all the things he would need to move forward. After that, he and his buddy scrimped and saved until they had enough money for a down payment. They then bought a small home in West Boise with a plan to rent out a couple of its rooms to offset their monthly payment. They knew they had to make it work somehow. And, in fact, **they did make it work—they made it work very, very well.**

A year or so later, the guy’s buddy got married. So, he quitclaimed his interest in the property over to the person our story centers on today. This gave him sole responsibility of the house, but also gave him another room he needed to rent out. When he was able to find a new tenant, he actually made an important move in what would become the beginning of his investment career.

**He went out and purchased another home where he repeated this process by paying off the mortgage with his tenant’s rental fees.** He wasn’t even out of college yet. He was waiting tables and going to school full time, yet he owned two houses and was earning investment income on both.

Fast forward to today, his success story has only continued. He owns rental properties all over the place and now lives with his wife in a beautiful West Boise home. He was truly able to turn a real estate goal into a reality that exceeded all expectations.

**You can make your own real estate dreams come true, too.** If you have been renting for some time and are thinking of making the transition into homeownership, please reach out to me. I would be happy to help you start your own success story.
