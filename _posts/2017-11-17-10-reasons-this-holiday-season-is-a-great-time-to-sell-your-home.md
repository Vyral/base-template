**Here are the top 10 reasons this holiday season is a great time to sell your home:**

10. Selling now will make you a non-contingent buyer in the spring when there are more houses on the market available for less money. This will allow you to sell high and buy low.

9. You can still restrict showings during the holidays.

8. January is traditionally the month for employees to start new jobs. Since transferees can’t wait until the spring to buy, you need to be on the market in spring and winter to capture those buyers.

7. Some people are looking to buy before the end of the year for tax purposes.

6. Buyers have more time to look during the holidays than they do during the workweek.

5. Buyers are more emotional during the holidays. This makes buyers more likely to pay your price.

4. Houses show much better when they’re decorated for the holidays.

3. Supply will increase in January, which means less demand for your home, and less money for you.

2. Serious buyers have fewer houses to choose from. Less inventory means more money for you on your home sale.

**1. People who look for homes in fall and winter are more serious buyers.**
