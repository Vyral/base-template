One common concern among home sellers today is the fear that their property might not appraise, so today we’ll be discussing what happens when this is the case.&nbsp;

**More often than not, a home sale is contingent on the property appraising.** And given that appraisers are chosen from a random rotation, there is no way for anyone involved in the deal to choose a specific professional for the job. The appraisal process is designed to be performed without bias.&nbsp;

With this in mind, though, there are ways to salvage the deal if your listing doesn’t appraise. **The buyer may agree to pay the difference between the contract price and the appraised value,** for instance, but this will not always be a feasible option. Another option sellers can pursue is to reduce the price to a point that matches the appraised value.

And if all else fails, the sale can be canceled. If you plan to relist the home, though, be mindful that **FHA appraisals stay with the property for six months.** Thankfully, conventional and VA loans don’t have this same effect.&nbsp;

Sometimes, the best option is to take your property off the market for a while to see how conditions shift moving forward.&nbsp;
