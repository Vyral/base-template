Let’s talk about my favorite subject: real estate investment. Anybody can invest in real estate by buying a house. If you already own a home, you can go out and find another house to increase your investment. When you buy a property and continue to grow your equity, you can take that out to buy another property.

Oil prices have kept the market down in our area over the last few years. **Now that those prices are going up, we have started to see investment opportunities decrease**. You’re running out of time, so if you’ve ever thought about having more room for your family, don’t wait. Do it now.

We’ve seen the bottom of the market, and we’ve been coming up for a long time. **The opportunity for you to buy low is closing**. The higher-end market isn’t moving as fast, so there are a ton of deals ready for the right buyer to come along.

Interest rates have been historically low, so you can still take advantage of them before they go up as well. You can buy a home with a lot of equity at a low price.

**Mortgages are made up of two pieces: your principal payment and your interest**. The principal comes out of the price of the home, and the interest rate comes with the loan. As the industry starts growing, your principal will go down, decreasing your buying power.

In two or three years, it will be a seller’s market once again. That’s why today you need to go out, get that home at a great price by having a great agent who can negotiate, lock in a low interest rate, then sell in a few years when the market is better for sellers.

If you have any questions about buying or selling a home in Houston or about the real estate market in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
