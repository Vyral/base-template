Today we want to talk about some of the benefits of using the Burks Team over your traditional real estate brokerage.

To start with, while about 90% of the agents in this industry are part-time, **we are all full-time agents.** In our market, the average agent sells less than 10 homes a year, whereas the agents on our team sell over 40 by working every day. These sales give us current market experience that’s crucial to understanding the ever-changing market.

Another benefit of using the Burks Team is that **all of our agents do weekly training.** On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday mornings we have one-hour training classes to learn new negotiating skills and learn more about contracts and any new laws that come out. This puts us at the forefront of real estate knowledge compared to other offices that don’t have required training, and it allows us to do a better job for our clients.

At the Burks Team, **we also specialize.** We have buyer specialists who only work with buyers to help them find a new home. Meanwhile, you can work with one of our listing agents if you need to sell your home. They will look at market values and what your home may be worth in order to get you a better price. We also have a full-time marketing coordinator, a professional photographer, and three closing coordinators to help us complete your transaction smoothly.

**Another thing that we offer that is unique to the Burks Team is our “Love It or Leave It” guarantee.** We guarantee that you are going to love your home, but if for some reason you don't, you can call us back within 365 days and we will relist it for free if you buy another home of equal or greater value. We will eat both sides of the commission to get you out of that home and into a home that you love.

Our clients Jim and Kelly Newberg recently took advantage of this opportunity when they moved back into the city after spending some time in the country. You can hear their testimony about saving thousands of dollars with this guarantee at 4:15 in the video above.

**Another guarantee we offer is our “Guaranteed Sold or We'll Buy It” guarantee.** If you are looking to list your property with our team, we guarantee to sell your home for the price and deadline we agree to. If for some reason it doesn't sell, we buy it ourselves. For more details about this, give us a call at our office and we can set up an appointment.

When you buy or sell with us, **we consider you a client and friend for life.** With this friendship comes perks such as using our 16-foot box moving van or pickup truck for a 24-hour period anytime you need it as long as it isn't booked by somebody else. You have access to our notaries on staff and we can even help you with copies and faxes as well. All you have to do is come by and we would be happy to help.

As one of our current and/or former clients, you’d also be invited to several client events we throw throughout the year, such as breakfast with Santa where you can bring your kids for pictures with the real Santa Claus or a special viewing of a children's movie where we rent out the entire theater for everyone to enjoy.

The key is that we don't sell homes. We offer expert representation to make sure the process of buying and selling your home goes smoothly.

If you would like to know even more about our expert representation, or if you are ready to buy or sell with us, please feel free to contact us. We look forward to speaking with you soon.
