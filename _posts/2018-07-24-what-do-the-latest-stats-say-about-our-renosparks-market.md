We are halfway through 2018, so today I want to share some midsummer market statistics with you to give you an idea of where things stand. In June there were 587 total home sales, and the median home price was $385,000, which is up 15% year-over-year. We currently have about 1.5 months’ worth of inventory, which is pretty tight, but that number should increase as the year goes on.

This means if you are a seller, you do not have much competition at the moment. If you are a buyer, the situation is the opposite—you need to be purchase ready because you do have a lot of competition. To hear my full market update, watch this short video.
