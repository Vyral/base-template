People always want to know when they should list their house. Some say the best time to do so is the spring, some say the fall, and others recommend the summer. What’s the truth?

I don’t think there’s a wrong time to sell a house, but I will say certain periods are more or less active than others. Generally, spring and summer are when the market is most active; fall and winter are a bit slower.

The difference is that **in the fall and winter, there aren’t as many buyers out in the market, but there also aren’t as many homes on the market.** In the spring and summer, there are plenty of homes on the market as well as buyers, so in the end, it works itself out.

If you want to have your home on the market when most buyers will be looking, home sales seem to peak each year between April and June. Many people think that they should wait until their kids are out of school to list their homes, but by doing that, **you could miss some of the prime buyers that are in the market before then.** If the majority of buyers are closing in June, that means the majority are going under contract in March and April.

If you’re on the fence about listing your home, now’s the time to do it. Don’t hesitate to reach out to me with any questions you may have.
