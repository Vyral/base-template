<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Happy holidays from all of us at Healthy Realty!</em></p>

Merry Christmas and happy holidays\! I’m out here at the James Island County Park Holiday Festival of Lights, it is a wonderful place to come and savor a little Christmas spirit with your family.

There are so many joyful things to do around Charleston this season. I hope you go out and have a chance to get into the holiday spirit. Remember, we’re always here if you need any help with real estate. Happy holidays to you and your family\!
