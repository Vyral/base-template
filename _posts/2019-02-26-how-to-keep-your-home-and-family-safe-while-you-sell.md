Just because you have your house on the market, **that doesn’t mean you need to open your home to anyone and everyone who asks to come inside.&nbsp;**Don’t let the home selling process come in the way of your common sense.

Home security is of the utmost importance as you prepare to sell. While your property is on the market, there are certain additional steps you’ll need to follow to keep yourself, your family, and your home safe.

**When someone wants to schedule a showing, for example, don’t volunteer more information than necessary about your personal life.** Also, always be sure to check after showings that the agent signed in. If they haven’t, they may be running behind and yet to show up. This is just one reason why communication between agents, and between agents and their clients, is so critical.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information about staying safe while selling, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
