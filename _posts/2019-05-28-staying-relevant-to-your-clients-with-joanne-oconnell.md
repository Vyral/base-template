Today I’m joined by Joanne O’Connell, one of our top associates, to talk about staying relevant to your clients.

Joanne has lived in Park City for 20 years and has worked in the real estate business for the last 15. Prior to joining KW, she worked out of Glenwilde. Everyone wants to build a referral-based business, and 100% of Joanne’s business comes from repeat clients and referrals.&nbsp;

What does she do to stay in touch with her clients?

“I think what’s so important to me is my clients, and becoming personal friends with them, taking care of them, always being there for them—even after the closing,” she says. “I think that’s why I get so many referrals.”

In other words, **she focuses on providing her clients information that will help them and keep Park City in the forefront of their minds,** and her main tactic in doing so is offering them something of value (market knowledge, stats, etc.). That makes them want to receive emails from her.

Having KW’s systems in place has given her more time to focus on this aspect of the business. She used to have to spend a lot of her time coming up with unique ways to market items of value she thought her clients would find interesting, but KW is such a great resource for doing exactly that.&nbsp;

“Somebody else who’s really good at creating marketing material can take my ideas and run with it, and I can be working with my clients one on one, and that way I feel like all my clients are getting some attention each month, but I don’t have to individually contact each one of them.”

**Joanne has been with KW for 11 years now, and she joined because she knew they’d help her create and market *her* brand.**&nbsp;
