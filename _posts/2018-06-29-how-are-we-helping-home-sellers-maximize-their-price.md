Today I wanted to talk about a problem that we’ve been seeing in the market recently. The problem is that there are a lot of homeowners who would like to sell their home for top dollar, but they don’t have the funds to make the necessary repairs that will get their home top dollar. **These improvements range from new carpet and new paint to new landscaping and remodeled bathrooms and kitchens.**

Making any of these improvements can dramatically increase the amount of money a home seller will walk away with when their sale closes. **When they don’t have the necessary funds, it leaves them in a tough position.**

We have created a program that invests the funds for sellers upfront so that they can take the advantage of that increased value. We arrange for licensed, professional contractors to do the work, and you won't have to pay us back until you’ve sold the home and netted the increased profits. The best part? We don’t charge anything for this service. **The loan is completely interest-free.**

**This program isn’t required to use when you list your home with us, but we just want to make sure that you have every opportunity possible to maximize your home’s final sale price.**

If you’re thinking of selling your home and are curious about the projects that you should or shouldn’t consider before listing it on the market, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
