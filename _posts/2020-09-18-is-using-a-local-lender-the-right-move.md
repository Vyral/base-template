<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s why I think that every homebuyer should work with a local lender.</em></p>

Interest rates are very low right now and more people are thinking about buying or refinancing their current mortgages. However, there are some issues you can run into when working with certain lenders.

**The best advice I can give you is to work with a local lender.** They are always going to serve you better. At national banks, the employees work for the bank. When you work with a local broker, they can go out, get your information, shop it out to find the best lending product, and get you the best deal possible. The local lender is going to have your best interest at heart instead of their own. The important thing is to sit down with this lender, hash out your goals, and come up with a plan.

**Every monday, I do a radio show with a local lender and we talk about stuff like this and more.** If you haven’t, listen to it every Monday at 1 p.m. on KENI talk radio. You can also find the episodes on demand right here on my website. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve talked to who wished they had started listening to the show before they started the home buying process. We’re getting ready to do a series on investment properties that you’ll want to tune in for.

If you have any other questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
