Today, I want to talk about an exciting program we have that might have already heard of.

Last year, we gave away an exciting vacation to a couple. All they did was call us and tell us about a friend of theirs that wanted to buy or sell a house. Their names went into a drawing and t**hey won the free vacation—just by mentioning our name.**

I’m here to tell you that I’m so excited about this program that we’re going to do this twice a year—once in the summer and once at the end of the year.

All you have to do is **give us the name and number of someone you know who is looking to buy or sell a home** in the Midlands of South Carolina. After that, your name will go in the hopper every time you call.

<br>If you have any questions about this program or about buying or selling real estate, feel free to reach out to us. Here’s hoping that you win our next drawing!
