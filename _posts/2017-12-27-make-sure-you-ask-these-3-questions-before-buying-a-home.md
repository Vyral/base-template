Recently, someone asked me, “What questions should I be asking before purchasing a home?”

I believe there are three main questions that you should focus on.

**1. What is the offering price based on?** Make sure that your Realtor has a good idea of the market and that they have run the correct comps. That way, you are making your offer price based on what other homes in the neighborhood have sold for and current market conditions.

**2. Ask about the home’s condition.** If the home has been renovated, what are renovated homes selling for in the area? If the home has not been renovated, does the price reflect that? Also, I recommend getting an idea of what it would cost to renovate the home yourself. Talk to a professional to see what those costs would be.

**3. Ask about the location of the home.** Are you on the waterfront? Do you have a city view, a western view, or are you looking right into your neighbor’s house? Is the house closer to schools and parks? The placement of the house in a building or town can have a huge impact on the home’s value. Is the property a three-floor walkup? Is it a single-family home on a corner lot?

There are a lot of key factors that go into buying a home and writing the best offer. It’s important that you have a Realtor on your side who knows the market and its intricacies to help you make the best decisions moving forward.

If you have any other questions about buying a home or about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
