Are you feeling the shift? Is there a market slowdown in your market like there is here in Tulsa?

I knew it was time to dust off “Shift: How Top Real Estate Agents Tackle Tough Times” by Gary Keller, the book that always helps us when we need to reset and re-adjust our thinking and our mindset. No matter if you are in an up or down market, this is always an awesome book for real estate skills.

The reason we’re noticing a shift here in Tulsa, and maybe you are seeing it as well, is that inventory is slowing down. **We aren't selling homes as fast and the ones that we think will sell quickly end up sitting.**

So whether this is a seasonal cycle that we experience every single year or a bigger shift in our market, only time will tell. However, we do have control over how we think about it, how we handle it, and how we talk with our clients about it.

Our clients need us now more than ever, especially in a market like ours where the average sales price is $185,000. If they have a home that’s anywhere from $200,000 to $400,000, the inventory in that price range is getting stale with beautiful homes in wonderful condition just sitting on the market.

Now more than ever, we need to get really good at explaining window of opportunity and what it means for our sellers. We also have to explain to them the mindset of buyers.

So, go into your book and look at tactic No. 7, which is pricing ahead of the market. **Reread this tactic and familiarize yourself with the mindset and what's going on during this time.** This is when you should be having conversations with your sellers at listing appointments and sharing the importance of pricing correctly from the beginning.

I know you are already doing this, but now you need to read this chapter because it is going to give you some really good ideas and reminders of how important it is at the beginning. You can never get back that window of opportunity. Buyers will move on to the next home and you don't want to chase the market down; you want to price ahead of the market. Get familiar with this language so that it flows and you project the confidence that I know you have.

Buyers are going to need you more than ever and this is when you are really going to get to shine as an expert. Pricing is so important. Now more than ever, you can't just price a home and see what happens because although we know that is what they want, it is not setting them up for success, which is our job.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
