What are the five main steps of the home buying process?

The first and most crucial step, of course, is deciding that you want to buy a home in the first place.

Second, **hire a professional agent such as myself** who will educate you on market conditions, analyze what your housing needs are for you and your family, guide you to the appropriate price point, and help you through negotiations.

Third, get pre-approved. During the pre-approval process, you want to find the right lender who will look out for your best interests.

The fourth step is to **find the right home and make an offer.** During this time, your agent will negotiate the terms of your offer and gather up all of your forms—such as your tax returns, W-2s, forms of identification—and give them to your lender. This will help secure your financing. Your agent will also negotiate certain repairs you might find during the home inspection.

The fifth and final step is closing on the home. This is when you’ll head over to the title company and finish all necessary paperwork. Congratulations, you’re a homeowner!
