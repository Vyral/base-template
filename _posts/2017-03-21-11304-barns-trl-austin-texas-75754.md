Located in East Austin this property is on the park side of the Harris Branch subdivision.

It's a beautifully kept two-story home with a huge family room that includes a fireplace. You'll also find an open floor plan and high ceilings.

**This four-bed, three-bath home is only about 15 minutes from downtown Austin and will have an awesome list price of around $250,000.**
