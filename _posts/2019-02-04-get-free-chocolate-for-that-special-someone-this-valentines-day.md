A lot of people have been asking what the market was like this January, so now that the month is over, I’ll give you a quick update on how we did.<br><br>We finished out January with 18% fewer home sales than we did in January 2018. Our team was shocked to hear that, given that our team’s activity was up 90%.<br><br>Our days on market stayed consistent; homes sold just as fast this year as they did last year at this time, which took an average of seven days to sell.<br><br>Overall, the market has been behaving a bit differently than our team’s activity would suggest.

{% include pullquote.html %}<br><br>If you have any questions about the market or would like more specific figures for your area, feel free to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help you.
