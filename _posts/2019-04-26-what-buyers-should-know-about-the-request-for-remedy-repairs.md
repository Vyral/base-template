Hello everyone and welcome back to “Facebook Fridays\!”&nbsp;

Today’s focus is on homebuyers’ requests for remedy repairs, and I’ll be answering a few pressing questions from Bree on the topic.&nbsp;

<br>***Q. What types of questions should a buyer ask their agent when requesting remedy repairs?&nbsp;***

A. When requesting remedy repairs, the first thing a buyer should aim to address are matters of health and safety. What constitutes health and safety issues? Say, for example, you had a radon inspection performed on the home and the levels exceeded those set by state regulations. In this instance, it’d be perfectly acceptable for you to request that the seller remedy the issue.&nbsp;

Another example might be if the roof is leaking in the attic—an issue that wasn’t detectable during your initial walk-through. At the point that you become aware of it, though, you’re justified in requesting a remedy repair. Now, if the issue does catch your attention during the walk-through, be sure to include a request for repair in your offer to purchase up front.&nbsp;

As a buyer, issues such as these should be at the top of your list when it comes to the request for remedy repairs. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

<br>***Q. &nbsp; Is it up to me, the buyer, to know all of this or should I rely on an agent who has experience and savviness in negotiating the request for remedy repairs?&nbsp;***

A. Given that the remedy request and purchasing a home is a business transaction, having an agent who can expertly represent you is very important. An experienced agent can help temper some of the emotions that both a buyer and a seller might feel during the process. In sitting down with both parties and speaking in plain terms about what needs to accomplished per the inspector, an agent who’s been in several of these situations can move the process forward and closer to closing.&nbsp;
