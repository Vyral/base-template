If you’re looking to buy an investment property, it’s best not to use cash for your purchase. Here’s why.

When I invest or help clients invest, I’m looking to increase the cash-on-cash return on investment and also reduce risk. **The best way to do this is to use bank leverage or financing.**

Let’s say you and I each have $100,000 and decide to buy rental properties worth that amount. You buy one for $100,000 in cash, and I buy four with $25,000 down payments on each. Now let’s say that in 15 years, the value of each property doubles. **Your property is now worth $200,000, but my four are worth $800,000.** Your profit is $100,000 and mine is $400,000. You’ve put all your money (and risk) into one property, but my risk is spread out over four.

Even though we each began with the same amount of money, **I just made four times more than you and mitigated my risk at the same time.**

If you’re looking to invest and have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.
