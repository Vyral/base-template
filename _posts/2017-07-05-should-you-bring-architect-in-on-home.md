Can you bring an architect or engineer with you to a home inspection? When should you do that?

Lately, a lot of homebuyers have asked me, “Can I bring an architect or engineer with me on a home inspection? Should I make the house purchase subject to an architectural review or have an engineer look at it?”

**If you really want to talk to an engineer or architect,** the only way you can ask is to write it into the contract. Make the offer subject to an architect or engineer reviewing the home plans. Your agent will help you with the exact language.

You don’t always need an engineer to look at a home before you buy it. If you are buying a house and you want to blow out the walls and open up the floor plan, then it would be a good idea to have an architect or engineer check the property. They will let you know which walls are load-bearing, and **then you can make an educated buying decision.**

 The worst thing you can do is buy a house, blow out the wrong wall, and have the house implode on you.

 If you have any other questions about buying a home or the home inspection process, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
