<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We are thankful to every one of you, and today I wanted to say it outright.</em></p>

Thanksgiving is almost here, and 2020 has been a wild year. Both of my kids came home from college for spring break, thought they’d have to stay home for a week or two, but they’re still here. There’s no playbook for how things should go during a pandemic, but **there are some silver linings.** I get this bonus time with my kids that I didn’t expect, so as a family we’ve been enjoying cooking, watching TV, and spending quality time together.

I know all of you are going through similar things, whether it’s home schooling, working from home, or just trying to make sense of this unusual year. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you all for your faith and trust in me. To everyone who chose to buy or sell a home with us this year and anyone who referred us to their friends and family, we’re very appreciative. You are why we do what we do, and now more than ever, it’s about people.&nbsp;

Enjoy the holiday as safely as you can; **have a great Thanksgiving\!**
