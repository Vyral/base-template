Radon gas can be very harmful. Here’s how to make sure the levels in your home are acceptable.

Over 50% of the houses we sell have radon gas inspections done. Eric Clark from Lifetime Radon Solutions is here with us to talk a little bit about radon gas, what it is, and how you can treat it if the levels of radon in your home get too high.

Radon is an invisible, odorless, colorless gas. We know it’s there, but we don’t know it’s there. It’s a naturally occurring radioactive gas that comes from uranium in the soil and is concentrated in the home. **The midwest is notorious for high levels of radon. Wisconsin is right up there.**

Radon can’t be seen or smelled, but it can be measured and it can have consequences. Behind smoking, radon gas is the 2nd leading cause of lung cancer in the U.S. Every house has radon, it’s just a matter of how much. **The EPA recommends action for any radon levels above 4 pCi/L.**

Lifestyle Radon Solutions offers radon mitigation systems and they can install them in a number of ways. They draw the radon gas out from the home by creating a negative pressure that gets the gas out before it even enters the home. They guarantee that your radon levels will be below 4 pCi/L with one of their systems.The price range for one of these systems is anywhere from $845 to $1305.

So **even if you have high radon levels in your home, it is fixable.** If you have any questions for Eric about Lifestyle Radon Solutions and any of the services or products they offer, give him a call at (262)-955-7701. If you have any other real estate questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us anytime. We look forward to hearing from you.
