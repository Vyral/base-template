<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This is how you can tap into the equity of your investment property.</em></p>

If you have an investment property whose equity you want to tap into, there are several ways to do so. The first is by using traditional financing, where you show your taxes, look at your Schedule E form, and see how much money the property is generating versus how much you’re making. Based on that, you either qualify or don’t.

**In short, your other options don’t automatically mean using a hard money loan.** There are equity-based programs where we look at the income being produced by the property so it becomes a stand-alone entity. We look at your credit and the income being produced by the property to see whether you qualify for refinancing or cashing out. Right now, we’re going all the way up to 70% loan-to-value on these programs.

If you want to talk more about your options as an investor, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d love to speak with you.
