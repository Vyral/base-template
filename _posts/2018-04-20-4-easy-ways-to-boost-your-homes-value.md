Selling your home can be one of the most stressful times in your life. However, there’s no need to worry—today we’re going to go over four simple and effective tactics to add value for your home sale.&nbsp;

1. **Improve your outdoor environment.** A great outdoor space can make or break a sale. Consider updating your landscaping, mowing your lawn, and building a nice outdoor seating area. For a larger project, build a deck. For simpler projects, update your existing features. It’s all about creating emotion as your potential buyers pull up. You want to create a fantastic vision of warmth without breaking the bank.
2. **Remodel your kitchen.** Sounds scary, right? It shouldn’t be. It should be high on your priority list; updating your kitchen is highly recommended to improve the value of your home. Just don’t go overboard on your budget. Remodeling a kitchen should be a cosmetic, low-dollar rehab, as you won’t recoup investment on anything larger. Repainting the walls and old cabinets, as well as updating the backsplash and installing new energy-efficient appliances are simple updates you can do before selling.<br>{% include pullquote.html %}
3. **Ordinary updates.** Many homeowners look right past this, but there are a few easy fixes you can make, such as replacing rotting wood, repairing roof leaks, and repainting inside and out.
4. **Prioritize energy efficiency.** More and more homebuyers are looking for energy efficiency in their homes. Consider making updates to your home that lower energy costs. This can include installing insulation, purchasing replacement windows, or buying Energy Star appliances. These features are not only appealing to prospective buyers, but they can also lower your energy bills while you’re still living in your home. Jump on the sustainability train and make a few updates today.
