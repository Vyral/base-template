What vital role does title insurance play for Utah homeowners? To answer this question, and a number of others, I’m joined by special guest Kyle Cain of Old Republic Title.

**What are the most important things to look for when reviewing a title commitment?**

According to Kyle, there are three major components that must be kept in mind during this review process. The first component is the “Schedule A” section, which will show who owns the property, as well as who the buyers and lenders are.

The next component that must be reviewed is the requirements. In order for a policy to be issued for a transaction, certain stipulations must be met.

And last, but certainly not least, there is the matter of the “exceptions” section. This portion of the title commitment is perhaps most important of all during the review process, as it will list all items that are to be excluded from the policy.

**What should people understand about liens?**

There are many different types of liens, and some are more common than others. A mortgage lien, for example, is one of the most prevalent kinds. But regardless of what type of lien a property has against it, it must be resolved before a policy can be issued.

**What kinds of vesting are out there?**

“There are two major types of vesting,” said Kyle. “Tenancy in common and joint tenancy.”

But what is the difference between these two types? Well in joint tenancy, the title would be passed onto the surviving owner in the event that the other perishes. With tenants in common, the disbursement of interest will have to go through the court system if one tenant passes.

Should buyers consider putting property into a trust?

Whether it’s a financial strategy or done as a step in estate planning, Kyle says that pursuing this is often a good idea.

**What types of policies exist for title insurance?**

First, there’s the lender’s policy. This policy provides protection for the financial institution or the lender. In Utah transactions, this is usually paid for by the buyer. While the owner’s policy, however, is typically paid for by the seller. Essentially, obtaining a policy with a title company means obtaining access to their legal team.
