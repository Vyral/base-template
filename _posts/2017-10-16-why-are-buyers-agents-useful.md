  Why do you need an agent on your side as a buyer? For one, it puts you on even
  ground with the seller, who probably already has an agent.

What is the difference between a buyer’s agent and a seller’s agent? It’s a question I get a lot, but the answer is quite simple. If you see a sign in a yard with an agent’s phone number on it, that is the seller’s, or listing, agent. **They are hired by the seller and act with their best interests in mind.**

This is great if you’re a seller. However, if you’re looking to buy a home, you need someone on your side as well. **That’s where a buyer's agent comes in.**Some of their duties include:

* Showing you all the homes you want to see
* Running comps to help strengthen your offer
* Helping you write a strong offer

These are far from the only things a buyer’s agent does, but they are some of the most important. The best part about hiring one is that it’s completely free. That’s right. In the transaction, the seller is contracted to pay all of the real estate commissions, including those to the buyer’s agent. It doesn’t make sense to not hire one.

If you have any questions about buyer’s agents or anything else about real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
