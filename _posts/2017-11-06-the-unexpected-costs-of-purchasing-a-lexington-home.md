There are a few costs you might not have thought of when you started the home buying process.

One cost that is often overlooked is the home inspection. Home inspection fees run around $300 to $400, depending on the size of the home. **This is the homebuyer’s expense, not the seller’s.**

Of course, you should also factor in cash for your down payment, as well as property taxes. Sometimes people forget about property taxes. They may not be crazy expensive, but it can seem like a lot of money if you’re not prepared for those costs.

You will also have to pay a moving company. We work with an awesome outfit that will come in and do everything right for a reasonable fee. If you’re staying in Lexington, it won’t be too expensive to hire movers, but that cost will go up if you are moving out of state.

Regardless, it’s important that you hire the right mover. Hire someone who will handle your items with care and get them safely to your new house.

Finally, don’t forget about the cost of changing the locks on your home or switching over utilities. Again, these costs may not be very much on their own, **but all of these little things can add up.**
