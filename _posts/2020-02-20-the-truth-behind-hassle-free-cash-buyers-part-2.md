<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Some cash homebuyers make their money by preying on desperate sellers. Here’s how they do it and how you can avoid it.</em></p>


In our last video, we talked about [hassle-free cash buyers](https://daveknightsells.com/what-do-you-do-about-hassle-free-cash-offers.html){: target="_blank"} and the role they play in our market. We’re continuing that discussion today by focusing on **a common scenario that we’ve been seeing with these investors.**

What happens is that an investor will send out a bunch of letters using tax records and extend a hassle-free cash offer to a homeowner. When a homeowner reaches out to one of these investors, it’s usually out of desperation.&nbsp;

Although their initial offer may appear pretty close to market value, after the inspection they’ll come back and say there is $100,000 worth of work or more and reduce their offer by that amount.

Here’s the problem: **At that time, the buyer is in control.** They’ve wasted your time, your home has been off the market, and you’re even more desperate to sell the home. Whether the report is accurate or not, you have to disclose it to anyone you work with in the future. Not only are you in a pinch financially, but you have an additional burden of responsibility. In many cases, sellers decide the hassle isn’t worth it and just decide to sell for that low price.&nbsp;
