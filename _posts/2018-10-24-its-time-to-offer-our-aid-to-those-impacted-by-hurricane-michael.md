In the wake of Hurricane Michael, Mexico Beach is in a state of ruin. Buildings were torn asunder, trees were snapped under the force of the storm, and debris was scattered in thick swaths across the coastline. As harrowing as this scene may be, the mere sight of it cannot begin to truly illustrate the full experience of those affected. Yet hope is not lost. The more willing we are to offer our help to those in need, the more quickly our affected communities can recover. Your donation could make all the difference in the lives of those affected.
