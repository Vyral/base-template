Today we’re going to answer the question, “How do you price a home?” Each agent has different methods, but here’s what we do.

Online evaluation sites like Zillow and Trulia are a good place to start, but we won’t really get into it until we can see your home in person.&nbsp;**We’ll walk through the home and assess its condition, location, and overall value.**

We know what buyers are looking for in the marketplace and what they are going to pay for in terms of style, conditions, and upgrades. We will compare your home to the recent pending sales on the market, as well as the active properties on the market to get the best possible idea of its home value.

A lot goes into it. **It's a lot of head and a lot of heart, which is what we’ll bring to you every time.** If you have any questions for us in the meantime or need help determining your home’s market value, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
