Today, we're thrilled to take you on a special journey behind the scenes of our recent venture â€“ the construction and grand opening of our brand-new Larkin Group Headquarters at Legacy Corner. If you're a resident of St. George, you're probably no stranger to Cameo Florist, a beloved establishment that's been part of the community for years. Whether it was a bouquet for a special occasion, a heartfelt thank-you gift, or an "I'm sorry" bouquet, Cameo Florist has touched many hearts.

For those who have been in St. George even longer, you might have fond memories of attending weddings in this very space. Perhaps it was your own wedding that graced these halls? As you can see, this location holds a special place in our hearts.

**The journey from purchasing the building to bringing our vision to life was an 18-month labor of love.** From concept to completion, every step was carefully considered to create a space that truly reflects our commitment to excellence and service.

Now, as we proudly open the doors to our new headquarters, we want to express our deep gratitude to this wonderful community. We invite each of you to come and experience this remarkable space for yourself. **We can't wait to show you around and share our excitement for the future.**

Stay tuned for more updates, events, and news as we embark on this new chapter. Thank you for being part of our journey, and we hope to see you soon at Legacy Corner!
