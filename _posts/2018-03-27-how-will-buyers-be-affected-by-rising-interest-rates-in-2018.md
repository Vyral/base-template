  I’ve been getting a lot of questions lately about what interest rates will do
  in 2018, so today I’ll give you my thoughts on this topic. Right now, rates
  are sitting at roughly 4.5%, which is historically very low. Throughout the
  first quarter, though, we’ve seen them rise, and they’re expected to reach 5%
  by the end of the year. If you’re a buyer in our market, this means waiting to
  buy could cost you more. To find out why, watch my latest video.

How will interest rates affect our market for the rest of 2018?

Historically, rates have hovered right around 8%, and right now they’re at a 4.5%, which is fantastic. During the first quarter of 2018, though, we’ve seen them rise a little bit. Just before December, they were at the 4% mark, and they’re projected to rise to 5% by the end of the year.

What does this mean for buyers? Right now, the median price for a single-family home in Salt Lake County is about $325,000. At a 4.5% interest rate, that equates to roughly a $1,647 monthly mortgage payment. If and when rates rise to 5%, that same payment will increase to $1,744. That’s paying almost $100 more a month if you wait until the end of the year to buy.

Let me put it another way. Let’s say that right now you’re qualified for a $325,000 home based on your debt-to-income ratio and your credit. Back in July 2017, you would’ve qualified for a $345,000 home. By the end of the year, though, you’ll only be able to qualify for a $307,000 home.

**Based on these projections, you can see why now is the time to buy.**

If you’re in the market to buy a new construction home, you’re looking at a completion date near the end of the year, so think about everything we just went over and ask yourself how comfortable you’ll be with those payments. Even if you get approved right now at a 4.5% rate, chances are it’ll be close to 5% by the time you close on your new construction home. Be prepared for that so when you move into the house, you know what you’re getting into and you’re not stressed about the mortgage payment

If you have any further questions about interest rates and where they’re headed in 2018 or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
