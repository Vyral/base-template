Here’s how to work more efficiently without multitasking.

I gave an hour-long speech recently about why multitasking is a lie and how you can work twice as efficiently as you already are. Today I want to share the most important parts with you. Here are four reasons why multitasking is a lie:

**1\. What you’re actually asking your brain to do is switch tasking.** Studies have shown that when you are doing multiple things at once, you’re not doing any one thing efficiently. You might do them all well, but you’re taking a lot more time to do them than if you didn’t ask your brain to switch tasks in the first place.&nbsp;

Here’s a good example: Put a timer on, then say your ABC’s, then count to 26. You’ll probably do it incredibly quickly. Now time yourself while doing them both at the same time (e.g., A1, B2, C3, D4…) It’s going to take you a lot longer to do that. About three to four times longer.&nbsp;

**2\. Time and activity management.** They’ve found that people are three to four times more efficient when they set up their day to focus on one task at a time.

**3\. Time blocking.** If you can time block your day so that you have specific times set for specific tasks, you’ll operate twice as efficiently.

**4\. Activity chunking.** When you time block activities and chunk together similar activities into full mornings and full afternoons, your day will be a lot more efficient. Structure your whole week like this, and you’ll be surprised at how efficiently you operate.

If you have any questions about this or want to learn more, I’d love to share my full powerpoint presentation on this topic with you. Just reach out via phone or email today and I’ll get it sent over.
