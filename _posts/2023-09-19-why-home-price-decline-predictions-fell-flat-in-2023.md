No matter where you get your news, you've likely heard someone predict a decline in home prices this year. Negative news tends to spread quickly. However, the reality is that prices did not crash. I can back this up with data. But don't just take my word for it.

Let's examine the facts. **Even experts admit they made incorrect forecasts.** The chart below illustrates seven expert organizations' 2023 year-end home price forecasts. It includes both their initial 2023 predictions from late last year and the most recent revisions, available here. When I analyze it, I notice that all their initial forecasts predicted price drops, represented in red.

However, that's because none of them anticipate price declines anymore. They all predict that by year-end, prices will remain stable or show positive growth. This is a significant change, **indicating that prices were more resilient than originally expected.**

This is great news for homeowners. In Louisville and southern Indiana, the results are mixed. Many areas meet or even exceed national projections. However, some lag slightly due to location. I can help you stay ahead of the next wave of negative headlines, which is inevitable. Let's dispel the fear before it takes hold.
