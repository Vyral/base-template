As a broker associate with Keller Williams here on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, I’d like to talk to you a little bit about the 203(k) loan.

What is a 203(k) loan? This type of loan is a renovation loan that **works in tandem with your regular lending and allows you to make renovations to the house during the purchase.**

Under the terms of the loan, you have about six months to make those renovations, and you’ll be required to use an approved contractor. It’s a little bit of extra paperwork, but it’s definitely worth doing.

There are two versions of the 203(k) loan: a full version and a streamlined version.

If you go into a house and you love everything about it except that maybe the kitchen is just not right, ask your agent about a 203(k) loan. You can have the entire kitchen renovated to be just the way you want it so that you can own the perfect house.
