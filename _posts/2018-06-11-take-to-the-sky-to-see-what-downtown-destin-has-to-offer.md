Today I want to share with you a quick aerial tour of the downtown Destin area. This video will include views of Destin Harbor, Holiday Isle, Big Kahuna’s, and the various shopping centers around the downtown area. What’s unique about our coastline is every little section has its own special spot, which makes it a great place for families. To see what I mean, watch this video.
