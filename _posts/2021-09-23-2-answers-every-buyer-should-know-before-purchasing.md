If you’re thinking about selling your home in 2021, these are the two questions you must know the answers to:

**1\. Where are you going?** Even though we’re into the fall season, this market has continued to stay red-hot in most price ranges and areas. Appropriately-priced houses are still selling very quickly. This is one of the first questions we ask potential sellers. Whether you already have a home, plan on moving into a rental, or moving in with family, you need to have a plan.

**2\. What does the market look like in your area and price range?** Some areas and price ranges are hotter than others. There is more competition in certain market segments as well. Based on what you’re looking for, dig deep on that.

If you have any questions for me about selling a home or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
