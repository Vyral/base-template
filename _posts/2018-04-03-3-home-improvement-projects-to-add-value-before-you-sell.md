There are a lot of things you can do to your home that won’t bring a high return. These include things like backyard patios, upgraded hardwood floors, pools, and more. By all means, spend money on these features for your own personal enjoyment, but just don’t expect to see a big return.

Today I want to tell you the three areas of home improvement that bring the most bang for your buck when it comes time to sell.

**1. Update your kitchen and bathrooms.** Updating both or either of these rooms will bring you high returns. Still, it’s good to pay attention to current trends to maximize this investment. Right now, for example, navy blue cabinets, stainless steel appliances, and white quartz cabinets are all in. I recommend looking at interior design magazines to get ideas. But, be careful to make sure that the rooms still look cohesive with the rest of the home.

**2. Add square footage through finishing unfinished spaces.** If you can, finishing basements or attics can add a lot of value to your home sale. However, make sure all proper permits are pulled before taking any of these projects on. Also, stick to finishes that match the quality found throughout the rest of the home. <br><br>**3. Consider a new roof and HVAC units.** If either of these features is old, replacing them can bring a lot of value to your property when it comes time to list. These are both things an appraiser will definitely give value to.
