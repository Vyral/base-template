Today we’re coming to you from one of our listings to demonstrate some of the safety precautions we’re taking as a team. For example, all of our agents will be carrying with them disinfecting wipes that will be used to turn on light switches and lamps and open doors. I’m also meeting with prospective sellers via Zoom; we can see updates they’ve made to the home and send back a list of comparables. Our processes in the real estate business have changed, but we’re still getting the job done. At 2:38 in the video above, you’ll also get a look behind the scenes of my appearance on “My Southern Home.”&nbsp;

As always, if you have any real estate-related questions for us or you’re interested in buying or selling a home but are overwhelmed given the global events, please reach out. We’re here to be calm professionals in uncertain times; we have what it takes to meet your needs.
