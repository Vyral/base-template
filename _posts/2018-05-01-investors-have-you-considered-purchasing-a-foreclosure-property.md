Before I venture into today’s topic, I’d like to first discuss the recent storm here on Kauai. While most of the island goes unaffected, certain low-lying areas were greatly impacted by this historic natural disaster. That said, there is a silver lining.

The people of Kauai are incredibly strong and there has been an incredible response from those who have given their time, energy, and monetary donations toward relief efforts. Seeing the island come together like this truly demonstrates the aloha spirit.

With all of that being said, I’d like to move on to today’s subject: foreclosure properties. **Investors are always searching for opportunities, and many of these opportunities come in the form of distress properties.**

The dominant type of distress property in our market today is bank-owned properties. It may be hard to believe, but some of the properties I see coming to auction at the courthouse steps have been in foreclosure for nearly 10 years. These properties represent some of the best investment opportunities for those with the skills and resources to handle them.

**However, it’s important to note buying a bank-owned property is a different kind of transaction than a typical real estate purchase.** The bank offers no guarantees or warranties. Another way this kind of purchase differs from typical transactions is that while the properties are sometimes placed on the MLS, they are also often sold through the courthouse or through an online auction.

When it comes to courthouse auctions, a professional such as myself may bid on your behalf. The process can seem somewhat complex at first, so allow me to give a basic explanation of what you can expect.

Before bidding can begin, the commissioner will ask all bidders to verify that they possess a cashier's check.

**While there is not typically a minimum bid, the bank will often put forward a “reserve price”** bid to ensure that the baseline is set at either the remaining loan balance or the market value. The lower figure between these two will usually be the one the foreclosing bank will bid. After this point, the auction will proceed as normal. If you win, know that 10% of the sales price will be owed immediately.

Once the sale has been confirmed, you will open escrow. You’ll then have 30 days to consummate the sale. If everything is on track, you will, at last, be issued a fully insured title deed called a “commissioner's deed.”

Of course, I would be happy to further explain this process. So if you have any other questions, would like more information, or are interested in purchasing a foreclosure property, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
