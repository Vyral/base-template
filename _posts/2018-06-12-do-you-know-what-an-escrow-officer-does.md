{% include youtube.html %}Randi Bennett, an escrow officer at First Centennial Title Company, is here today to explain what she does for you to help you close on your new home.<br>&nbsp;<br>As an escrow officer, she handles every small, final detail of a transaction. After all the inspections are complete and the appraisal is occurring, Randi is reviewing the information about the title to the property. **She ensures that there are no liens or encumbrances on the property** and makes sure ownership can transfer clearly when it is time for the final signing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Once all requirements have been met, **Randi ensures that all funds are in and everything is accounted for.** She then records all the documentation at the Recorder’s office and it is legally sold or purchased.

{% include pullquote.html %}It is a very private job since she deals with all of your personal information. Rest assured, however, that Randi promises that they keep all of it as safe as possible. She does not represent one side over another, but is instead an entirely indifferent third party.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you have any additional questions about escrow, you can contact Randi by phone at (775) 689-8510 or email at randib@firstcentennial.com.<br>&nbsp;<br>As always, if you are interested in talking to the Gabrielli Homes Team about buying or selling, you can contact us by phone or email. We look forward to speaking with you soon.
