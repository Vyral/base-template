How do you select a home for an open house that will attract a lot of potential clients and make you money? Here are the key tips you need to remember.

First, **pick a home that’s very accessible**, not tucked away in a cul-de-sac in the very back of the neighborhood.

Second, **choose a home that’s visible**. If you can get a home on a corner or one next to a major highway or thoroughfare, that’s all the better. If people can see the home and see that it’s easy to get to it, they’re more likely to come.

Lastly, and most importantly, **try to choose a home that’s in your geofarm**. If there’s a neighborhood you’re actively marketing to become the agent of choice in, try the best you can to host all of your open houses in that neighborhood. For each open house, put out at least a dozen brand-directional signs.

If you do that, it won’t matter whether you sell that house or not. The real value comes from reinforcing the message to all the homeowners in that neighborhood that you’re the agent of choice—the neighborhood specialist. Over time, you may not sell that open house, but I guarantee that you’ll be taking on a lot more listings and selling a lot more homes in that neighborhood.
