How do you begin your home search? If you’re trying to buy a home, you probably started by searching for listings online. With a background in technology, I’m all about using technology to make our lives easier, especially when it comes to finding the perfect home.

**One of the most effective ways to start your search is to use property search tools.** This means entering the criteria that matter most to you. Did you know that Zillow recently conducted a survey to know the top five search terms buyers look for? Here they are, in no particular order:

1\. Walk-in closet

2\. Pool

3\. Family room

4\. Open floor plan

5\. Backyard

These features sound exciting, but it’s important to remember that you don’t have to limit your search to homes with a pool or an open floor plan just because they’re popular. You should focus on what truly matters to you.

When I sit down with buyers, I make it a priority to pay attention to what’s important to you. **I always ask about what matters to them the most.** This helps me get a clear picture of what you’re looking for in a home.

If you work with me, I’ll guide you in creating three essential lists:

**• Must-have list.** These are the features you need.

**• Would-be-nice list**. These are the extras that would be great but aren’t deal-breakers.

**• Do-not-want list**. This is a list of what you don’t want in your new home.

Once we’ve created these lists, we can set up a property search tailored for you. This personalized approach not only helps us find homes that meet your criteria but also allows us to develop an effective buying strategy.

I would love to sit down and talk more about what home means to you and what features matter most in your search.
