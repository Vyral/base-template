Today I want to talk about the importance of using a professional stager before putting your home on the market and what that process looks like.

These days, homebuyers are going to search for homes online and view photos of your home there before they ever walk in the door. That’s why you need to put your best foot forward by allowing a professional to come into your home. **You want to meet with them at least a few weeks before you’re ready to list, if not a few months before.** If you’re considering making improvements to your house before selling, I recommend the latter. You want to avoid overspending, especially if you won’t get the money back in return.

Ideally, your agent is going to spend the money for the cost of a staging consultation. If they don’t do that, **I highly recommend that you have a staging consultation either way.** The stager’s job is to make your home look like a product that a buyer will pay top dollar for. Right now, your home is personalized. The stager will come through, give you ideas on how to depersonalize and declutter the home, and make it appeal to the widest possible number of buyers.

Here’s what happens during a staging consultation. The stager will start on the outside of the home, examining your yard, driveway, sidewalks, and the exterior of your home. Then they will go through the home room by room and give you a list of ideas of things to do in each room. The consultation usually takes about an hour, and the stager will present you with a report. It’s a giant to-do list and can be very overwhelming, so prioritize the list. It’s okay not to do everything, but the more you’re able to do on the list, the better.&nbsp;

Finally, keep in mind that this is your home and we know it can be hard to let go. However, **a home stager is there to transform the home from a personal home to a product that buyers are willing to pay top dollar for.** Putting in a little work up front can really pay off in the end.

I hope this was helpful for you. If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
