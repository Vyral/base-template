Whether you’re buying or selling a home, you need an agent to represent you. Not hiring a professional can cost you a lot of time and money.

Our market is strong right now. Inventory is low, which is good news for sellers. It’s also a great time to be a buyer in certain price points because interest rates are so low.  Because of this, though, I’ve been getting a lot of questions lately from both buyers and sellers asking whether they really need an agent.

Obviously I’m a little biased, but yes I do think you need an agent to buy or sell a home in our market.

For sellers, **not using an agent can cost you.** For example, a seller client of mine recently pointed out that one of his neighbors sold his home all by himself inside of a week. What he didn’t know is that his neighbor only sold his house so quickly because he underpriced it by about $50,000. If he would’ve used an agent such as myself to represent him, I would’ve netted him dramatically more.

As another example, I had a client once try and represent himself as his own attorney during a closing rather than pay the $600 fee for a professional attorney. Needless to say, this was a disaster. I’ve been to hundreds of closings and I buy many properties each year, and even I hire an attorney during these transactions so I have another set of eyes on what I’m doing. $600 is money well spent when it comes to what’s probably your biggest financial asset.

If you have a Picasso, you can sell it in a day at a yard sale, but you won’t get top dollar for it unless you go to an art dealer who knows how to market it. It’s no different when you’re selling a home. **Us Realtors can get you the most exposure and the biggest bang for your buck.** We help you net more money overall, which makes up for our small marketing fee.

On the buyer side, I always get buyers who think they can save money by going straight to the listing agent. If a buyer comes to me directly, I will refuse to work with them. To me, that’s a huge conflict of interest. I represent the seller, so my goal as a listing agent is to get top dollar for their home.

If you’re a buyer, you won’t get a better deal by working directly with the listing agent. You need a buyer’s agent working on your behalf who has a fiduciary responsibility to you. That’s what my buyer’s agents do when working with our buyers.

Even in today’s market, it’s important that you use a professional. By doing so, **you will save both time and money.**

If you have any questions about our market or you’re interested in buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I would be happy to help you.
