If you’re a veteran of the Armed Forces, there are many special lending privileges you can take advantage of if you’re thinking of buying a home.&nbsp;

Primarily, **VA loans offer 100% financing, no required mortgage insurance, and the lowest interest rates on the market.** Ultimately, this means you’ll pay as little as possible for your monthly mortgage payment.&nbsp;

You can also use seller-paid closing costs to break your lease months in advance if you need to. If you have a debt you need to pay off in order to qualify for your mortgage, you’re allowed to use seller-paid closing costs to pay that off as well.&nbsp;

If you also happen to be an avid golfer, don’t forget that the CMG Foundation’s annual charity golf tournament is coming up on April 11 at the Wild Dunes Harbor Golf Course. Once again, they’ll be raising money for the Gary Sinise Foundation, so don’t delay if you’d like to sign up. **T****o find out more about this event, [click here.&nbsp;](https://golftourney.com/golftournaments/cmg-foundations-inaugural-charity-golf-tournament/?error_message=errors:[code:415,message:CallbackURLnotapprovedforthisclientapplication.ApprovedcallbackURLscanbeadjustedinyourapplicationsettings){: target="_blank"}**
