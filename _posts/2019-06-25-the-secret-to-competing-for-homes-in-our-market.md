How do you buy a house in today’s market?

**You just do it.** Don’t worry about what others are doing. If you want a house, put your blinders on and make your best offer.&nbsp;

A lot of buyers out there don’t want to compete for homes right now. Essentially, they’re afraid that other buyers’ offers will be better. What if all those buyers don’t show up, though? What if there are only two or three buyers competing for the same home as you and their offers aren’t any better than yours?

Sit down, get a pen and a piece of paper, and **write down what you’re willing to pay, what you need, what you don’t need, and what you’re willing to do for the home you want.** After that, have your agent craft your offer. Everything’s done electronically these days, so they’ll be able to email you the offer for you to proofread before they submit it—it’ll only take two or three minutes of your time.&nbsp;

Once that’s done, have them present the offer in person to the listing agent and the seller. It might be enough to win the home\!

If your agent is afraid to make the offer because they’re afraid there is too much competition out there, give me a call and I’d be glad to help you close on the home you want.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me as well. I’d love to hear from you.
