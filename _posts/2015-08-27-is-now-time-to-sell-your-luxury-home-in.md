Today I wanted to update you on the luxury market here in Tucson. Any property that's valued over about $900,000 will qualify as a luxury property. This is a smaller section of our market, but I hope this information is still valuable to you.

* Currently, the active listings are down by 19% since the beginning of the year
* Our supply has been reduced to 13 months of inventory (down from 20 months at the beginning of 2015)

What does this mean for you? Well, the market is heating up and inventory is relatively low, so now is a good time to get your home on the market. You may be able to draw multiple offers on your home and increase your sale price through a bidding war.

If you're on the fence about selling, please don't hesitate to contact me. I would love to consult with you to see if we can sell your home quickly and for top dollar.

I look forward to speaking with you!
