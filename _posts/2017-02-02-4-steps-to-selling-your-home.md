Selling your home is saying goodbye to an irreplaceable part of you. As difficult as it may be, you have to go through it. So how to do it? Here are some tips:

\* **Condition**
<br>- Making sure your home is in it's best state is an art. It takes a few easy, basic tips and tricks to get you there.

\* **Marketing**
<br>- Take good photos, and we're not only talking about the resolution but also the angle of each shot. We want buyer gasping in AWE - not restraining themselves from screaming "What are they thinking?".
<br>- Suggest an open house to your agent.
<br>- Make sure to ask your agent to create a video of your home to be uploaded online. A lot of buyers spend majority of their home search online.

\* **Hire a Professional**
<br>- Agents save you on the hassles of spending time, money, and effort on selling your house.
