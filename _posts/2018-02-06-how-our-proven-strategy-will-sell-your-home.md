Congratulations! You are thinking about selling your home and you’ve decided to interview us. We are so excited to be candidates for your home sale.&nbsp;

We wanted to share a few things that set us apart from other real estate agents and explain how we can sell your home for more money in less time.&nbsp;

**One of the things we do differently from most agents is that we have a very large marketing budget.**We spend about $9,000 a month in marketing. Compare that $9,000 a month to the average agent who only spends $400 a month and you’ll see how we are able to get your home more exposure.&nbsp;

We utilize radio, Zillow, Realtor.com, and Trulia so that your home always shows up on the first page of search results, not the 10th page.&nbsp;

The more exposure that you get, the more money you will net on your home sale. We make sure to target Bay area buyers that come out to the Central Valley to buy homes. They are comparing their rent payment with potential mortgage payments, and they usually find that they can get a bigger home with a yard for the same as or even less than what they are paying in rent in San Jose. &nbsp;

**When you hire us, you are hiring our team.** We will be your main point of contact, but we have so many different resources to get your house ready for sale.&nbsp;

For example, one of the things we love to do to get the house ready for sale is to hire cleaners for the property. That way, you don’t have to worry about it and your home will be sparkling clean.&nbsp;

Professional photography is also an important part of our team. Pictures are incredibly important because people will look at your home online before they come out to look at it in person. If you don’t have professional photography that makes your home pop, they will simply scroll over to the next home and never ask for a showing on your home.&nbsp;

We believe in professional photography. Those are the costs that we incur to make sure that your home is shown in the best light possible. &nbsp;

**We are aggressive in our approach to selling homes.** We don’t just put your house on the MLS and wait for someone to buy it. We do things like prospecting, calling neighbors, mailing postcards, and talking to other brokers and agents to sell your home.&nbsp;

More importantly, we go directly to the consumers who are looking to buy your home. We have a marketing budget that is unparalleled compared to the rest of the local competition, which means more money in your pocket.&nbsp;

Since we are actively and aggressively marketing our listings, we are able to sell homes for 18% more than the average agent.&nbsp;

We look for new buyers and we have an enormous database of existing buyers. When we list your house, we send the listing out to everybody that’s already in our database.&nbsp;

Finally, we have real estate authorities that have recommended us to their listeners and followers because **they know that we have a proven, marketable system that will get your home sold fast and for top dollar.**&nbsp;

We look forward to meeting you. If you have any questions in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would be happy to help you!
