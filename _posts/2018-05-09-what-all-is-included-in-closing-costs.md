Today we are answering your questions about closing costs. **What are closing costs?**

I consider closing costs to include: the down payment, closing costs, and prepaid items.

A down payment is a percentage or specific dollar amount which goes directly toward the purchase price.

**Closing costs are one-time fees associated to you getting the mortgage or purchasing the property**. This includes the fees from the appraisal, the survey, the lender costs, and the title insurance.

Finally, prepaid items are those recurring charges. These are things which you will pay continually as a homeowner such as homeowners insurance, property taxes, or mortgage insurance.

The amount of money that you bring to closing will vary based on the price of the house, your down payment, and your creditworthiness.
