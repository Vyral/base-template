Not long ago, I got a call from a consumer who had been looking at foreclosures online. They were on the site hoping to find a deal, but when they came across a property they liked, the website indicated that they would need to pay to see more information about it. This is a big red flag. Not only was this person being asked to give money for free information, the home they were looking at had sold two years ago. There are a ton of reputable websites out there, but if you ever come across one that asks for your credit card information: beware. To see my full message, watch this short video.
