Do you know the difference between a porch and a patio? While they may seem similar, they’re actually completely separate outdoor spaces. Knowing which is which will ensure you’re asking for the right thing when looking for a home.

A porch is typically placed at the front of the home, and it’s often covered or enclosed. It adds curb appeal, and it’s a great place for people to relax. Staging your porch is critical; however, many people enter their houses from the garage, so they tend to forget what that space can do for their home’s appeal. It becomes a place for storage, but **a porch** **can be a fantastic decorating opportunity.**&nbsp;

On the other hand, a patio is constructed at the back of the house. Patios are poured concrete or decorative stone. They’re excellent for a grill or fire pit. However, patios are not the same thing as a deck. A deck may have some of the same stuff on it, like outdoor furniture, but it is usually an elevated structure attached to the house, whereas patios are on the ground either right beside or slightly away from the home.&nbsp;

A lot of people added porches, decks, and patios to their property in the last few years when they were spending more time at home. It’s important to know their differences so you can get what you want. **If you’re selling, don’t forget to stage those spaces.** Having that extra outdoor area makes your home feel larger and adds interest to the property.&nbsp;
