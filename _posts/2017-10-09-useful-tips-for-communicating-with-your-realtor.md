Have you ever gone to the doctor for an exam and not told them what’s wrong with you in the hope that they won’t tell you that you’re really sick? How well would that work out?

Your Realtor is another professional who’s there to help you, but they need all the information you can give them in order to do so. Not being straight up with your Realtor may not kill you, but it may get in the way of you getting a really good real estate deal.&nbsp;

**Here are a few tips for communicating with your Realtor so the transaction goes smoothly for the both of you:**

Discuss your financial situation with them. If there’s a problem, talk to them about it—they may have a solution. Be candid about what you qualify for or if you do or don’t have a pre-qualification or pre-approval letter.&nbsp;

Talk about what price range you want to shop in and what are your “must-haves” versus your “like-to-haves.”

Talk about your communication style. Are you a person who prefers texting, talking on the phone, or talking via email? How frequently do you prefer to communicate? This information will help you communicate in a positive way and get the job done.&nbsp;

Bring up any expectations that aren’t being met.&nbsp;

Be straightforward if you’re working with other Realtors. Some Realtors are OK with this, while other aren’t. Some take it as a challenge to be better than the other person you’re working with.

Unlike your doctor, your Realtor is working on commission, so they’ll work very hard to get the job done for you. They won’t make a penny until it is. Be respectful, be courteous, and communicate.&nbsp;
