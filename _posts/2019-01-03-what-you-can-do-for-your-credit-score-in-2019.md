With the new year officially here, it’s time to think about what you can do to give your credit score a boost in 2019.

First, aim high: 850 is the highest score possible, and while it may seem insurmountable, the FICO credit scale approximates that one in every 200 people achieves a perfect 850. Those who see an 850 reflected in their report are strategic in every aspect of their budgeting and financial picture—tactics we should all emulate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you’re hoping to be in the market for a new home soon and 850 just isn’t feasible, don’t be discouraged—shoot for a 720, instead. By no means is this a major drop in score. In fact, 720 tends to be the magic number for lenders and creditors who will be vying for your business and offering you the best interest rates.

Remember that your payment history and the timeliness with which you make payments is a key determiner of your credit score. According to CreditCards.com, payment history makes up 35% of your score.

A great way to reach (or preserve) a high credit score is to automate your payments, so you won’t have to rely on memory alone. But be sure the funds are available in your account; if you’ve been shuffling funds around, set some sort of reminder for yourself to put money back into the account your autopayments are attached to.

Don’t be afraid to refinance. If you purchased a home before your credit score reached its potential, there are streamlined refinance plans out there that might lower your rate—especially with FHA loans.

Watch your credit limits. You won’t be viewed in a good light by the bank if you’ve maxed out all of your available credit; it’ll appear as though you’re not living within your means. This ranks as the second most important factor when calculating your score.

Experts advise that you spend less than 30% of your limit, but be careful not to spend too little: Banks like to see an aptitude for sound financial management. Using between 10% and 20% of your limit and paying the balance down to a reasonable level is the key. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
