Everyone leads a different journey in life, but there are seven habits that will lead to wealth whatever your unique path may be. These habits come straight from David Osborn and Paul Morris’ book, “Wealth Can’t Wait.” This list is just one of the many things that stood out to me as I read it

**1. Live your life by design.**This point is so important that Tom Ferry wrote a book about it. Think about the way you want to live your life and create a plan to get there.

<br>**2. Make business decisions based on a solid foundation and solid fundamentals.**

<br>**3. Stick to what you know and drill deep.**Your wealth should be built using your greatest areas of competence.

<br>**4. Earn more by learning more.**I personally attend a ton of real estate seminars that I feel have helped me immensely throughout my career. There’s always new information to learn, so why not seek it out?

<br>**5. Break down your goals and add accountability.&nbsp;**

**<br>6. Spend less than you earn and invest the rest.**

<br>**7. Let go of the small stuff.**To earn wealth, you need to think big and act on a larger scale.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
