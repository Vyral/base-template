**Since I last spoke to you, there have been a lot of exciting changes for our team.**Before I get to those, I want to say thank you to all of our friends, families, and clients. Because of you, we were able to help more people accomplish their real estate goals than any other agent in central Mississippi. The long hours of work were worth every second to be able to help you.

Now, onto the changes. I founded this company in 2004 and shortly after, I brought on two business partners. They helped the business grow and now, 14 years later, we have been blessed again. **I am now the sole owner of this company once again. I’m so excited about the opportunities and I give all the credit to God.**

What do these changes mean for the company? The company name won’t change. We’re still part of Re/MAX Alliance. However, our new team name is the “Moving On Team.”

We’re increasing our marketing, our sales staff, and everything else we do in order to give a better experience to our clients.

Here’s a final surprise. I have been able to remove myself from being the broker of Re/MAX Alliance, and I’ve turned over the reins to my beautiful bride, Amy. **This will allow me to focus more on business development and sales so we can build a bigger and stronger team.**

Our guaranteed sale and homebuyer advantage programs are still here to stay. Barbara Corcoran still endorses our team as well.

If you’re looking to buy or sell a home or you just have any questions about real estate, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
