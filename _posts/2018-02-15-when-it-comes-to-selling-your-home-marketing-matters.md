Welcome back to our consumer real estate blog! We’re bringing you relevant information to make informed decisions in the marketplace. Today, we’ll be talking about putting your home on the market to sell in 2018.

When it comes to selling, marketing matters, and so does the real estate team that you choose. Now more than ever, how you market your home online, on social media, and everywhere in between is crucial to your success.

There may not necessarily be just one way to market your home, but there is a wrong way. Unfortunately, we see about 90% of home sellers marketing the wrong way.

To see an example of good marketing, visit [www.36cookeroad.com](www.36cookeroad.com). There, you can see a storyboard we created for a property here in Wallingford, Connecticut. You can see aerial views, floor plans, and you can take a real-time, 3-D walkthrough of the home on your laptop or phone. This was actually a property that was listed with another agency. We re-marketed the property and came up with an effective marketing strategy.

Not every home will be marketed the same way. You need to take a unique approach depending on what your objective is and what type of property you have. That’s where experience and reference points matter.

If you’re thinking about putting your home on the market within the next 12 months, you should be talking to a real estate expert now. If you’d like help with your listing or have any other questions, feel free to reach out to me. We can come out to the property and get you started on the process.
