As an experienced Mansfield Realtor, I oftentimes identify common mistakes within the local marketplace. It’s mind-boggling! Today, we’ll review the four most common mistakes, so you can avoid them when selling your home.

 The first mistake people make is trying to sell their home themselves. One of the biggest reasons to hire a real estate professional is they can market to a wider net of people than you can. You also have limited knowledge of the real estate market. Real estate agents are working in the market all day, every day. We have a level of real estate expertise that you cannot reach and learn on your own. We can help you negotiate contracts and sell for the most money. Don’t miss out on maximizing profit from your property!

The second mistake people make is overpricing their home. Everybody wants to get the most money they possibly can for their home. People have a tendency to think their home is worth  more than it actually is. A real estate agent will examine comparable sales in your area so you know what your home is worth in today’s market. By accurately pricing your home, you will sell faster and for more money than you would if your home was overpriced.

The third mistake is using poor quality photos. Just because your phone has a camera doesn’t mean you should use your iPhone to take pictures for the MLS! Professional photographs will make your home shine, and a real estate agent will make sure that the MLS does not distort the size of your photographs.

The final mistake is forgetting about the backyard. We all tend to focus on curb appeal and cleaning the interior of the home but run out of steam when it's time to take care of the backyard. The backyard matters to buyers, so make sure you get everything neat and tidy.

If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
