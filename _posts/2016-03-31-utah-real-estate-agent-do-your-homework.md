**When determining the sales price for your Utah home, it’s crucial to do your homework.** Many agents in our market today don’t take the time and effort that they should in helping their clients determine the proper sales price for their home. Oftentimes, an agent gets a call from a friend or family member asking them if they’ll list their home; the agent usually takes the time to pull up a few comparable properties, but not much else. They then come up with a sales price based solely on the comparables without even stepping foot in the home!

 Here at the Canovo Group, **we go far more in depth to determine a list price for our clients.** When we have a client who is looking to sell, the first thing we do is a rough estimate. This is a basic analysis used to determine what price range you can expect to sell your home in; the purpose of this is to give you some information to go off of to start making some basic decisions about whether you even want to move forward with the sale of your home.

 If your home falls in a price range that makes sense for you, and you want to pursue it further, **we will then schedule a walkthrough appointment of your home.** During it, we will take notes and snap some pictures in order to become familiar with your property. We want to understand the condition, the fixtures, the finishes -- the unique selling features of your home. We want to experience all this for ourselves so we can **determine what makes your home unique and figure out how we can leverage those features** to sell your home quickly and for top dollar.

 Once this part of the process is down, **we head back to the office in order to do a full, in-depth equity evaluation.** From there, we will develop a comprehensive selling strategy for you. Over the last 12 years of selling real estate, we have devised a very specific selling system to help us identify the optimal sales price for you. We want to avoid leaving money on the table, but we also want to avoid overpricing your home and having it sit on the market for months with no interest.

We’re going to do our due diligence and take some time to really make sure that we’ve done our job to ensure that we’re helping you make a decision on where you price your home to get top dollar and sell it quickly. **So, make sure you do your homework before you put a price on your home!** A good agent will walk you through the entire process I just described, so it doesn’t need to be a stressful or difficult experience!

 If you have any questions about this topic or about real estate in general, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to hear from you!
