*This is the difference between being pre-approved and pre-qualified.*

What’s the difference between being pre-qualified and pre-approved? When you’re pre-qualified, the lender is going off the information you’ve told them: your name, social security number, income, bank account resources, credit score, etc. and they pull your credit score. Being pre-approved means the lender has verified all your information and looked at your documents such as tax returns, bank statements, and W2s. **What you truly want is a pre-approval** because it proves you’re legitimately qualified for a loan. Being pre-approved also looks better to a seller than just being pre-qualified.&nbsp;
