Today I’m chatting with Kelsey Snyder, who knows all about the best ways to stage your home for the market.

It’s widely known that properly staging your home for sale can result in a huge payoff. Today I’m joined by Kelsey Snyder to help me go over what you should do to prepare your home for the market.

According to Kelsey, first impressions are the only impressions. The first thing buyers will see is your entryway, so you want to make sure coats and clutter are put somewhere else, giving your entryway a clean look.

**You always need to make sure your home is “show ready.”** Buyers can sometimes schedule showings with little to no notice at any time of the day. Make sure your home always looks its best while on the market.

It’s also important to note that **your kitchen and your bathroom are the two biggest things that will sell your home.** However, if you don’t have the budget for a full blown renovation, there are little things you can do like updating your paint colors or putting updated handles on your cabinets. Kelsey can help you do those things, as well.

Another thing you need to do before hitting the market is take the home out of your house. This means taking down family photos or anything else specific to you or your family. **Buyers want to imagine themselves in the home, which can be difficult if they feel like they are intruding.**

If you have pets, make sure they are out of the house during showings. You always want to put away any toys, food dishes, and water bowls.

The final thing you need to do is hire an informed real estate agent to show off your market ready home!
