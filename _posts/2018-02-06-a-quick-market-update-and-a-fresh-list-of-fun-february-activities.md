February is here, which means we have a quick market update and a full list of fun events coming up this month.

Here are some of our favorites:

* **Our team’s fifth annual Valentine’s Day chocolate giveaway.**Don’t be bashful—reply to this email and we’ll send you a bunch of chocolates in the mail. The reason I do this is to show my gratitude and appreciation for those who support our business.
* **The Southeast Wildlife Expo.**
* **The Charleston Wine & Food Festival**, which starts at the end of the month.
* There are also a number of oyster roasts being held this month by nonprofit organizations.

Now, onto the latest news from our market. As we settle into 2018, there are a couple key statistics from last year that you need to be aware of. There were over 18,000 total homes sales in 2017, which was an increase of 3.4% from 2016. The average sale price also increased to the tune of 4.3%, which is very sustainable and moderate rise.

Included in the link above are a few more market numbers for your consideration. If you have any questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, feel free to get in touch with me. I’d love to help you.
