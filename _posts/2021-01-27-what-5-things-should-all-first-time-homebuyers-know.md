<p style="text-align: center;"><am>Here are five great tips for first-time homebuyers in 2021.</am></p>

If you want to buy your first home in 2021, here are the top five things that you can do right now to prepare and make sure you’re ready:

**1\. Check your credit score.** Take steps to improve it if necessary. Your credit score and history play a huge role in your interest rate and whether or not you get approved for a mortgage loan. It’s best to start monitoring your credit report by getting free copies and work on your score by paying off debts and keeping card balances low.

**2\. Research first-time homebuyer programs.** Do some research to see if you qualify for any of these programs from the city or state. There are down payment assistance programs and even special loan programs for first-time buyers with a lower rate.

**3\. Shop around for a lender and get pre-approved.** After you’ve taken care of your credit, shop around with various lenders to see their offers and get the best deal available. A pre-approval is great because it lets you know how much you can borrow and it lets sellers know that you're serious.

**4\. Find a local and knowledgeable real estate agent.** Even if your sale is months away, it’s a good idea to start looking for a good agent now. They can provide you with crucial information about the buying process, the real estate market, and real estate in general. Read online reviews, get recommendations from those you trust, and interview several agents before deciding on one.

**5\. Set up a budget.** This will help you anticipate the costs of homeownership. Make your budget as close to it would be as a homeowner and don’t forget to budget all your monthly costs. It will give you a much better idea of what you can comfortably afford as a homeowner.

If you have any other questions about buying a home or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
