Window coverings are a subject that always gets covered, but usually late in the process. The homeowner may have blinds, curtains, or nothing. However, **my advice to homeowners is to use curtain rods.** Just put up some curtain rods, and then your tenants can get their own curtains in whatever color and style they prefer. Then, when they leave, they can take their curtains with them.&nbsp;

Window coverings are very important, and you need to have something for the tenants to put out. Therefore, I believe that curtain rods are the way to go.
