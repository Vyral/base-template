Today we’d like to introduce you to one of the great new members of our team. Michelle Menches has been with the team since January and works with both buyers and sellers.

She had been in real estate for a few years working on her own, but realized that joining a team would be a much better fit for her and a much better place to grow her business. **Once she joined us, things took off quickly.&nbsp;**

She closed one home in her first three months, but now has three homes set to close this month. There has been a lot of learning, but Michelle has taken off quickly. Since her first appointment with Rob, she has consistently receiving weekly appointments. **The focus that she used to spend on lead generation and cold calling can now be spent on ensuring her clients’ transactions move along smoothly.**

Michelle is straightforward, honest, and respects her clients. She wants them to be as informed as possible about what they can expect from her and from the market. Here are a few more fun facts about Michelle:

* She is married with three kids, ages 16, nine, and two.
* She is a big movie buff
* She loves to bake in her free time
