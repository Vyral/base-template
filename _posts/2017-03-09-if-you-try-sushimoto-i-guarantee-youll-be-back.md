This week I'm honored to feature Sushimoto, one of our favorite local restaurants here on the Emerald Coast.

My wife and I absolutely love coming here for sushi that’s extremely fresh and hot dishes that are great. In fact, **Emeril Lagasse himself recently featured Sushimoto as one of his favorite restaurants!** Owners Andy and Sophia are great people and good friends that provide the best customer service.

Andy wanted a way to feature local seafood and our beautiful beaches drew him here. He loves having a local spot and seeing so many new faces come try his food.

**If you mention the Nathan Abbott Team, they'll even give you a hot sake on the house.**

I encourage you to check out Sushimoto because if you come once, I'm sure you'll be back. You won't be disappointed!

Until then, give me a call or send me an email with any questions about our local real estate market. I’d be happy to help.
