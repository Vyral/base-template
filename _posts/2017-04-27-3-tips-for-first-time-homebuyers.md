If you're a first-time homebuyer or a newlywed buying a home, these tips will help you:

1. **It's all about the budget:** Your house is more than just a mortgage payment. Over time, you'll have to pay for maintenance and insurance. That's why we recommend you pay between 25% and 35% of your household disposable income toward that mortgage payment.

2. **Location, location, location:** Think about school districts even if you don't have kids. When the time comes to sell in the future, it'll be easier if you're in a positive school district.

3. **Communicate about the top features of the home:** During our free buyer consultation, we'll get a list of features that you and anyone living in the home would like to have. Then, we compare the lists and merge them into one list of must-haves so we can find your dream home.

If you have any other questions about preparing to buy your first home, give us a call or send us an email. We'd be glad to help!
