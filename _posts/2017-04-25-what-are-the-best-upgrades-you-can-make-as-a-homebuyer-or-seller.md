If you’re a new homebuyer, you might find yourself having to waive contingencies to get your offer accepted, which leaves you with a home in need of repairs or some updates. If that’s the case, you have a few options. You can use your own money, but you can also use a 203k loan.

The 203k loan is a rehabilitation loan which allows you to wrap all of your repair costs into a 30-year loan for a very low down payment. When taking out a 203k loan you’ll work with a HUD consultant that will help you complete all of the rehab projects necessary for your new home.

In fact, I’m working with one right now to update and repair a duplex. There’s a new HVAC system going in, the electrical and plumbing systems are being updated, the kitchen is getting new cabinets and appliances, and there’s new carpet installed as well. Although this loan allows you to make some great upgrades to your home, you want to make sure you don’t over improve. Luckily, talking with a HUD consultant will keep you on the right track when picking out which projects to undertake in your new home.

As a seller, where will your money count most when updating? The most important rooms to put in a little elbow grease are your kitchen and bathrooms. When it comes to a move-in ready home, upgrades in those areas are what buyers will to bid on.

If you really want to wow your buyers, there are a few additional things you can do. Most importantly, make sure your curb appeal is in tip-top shape. Put in the extra work to make the outside appearance of your home attractive and it will more than pay off. You’ll also want to make sure your carpet or other flooring is in pristine condition. For that extra edge that will show off all your upgrades and really make your home stand out on the market, have your home staged.
