The holidays are upon us. This is our absolute favorite time of year, and we’re sure this is the case for many of you, as well.

But while we all love the food, fun, and time with loved ones that comes with this season, there’s another important subject we’d like to highlight today: Holiday real estate. The ground may be freezing over, but the market certainly is not. Those looking to sell still have a chance to earn a great deal for their home, and there are three main reasons why:&nbsp;

**1. There’s less competition.** Not many people choose to list during the holidays, so those who do have a better chance at standing out.&nbsp;

**2. Buyers are more serious.** Anyone still out there looking for homes is doing so with good reason.&nbsp;

**3. Holiday decor can make your home shine.** Seasonal touches can make your house feel like a home for buyers who tour it, but make sure that you don’t overdo it. You want your listing to look tasteful and festive—not tacky.&nbsp;
