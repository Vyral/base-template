What happens when the agent becomes the buyer?

Paul Popp, our transaction coordinator and operations manager, is purchasing a property right now, which means he’s going through all the same steps our clients go through when buying a home.

So far, Paul’s been calm where he didn’t expect to be calm and feeling different emotions in situations he thought he’d know how to handle better. **Being in the same shoes as you are has helped him understand the process better.**

“It’s been unique,” he says. “It’s a constant reminder of where our clients are at different stages of the process and how those stages are being influenced, either by the other agent, the seller in this situation, the home inspector, timeliness of response—all of that stuff is really kind of communicated in a heavy, tangible way what our clients are going through.”

The amount of documentation buyers have to provide to their lenders has stood out as the most vivid part of the process for him. As easy as lenders make that exchange, he’s found that it can still be tense as far as the level of detailed knowledge they have about you. Once he finished getting pre-approved and entered negotiations, keeping his end-goal in mind helped him deal with the emotions of that situation and navigate all the hypothetical scenarios that arose.

**“Continually coming back to the goal made it crystal clear what we were trying to accomplish.”**

Thankfully, the seller responded reasonably to all of the negotiations. Next up was the home inspection phase, which always creates moments of apprehension. Going in with a 203(k) loan, Paul is borrowing a little bit more money than the purchase price of the property in order to put some money back into that property.

Knowing that extra money was there to handle problems created a sense of calmness, but the home’s inspection revealed three relatively big ones: asbestos, residual termite damage, and some fascia on some of the gutters, which is a complicated fix. Moving forward, we’ve uncovered a layering of information and still have some unknowns to decide on in order to proceed.

Paul jokes that he’s almost fired two people so far, but having the experience of feeling like he’s not being heard was invaluable to him because he always wants our clients to feel like they’re being heard, as do I.

What we’ve seen for a long time, and what partially explains this feeling if you’re a homebuyer, is that the further away a person involved in the transaction is from the actual transaction and the core facilitators of that transaction (i.e., the agent), the more you’re just a file to them. They don’t have the first-hand connection to your goals, your situation, and your timeline. **We always keep these factors in mind when working with our clients.**

“We train really hard on stuff like that—how to listen, how to find out where people are, and how to ask a question to dig deeper about emotions.”

We’ll keep you posted on the next steps of this transaction and relay some more first-hand knowledge on the subject. In the meantime, if you have any questions or are looking to buy or sell a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help.
