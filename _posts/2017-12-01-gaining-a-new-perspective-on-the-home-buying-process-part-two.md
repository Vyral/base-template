Today we’re coming at you with the second part of our two-part series, where we continue to answer the question “What happens when the agent becomes the buyer?” **[For the first part of this series, click here.](/gaining-a-new-perspective-on-the-home-buying-process-part-one.html)**

The next step in the home buying process for Paul was the home inspection phase, which always creates moments of apprehension. Going in with a 203(k) loan, Paul is borrowing a little bit more money than the purchase price of the property in order to put some money back into that property.

Knowing that extra money was there to handle problems created a sense of calmness, but the home’s inspection revealed three relatively big ones: asbestos, residual termite damage, and some fascia on some of the gutters, which is a complicated fix. Moving forward, we’ve uncovered a layering of information and still have some unknowns to decide on in order to proceed.

Paul jokes that he’s almost fired two people so far, but having the experience of feeling like he’s not being heard was invaluable to him because he always wants our clients to feel like they’re being heard, as do I.

What we’ve seen for a long time, and what partially explains this feeling if you’re a homebuyer, is that the further away a person involved in the transaction is from the actual transaction and the core facilitators of that transaction (i.e., the agent), the more you’re just a file to them. They don’t have the first-hand connection to your goals, your situation, and your timeline. **We always keep these factors in mind when working with our clients.**

“We train really hard on stuff like that—how to listen, how to find out where people are, and how to ask a question to dig deeper about emotions.”

We’ll keep you posted on the next steps of this transaction and relay some more first-hand knowledge on the subject. In the meantime, if you have any questions or are looking to buy or sell a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help.
