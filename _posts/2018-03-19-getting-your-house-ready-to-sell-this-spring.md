  It’s almost spring! That means that listing season is almost underway. That in
  mind, I have three tips you can use to prepare your home for sale—and to get
  more money from it. First, be sure to declutter your home. Get your personal
  knick-knacks off any surfaces and off the floor. Doing so will appear to add
  more space to your home. For the other tips, watch my latest video.

Welcome back to your real estate market minute.

Listing season is almost upon us, so I’d like to give you the three most important things you can do to get your house ready for sale.

**1. Declutter.**Decluttering is simple, but not always easy. Essentially, it means getting all of your stuff—tchotchkes, knick-knacks, and other possessions—off your flat surfaces, including the mantel, the nightstand, countertops, etc. This also includes any stray items on the floor. Putting them away will help you make your space look larger.<br>

**2. Deep cleaning.** When you clean your home, you should pay particular attention to the kitchen and bathrooms. These areas really need to sparkle; there’s nothing worse than walking in and seeing crumbs or stains on the countertops. Also don’t forget about the simple things like mopping and sweeping the floors, shampooing the rugs, cleaning the mirrors, and so on. Doing these tasks will make your house all the more inviting.<br>

**3. Depersonalizing.** If you have a lot of family pictures on the wall or other such personal items, you’ll want to take those down and put them away. You want the buyer to be able to imagine themselves in the homes. However, you don’t want to take too much down, or else it will seem cold. It’s a little bit of a balancing act. Additionally, you should depersonalize your colors, sticking to neutral colors like grey and tan.
