The residential housing market has been hot. Home sales have bounced back solidly and are now at their [second highest pace](https://www.nar.realtor/news-releases/2016/12/existing-home-sales-forge-ahead-in-november) since February 2007. Demand has remained strong throughout the winter as many real estate professionals are reporting bidding wars with many homes selling above listing price. What about your house?

**If your house hasn’t sold, it is probably because of the price.**

If your home is on the market and you are not receiving any offers, look at your price. Pricing your home just 10% above market value dramatically cuts the number of prospective buyers that will even see your house. *See chart below.*

**Bottom Line**

The housing market is hot. If you are not seeing the results you want, sit down with your agent and revisit the pricing conversation.
