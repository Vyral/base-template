As you try to scale up in our businesses, the idea of who you’re surrounding yourself with becomes incredibly important. **You tend to become the average of the five people you most commonly surround yourself with**.&nbsp;

Now that we’ve reached the new year, ask yourself who you’re surrounding yourself with. Are you happy being the average of those people? If not, who do you to replace or add to bolster your personal average?

Also, think about your environment when you’re generating leads. Do you have a place to go where you can do your most important work without being disturbed? **Having an environment conducive to your work is key.**

Finally, what are you putting into your brain? In other words, what are you reading or listening to? Readers are leaders, after all, so it’s key to feed your brain with good books or podcasts that help accelerate your business.

If you have any questions or would like to schedule a 30-minute consultation to discuss this in more detail, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send an email. Hope to hear from you soon\!
