Why can’t you trust BC assessments to accurately value your home?

A BC assessment is a government document whose sole purpose is collecting taxes. They’re also created using an algorithm to determine value. This algorithm compares your home to other homes that have sold in the area during July of the previous year—which means it’s not very up to date.&nbsp;

Assessment data doesn’t know if you’ve remodeled your home or bathroom or if your property has redevelopment potential, and it usually comes in 5% to 15% below or above market value. Very rarely does a person actually come out to your property to perform this assessment.&nbsp;
