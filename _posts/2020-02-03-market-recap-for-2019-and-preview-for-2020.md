*Our real estate market remained pretty stable in 2019. Here’s what you can expect in 2020.*

I’ve got a quick market recap for you today on what we saw in the real estate world in 2019 and what we can expect in 2020.

**We finished the year positively in Chicago.** The median sales price was up by 1.7%, and a positive number here is always good. Another interesting stat is the total number of closed units. We’ve seen a gradual decline in the last few years, and while it hasn’t had a big impact on price yet, it could down the road.

**The other important data point we track is the inventory.** We’ve seen it remain stable, but our level of inventory still technically has us in a seller’s market. As we slow down a bit, things have become a bit better for buyers, especially with the low interest rates we’ve had for the last few years.

Overall, 2019 ended as a strong, stable market. As we look forward to 2020, the data indicates that we should see more of the same. **The market won’t be too strong in either direction and should remain pretty balanced.** There’s no reason to hold back if the time is right for you to buy or sell a home.

If you have any other questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
