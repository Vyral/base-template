We at the Friedman Team care about keeping you in the loop, and we’ve got a few important updates to share with you today.&nbsp;

First, **Pet Fest is just around the corner, and we hope to see you there.** This great event will take place at Palmetto Island County Park on Saturday, March 30, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Pet lovers of all kinds are sure to enjoy this incredible fundraising opportunity.&nbsp;

**We would also like to let you know about an upcoming charity golf tournament at Wild Dunes on April 11.** Proceeds from the tournament will go toward the Gary Sinise Foundation, an incredible organization which serves our nation’s heroes by “by honoring our defenders, veterans, first responders, their families, and those in need.”&nbsp;

Now that we’ve touched on these two fantastic events, let’s quickly review the recent rise in loan limits. T**he FHA conforming loan limit recently rose to $388,700, and the conventional loan limit recently rose to $484,300.** This is great news for buyers interested in expanding their horizons to a broader range of homes. This rise means buyers can now afford homes at higher price points, while still submitting a relatively low down payment.&nbsp;

Though it’s true that 2019’s first quarter won’t finish as strongly as the market did at this time last year, conditions remain relatively positive. Beyond that, our team has the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to help clients succeed regardless of current market conditions. **We’ve been able to help sellers close quickly and for 100% of their asking price these last couple of years,** even though many sellers nationwide have been struggling to strike a deal at all.&nbsp;

Overall, there’s no reason to panic over the recent changes in real estate. Our market may be changing, but these developments won’t prohibit savvy buyers and sellers from reaching their goals.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are curious about how we can help you buy or sell in 2019, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
