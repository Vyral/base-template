There are some recent headlines about home prices that might be causing you confusion. You may have heard that a record number of sellers are cutting home values. However, there's an important distinction to make between asking prices and sale prices.

**The asking price is what a seller hopes to get when they list their home.** Sometimes, sellers aim too high for the current market conditions. When they don't receive many offers, they lower their asking price. This adjustment is not the same as the final sale price, which is the amount a buyer actually pays once the transaction is complete. Interestingly, despite these price adjustments, the final sale prices are not decreasing. In fact, home prices today are about 6% higher than they were a year ago.
