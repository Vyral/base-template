If you’re a new real estate agent, building your brand is going to be an incredibly important aspect of your business. Today I’m excited to bring you the first installment of my three-part series on how to establish your own brand.

**Before anything else, ask yourself the following question: What are your core values?**

This may sound silly, but it’s very important. You’ve got to decide how you’d like to be defined by the public. Whether you want to be defined by your honesty, your integrity, or some other core value, this is a critical step in establishing your brand.

**Think deeply about who you are as a person and write down the core values you come up with.** These values should be an accurate reflection of the way you live your life and the way you plan to run your business. This list of values can be as long or as short as you want.

The main thing to keep in mind is that people who are considering you as an agent will want to know what you stand for.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
