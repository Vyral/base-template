A lot has been going on with 2 Percent Realty lately, and we can’t wait to tell you all about these developments.

We just come back from a corporate Annual General Meeting in Las Vegas, and we’ve got some exciting news to share with you on the heels of our return.&nbsp;

First off, **2 Percent Realty is now Canada’s largest full-service, lower commission real estate brokerage** based on sales volume, dollar volume of properties transacted, and number of agents.&nbsp;

What this tells you, our clients, is that we offer service you can believe in. We’ve been in business for 10 years now, and the amazing growth we’ve seen in that time speaks for itself. And, of course, we couldn’t have achieved this level of success without you.&nbsp;

The second piece of big news we’d like to share is that our brokerage now has 22 locations across the country. Of those, we’ve named 2 Percent Realty Valley as the Brokerage of the Year.&nbsp;

And, as our third piece of exciting news, we are about to grow even more. We know our system works, and so we have decided to open a third location in Vancouver.

We are so excited for the opening of this new location, especially as it relates to our fourth and final announcement: **Our two current Vancouver branches will be joining together as 2 Percent Realty West Coast.&nbsp;**

By the end of this November, everything should be up and running, but we’ll continue to keep you in the loop as developments come in. Until then, we’d like to thank you once more for making all of this possible.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
