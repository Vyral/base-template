How do you know if you’re hiring the right agent to sell your home? I’ve got a few things you should consider when choosing your Realtor.

As I’ve mentioned in previous videos, there are a lot of things that they don’t teach in real estate school. Interviewing two or three Realtors for the job of selling your house is critical to the success of the sale.

Even in a market as hot as this one, not all houses sell or sell at their asking price. Hiring a competent agent is your best strategy. When interviewing agents, there are a few things you should look out for.

Make sure the sure the agent doesn’t just come prepared with information from your neighborhood, but **also has a wider understanding the market in your area.** Do they have knowledge of the macro- and micro-markets and see the trends that are happening? Do they know the absorption rate? Anyone can compile information on listings and what’s sold and what hasn’t. Make sure that they can interpret that data.

**Make sure the agent that you choose is marketing and tech-savvy.** You want them to be able to understand how to market your home across social media platforms and get it in front of the right buyers and demographics. They should be utilizing every resource that they have available to them both on and offline in order to market your house to worldwide prospective buyers.

**What is their track record?** What have they sold in the last three, six, and nine months? You need to make sure that the agents you interview can show you the statistics of the homes they’ve listed, not just the buyers they’ve worked with. What is the number of days that those homes spent on market? What was their list-to-sales price ratio?

Being a listing agent is different from being a buyer’s agent. **The skills required for each role are different, and be sure to ask the tough questions of the Realtors you’re interviewing** to determine that they have the knowledge and experience to sell your home quickly and for top dollar.

If you have any other questions or you’re thinking of selling, please give me a call. I would consider it a privilege to be interviewed by you to sell your home. I look forward to speaking with you.
