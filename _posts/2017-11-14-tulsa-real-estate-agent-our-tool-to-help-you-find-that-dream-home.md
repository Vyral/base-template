If you’ve struggled to find your dream home by searching on your own, we have a proactive solution that may be the answer you need: buyer listings.

Today I wanted to tell you about our buyer listings.

We’ve had many buying clients who have either exhausted the market because they just can’t find what they’re looking for, or they aren’t ready to move right this minute.

**We have come up with a plan to proactively search for listings for our buying clients.** We call this our buyer listings.

Just like we do for sellers, when we gather all the information on the property and market it on the MLS, our websites, and social media, **we do the same thing for our buyer clients.**

**We have a website set up specifically to host all of these properties for our buyers,** and we definitely push those listings out to our social media avenues and networks as well.

It’s kind of like a dating game but for a home. We are so excited to help match you up with a great home you’d be interested to move to.

Even if you’re just starting to think about the buyer search or you’ve been searching online with no luck, go ahead and get with us. We’ll have a consultation where we talk about all your wants and dreams and get you set up on our website so we can help you find your perfect home.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call at (918) 712-2252 or send me an email at info@TheWolekGroup.com. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
