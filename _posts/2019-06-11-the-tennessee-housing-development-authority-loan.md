Mortgage expert Beverley Slocum recently joined me to discuss a great financing option available to homeowners in the 37040 and 37042 ZIP codes: the Tennessee Housing Development Authority loan, otherwise known as the THDA loan.

Those who qualify for this grant can receive up to $15,000 in down payment assistance. However, time is limited. **Those seeking to take advantage of this program must be under contract before the end of June 2019.&nbsp;**

Also, it’s important to note that there are sales price restrictions for this loan, though these restrictions vary depending on the number of people in your household as well as your debt-to-income ratio.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to our team. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
