Are you looking to purchase a home? There are three funds you need to have ready:

**1\. Closing cost fund.** Closing costs are what’s required to sustain a mortgage. You should plan on saving 2.5% or 3% of the purchase price saved to cover closing costs.

**2\. Down payment costs.** Depending on your mortgage, this amount will be different. Make sure you understand your mortgage and know how much you need to save.

**3\. Cash reserves.** Loan officers will look into your bank account to ensure you have the cash in case anything goes wrong. Plus, it’s always nice to have extra laying around.
