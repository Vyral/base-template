If you’re a homebuyer in today’s market, you need to focus on doing five specific things in order to have the smoothest and most profitable transaction possible.

**1. Move quickly.** When you see something you like, you’ve got to be able to write an offer right away. If you wait a few days to make an offer, the property might be long gone by then.

**2. Understand the seller’s needs.** You can have your agent reach out to the seller’s agent and ask them what they’re looking for. Do they want a longer escrow period or a larger earnest money deposit? Whatever the case, you can craft your offer to the seller’s liking once you have this information.

**3. Have your loan officer call the listing agent.** If your loan officer lets the listing agent know personally that you are fully approved and ready to go, it can make a world of difference.

**4. Be aggressive with your terms and pricing.**

**5. Work with an experienced real estate agent.** I’ve been in the business since 1979 and last year, my team sold 169 properties. You want an experienced agent that knows this market.
