Our real estate market is very hot if you have a home to sell. The house I’m standing in front of in the video above was listed about a month ago in Mount Pleasant. It’s a beautiful, white-painted brick ranch home in a wonderful neighborhood. We hosted an open house the first day it was on the market and had 21 showings.&nbsp;

**We received seven offers, two of them were all cash**, we went under contract, but sadly the first buyer changed their mind. The house went back on the market, but we got one of the other offers under contract quickly. This home sold in about a month.

If you want to learn the value of your home or how it can receive multiple offers in this excellent market, reach out to us via phone or email. We’d love to speak with you.
