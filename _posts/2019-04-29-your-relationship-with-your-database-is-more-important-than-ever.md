Today on “Go St. George TV,” I discuss the importance of growing and maintaining your client database in our changing market.

Behind me is Petco Field, a place here in St. George that many of you have been to. I didn’t come to watch baseball, though—I came down to the park to meet with Frank Klesitz, a friend of mine who owns Vyral Marketing.

Vyral marketing is a firm that helps agents connect their database with what’s going on in the real estate industry. As we know, the relationships we form with our clients are more important than ever, especially with the advent of sites like Zillow and Redfin and the tactics of iBuyers in our market.

Everyone likes to have philosophical discussions regarding what to do about Zillow, but I like to follow the advice Gary Keller gives in his book, “The Millionaire Real Estate Agent”:

**1\. Build your database<br>2\. Communicate with your database in a systematic way<br>3\. Feed your database every day**

That in mind, I came down here to spend a couple of days with Frank to talk about the idea of nourishing our database here at the Larkin Group. Ours is now over 9,000 clients strong\!

To reiterate: If you want to maintain relevance in a market where increasing numbers of people are turning to online resources and iBuyers to sell their homes, your relationships with your clients matter more than ever.&nbsp;
