Most home sellers are thrilled to the get the price they ask for when they put their home up for sale, but they don’t think about the possibility of getting even more for it. In this wild market, that’s definitely possible.

If you’re wondering what tricks of the trade you can use when it comes to getting a higher offer for your home, you should consider trying the following tips:

1. **Price it a little lower**. Generally, you should price your home at market value so it won’t linger on the market. By pricing it slightly lower, though, you may be able to get a lot more potential buyers through the door. This can also stimulate a bidding war among buyers who see value in your home and are willing to pay more for it. This tip has worked twice for our team in the last week, alone.
2. **Hold off for the right offer**. The benefit of using an agent, or a team like ours, is we know the market and we’ll be able to determine what amount the offer on your home should be. Make sure you consult with your Realtor before saying yes to an offer. It’s easy to be tempted by the first good one that’s close to your asking price, but it’s sometimes worth it to hold out for the amount you really want.
3. **Sell in the springtime.** It’s possible to get a good price for your home anytime of the year, but spring is the time homebuyers really like to hit the market. This means you might have a lot more interested parties to choose from. Instead of waiting for buyers to come to you, put your home on the market when there are already a lot of buyers out there ready to invest.
4. **Make it unique.** Whether you’ve recently made some renovations to your home or it already has some interesting features, make sure to promote these things in your marketing materials and at your open house. These can not only add value to your property, but they can also help potential buyers remember it so they’ll be willing to negotiate.

Most sellers put their home on the market with the hope of getting a certain amount for it, but by following these tips, you might be able to get more than what you asked for.

If you have any questions or you’re thinking of selling and you want to get more than asking price for your home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. My team and I would love to help you.
