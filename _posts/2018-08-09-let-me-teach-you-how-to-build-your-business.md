As a millionaire agent seeking to help others achieve their greatness potential, I’m going to be teaching **a live class on August 21 from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m** at our office (2121 S. McClelland St., Suite 201 Salt Lake City, Utah). There is no cost to attend and there are no strings attached, which is pretty rare in today’s time. I’ll teach you how to build a massive real estate business through talent and the new seven levels to a million dollar passive income real estate business. You’ll also learn who to hire, when to hire, and where to find the talent. We’ll be at 2121 S. McClelland St., Suite 201 in Salt Lake City, just above the Habit Burger. **Space is limited, so RSVP today.** I look forward to seeing you there.
