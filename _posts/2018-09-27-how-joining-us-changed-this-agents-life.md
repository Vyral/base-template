Today we’d like to share the amazing success story of one of our team members: Julia Umeron.

Before coming to Jeff Cook Real Estate in March of 2018, Julia was working in one of the largest hair replacement centers in Atlanta. According to her, this transition has transformed her life and career for the better.

In fact, the move to a successful career in real estate has propelled her toward personal real estate success, as well. **Julia is about to purchase her own home, all thanks to her hard work with our team.**

There have been day-to-day changes for Julia, too—like the fact that she now has more time with her family.

Also, while Julia says those entering a real estate career should have savings built up to draw on while they adjust to their new path, she also says that Jeff Cook Real Estate is one of the best places for new agents to dive into the industry.

With our top-quality training and a culture that is second-to-none, Jeff Cook Real Estate makes the transition into real estate seamless and simple for first-time agents.

**Even in just the few months Julia has been with us so far, she has already sold three homes and has two more currently under contract.**

Getting to know the families she works with and helping them find the perfect home is what Julia says is her favorite part of being an agent.

So **if you, too, are looking to help families find homes, while working in a family atmosphere yourself, visit [www.joinjcre.com](http://www.joinjcre.com){: target="_blank"}.**
