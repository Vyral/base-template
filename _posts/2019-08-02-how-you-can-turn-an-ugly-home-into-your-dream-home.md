As a buyer, it’s absolutely within your capabilities to to turn an “ugly” home into your dream home—here’s how.

Are you having trouble finding your dream home?&nbsp;

I have a client who I’ve been showing homes to, but we haven’t had any luck finding her dream home. Recently, we were looking at a home she said was ugly, but it also had a perfect floor plan and a pool—something her family really wanted.&nbsp;

That’s when her daughter turned around and asked her an important question: “Mom, why can’t you buy an ugly home and make it pretty?”

This brings us to the point of today’s message: **As a buyer, you can turn an “ugly” home into your dream home.** In fact, investors do this all the time. If you come across a home labeled as “recently updated,” this means an investor likely bought it, fixed it up, and put it on the market.&nbsp;

If you’re worried about not being able to afford such a project (as my client was), talk to your Realtor, because they can help you with financing. I know plenty of lenders who offer rehab loans for this exact situation. All you have to do is tell them what repairs you’re making and which contractor you’re hiring to do the work. An appraiser will then estimate how much your repairs will increase the value of the home, and if the numbers make sense, the bank will give you your loan.&nbsp;

Rehab loans typically take longer to close than conventional loans—we usually ask for a 45-day closing period in this case, whereas with conventional loans, we ask for 30 days—but this gives you extra time to get everything in order.

Once you close on the house and the contractor finishes their work, the bank will release the funds to pay them. After that’s done, you’re all set to move in. Congratulations\! You just turned an “ugly” house into your dream home.&nbsp;

Remember, **all you need to make this happen is a Realtor who has the expertise to guide you through the process.** I myself am a real estate investor, so I would love to help you build your dream home.&nbsp;
