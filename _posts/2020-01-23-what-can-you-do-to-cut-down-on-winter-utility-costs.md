I would like to thank our past clients Bill and Patty, who ask, “With colder weather and higher utility bills on the way, do you have any recommendations that could keep our costs lower this winter?”&nbsp;

**I recommend changing your thermostats to a digital, programmable type.** Doing so will make a huge difference in your monthly bill.&nbsp;

We installed digital thermostats about three years ago after purchasing them from Lowes for $68. We got the [Lux TX9600,](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Lux-Touch-Screen-Programmable-Thermostat/50066689){: target="_blank"} a seven-day universal touchscreen thermostat. **Our utility bills went down by $100 a month.&nbsp;**

If you have any other questions, please send them our way. We would be happy to help you.
