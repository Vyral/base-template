How does our market look now that summer’s here?

**Inventory in our market is still extremely low**—maybe the lowest it’s been in the last 15 years. Houses are really moving for second homes and vacation homes. Prices are stable, and good houses that are priced properly are off the market in as little as a week.

**This market is especially good for sellers.** If you put your home on the market and price it properly (or even a tad below its market value), you may generate multiple offers and escalating contracts, which means more money for you.

First, though, you must hire an experienced agent such as myself who knows how to handle these contracts, get you to the settlement table, and negotiate properly.

If you have any other questions about our market or are thinking about buying or selling a home, give me a call or shoot me an email. I’m always here to help.
