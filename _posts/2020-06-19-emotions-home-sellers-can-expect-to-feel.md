<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The first step in dealing with emotions as a home seller? Normalize them.</em></p>

When you put the house you’ve lived in for a long time on the market and get the number you wanted for it, you feel excited—that’s a good thing. However, as the process progresses, **you may begin to experience a whole gamut of other emotions, ranging from remorse to nostalgia to downright nervousness.&nbsp;**

I’m here to tell you that’s completely normal; you’re about to make a big change and transition into another property, whether as part of a downsize or a much-needed upgrade. As a real estate professional, it’s our job to guide you through this process and reassure you that emotions are to be expected when moving on from a home.&nbsp;

I can personally testify that when I moved, I didn’t think that I’d get hit by some of these stronger feelings, but I did. I got a little anxious, but when I reached the closing table, everything was fine. If you work with a trusted Realtor, the same will be true for you, too.
