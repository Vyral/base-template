I wanted to stop by quickly today and just say merry Christmas. I want to thank everyone for your support this year and in years past.

There's one thing I wanted to share with you today.

How you been outside lately and seen the stars and the amazing landscape, sunset, and the moon? **If God was able to create all of this, and you still have a beating heart, you still have a purpose in life.** Not only did God create all those amazing things, He breathed His very life into creating you.

This Christmas, reach out to those around you and love your neighbor. Be encouraged and cheerful, and remember the reason for the season!

I look forward to hearing from you soon! Merry Christmas!
