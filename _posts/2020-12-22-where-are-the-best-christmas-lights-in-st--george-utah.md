It truly is the most wonderful time of the year\! Yes the traffic is out of control and don’t even THINK about trying to go to Wal-mart or Costco mid-day\! But the music, energy, and LIGHTS are amazing ANY year, and just what our spirits needed this year.

Today we’ll take you on a quick tour of three of the BEST spots to enjoy Christmas lights in my hometown of St. George, Utah\!

In our Holiday tour we visited:

* St. George&nbsp;**[Town Square](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g57119-d7988795-Reviews-Town_Square_Park-St_George_Utah.html){: target="_blank"}**
* The&nbsp;**[Red Hills Desert Garden](https://redhillsdesertgarden.com/){: target="_blank"}**
* The ABC “Christmas Light Fight” award-winning&nbsp;**[Olsen Family home](https://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2015/12/15/mgk-olsen-home-wins-christmas-light-fight/#.X-JNvdhKiUk){: target="_blank"}**&nbsp;on Harmony Place in Bloomington Hills\!

You’ll of course want to hop in the car and see these and many others. Thanks to Hedgehog Electric for their annual St. George Christmas Lights map\! You can find it **[HERE](https://www.hedgehogelectric.com/2020-st-george-christmas-map/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.**

Happy Holidays friends\!
