Whether you’re purchasing a property with existing appliances and home systems or you already own a home, it’s important to understand how long home systems and appliances truly last.

One of the most important things to realize is that **even though systems or appliances may not be broken down, they still might not be as efficient as they could be.**&nbsp;

If technology has advanced far past the level at which your current appliances and systems are functioning, you may want to consider making some repairs.&nbsp;

Sometimes, replacing systems and appliances altogether might also be necessary. Staying proactive about repairing or replacing systems and appliances will save you a lot of trouble down the line.&nbsp;

It is important to know how long each of the systems and appliances in your home will tend to last. Knowing this will give you a better idea of where you should make investments toward a more efficient home.&nbsp;

Air conditioners, water heaters, and stoves all last eight to 15 years. Refrigerators last between seven and 13 years, dishwashers last between nine and 15 years, and washers and dryers last five to 15 years. **HVAC systems tend to last the longest—between 10 and 30 years.&nbsp;**
