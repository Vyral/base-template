If you plan on investing in real estate, should you focus on flipping houses or on long-term property ownership? The answer actually depends on your goals.

Where can you make more money when investing in real estate: flipping houses or long-term ownership?

Now that that market is beginning to sway in favor of sellers, this is a question I’m hearing all the time. **The answer actually depends on your goals.**

People who flip houses generally do so on the side. It isn’t typically a primary income source. By the time they pay tax on their returns, they’re left with a net profit that probably doesn’t resemble what you’d see on HGTV.

However, if you’re willing to quit everything else you do, you can make flipping houses a full-time career. To be successful, though, **you will need to develop a lead generation strategy, a marketing plan, and have a number of other systems and resources in place.** Yet, like in any other industry, only the top percent of those who follow this career path will a high level of success.

Moving on, long-term ownership is another option to consider if you plan on investing in real estate. This kind of investment can create long-term wealth.&nbsp;

So to answer our original question, most experts agree that long-term property ownership is your best bet if you plan to use real estate as a source of passive income. And unlike house flipping, **long-term ownership can generate a substantial profit without requiring you to step away from other income opportunities.&nbsp;**
