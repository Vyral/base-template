Choosing the right Realtor is an absolutely critical step in the transaction when buying a home. Let me tell you about a recent client of mine who decided midway through the home search to hire a family member to help them.

**Long story short, their cousin ended up butchering the transaction and they ended up purchasing a property with a ton of issues.** The agent didn’t negotiate very strongly at all on their behalf. They had to re-invest a ton of money into the property to fix these issues.

There are some critical team members that you need to have in a real estate transaction. A good lender, like myself, is No. 1. Next is a great Realtor with strong negotiation skills.

You can vet Realtors in a few different ways. **Ask them to send you their top clients, or just ask me and use me as a resource.**

I don’t want to scare you, because home buying is an exciting journey, but dealing with an inexperienced Realtor when buying a home may end up costing you thousands of dollars.

If you have any questions or would like help getting in touch with some tremendous, trustworthy Realtors, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
