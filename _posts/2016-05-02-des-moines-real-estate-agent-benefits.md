Today our buyer’s agent, Amy Schafer, joins us to discuss **the advantages of hiring a buyer’s agent.**

As a buyer’s agent, Amy focuses on three main things. First and foremost, she **will help you find a home.** Buyer’s agents also negotiate on your behalf, protecting your finances and motivation. Finally, a buyer’s agent will get you to the closing table and moved into the home.

If you want to buy a certain property, **don’t just call the agent on the sign in the front yard.** Having a buyer’s agent is a free service, so why not take advantage of it? The seller’s agent will not have your best interests at heart.

**You don’t have to pay for a buyer’s agent.** When the seller lists a property, they take care of paying their agent and the buyer’s agent because they want the buyer’s agent to bring people to their homes. If you buy a For Sale By Owner property, your agent will negotiate their fee with the seller.

A lot of people start looking at properties online. Where do you go from there? Contact Amy for a 30-minute buyer consultation. She will go over strategies on finding a home and let you know how the whole process will work.

Inventory is incredibly low right now and many buyers are having a hard time finding good properties. A good buyer’s agent will get creative to find you the right home. For example, **Amy knows about many homes before they even come on the market.** She can match you with the right property before it even hits the MLS.

If you have any questions, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
