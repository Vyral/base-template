If youâ€™re selling a house during the wintertime, you need to set it up to show a little bit differently than you would in the spring or summer. I have some tips for just that.

If you sell your home in the wintertime, there are a few things you need to do differently to make sure it shows well.

**The first thing you can't overlook is the home's exterior**. Even though the grass may be dead and brown and things generally don't look good outside, it's still important to think about curb appeal. Driveways and walkways still need to be edged, the yard should stay raked, and flowerbeds still need fresh mulch or pine to look clean and sharp.

Just like the rest of the year, the interior needs to appeal to buyers. Go for fresh paint and clean all items from your countertops and vanities. When you go through Thanksgiving and Christmas, though, you may still want to decorate, and that's just fine. **Decorating for the holidays doesn't hurt the house, but it needs to be tasteful.** You don't need to make your house look like you're trying to win a Christmas decorating contest with a gazillion displays. This can make rooms look small and cluttered.

It's easy to sell your house in the wintertime if you follow these rules. If you have any questions for us or you're thinking about selling, give us a call or send us an email. We'd love to help you!
