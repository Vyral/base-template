Today’s appliances have a different lifespan than they did in years past, the reason for which is the fact that, now, they are more high-tech. This makes them more efficient, but also means that they’ll have more expensive issues. In the long run, older units aren’t as efficient, so you might consider replacing them to save on utility costs.

The main factors that affect the lifespans of appliances and mechanical systems are the brand of the product(s), the wear and tear, the complexity of repairs that become necessary, and the age of the unit itself. **Most appliances typically have a one- to five-year warranty, and once you get to that period, you’ll want to consider the life expectancy.**

One of the most important system in your home is your HVAC system (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning). These systems last anywhere from 10 to 30 years past the warranty. Your AC unit can last eight to 15 years. Another important appliance for any home, the refrigerator, has a lifespan between seven and 13 years. Electric and gas stoves, as well as your water heater, often last eight to 15 years.
