There’s a lot to love about buying in the spring market, but there are also a few drawbacks. Today we’ll share a few of these key pros and cons.&nbsp;

**The first advantage of buying in the spring is the bountiful inventory.** Unfortunately, as more supply hits the market, more buyers do too. This leads to our first drawback: increased competition. Multiple-offer situations are common these days, but, thankfully, the right agent should be able to help you craft a strong enough offer to secure the home you want.&nbsp;

Another thing you’ll likely love about the spring market is all the open houses. These events are plentiful this time of year and are the perfect opportunity to shop around without too much pressure.&nbsp;

With that said, the pressure itself is another aspect of the spring market that many buyers hate. With sellers in the driver’s seat, buyers can easily become overwhelmed by the state of the spring market. And along with increased pressure, prices are also higher than usual right now.&nbsp;

The bottom line is that our current market conditions are a mixed bag. **It will take professional guidance and careful planning to succeed,** and our team would be happy to help you out.&nbsp;
