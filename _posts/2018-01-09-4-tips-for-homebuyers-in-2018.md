Thinking about buying a home in 2018? If you are, now is the time to start preparing. **Here are the things you need to do first:**

**1. Check your credit score.**

**2. Avoid opening any new credit cards or making any big credit purchases.** You could increase the total price you’ll pay for your home in the long run.

**3. Keep tabs on interest rates.** The FED is expected to raise interest rates this year. They might do it more than once.

**4. Find a mortgage lender.** Then get pre-approved. This will save you time in the long run.
