Welcome to another episode of “What’s Working Now?. Today we’re going to talk about a frequently asked question during negotiations with buyers and sellers.

When a buyer and seller appear to be far apart at the beginning of negotiations, they want to know: **Is it worth it to keep going back and forth?** It is, and here are a few examples that prove that.

The secret to any successful negotiation is staying alive. Recently, I was in a negotiation where the buyer came in and made an offer. Instead of saying no right away, we went back and forth a few times. We let it stew overnight and the buyer came back in the morning with a great offer. **We ended up making a deal where the buyer and seller were both happy.**

Another example that comes to mind is with a listing that was overpriced. We still advised the buyer to make an offer in writing and we took it to the seller’s agent. It just so happened that this seller’s agent was a very good agent. We bounced the contract back and forth a few times and ended up meeting in the middle and made the sale.

If you’re a buyer, don’t be afraid to make your offer and if you’re a seller, don’t take every offer as an absolute end-all. **Like I said before, the secret to negotiations is staying alive.**

If you have any questions for me about your own negotiations or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
