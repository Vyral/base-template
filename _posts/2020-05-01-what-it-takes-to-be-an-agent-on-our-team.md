<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Why do the agents on the Dan Jones Team succeed? Here’s some insight into why our team is so accomplished.</em></p>

We often ask agents who aren’t on our team, “Why do you think the agents on the Dan Jones Team succeed?” Many times, they respond by suggesting that we have something they don’t have.

The real reasons for our team’s success, however, are the **structure, accountability, leads, guidance coaching, and support** that allow our agents to focus on prospecting, showing houses, and writing offers.

We do a ton of training, prospecting, and outbound marketing to get inbound phone calls. We work with warmer leads and get hundreds of opportunities every month.

We also set goals for ourselves. One of our core values is having a growth mindset. We don’t want agents on our team who only want to sell 15 or 20 houses. We’re looking for agents who set higher goals and pursue professional growth.

However, just because you have a goal doesn’t mean you’re able to execute it. To be a part of our team, **you have to be willing to do the work it takes to get to where you want to go.**

There’s so much that goes into helping our agents be successful and accomplish what most agents won’t ever accomplish in their careers. If you have any questions or would like to schedule a confidential appointment to discuss your goals and what you’re looking for in your real estate career, give us a call. We’re looking for top talent to join our team. We look forward to hearing from you\!
