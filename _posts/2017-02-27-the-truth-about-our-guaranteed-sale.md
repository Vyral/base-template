There is some confusion about how our Guaranteed Sale program works. Today, I’m here to tell you the truth about it.

Our Guaranteed Sale program is the most aggressive, most effective one in the Midlands. There is some confusion about how this program works, so I would like to clear that up today.

{% include pullquote.html %}

Recently, someone claimed that agents who use Guaranteed Sale programs only offer 50% of the home’s market value. **That is not the case.**

If you use our Guaranteed Sale program and we somehow don’t manage to sell your home, then we will pay you 90% of the home’s true market value. We are so confident in our selling program, which focuses on marketing, merchandising, and pricing, that **we can guarantee the sale of your house.**s

If you have any other questions about this program or about the home selling process, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
