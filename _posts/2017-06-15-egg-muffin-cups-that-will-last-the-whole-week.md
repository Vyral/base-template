Egg muffin cups is a recipe that can be prepped at the beginning of the week and it will give your breakfast for the whole entire week. Youâ€™ll need:

* Four organic, pasture-raised eggs. This is a good, inexpensive source of protein, vitamins, and good cholesterol.
* Any vegetables you like. This time, we had some leftover grilled bell peppers, green onions, white onions, and garlic.
* Organic butter or coconut oil.
* Pink Himalayan sea salt and pepper to taste. Stay away from cheap table salt.

<br>&nbsp;Start by preheating your oven to 400 degrees. Whisk your eggs together with salt and pepper and mix in the vegetables. Pre-line a muffin tin with paper muffin cups and grease the cups with organic butter or coconut oil. Using a ladle or large spoon, fill up the cups halfway with the egg mixture. Bake mixture for about 15 minutes. This recipe will make six cups for the week, and your breakfast prep is out of the way.
