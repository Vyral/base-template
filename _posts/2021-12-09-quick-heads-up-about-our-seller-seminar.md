This week, I wanted to let you know about an event we have coming up. The Dar Walden Team will once again be holding a seller seminar in the early part of 2022.&nbsp;

Many of you have come to it in the past, but many of you have not. **If you're thinking about selling your home, this is a great opportunity for you.** It’s a few hours long, we’ll provide lunch, and we’ll talk all about the home-sale process and what you need to know. This has been a great program for homeowners for many years, and we look forward to bringing it to even more of you.

We can usually hold 50 to 60 people at capacity. **There’s no charge for the event and it won’t be until the end of January, but spots will be reserved on a first-come-first-serve basis.** We’ll cover everything you need to know as a home seller to ensure success.

If you’re interested in this or have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. Keep an eye out for a future message where we’ll have all the details about the event and how to reserve your spot. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
