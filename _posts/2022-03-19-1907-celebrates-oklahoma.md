Tulsa looks so good on 1907\! Located near the Rose District, I’m excited to be with Bree at 1907. Being an Oklahoma native, I just get energetic while I’m here. Bree was kind enough to answer a few questions about her business for me below:

**What is 1907, and what makes it unique?**

“1907 is a celebration of Oklahoma, and our store is called that because 1907 is the year we became a state. Everything in the store is made locally, and we make a lot of it. We have a little bit of everything including super-soft shirts, tumblers, koozies, earrings, soaps, salsas, jams, and more.”

I love that there’s something for everyone in all different sizes and shapes. **What are some of the most popular items?**

“It depends on if you’re an Okie or a transplant. We have Okie girl stuff, but you have to identify as one to want those items.”

**People can also make custom items here. Besides that, what are some special features of 1907? **

“We’ve been here since 2013, which feels like forever ago. We started out with a little store and just made jewelry and bought everything else. I’ve always loved doodling, and in art school, everything I drew looked like doodles, and that’s turned into a business.

One time I drew the Osage shield with a dreamcatcher in the background, and taking that to get printed was the coolest feeling; I took an idea, turned it into something, then turned it into items people can buy. I’m not selling expensive paintings—it’s everyday art all people can appreciate. Then I just did another and another, and my favorite part of this business is making something people can take home. If you like a design, you can get it on a t-shirt, cuff, or coaster. I love seeing the way people light up when they see something they like.”

**How can people find you?**

“Come by the store; we have way more here than you’ll see on our website because the in-person stuff is our specialty. However, [our website is great](https://www.1907ok.com/), and you can also find us on [our Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/1907ba/) and [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/1907OK/). We’re on the south corner of the Rose District in Fort Worth; we’re a big red barn, you can’t miss it. Bigfoot is outside, so you can take a selfie\!”

We appreciate Bree sharing all of her passion and her very cute store with us. If you ever have any real estate questions, call or visit The Wolek Group website. We would love to help you.
