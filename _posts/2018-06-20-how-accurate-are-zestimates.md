You may have heard of Zillow’s Zestimate feature, but do you know whether or not this online value can be trusted?&nbsp;

In case you aren’t already familiar with this web-based tool, Zestimates are essentially Zillow’s version of a home value estimate. By entering in some data about your property, Zillow will assign your property a certain value.&nbsp;

**Unfortunately, the algorithm this tool uses is not designed in a way that will always produce accurate results.** Zillow’s Zestimate tool simply cannot factor in all relevant elements that go into your home’s value. Zestimates ignore key factors such as location and upgrades, which both have a significant impact on home value.&nbsp;

Homes in cookie-cutter neighborhoods might see more accurate results from a Zestimate, but **unique homes or those in a rural area are likely to be assigned a value that is way off.&nbsp;**
