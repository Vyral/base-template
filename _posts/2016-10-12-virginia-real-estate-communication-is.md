Today I wanted to talk about two tools that real estate teams can use to communicate with their clients. Be sure that the agent you hire has exceptional communication skills to keep you in the loop!

One tool we use for that kind of communication is a showing service. This service helps the seller approve showings and know what days and times an agent might be showing your home. There's also an online journal for feedback on your home compared to others in the market.

You should also look for a team that uses an interfacing system that allows you to see what that team is doing at all times when it comes to necessary activities for generating a smooth transaction for you. In our case, my Listing manager, my Transaction manager, and I use an online service to give you a sense of what we do on a daily and weekly basis. You should work with a team that constantly gives you the chance to know what's going on with your transaction!

Since it's such a big transaction, the importance of great communication with your agent and their team can't be understated. If you have questions about finding the right agent for you, give us a call or send us an email. We'd love to help you out.
