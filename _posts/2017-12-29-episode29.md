You’ll learn how to read a simple script into a microphone so you don’t have to be on camera. A voiceover is the best way to record a video when you must be 100% on message. Voiceovers work best for sales and promotional videos. Simply send us photos or footage. We’ll add in music and the voiceover. We can record the voiceover for you (once we agree on the script) or you can record it using your computer.

In this episode, you’ll see how real estate clients taking my upcoming recruiting class to launch Jan 8th are creating videos to sell tickets to upcoming training events. I use the Yeti microphone, with the levels set correctly, to read a client’s script into recording software (Audacity). This way you can see how it works to record your own voiceover. Remember, we can record the voiceover for you so there’s no work required of you. This is available to all clients. If you want to make a promotional video, and you don't want to be on camera, this episode is for you.
