Are you familiar with the quote, “You can be anywhere you want to be in five years?” Too often, we overestimate what we can do in one year and underestimate what we can do in five.&nbsp;

As I reflect back on my life and business just five years ago, I realized that I’d helped 71 families. All were experiences that I feel so honored and blessed to have been part of. &nbsp;

Since then, we’ve been able to help so many more. Last year, for example, we helped 135 families in their real estate endeavors, and we’re on track to surpass that in 2019.

**The secret to success is implementing the five personal perspectives into your life and business.** I did this very thing and, over the course of five years, I’ve been able to double my production. These are the five personal perspectives:&nbsp;

* Removing your limiting beliefs&nbsp;
* Being learning-based&nbsp;
* Working daily on self-mastery&nbsp;
* Focusing on what matters most, or following the 80/20 principle
* Being accountable to achieving your goals by a coach&nbsp;

The coalescence of these five points allowed me to go from E to P—entreprenurial to purposeful. As you think about and reflect on your own life, dedicate some thought to your future. When you’re able to define where you want to be and why you do what you do, you can achieve any and every goal you’ve set for yourself.

If you have any questions or thoughts about the five personal perspectives, feel free to let me know. They’ve changed my life and I know they’ll change yours as well. If you have any other questions related to real estate, you can reach out to me as well. I’d love to hear from you\!<br>&nbsp;
