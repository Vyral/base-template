Whether you are buying a home, selling, or have simply lived on a property for a long period of time, it’s a good idea to have an inspection done.&nbsp;

Recently I was joined by Bill Whitmire from On The Square Home Inspections.

**Bill and I agree that getting a home inspection is the best way to make sure any property is in proper condition.** On The Square performs inspections on structural, electrical, plumbing, and other major components of a home to make sure they are functioning safely and correctly.&nbsp;

Moreover, home inspections also ensure that the property is a good investment. Realtors will structure your contract in such a way that you are able to view the full report prior to any obligation you have to move forward in the process.

These reports are usually 20 to 30 pages in length and include pictures of all the items commented on. The comments within can be good or bad.&nbsp;

But, in either case, **the report is designed to give you an overview of the home’s condition.**

It also may surprise some to find out that it’s actually recommended for sellers themselves to get the inspection prior to listing their home rather than expecting it to be the responsibility of the buyer.

As Bill points out, this will allow sellers to repair components of the home at their leisure. It’s also a much cheaper option than waiting to have it performed later in the process.

This is especially true because sellers will often times not realize that certain smaller issues have damaged their home over time. Accumulated issues can lead to the buyer demanding a decrease in price or other stipulations.&nbsp;

**By having an inspection done ahead of time, the seller is able to make sure the home has a “clean bill of health”** before proceeding.&nbsp;

However, Bill and I both personally recommend that you get an inspection on your home whether you’re selling or not. If you have lived in a property for a long time, it’s good to uncover potential repairs before they become an issue.
