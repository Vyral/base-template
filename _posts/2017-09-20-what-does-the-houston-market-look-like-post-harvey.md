Instead of doing my regular monthly update, I wanted to spend some time talking about the real estate market in general here in Houston after Harvey. First, I want to send out my true sorrow for those who have lost anything (or everything) in the flood. We’ve been helping people clean out their homes for the last week and the destruction and devastation is just unbelievable.

There’s a lot of work still left to do, but I’ve been starting to get a lot of questions about **how the flooding is going to affect property values.** I think, at least for the time being, properties will fall into one of three buckets:

**1. Those that have never flooded**

**2. Those that only flooded during Harvey**

**3. Those that have flooded multiple times**

I’ve also been getting a lot of questions about rebuilding. While it’s still uncertain how flood insurance claims are going to work and what FEMA’s role is, I will say this. If you are planning to repair and sell, you need to look at that home as an investment. You want to fix it up and bring its value back in line with the neighborhood. You don’t want to over- or underdo it though. You want to get as much money back as possible.

After the water recedes, there are a few things you need to know:

**DISASTER ASSISTANCE**<br>For up to date information on Disaster Assistance which includes FEMA, Shelters, Housing, Insurance, Legal, Health and Safety, and Home Repair, please visit Harris County Recovery Network:&nbsp;[www.harrisrecovery.org](http://harrisrecovery.org/)<br><br>**IF YOU HAVE FLOODED**<br>1- File a claim with your Homeowner's Policy/Flood Policy/Register with FEMA

\*Flood insurance and/or FEMA will NOT reimburse you for loss of use, so any hotel or lodging expenses will be out of pocket. Auto flooding is handled through your Auto Insurance Carrier.
