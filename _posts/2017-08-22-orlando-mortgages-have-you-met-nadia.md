Today we are excited to introduce you to another important member of our team at Success Mortgage Partners, Inc.

Nadia Lokhnauth has been with us for about two years now as a junior loan processor. She has recently started placing all the orders for our appraisals while still processing loans, herself. She puts all the documents together and makes sure it gets sent to our underwriters for loan approval. **When the loan initially comes back from underwriting, she also works with the title company in getting certain documents recovered and back to underwriting for final approval.**

One thing that Nadia wants people to know is that the mortgage process isn’t as stressful as you think. **There are so many options and different programs available to borrowers,** you’ll be just fine as long as you have the right lender helping you through the process.

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email. Any time. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
