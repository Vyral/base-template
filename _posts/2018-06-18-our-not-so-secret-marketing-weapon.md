&nbsp;

What is our secret weapon for marketing? Our “Coming Soon” program, of course.

Although it is not really a secret, this program helps us make sure that your house gets maximum exposure before it even goes on the market.

An example of this is a property we recently had in Tracy. The seller was not quite ready to list, but since we knew that the house was at a prominent price point, **we wanted to create a momentum buildup**. That is why we listed it as “Coming Soon” and marketed it as such.

By the time we put the open house sign out two weeks later, we had people lined up at the door to get into the house. We ended up getting seven offers on the property with a maximum dollar amount. The seller was thrilled with the end result.

The house was actually only on the market for one day because of our marketing strategy. We just had to build up the momentum and get buyers excited about the property. Also, **you want to create a little mystery behind it**.

One of the things that we have found is that our other marketing enhances this “Coming Soon” program for our sellers. We get maximum exposure with signage, internet postings, radio ads, etc. to make sure that everybody knows that this house is coming on the market. Anticipation is how we get top dollar for your home.

The very first day the home hits the market, there is already competition between people for your home, which is what we want. **Our goal is to maximize the amount of money that you put back into your pocket** when you sell. We are able to do all of this because of our full-service agency.

Whether you hire us or someone else, you want to make sure that you hire a full-service agency. They need to offer this kind of opportunity for you which makes you get the momentum and anticipation built up so that you get multiple offers on your home.

If you have any questions about our marketing or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to contact us by phone or email. We would be happy to speak with you.
