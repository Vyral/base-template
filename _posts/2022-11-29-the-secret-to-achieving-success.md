Have you heard about the science of success? Some people think success happens by luck or chance, but it doesn’t; there is a science to it. That’s why I want to share what you need to do to lead you onto the path to success. At Keller Williams, we refer to these as the six personal perspectives, and today I’ll discuss the first two out of the six:

1. **Commit to self-mastery**. Self-mastery is simply focusing on becoming your best. Know that what you perceive as the destination is merely just a stopping point for the longer journey. If you hit a point where you feel like you know everything there is to learn, that's where growth starts to stall, and your results tend to falter.
2. &nbsp;**Follow the 80/20 rule.** Some people know it as the paradox principle. This is universally accepted across everywhere in life. It suggests that 20% of the input will equal 80% of the outcome you want. If you twist that and say you put in 20% of the wrong input, you won’t get the outcome you want. This means that if you input the required items correctly, you will get the outcome you want.&nbsp;

When applied to real estate, which is where I coach, it takes just these five things to achieve success: scripting, lead generation, follow up, going on appointments, and writing and negotiating contracts. An agent that does and commits to those five things will have a great business. It’s the same for marathon runs. The art of the long run is the 20% input. Diet, stretching, and hydration will help, but somebody who masters the art of the long run will do just fine in a marathon.&nbsp;

These are the first two steps in the science of success to help you become the very best version of yourself. If you've found value in this, give us a call, text or email. We'd love to set up a time to talk about it more. Have a wonderful and productive day.
