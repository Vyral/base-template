<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Our home seller seminar is a fantastic opportunity for any future home seller to learn some of the ropes. There are still a few spots left for this free event.</em></p>

I just wanted to send a message reminding you about our upcoming free home seller seminar. <strong>If you’re interested in signing up to learn everything about the home-selling process, give us a call right away or sign up on <a href="https://www.alaskatopagent.com/" target="_blank">alaskatopagent.com.</a></strong>

We’ll be joined by lenders, appraisers, and inspectors. There will be lunch, door prizes, and Q&A sessions. 35 seats are still available, but we’re not sure how long they will last.

If you have any questions for me, feel free to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
