We receive a lot of questions about when the best time of year to sell a home is. Most people tend to think it’s spring or summer. While it’s true that those months are when the market is most active, fall can actually be a great time to sell a home as well. **Here are a few reasons why:**

**1. Less competition.** During the spring and summer, everybody hits the market. Things can get competitive as the market is flooded with new listings. In the fall, you won’t have as much competition and your home will stand out more to buyers.

**2. More serious buyers.** There are a lot of people out there during the spring and summer who are just looking around and considering making a move, but aren’t necessarily serious about making an offer. In the fall, we find that buyers typically have a deadline. Most of them want to be in their new homes by the holidays. You can use this motivation to your advantage to sell quickly and profitably.

**3. Fall colors add curb appeal.** While the grass is still green and the leaves are changing colors, fall is also a great time to capture your home in its best light. We use professional photography on all of our listings, and we’ve seen a lot more traffic on the homes that have beautiful fall photos. More traffic means more buyers, which leads to more offers.

These are just a few things to be aware of if you’re thinking of selling your home anytime soon. If you have any questions for me or want to take advantage of the current market conditions, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
