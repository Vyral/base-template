Currently, interest rates are sitting at about 4.77%. Up 1% from where we were last year, this rate is a seven-year high. Home affordability, meanwhile, has reached a 10-year low.

However, **we believe that the double-digit price increases we’ve seen over the last few years, not the increase in interest rates, are the primary factor behind this drop in affordability.**

It’s a simple matter of supply and demand. Supply has dropped, leading to an increase in demand, and, therefore, an increase in price.

All in all, it’s still a fantastic time to sell. Those looking to buy, though, will have a little bit of a harder time due to our fluctuating rates. Even so, buyers who are backed by an experienced, professional agent can still be successful in our market.

**Just as every market is different, so are the circumstances of every buyer and seller.** If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like to know how we can help you reach your real estate goals, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
