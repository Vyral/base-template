A lot of people have been asking me if it's still a good time to sell. If you're on the fence and worrying about the right time to make a move, here's what I can tell you: even with higher mortgage rates, homebuyers are still out in force.

In fact, the current traffic of potential buyers is higher than in pre-pandemic years. This is a significant indicator of buyer activity. The latest data reveals that March and April witnessed some of the strongest buyer traffic in recent memory, with the exception of the pandemic-induced buying frenzy. It's important to note that the pandemic period was an anomaly and not a fair comparison to the normal pre-pandemic years. The key takeaway is that **buyers today are more active than ever, demonstrating a continued demand for houses.**
