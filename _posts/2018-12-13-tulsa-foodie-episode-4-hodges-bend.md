Today on “Tulsa Foodie,” I’m spotlighting Hodges Bend, a coffee and cocktail bar in Downtown Tulsa. Joining me for a quick chat is co-owner Noah Bush. 

Noah got into the restaurant business at a young age and has worked a lot of different jobs in the industry over the years. He always had a love of food, but after he started working at a wine bar here in town, he fell in love with wine too. After making a name for himself at Doc’s Wine & Food, he met up with his business partner and they developed the concept of a bar that specializes in coffee, wine, and cocktails. 

**Aside from serving high-quality drinks, what you might not know about Hodge’s Bend is that they also serve food.** They open at 7 a.m. every weekday and serve breakfast all throughout the day. Once nighttime hits, they switch over to their dinner menu, and on weekends they also serve brunch. Moving forward, they plan to make a few exciting menu changes while retaining their core products.

“We always wanted to be a bar with really good food,” Noah says. **With his wine background and the background of their two chefs, they plan on putting on more wine dinners in the future.**

What they’re really known for, though, is their drinks, and I had the pleasure of sampling their best-selling item while we sat at the bar: Irish coffee. Their version of this popular cocktail is made with espresso, sugar syrup, Irish whiskey, and a nice, thick layer of cream on top. 

If you want to try one yourself, you can find Hodges Bend at 823 3rd Street.
