Today I’m going to be sharing with you some information about a brand-new home community that is being built right now in the Southern Highlands.

**This community is being built by Lennar, a fantastic home building company that has many communities around the Las Vegas area already.**

There are five different models for you to look at, starting at 1,700 square feet up to 2,700 square feet. They range in price from $330,000 to $415,000.

Lennar offers great upgrades in even their most basic package. The new community is located all the way on the south side of the Southern Highlands. **It’s just a few minutes from the strip and also just a few minutes from the highway.**
