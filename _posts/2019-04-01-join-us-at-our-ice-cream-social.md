As many of you know, our team recently partnered with Everyday Angels in an effort to help support this local nonprofit and their mission to provide short-term financial relief and encouragement to those in need in our community.&nbsp;

With this partnership, for every home we put under contract between March and May, we’ll donate $500 to $1,000 of that transaction to Everyday Angels.&nbsp;

We’re proud to be able to give back to our community, and to help us cap off this partnership, **we’re inviting you to an ice cream social we’re hosting on April 29 at 722 Stonecroft Lane in Woodstock, Georgia.** We’ll have plenty of ice cream to go around, and we’ll also present our final check to Everyday Angels.&nbsp;
