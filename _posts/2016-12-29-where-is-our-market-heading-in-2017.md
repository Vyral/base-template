Today I wanted to talk about how our market has performed this year and where I think it’s going in 2017 based on some recent historical data.

The first statistic we look at is the average sale price. Year to date, our average sale price is $332,000. At the same point in 2015, that number was $327,000. Going all the way back to 2011, it was $311,000. As you can see, we’ve had some appreciation in this case, which is no surprise considering how good our market has been this year.

The next statistic we examine is our average days on market (or average days to sell). Currently, we’re running at about 67 days on market. In 2015, we were running at 71 days on market. In 2011, there were 99 days on market. This number continues to trend downward the further removed we get from the crash of 2008 and 2009.

Next, we look at months of inventory. This is what’s driving our prices and our interest rates. Currently, we only have three months of inventory, which is not a lot. In 2015, we had seven months of inventory. In 2011, we had a whole year’s worth.

Next, we look at sales. Year to date, we’ve had 7,398 homes sell, with about 466 to 500 pending sales, giving us an estimated final number of 7,844. In 2015, we had a total of about 7,689 sales. In 2011, there were 4,948 sales.

So, what do these disparities mean? Where are we going in 2017?

As we all know, the Federal Reserve met earlier in the month and increased interest rates again, so we should continue to see that number trend upward. Mortgage rates have risen from a low of about 3.5% earlier in the year to 4.25% now. That increase should balance out our inventory levels. If our inventory levels don’t increase, we’ll continue to see that price appreciation.

 However, next year, I think we’ll see a general slowdown in the market. We simply can’t continue at the pace we’ve gone over the past year. If you’re thinking about making a move in our market, now would be a good time to get ready for that.

 If you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, we’d love for you to email us or give us a call so we can help you. In the meantime, have a happy holiday season and I hope we talk soon!
