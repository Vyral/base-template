Today’s special guest, Chad from Hancock Mortgage, has done a phenomenal job helping my clients to obtain mortgages. Because of this, I wanted to bring Chad on to answer some questions about the home buying process

The first question we went over was, “How long does it take, from start to finish, to purchase a home?”

“Typically what we tell people is 30 days or less. As long as someone gets us the information we need in a timely manner, **30 days is more than enough time for you to submit a contract**to the close date,” said Chad.

Next, I asked him about the subject of credit scores.<br><br>As far as credit scores go, Chad explained that the higher your rate is, the better. This is because **credit scores help to determine the rates you’ll receive when buying a home.** However, there are many different programs available for any kind of credit score.

The third question I often hear people ask is, “How much do I need for my down payment?”

According to Chad, it no longer takes 20% down to buy a home. In fact, certain down payment assistance programs allow buyers to get into a home with zero down. However, this doesn’t mean you can buy a home for free. **“Zero down doesn’t mean zero closing costs,”** says Chad.

Nevertheless, a high-quality agent will be able to negotiate on your behalf for the best deal possible. Don’t let misinformation prevent you from getting your next home.

If you have any more questions about the home buying process, you can contact Chad at (281) 932-857.

And as always, if you’ve got any other real estate questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
