2020 was a tough year for so many. We are blessed that we were able to safely help so many families with their real estate needs, even in a historic pandemic.

Typically, our team would be together in person, celebrating our previous year’s production with each other and our Keller Williams family. Instead, we’re still mostly operating through Zoom. I still wanted to acknowledge our amazing team’s hard work and our gratitude for all of the families who trusted us with their 2020 move.

**As a team, we helped over 170 families last year, which was around $43 million in volume.** We also were able to donate $20,000 to the Tulsa-area community, which we could not have done without your support and referrals.

We’re grateful for last year's business, and you know that we are already focused on helping even more families in 2021\! The real estate market is still hot. The way home values are increasing, your home may be worth more than you think. Interest rates are still low, so buyers are getting more home for their money.

We work daily to help our buyers and sellers achieve their real estate goals. We focus on listening to all their wants and needs and strive to assist them seamlessly through the sometimes bumpy process. We are also focused on following through on our 2021 word of the year, which is Relentless. **We are Relentless in:**

* Delivering an amazing experience for our clients
* Learning and growing
* Bettering ourselves daily
* Connecting and communicating as a team
* Purposefully achieving our goals
* Giving back to our community
* Being flexible, caring, and kind to all
* Having fun while doing what we love

Thank you for trusting us and allowing us to do what we love\! If you have any questions for us or real estate needs we can assist with, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
