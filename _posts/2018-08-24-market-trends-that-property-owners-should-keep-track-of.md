Since we’re in the late summer of 2018, I want to talk about some market conditions and trends we’ve been studying that could have an effect on the sale of your property.

**1. Job growth in Columbus is slowing.** Mind you, we’re still growing, but the rate at which we’re adding new jobs has gone down year over year. Columbus is still at an all-time low for unemployment, but a dip in job growth can sometimes be a sign that it’s time to sell your property.

**2. Interest rates are rising.** Higher interest rates make it harder for developers to complete their projects since the cost of money is going up. Not only that, but construction costs have also gone up in Columbus. The 33-year fixed rate mortgage has gone up 33% in the last 23 months, and it’s still going up. Many buyers have changed their mindsets about purchasing properties because of the rate hike, and as the buyer pool shrinks (however slowly), it will impact what projects you’re able to complete and what you’re able to sell them for. If you’re in the middle of a project or you have a building that’s already profitable but you’re thinking about selling and moving to a different asset class, now might be a good time to consider doing that.

**3. Unit price growth is exceeding wage growth.** In the last year, the average property price has grown three times faster than wages have. This type of trend cannot be sustained long-term. When you see prices appreciating faster than wage growth, it’s a good time to reflect on the future, which means considering whether or not to sell a property now before you start losing tenants.
