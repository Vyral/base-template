Happy 2025! I hope you had a great holiday season.

It’s January, which can feel like a financial hangover month, and most people are drained from the holidays and might not want to do much. But there are a couple of things that make January a month full of opportunities, especially for buyers and sellers.

**For sellers, listing in January shows that you are motivated to sell your home.** Maybe your listing has been on the market since fall, and now you’ve adjusted your price and positioned it just right. You might be looking at a cold winter being on the market, but if it means you can get your home sold, you could be open to negotiations and get a buyer a good deal.

**For buyers, January is the month when most people look for homes,** especially those relocating for a job. They want to take advantage of the holiday downtime to make their move and settle in for the new year.

**The new year is a time for goals,** **and if real estate is one of them, we can create a plan together.** I’m receiving a lot of calls from people who are eager to move this year.

If you want to buy, we can find a great home deal. If you’re a seller who wants to list your home, I’ll guide you through the spring seller rush and help you get in and out quickly. This year is a prime time to discuss your plans. Who better to chat with than your trusted real estate pro?
