  People often ask me, “Is it difficult to sell a home in the winter?” Well,
  based on some statistics, I’d say yes. Across the four-county area where I
  work, I notice a significant drop in the average number of homes that are sold
  during two specific months of the year. In fact, during those two months, the
  average number of homes sold is lower than other times of year by up to 35%.
  To hear which two months these are and learn more, watch this short video.

So often people ask me, “Is it difficult to sell a home during the winter months?” I have to tell you, after looking at the data, my answer is yes. **It probably is a little more difficult to sell during this time of year.**

My team and I sell an average of about 2,400 homes per month in the four-county area where I work, across Cuyahoga, Medina, Summit, and Lorain. In November, our sales start to dip a little bit below that average.

In January and February, though, our average drops pretty significantly. We sell 1,600 homes on average in January and 1,700 in February. **That’s about 31% to 35% below average.**

Statistically, that’s fairly significant. If at all possible, sellers might want to keep their homes off the market during these two months.

However, buyers should know that these months are a great time to be looking. **You could possibly get a really good deal due to the lack of competition.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
