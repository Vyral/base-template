I’m joined today by **Mandi Henriod of Intercap Lending**, who shared with us a great way buyers can lock in current interest rates. Let’s say rates are 5.25% now and you know you want to buy a home within the next year, but by then, the rate will likely increase to 6.25%. Intercap Lending’s new program can help.

**Their clients can now lock in a rate for up to 120 days while shopping for a home.** Most lenders won’t lock in a rate without having a purchase contract, but that’s not the case with this program. Intercap Lending will be able to lock it in with no up-front fees, and they can even lock the rate on a specific property for up to 360 days (with a fee). This is a great option if you have a home under construction.

Unlike any other option we’ve seen, the up-front fee is refundable at the time of funding. All of their rate-lock options allow for renegotiation if rates somehow decrease. **They’re able to offer this on all agency loan programs, including FHA, VA, and conforming loans.**

If you’re looking to make a move within the year, [contact Mandi at Intercap Lending](https://www.intercaplending.com/loan-officers/mandi-henriod/){: target="_blank"} so you can lock in a low rate today. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
