Recently, a lot of clients have asked me, “What are my options if I can’t prove my income?” Today I want to answer that question.&nbsp;

There are two sides to this. If you’re self-employed, you might not have a W-2, but you can use bank statements to prove your income. The other side is if you have a limited income due to disability, retirement, or some other factor.&nbsp;

Fortunately, **there are programs designed specifically for people with limited incomes.** All you need is a 640 FICO score and sufficient cash reserves to qualify. A retirement account should be more than enough.&nbsp;

With these loans, you can get up to 80% of a property’s value. The interest rate will be a little higher because of the increased risk, but it is a great option for those who don’t qualify for conventional loans. This is a new program, but we’ve already helped a lot of clients buy homes using it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this new loan program, give my team a call or shoot us an email. We are always willing to talk\!
