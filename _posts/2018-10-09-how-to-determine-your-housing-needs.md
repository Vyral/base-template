Before you start your home search, you need to determine your housing needs. To figure this out, there are a few questions you can ask yourself.

The first is **what price point do you want to be at?** The price that you pay for your new home will dictate your monthly payments, so you should be comfortable with the amount.

You should also **ask yourself how big of a home you and your family will need.** How much square footage and how many bedrooms would your ideal home have? What about outdoor space?

Next, **consider****where you want to live**. Everybody has a dream location in mind at the start of their home search, but many people don't have the budget to match. Nevertheless, an experienced Realtor will be able to help you find the perfect neighborhood, keeping in mind the amenities that matter most for you and your family.

If you have any questions about this, or if you're interested in buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
