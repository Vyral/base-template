Today I’d like to discuss some innovative technology our company utilizes to help buyers and sellers.

We call this technology our **Shorewest Real Estate Hotline**. Essentially, this is a 24-hour, bilingual information line that generates results for buyers and sellers. This replaces the old system of putting a brochure in a box in front of a house.

Here’s how the Hotline works:

We put a hotline number, (262) 814 1400, on our signs, with is a PIN designated to that particular property. **A buyer can call in anytime they want to hear a verbal description of the house, and they can be put in contact directly with the listing agent. Additionally, the buyer can have pictures of the house and information texted to them.**

This technology allows buyers to get information about a property immediately, even if they didn’t see an ad on the property. It also attracts more buyers for sellers by providing an easy way for those driving by to inquire about the property. Further still, it allows agents to respond quicker to buyers since we’re notified of their inquiry immediately. We can contact them and ask them if they’d like more information on the property or possibly come view it.

If you have any questions about the Shorewest Real Estate Hotline, please feel free to reach out to us. We’d be more than glad to answer any questions you have.
