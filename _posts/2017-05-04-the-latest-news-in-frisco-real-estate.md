If you’ve been paying attention to the real estate market lately, none of this should be a surprise to you. However, if you haven’t, here are the biggest changes I’ve been seeing in the Frisco market this year as compared to last year.&nbsp;

Inventory increased by almost 8% in March to about 8,300 homes. However, we continue to have a lower supply of homes on the market that we have seen in the past seven years.

**Demand has stayed strong, with about 40,000 people moving to the area each month.** With new companies moving to the area, excellent public schools, and no state taxes, north Texas remains one of the most sought-after areas in the nation for homebuyers.&nbsp;

With a high level of demand and a low level of supply, home prices are going to continue to rise. In fact, right now, we are seeing the highest average sale price in our history. It’s up 12% to an astonishing $377,000.

What does this mean for buyers? **With limited options, you need a good real estate professional on your side who can find the home for you and find it quickly.** I’m talking as soon as it comes on the market. You must also expect to pay at least list price, if not more, to get the home you want in this competitive market.

For sellers, it’s all about preparation. Your home is going to sell quickly if you have an agent who can help you prepare your home, price it correctly, and present it to buyers in its best light. You also need to make sure you have your home purchase plans in place before you even put your home on the market. If you price correctly with a professional who knows what they’re doing, chances are that you will have a lot of showings and a lot of competing bids for your home.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions about the current state of the market or you want to take advantage of the current conditions as a buyer or seller, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
