I’m here today to quickly walk you through the steps of buying a home. Whether you’re a first-time buyer or just need a refresher, here’s how that process should look.

First, you need to make the decision to buy a home. Easy enough, right? After you’ve decided to buy, you’ll need to hire the right agent to help you through the process. This is a crucial step. **After you’ve chosen an agent, they will be able to help you secure financing for your home by choosing a lender.**

After you’ve picked out a lender, it’s time to start looking at homes. The process might take a while, but once you find one you like, you can make an offer right away. Your agent can improve the terms of your offer to give you a better shot. **These include increasing the price, increasing the earnest money, and negotiating repairs with the seller.**

Once all the due diligence has been completed, it’s time to close on the home and sign on the dotted line. After it’s in your possession, it’s time to protect your investment with a brand new home warranty.
