We’ve all heard of FAQs, but have you heard of SAQs? Today I’m going to talk about why **the SAQs are the questions you should really be asking, as they relate to your real estate business.**

First off, let me say congrats on your new real estate career. I’m very excited for you. I remember when I started my journey 16 years ago and it was very exciting. You’re probably getting a lot of calls from brokers and other agents that want to tell you about their company and why you should choose to work there. They’re all ready to answer the FAQs because that’s what everybody asks them. However, there are certain questions that you should be asking

{% include pullquote.html %}

When you’re looking to join a team or brokerage, you should be the one doing the interviewing. Not the other way around. You want to make sure that they have what you need to perform at a high level.&nbsp;**I’ve actually put together a list of SAQs for you to ask the next time you meet with a broker.**

They include questions like, “How is your company ranked in the marketplace?” and “What technology is available to me for free?”

These kinds of questions are important to ask so that you have clarity on what they are bringing to the table. You need to view this as an investment into a brokerage instead of an expense. If you’re going to invest money in a brokerage, you want to make sure you succeed at a high level.

You obviously got into this business to succeed. **If you’d like to succeed and are interested in getting a copy of my SAQs for free, reach out to me and I’ll make sure to send them over.**

If you have any other questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
