When you consider downsizing, it’s important to embrace a minimalist mindset. If the thought of downsizing makes you wince, though, you’re not alone.

Here are three tips to take some of the stress out of downsizing:

**1. Come up with a plan.** Ask yourself, “Why am I moving? What is my time frame? What kind of lifestyle do I want to lead?” Once you answer those questions, you can look at the contents of your home and decide what you want to keep and what you can donate.

**2. Start looking for your next house now.** Check out the neighborhood you want to live in and go to as many open houses as you can. Decide on the kind of home you want to live in. Whatever you do, do not put your home on the market until you’ve identified where you’re going.

**3. Prepare your home for sale.** Start now because this can be a long process. Take care of any deferred maintenance and freshen up the walls with a fresh coat of paint. Call me before you remodel your kitchen or bathroom; those remodels don’t always significantly increase the value of your home. Sometimes, updating your kitchen or bathroom just isn’t worth it.

Hopefully, these three tips will help you take the hassle out of downsizing. If you would like to learn more downsizing tips, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
