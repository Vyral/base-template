I’ve got some very interesting statistics about the Columbia real estate market that are hot off the press!&nbsp;

Before I get to those, I wanted to share with you that I’ve partnered with Kris Ancone to launch Jeff Cook Real Estate to serve the entire Midlands area. Our office is at 602 East Main Street in Lexington, South Carolina. We’d love for you to stop by.

So how’s the Columbia real estate market doing? So far this year, Columbia has had 16,035 homes enter the market via the MLS. Of those, **12,000 have sold,** which means that 25% did not, even though the market is getting better.

This is why it’s important to work with an agent who’s got your best interest in mind. **We have a great marketing campaign going here,** including billboards, radio advertising, as well as a vast relocation network of people moving into the Midlands. This is why we’re servicing the area now; our network is pushing a lot of people into the Midlands area.

How long on average will it take for your house to sell? Coming out of the holidays, **it will take on average between two and three months to find the perfect buyer,** relocate them, and get them into your home.&nbsp;

Here’s the interesting part: we’ve already started working with a lot of relocation buyers that have already started the process, so if you need to get out in, say, 30 days or so, we have the ability to help you with that too. **If time is of the essence, we’re the people to call.**

Last but not least, how much have homes appreciated in the last year? Average sales prices went from about $188,000 to $191,000, so homes have increased by about $3,000 on average. We expect that to continue to increase this year as well, and for real estate to continue to be a sound investment.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reply to this email or give us a call. We’d love to chat with you.
