It’s not summer yet, but the Charlotte real estate market is the hottest market we have ever seen. I’ll go over more details for you today.

If you are thinking about selling a home in the next three to six months, you should know that **the real estate market is on fire right now. **

This is the hottest market that we’ve seen. Homes are selling after 30 to 40 days on the market; some homes are selling in 60 to 70 days. This is a much faster pace than the usual 130 to 140 days.

If you are thinking of buying or selling a home, we would love to show you what we do differently to help you reach your real estate goals. We can sell houses in half of the average days on market; in other words, **we can sell your home in 15 to 20 days. **

One marketing tool we like to implement is our “Full Price Offers Only” sign that we put on each of our listings.

For buyers, interest rates are still incredibly low, but they are starting to creep up a bit. Now is a great time to jump into the market while rates are still low.

If you have any questions about navigating our current market, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
