If you’ve just bought or sold a house, congratulations! Now, of course, comes the moving part. Here are some of our best tips to make the moving process as smooth as possible for you.

The first thing you need to do is **prepare early.** As soon as you’re under contract, you need to start talking to movers. The Burks Team lends out our own moving truck to our clients for free on a first-come, first-serve basis, so feel free to call us as soon as you get that offer.

Next, start a schedule and plan a to-do list. When are you going to clear everything out of the attic? When are you going to box-up everything in the garage? Look at your cabinets, closets, and everything else and make a plan for when your family will get together and start packing.

Speaking of packing, be sure to **use labels on your boxes.** Label all four sides and indicate on the labels what’s inside the box. Use different-colored markers or labels for different rooms. Cut a piece of painter’s tape and attach it to the door of each room in your new house so movers know which boxes go where. If it’s a long-distance move, you might want to number your boxes because you won’t be there to supervise and check that all of them make it safely to their new destination.

For any breakable items like dinner plates, use styrofoam, dish cloths, or towels to wrap them and keep them secure in their boxes. When taking down picture frames off the wall, use some more painter’s tape to tape over the hanging hooks so when you’re ready to rehang them, you already have the right-size hook and nail.

It’s also a good idea to have an “open-first” box, which is the last box to leave your old house and the first box to get unpacked at the new one. Items included in this box should be tools, toiletries, and other essentials.

Next, **eat your food!** This way, you don’t have to pack all your freezer or pantry items. Whenever my family moved, my kids and I would have a "food night' before moving day, when we'd empty out our freezer and cook everything.

Additionally, write down the addresses of everything you’re getting in the mail so you can notify everyone of your new address.

Lastly, **move your kitchen, bathroom, and closet items before you move the furniture.** That way, when you move your furniture, you can find your clothes, toiletries, and you can get something to eat or drink if you want.

If you’d like more moving tips or you’re thinking of buying or selling a house soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help.
