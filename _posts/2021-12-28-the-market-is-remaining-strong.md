Traditionally, we’d expect the market to slow down over the holidays, but it’s still very active. Today we'll talk about why that is and what it means for you.

The main reason why the market continues to be strong is that **the conforming loan limits for Alameda, Contra Costa, San Joaquin, and Stanislaus counties have increased.** This helps limit enormous loans and creates more opportunities at better interest rates. Instead of paying jumbo loans at a higher rate, you can get a conventional rate and qualify for more home with less money.&nbsp;

On top of that, homeownership is a great hedge against inflation. Money is cheap right now, so this is a great opportunity to get your foot in the door if you're a first-time homebuyer or if you're looking to build on your real estate portfolio.

If you're curious about what's happening in the market, or if you have any other questions, we'd love to have a conversation with you. Just reach out to us via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you\!<br>&nbsp;
