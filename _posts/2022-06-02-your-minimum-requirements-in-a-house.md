Your home should fit your lifestyle and have spaces and features that appeal to your whole family. Today let’s talk about how to determine your housing needs when you’re in the market to buy a home.

**Before you begin looking at homes, make a list of priorities.** Include things like amenities, location, and size. Don’t forget to factor in distance to a certain school, your job, or public transportation. Sort these into a set of minimum requirements and a wish list. Minimum requirements are things that a house must have for you to even consider, while a wish list covers things you would like to have but are not completely essential.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
