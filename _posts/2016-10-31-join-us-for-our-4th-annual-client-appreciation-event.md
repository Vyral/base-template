We wanted to take just a moment of your time to invite you to our fifth annual client appreciation party at the New Westminster Landmark Theaters. The event will be on Saturday, December 3rd at 9 a.m.

**We will be showing two different movies. One is the new Disney-Pixar animated film, Moana. The other is a thriller starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard called Allied.**

Did we mention we will also be giving away a car at this event? Thatâ€™s right. We are giving away a 2016 Volkswagen Jetta to one lucky contest winner. To enter the contest, all you have to do is either buy a home with us, sell a home with us, or refer us to someone who buys or sells with us.

This is just an informal invite to let you know about the event. **Your Eventbrite invitation should be coming to your email inbox soon, so keep an eye out for that.**

If you have any questions for us in the meantime, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon!
