{% include youtube.html %}Contrary to popular belief, the holidays are a great time to sell your home. Why? A couple of reasons, actually.

The first is that if you wait until spring to sell your home, you’ll be competing against a lot of other properties. This reduces the buyer pool. The second reason is that you’ll know that the buyers who are out there looking for homes now are dead serious about buying.

To illustrate this point, I want to tell you a personal story about a house I once sold for a very good friend of mine. We were considering putting this house on the market before Christmas, so that’s what we did—we listed it the very week before. Everybody called us crazy, but I told my friend the same two things I just shared with you.

When we did our open house that weekend, we got more than 50 groups of people that came through. They were literally tripping over each other’s shoes because it was snowing outside. We ended up getting nine offers on the property. We put the house on the market at $440,000 that Friday. The following Monday, we were ratified at $467,000. We escalated $27,000 above our asking price and ratified the contract on Christmas Eve.

So, if you have people telling you you’d be crazy to try and sell during the holidays, remember to speak to a professional first. We’d love to be the ones to speak to you, so if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us by phone, text, or email. We look forward to hearing from you!
