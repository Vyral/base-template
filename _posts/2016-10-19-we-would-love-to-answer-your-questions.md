We have some exciting news to share today. We have decided to create our own video blog to stay in touch with you. Twice a month, we will upload a video that is educational and provides valuable information. **We want this to be a forum to answer your questions about the local Indianapolis real estate market.**

We want to be able to get this information out to all of our clients, family, and friends. We will highlight seller tips, buyer tips, and more as we answer your questions. **We will also talk about the mortgage and title industries, which are important to real estate as well. **

If you have a specific topic you’d like to know more about or if you have a specific question you would like us to answer, let us know by reaching out and sending us an email or giving us a call. We want this blog to be a valuable resource for you now and in the future.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out. We look forward to hearing from you.
