excerpt: Today we’re in the city of North Charleston in a neighborhood called Park Hill. Hurricane Matthew just rolled through here a couple of days ago, and the majority of the houses along the street I’m currently standing at have flooded. We decided to come down here and lend a hand to the people in this community because that’s what we do in Charleston.

Today we’re in the city of North Charleston in a neighborhood called Park Hill. Hurricane Matthew just rolled through here a couple of days ago, and the majority of the houses along the street I’m currently standing at have flooded. We decided to come down here and lend a hand to the people in this community because that’s what we do in Charleston.

A lot of people have been asking me what all this storm’s impact means for the real estate market. **Overall, this won’t hurt Charleston’s real estate prices.** Just because this is a hurricane-prone area doesn’t mean that the market suffers after one hits.

If you’re interested in assisting us with rebuilding this neighborhood, you can get in touch with us on Twitter at @rebuildparkhill or visit our website we’ll soon be launching called <a href="http://rebuildparkhill.com/" target="_blank">**rebuildparkhill.com**</a>. There you’ll also be able to see pictures of some of the houses that we’ve worked on to get a better idea of the devastation and how we’re rebuilding.

We’re still in business, so if you have any questions please give us a call or just reply to this email. We look forward to hearing from you!
