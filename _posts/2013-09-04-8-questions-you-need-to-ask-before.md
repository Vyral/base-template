Hello, everyone. When you decide to sell your home, you want an agent with a proven track record of getting the job done. I have a list of eight questions you should ask a listing agent before hiring them.

How many homes did you sell last year?

Most people are unaware that the average realtor in our area only sells about 3-4 homes per year. The Gresh Group sold 50 homes last year! Over the past 10 years, we’ve sold 450 homes and we can provide a list to prove it!

In how many of those transactions did you represent the buyer? In how many did you represent the seller?

The average agent represents buyers 80 percent of the time and sellers only 20 percent of the time.  

Because we represent sellers 50 percent of the time and buyers 50 percent of the time, we have the experience and knowledge of how to sell your home more than most agents out there.

Plus we have a rental assistant if you are looking to rent a property!

Can you give me references for the last 10 clients whose properties you successfully listed and sold? Specifically contact information such as name, location, phone number and date closed?

It’s important for you to check references. Keep in mind that that the average real estate agent has only been in the business for 11 months.

Do you currently hold any other occupation(s) besides selling real estate? What other activities are you involved in outside of selling real estate?

Selling your home is a huge decision; you want someone who is committed 100% to marketing your home and getting it sold.

Most agents are part time and sell real estate as a way to supplement their income. You don’t want an agent who fits selling your home into their schedule. Rather, get the agent whose entire schedule is based on you!

At The Gresh Group we are all full-time realtors.

The Gresh Group is part of Keller Williams Realty, the #1 brokerage in the WORLD!

Thank you so much for watching! These are eight important questions you need to ask your listing agent before you hire. If you’re ready to sell, give us a call!
