I’ve got some fantastic St. Charles real estate market data to share with you today. The average sale price in St. Charles across all price levels is up by 4% compared to where it was at this time last year.

Additionally, our month’s supply of homes is down by 5.4% and showings to contracts are down by 7.7% as well. This is all fabulous news for sellers in today’s competitive market. It will make it easier for them to get their homes sold without having as many showings. To get our full market update, watch this short video.
