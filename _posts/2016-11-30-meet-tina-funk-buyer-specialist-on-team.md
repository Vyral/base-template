*Tina Funk is one of our great buyer specialists. She is here today to talk about what attracted her to our team and why she enjoys working with us.*

We are back to introduce yet another great member of Team Lally. Tina Funk heard about us from another agent in Honolulu that thought she would be a great fit with us. She came out and met with us and left very impressed about how much we care about our clients and how we treat our agents.

{% include pullquote.html %}

From there, Tina joined our team as a buyer specialist and **she loves the role because she is responsible for one thing and one thing only, taking care of our buyers.** She knows that she has the support of our team through training, technology, and marketing, among other things. Tina uses all of this to bring together an incredible experience for our clients.

**If you have any questions for Tina about buying a home,** send her an email to tina@teamlally.com or give her a call at (808) 888-5021. If you have any other questions, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
