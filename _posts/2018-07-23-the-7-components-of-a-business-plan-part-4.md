Today we are continuing our series on the seven components of a business plan. This time we’ll be discussing strategic goals.

We talked previously about how you need to break everything down in terms of how many sales you have to make. Of course, it is going to come down to how you are making your sales, how you are getting your leads to get your sales, and how many contacts you need to get those sales.

However, if you have to have three open houses to get one buyer, and you want to do 24 sales this year, then you are going to have about 75 open houses.

**It’s also important that you don’t set unattainable goals.** No matter how much like Superman or Superwoman you are, you can only do that for so long before you get burnt out and break down. For this reason, I highly encourage you to be very specific when setting your goals. Sit down and narrow down your plan of attack.

**This is a business, not a hobby.** If you want to make money at this and make it a career, you will need to treat it like a business. Big businesses like Pepsi and Nike do not go into a year without measurable goals. They are laid out. There is no difference in the way you should be running your business

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I would be happy to help you in any way that I can.
