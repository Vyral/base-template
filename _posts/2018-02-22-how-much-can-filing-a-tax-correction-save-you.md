Making sure your tax valuation is accurate is critical. Today, I will be using real examples to illustrate this.

I bought a single-family property this year for $221,000. The assessed value by the auditor’s site was $242,000, which is 9.5% more than what I bought it for.&nbsp;

This assessment made my taxes between $5,200 to $5,300 per year in Franklin County. I worked with accountants and attorneys without receiving an answer, and ultimately found that, in all honesty, this is an issue you can resolve online using the two-page form at [www.franklincountyauditor.com](http://www.franklincountyauditor.com).&nbsp;

By filling out this form, you can receive a no-hearing judgement on your case. **All of the documentation you need is the deed, the settlement statement and a duly-signed purchase contract.**&nbsp;

According to my estimate, I expect to save approximately $460 per year thanks to this correction. Over the length of my 30-year loan, this amounts to a savings of $13,700. The time it takes to file for this correction is well worth the result. This is especially true for commercial investments.&nbsp;

For my second example, I’ll refer to a commercial investor my team and I are working with right now. He is currently in the process of purchasing a 47-unit apartment complex that, when we went under contract, was assessed at $5 million. Our contract price, however, is $1 million. The current owners actually challenged the assessment and had it lowered to $2.25 million. As such, the taxes went from $72,000 to about $64,000.&nbsp;

Even so, I still recommended to this investor that he visit the auditor’s site and fill out the correction form, as I did with my own single-family property. If he is able to lower his taxes by an additional $150,000, we estimate that he will save about $4,300 per year. **For a commercial property, this savings adds money back into the net operating income.&nbsp;**

Over time, this addition to his net operating income will add about $53,000 to the value of his property. Once again, the time it would take to fill out the correction form would be more than worth the results.&nbsp;

Now, I would like to delve into another topic, which is how to handle receiving incorrect information about a property. Let’s use the example of the single-family home I mentioned earlier. After purchasing the property I ordered a survey. This survey allowed me to discover that the square footage of my property was incorrectly recorded by about 6%. The number of bedrooms was also reflected incorrectly.&nbsp;

**The form I used to correct this information was the Residential Data Sheet.&nbsp;**Ensuring that data about your property is properly recorded is very important to the home’s resale value.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
