Sometimes, homeowners may fail to notice the parts of their property that are outdated or worse for wear. It’s easy to overlook issues in one’s own home. However, when it comes time to list, homeowners should realize that the buyers they’re bringing in will certainly notice these flaws.

Thankfully, there are a few ways you can boost your home’s value before you sell, and today I’ll be sharing four of the most effective.

**1. Update the bathroom.** Changing out hardware like towel racks or the knobs on cabinets can be an inexpensive way to give your bathroom a facelift. Or, if money permits, upgrading your tile can be even more beneficial.

**2. Update your home’s lighting.** Good lighting can instantly make rooms appear larger and more welcoming. So before you list, take some time to assess the lighting fixtures throughout your home. Replace any burnt out bulbs, and, if necessary, swap out a few fixtures for newer, more luminous ones. Speaking of lighting, mounted lighting strips beneath cabinets can be a great addition. Buyers love this simple feature.

**3. Repaint as needed.** Giving the home a fresh coat of paint will make it appear bright and clean. Even just the smell of fresh paint can help leave buyers with a positive impression of your home. However, make sure you stick to light, neutral colors, and that you also update your trim.

**4. Fix up the home’s landscaping and curb appeal.** Even before stepping foot in your home, buyers will judge what they expect to find inside by how your property looks on the outside. A freshly mowed yard, well-trimmed landscaping, and the addition of darkly colored mulch will all go a long way in boosting your home’s curb appeal.
