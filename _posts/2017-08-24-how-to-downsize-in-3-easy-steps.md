We’ve been getting a lot of questions about downsizing as of late. Here’s what you should know about it.

I’ve been getting a lot of questions lately about downsizing, so I wanted to offer some tips for any of you who are thinking of selling your big house and moving into something a bit more manageable. **Here are the first three things you should do:**

**1. Make a plan.** We can help you with that. The difficult task here is going through all of your things and sorting them into what you’ll keep, what you’ll donate, and what you’ll throw away or get rid of. This is an important step because it plays a role in the size of the home you’re downsizing too.

**2. Start searching.** Get a feel for what you want in a home, where you want to live, and more. There are homes, townhouses, and condos to choose from. The more you look, the better you’ll be able to tell what you like and don’t like. This will help you create an even better lifestyle moving forward.

**3. Getting your home ready.** This is where a good agent can really help. You want to get the most out of your existing home sale, right? The best way to do that is by looking at your home and determining if there is any work that needs to be done before listing it.

**These are just the first three steps to downsizing.** There are plenty more that come after. If you have any questions for me about downsizing or anything else relating to real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
