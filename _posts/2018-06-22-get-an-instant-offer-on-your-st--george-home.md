<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Our instant offer program is not a joke. Here’s how it works and how it could benefit plenty of homeowners.</em></p>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

Today we’re answering a question about our instant offers program. Over the last several years, I’m sure you’ve heard about this program on the radio. A lot of people wonder if it’s real. It definitely is!

**This program was born out of a need that we saw in the community last year.**

We recently met with Tonie, and elderly woman who had heard about our services on 99.9 KONY Country radio. Her goal was to move East to Colorado within 60 days but expressed great concern about hassling with repairs, cleaning up, and showing the house with three cats. She was not only worried that the cats might affect the sale, but that she'd actually lose one of them during a showing!

These are real concerns that we see more often than you might imagine working with St. George area home sellers. Every seller has their reasons for moving, and they may be not only emotionally compelling, but in actual need based on health, divorce, finances, or other life stress. Initially quite motivated at the decision to sell, sellers suddenly face questions like:

***"Where am I going to move all of my stuff in the garage?"***

***"What about my cat/dog/hamster/pet shark? Where will they go during showings? Will they get lost?"***

***"I have expensive heirlooms. Do you think someone will steal them while in the home?"***

***"I'm feeling pressured to get out of town, AND I'm short on cash. How am I going to make needed repairs to show and sell the properly?"***

It's all fun and games watching folks sell their home on HGTV...it's entirely different when it comes time to actually do the work required to sell <em>yours!</em>

After our lead Listing Specialist Robert Macfarlane met with Tonie to price and list the home he shared her concerns with me. I thought, "What if I/we bought it?" I presented the idea to Tonie 24 hours later. Her eyes lit up like it was Christmas morning!

30 days later I purchased the home in its as-is condition, they never had to show it a single time to other buyers, nor make a single repair. She was off to Colorado, just like that!

**Many home sellers don’t have the time, the money, or the energy to prepare and show their homes.** Many are under a time crunch and need to sell quickly. That’s why we created this program.

If you’re interested in the program, here’s what we’ll do.

1. **We'll schedule a very simple 30-minute walk-through of your property.**
2. **We’ll do a side-by-side comparison of what your home would sell for** by us preparing it for top dollar, "open market" (MLS) marketing, versus a cash "instant offer" that can close as soon as seven days.
3. **We'll give you all the time you need** to consider both options, ask questions, make a decision to sell, or do nothing. Both are okay with us!

The market value of your property and any instant offer will of course be subject to the condition of the home.
