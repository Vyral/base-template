The Zestimate is Zillow’s tool for calculating home values. It gives you an instant home value based on a complex algorithm, but **the accuracy can be spotty.**
<br>&nbsp;
<br>If you’re in a neighborhood, for example, that has a lot of recent sales of similar homes, your Zestimate can be pretty accurate. However, if you’re in an area that has a new subdivision nearby or your house is a little older or a little newer than the most recently sold homes, the estimate probably isn’t very accurate.

<br>&nbsp;
<br>No matter what, you should probably talk to a real estate professional if you want an accurate valuation. **Only an expert in the market will be able to understand what your home’s value truly is** based on current market conditions and the most recent comparable sales data.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>If you need a professional opinion on your home’s value or if you just have any questions, you can always give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
