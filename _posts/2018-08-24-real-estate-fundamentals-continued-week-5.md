Fundamentals are all just pieces of one big puzzle without which you cannot see the full picture.

Today’s installment begins our journey into week five of my seminar. To those who have been following along, **have you taken specific action in relation to every one of these fundamentals that we’ve covered to turn them into habits?** For example, have you take action to better time block your calendar?

I hope that you are.<br><br>Today I want to focus on improving your grasp on important tools you’ll need to use in order to be as efficient as possible.
