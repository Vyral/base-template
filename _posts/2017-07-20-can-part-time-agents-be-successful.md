excerpt: The decision to be a part-time agent or a full-time one is based on what you expect out of the job.

I get a lot of questions about the details of being a part-time versus a full-time agent. People ask me if it’s possible, if it’s a good option, and also how they can make the transition from full to part-time.

A friend of mine, for example, has been thinking about getting into the world of real estate and has been asking me whether she could potentially join my team as a part-time agent. In fact, I myself started as a part-time agent when I got into the business.

From my experience with this, I found that it was difficult to work with the leads that I needed. I was struggling because I was only putting in part-time effort instead of making my work a full-time focus.

**The moment I transitioned to full-time I saw an increase in the number of appointments I was getting,** the number of people I was showing homes to, and the number of listings I was getting. Four to five months in, I started closing consistently and found success that I hadn’t when I was just working part time.

Working with my current team, we get 400 to 500 leads a month. **Everyone benefits from each other but in order to really work as a part of this environment you need to be full time.**

If you are working another job concurrently to your work as a real estate agent, you won’t be able to reach the level of focus that will drive you to success.

Consider if you were at a second job and you’re contacted by a lead. Instead of being able to work with them right away as you would if you were a full-time agent, you might end up making them wait, and people expect a quick response. The standard on our team, for example, is within five minutes.

Also, there are a lot of commitments at all times of the day that come along with being an agent. It would be incredibly difficult as a part-time agent to be able to meet these obligations. Take the case of hosting open houses.

Open houses are a great way to generate leads and are something you’ll certainly be able to do as a part-time agent. **However, when you aren’t full-time, you won’t have nearly the same ability to follow up with those leads.**

Ultimately, the decision to be full or part-time is something that depends on what you’re looking for. If you are looking for a way to make some extra income then being a part-time agent could be a good fit for you.

But, being a full-time agent means you will be finding more leads, closing more homes, and finding a higher volume of success in general. When it comes to preparing our newer agents, our team has a “jump right in” approach.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
