Today I have a short update on the market, a reminder about our upcoming Thanksgiving pie giveaway, as well as some advice about being productive versus just being busy.

<u><strong>What&rsquo;s Going on in the Market?</strong></u>

As we move into fall, the weather is getting colder and the leaves are changing. Similarly, the market is changing, too. I had five calls this week from people who listed with other Realtors; their homes are sitting on the market with no showings, and they’re wondering what’s going on.

What you need to understand about the fall market is that slowdowns this time of year are typical: interest rates may be down, but the market is slowing. There’s a saying in real estate and sales that says, “An uncertain mind always says no.” There is some uncertainty in the market right now, but the seasonal slowdown is expected. If you have any questions about some of the great activity we’ve seen in the market, reach out to me. I’d be happy to talk to you.

<u><strong>Thanksgiving Pie Giveaway:</strong></u>

Keep an eye on your mail: Soon, you’ll receive an invitation from me for our annual pie giveaway. I believe that we’ve been doing this for about 10 years, and many of you have participated before.&nbsp;

Regardless of whether you’re a new or old acquaintance, I invite you to RSVP for your free pies so that we know how many to prepare for you. If you’re homebound or just can’t get out of the house, don’t worry—I’ll personally deliver your pie to you.

<u><strong>Are You Productive&mdash;Or Just Busy?</strong></u>

We often have periods where we’re just super busy in life, where we have days that are just jam-packed with tasks to check off our to-do lists. But at the end of those days, are we always sure that we’ve really accomplished anything? This is an important question because a lot of the time, we’re just busy. We’re doing the busywork without actually accomplishing any of our goals.

I’m a runner; I like to run in the mornings to gather my thoughts, think about what I need to get done for the day, and to stay in shape. However, I’ve been injured a lot, and ultimately, a good friend of mine who also runs told me that I needed to slow down. But that was hard for me, as a Type-A personality. The way I figured it, the faster I ran, the faster I’d be done.

But if my goal was to stay in shape, injuring myself by pushing myself too hard only hampers my goal. At the end of the day, we all need to take a step back to take a step forward. Sometimes slowing down actually can make us more productive.

As always, if you have any questions about real estate, our upcoming pie event, or staying productive versus staying busy, you’re encouraged to reach out to me.<br>&nbsp;
