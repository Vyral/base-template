When is the ideal time to sell your home in 2019? Here in Charleston, it’s the first two weeks in April.

According to Zillow, the best time to list your home nationally are the first two weeks in May. **However, in southern states, it showed that the first two weeks in April was the best time.**

In our local market, it shows that we had about 894 homes for sale in April 2017. In April 2018, that number rose to 939. Those homes were selling in about 58 days on average from contract to close.

**If you want to get your home sold in under two months and for top dollar, take a look at the first two weeks in April.**

If you’re a buyer and have been frustrated with low inventory so far this year, be encouraged that there will be plenty of more homes listed in the coming months.

**If you’re a seller, you have about a month to get your home ready for sale, which is ideal.**
