These five tips will help first-time sellers sell quickly and for top dollar.

As a first-time home seller, here are the five steps that will help you maximize your sale quickly and smoothly:

**1\. Choose an agent based on their marketing plan and reputation—not what they offer to price your property at.**&nbsp;

You’re hiring an agent to do many things, and one of those things is give a consultation on your pricing strategy. The reality, though, is that if you schedule five certified appraisals, they’ll each result in different price points. This is why the most important thing you can do is rely on your agent for pricing guidance and set a price with a strategy that works. Then, follow their marketing plan so they can generate demand. That’s what will bring buyers, and buyers ultimately sell your home.&nbsp;

Reputation is something that can’t be understated, so check your references and work with an agent who has a great reputation in the community. Sometimes it takes one or two interviews with an agent to make sure you understand their marketing plan and verify they have a good reputation, so don’t hesitate to interview multiple agents to make sure you find one you trust.&nbsp;

**2\.&nbsp; Price the home accurately.**&nbsp;

As I said, don’t choose your agent based solely on price, but do get a couple of pricing estimates during the interview process. If yours is a unique property, you should also get an appraisal. Money is won or lost during this step. If you price your home too high, you’ll lose money because the home will sit on the market and become stagnant. If you price too low, you’ll leave money on the table.

**3\. Ask for advice on staging and prepping your home.**&nbsp;

This process also cannot be understated. Builders with model homes spend a lot of money on staging because it’s a good return on investment, so you should make that investment too. There are several key items your agent can advise you on to prep your home for sale, such as staging, cleaning, curb appeal, etc.&nbsp;

**4\. Be flexible with showings.**&nbsp;

In today’s market, there should be plenty of buyers wanting to look at your property, so open up your home during times that are convenient for them, not just you.&nbsp;

**5\. Insist on professional photography.**&nbsp;

Stellar photography will display your home in the best light possible, so hire a professional photographer. Your agent should foot the bill, so don’t worry about the cost.&nbsp;
