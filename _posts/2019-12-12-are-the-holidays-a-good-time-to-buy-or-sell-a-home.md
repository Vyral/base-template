<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The holidays can be a great time to buy or sell a home. Here’s why.</em></p>

Are the holidays a good time for you to buy or sell a home? Actually, they are, and for a few different reasons.

**If you’re looking to purchase a property, you’ll have less competition from other buyers.** That also means that you’ll see fewer multiple-offer situations on homes. Further, interest rates are outstandingly low right now, lenders are more readily available than in other seasons of the year, and title companies have more time to dedicate to your transaction. All in all, home purchases this time of year tend to be less hectic than they will once the spring market begins in March, April, and May.

If you’re thinking of selling a property, there’s a prime reason that the holidays are a good time to list. Many buyers who view properties in the spring market are looking for homes, but not seriously. On the other hand, **buyers in the wintertime tend to be people who are really focused on buying a property and moving into it as soon as possible.** Additionally, the holidays are a great time to capitalize on the warmth and emotion of having a home; there’s nothing like seeing a beautiful home decorated for the holidays.

If you’re thinking about selling after the holidays, it’s worth noting that, for some reason, a lot of sellers don’t believe that anything will sell on the market until about April. That means that we’ll have the lowest inventory of the year until early March. **You may get fewer showings, but the showings you get will be high quality.**

All in all, it’s a good time to both buy and sell. We have a decent selection of properties on the market, great interest rates, and if you need to take the house off the market for a day or two to enjoy a family get-together, that’s certainly acceptable over the holidays.
