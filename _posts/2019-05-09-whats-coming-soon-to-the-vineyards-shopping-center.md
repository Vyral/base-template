The Vineyards Shopping Center is nearly complete. Here’s a quick update on what’s going on and what you can expect in the coming months.

Today I’m coming to you from the Vineyards Shopping Center at Porter Ranch. I’m standing in front of Nordstrom rack, the first store to open here in the area. **The next big opening is going to be Whole Foods, which is relocating from a 27,000 sq ft. building to a 44,000 sq ft. right here at the Vineyards Shopping Center on May 22.** You can learn more about the grand opening, which will feature music, free samples, and more, [here.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/whole-foods-market-porter-ranch-grand-opening-registration-60605837692?fbclid=IwAR2VQiAY5O7pgG4RX755mKOAOpqdNHPOu2N3KjIX8-FGRnRnbIMjwqCIUs8){: target="_blank"}

The next two to open up are going to be Pete’s Coffee and Ulta Beauty, which are both set to open in the next one to two weeks.

**Three more restaurant tenants have already signed on to come here: Kava Grill, Lure Fish House, and Gus’s BBQ.** A lot of other tenants are in the final stages of signing their leases here at the Vineyards, but we can’t announce them at the moment. Expect those announcements in the next few weeks as the shopping center is finished.

A lot of you have asked me about the AMC theater that was scheduled to open around the 4th of July with 900 seats, a bar, and more. **Unfortunately, due to the torrential rains we’ve seen this spring, it will probably push the opening date back a few weeks or a month until later in the summer.** They have to wait for the ground to dry out to finish construction.&nbsp;

The Hampton Hotel is scheduled to open in 2020 with 100 rooms, and Kaiser Permanente's building is opening up later this year as well.

That’s the latest news and notes for the Vineyards here in Porter Ranch. **You can stay fully up to date with what’s going on at their website [here.](http://www.thevineyards.com/){: target="_blank"}** If you have any questions for me in the meantime about the Vineyards or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
