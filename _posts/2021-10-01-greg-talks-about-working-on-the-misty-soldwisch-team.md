We sat down with one of our agents, Greg Wallenstein, and asked him to share his story and why he likes working on the Misty SOLDwisch Team. Here’s what he had to say:

“I moved here about five and a half to six years ago from Saint Petersburg, Florida, which is just outside of Tampa. I was there for 14 years, and before that, I lived in Brooklyn, New York.

I started at a different company where I got my real estate license. Somebody on Misty’s team reached out to me and said I needed to interview with Misty and Keith. I stepped up to the plate, interviewed with them, and it went very well.

I think a lot of the difference comes down to the team atmosphere. When you’re a solo agent, you don’t have the backing that we do on our team. We have a client service department that takes inbound and outbound calls all of the time. **They not only set and prescreen appointments but also make sure that clients get pre-approved**. By the time they meet with an agent, they’re ready to go see houses.

Prior to joining Misty’s team, I sold four properties. **The first year on Misty’s team, I sold 69 properties, and that number has gone up every year since**. I was working another job on top of real estate before joining Misty’s Team, but after I joined, I gave up that second job. I didn’t need it anymore.

Misty has shown me how to think outside the box. A lot of other agents get tunnel vision when working on a deal. I can call Misty any time of the day and bounce ideas off of her. That’s one of the reasons I’ve stayed on the team and have been so successful; **we collaborate well together**. If one of us doesn’t know how to handle something, we can talk to Misty, and she’ll know what to do. She really has seen it all, and since we do so many transactions a year, we know a lot more than your average brokerage.”

If you want to buy, sell, or have any real estate questions, feel free to give us a call. We’d love to put you in touch with one of our great agents like Greg.
