Now that we’ve entered another new year, it’s time for another market update. This time, we’ll recap the conditions we saw in 2018 and review a few predictions for what might lie ahead.

One of the most notable developments we observed in 2018 is the 30% increase in unsold inventory in Hoboken’s condo market. But don’t panic. **While the media may attempt to make this seem as if our market is crashing, this isn’t true.** We’re actually experiencing some stabilization.

For one thing, the average price in our condo market rose 8% in 2018, with the year’s final list-to-sales price ratio closing out at 98%.

The main indicator of our market’s health, though, is the absorption rate, which is currently sitting at 3.37 months. It may be less aggressive than the one- to two-month absorption rate we observed earlier on, but this is still a good rate. All it means is that our market has begun to balance out.

With this rise in inventory, of course, the time it takes for homes to sell has also risen, with the average days on market going up 25%. This has left us with an average of 34 days.

**What does all of this mean for you?**

If you’re a homebuyer, it means you now have more opportunities and leverage than you would have in the recent past. And if you’re a seller, now is the chance to sell your home at peak value.

As we move further into 2019, stabilization will continue. Inventory and the number of days on market will continue on their upward trend, but it’s important to realize that all of this is normal.

If you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, have any other questions, or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
