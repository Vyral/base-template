&nbsp;

We have an amazing real estate team that’s been in business for 15 years. Whether you already have a real estate license or not, I’d like to talk to you today about our team and why we’ve been so successful.

**We help our real estate agents become successful by providing the systems, marketing, leads, processes, presentations, and operations that they need.**

If you’re interested in learning in how you could have a six-figure income and truly get paid for the amount of effort and work that you put in, then you need to learn just a little bit more about this opportunity. **Instead of listening to what I have to say, listen to what a very successful agent on our team has to say**.

David Carter started with us in October 2016 after working at an hourly job where he was spending 80 to 90 hours of his week. He was tired of the grind and needed to have more time to spend with his family, so he joined our team.

**Now, David sets his own schedule, makes the most use of his time, and is excited about the opportunity for growth** he has on the Jeff Cook Team. In his first full year, he sold 17 houses. This year, his goal is to double that to 34.

**His advice for anybody who is looking around at different agencies and trying to decide which one to join?** The biggest thing you need to look for is culture. Do you like the people that you’re going to be working with? You also want to make sure that whoever is in charge of the company is invested in your success.

David’s decision to join us was a big leap of faith for him. Looking back, he can say that it was a fantastic decision and he’s really glad he made it.
