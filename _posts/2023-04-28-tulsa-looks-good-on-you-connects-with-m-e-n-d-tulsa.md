Tulsa Looks Good on Tulsa’s nonprofit, M.E.N.D.

Jennie connected with M.E.N.D.'s Chapter President, Cat Markham to hear about the impact this organization is making on the Tulsa community.

M.E.N.D. *(Mommies Enduring Neonatal Death)* is a Christian based nonprofit with a mission to provide hope and healing through your journey after the loss of your baby.

M.E.N.D. is a place for families to connect, share their unique story of loss, and learn to live life without your precious baby. Tulsa’s chapter provides monthly meetings the 3rd Tuesday of each month at, 5401 S Harvard Ave in Tulsa.
