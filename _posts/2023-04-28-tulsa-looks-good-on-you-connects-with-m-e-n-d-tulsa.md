Jennie sits down with M.E.N.D.'s Chapter President, Cat Markham to hear about the impact this organization is making on the Tulsa community.

M.E.N.D. is a national nonprofit with a Tulsa chapter, supported fully by the kindness of volunteers. M.E.N.D. provides support to families experiencing the loss of a baby due to pregnancy or early infant loss.

M.E.N.D. Tulsa hosts a support group on the third Tuesday of each month at&nbsp;[5401 S Harvard Ave](https://www.google.com/maps/place/5401+S+Harvard+Ave,+Tulsa,+OK+74135/@36.0853512,-95.9418027,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x87b692e2eca85c7b:0x94cf96145f1106a2!8m2!3d36.0853512!4d-95.9396087)[Tulsa OK 74135](https://www.google.com/maps/place/5401+S+Harvard+Ave,+Tulsa,+OK+74135/@36.0853512,-95.9418027,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x87b692e2eca85c7b:0x94cf96145f1106a2!8m2!3d36.0853512!4d-95.9396087).
