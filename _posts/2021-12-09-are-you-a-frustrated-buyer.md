It’s the holiday season, and everyone is making lists. Healthy Realty has a wonderful off-market properties list that can help you as a buyer or a seller.&nbsp;

If you’re a buyer frustrated with the current market, you’ve been looking and just can’t find the right house, we can help. Let us know what you’re looking for; **we may have an off-market property that would be perfect for you.** I had someone reach out to me the other day in that very situation, and we’ll help her find the right property. We’ll check our list and make calls to try to find properties that may not be for sale right now. We’ll find her a property that meets her needs, and we can do it for you too.

If you’ve thought about selling your home within the next few months, now is an excellent time to get on our off-market properties list. We know that selling your home can be challenging with people walking in and out of your house. Being on our list helps cut down on that, and **we’ll likely have buyers interested in your home.**

If you’re interested in being on our off-market properties list or want us to look into off-market properties for you, please reach out to us via phone or email. We would love to help you. Have a happy holiday season\!
