Those who have been considering buying a home in 2019 but haven’t yet gotten off the fence about it: Today’s topic is for you. **There are a couple of statistics I’d like to share that will explain why it’s in your best interest not to wait to buy:**

In 2017, the average sales price in Clark County was $236,000. Between 2017 and 2018, that number jumped up $22,000 to $258,000. Between 2018 and 2019, the average sales price jumped again to $269,000.

Given that, do you think you should wait until 2020 to buy a house? Do you want to pay another $22,000 for the same house?

Granted, I don’t have a crystal ball and I can’t say for sure that the average sales price will rise by that amount, but with the trends we’ve seen over the last several years, it’s a safe bet that home prices will only continue to rise.

Of course, you could continue to rent for another year, but guess what? Rents are going up, too. By buying a house now, you’ll be able to lock in a payment that won’t change for 30 years. **I highly encourage you to jump off the fence now, lock in your rate, and settle into your new home before the economy becomes any more expensive.**
