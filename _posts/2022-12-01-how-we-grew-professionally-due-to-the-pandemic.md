While we would never wish a pandemic to happen, it is always good to look at the silver linings that happened during that time in our professions. Today I’ll share three things we’ve learned during the COVID-19 pandemic:

1. **We learned to slow down.** The pandemic allowed us to slow down, reconnect with people at a human level and care about how they're doing. In the past, we focused too much on wanting to add to our database or find ways to buy or sell real estate. Now, we have time for conversations. It's important to touch base with your clients and tell them that you care.
2. **We became expert zoom users.** With a busy travel and real estate schedule, it took longer to set an appointment in person. However, when the pandemic happened, my work and home life mixed together. I could schedule a zoom meeting with my client right around dinner at 6 p.m., then have it at 8 p.m. A lot of people were in the same boat as me—their home life became integrated with their work life. We can talk at all hours of the day and night. I'm having shorter and more efficient conversations.<br><br>{% include pullquote.html %}<br>&nbsp;
3. **We prioritized safety.** We want to put safety first, which is why I don't work with clients who are not pre-approved or haven’t talked to a lender. We ask questions such as: Have they driven by the home they’re interested in? Have they looked at digital marketing and the 3D tour? Do they know that there's an apartment building behind that house or if there's a busy street? For the purposes of safety, we don't want to expose ourselves, our clients, or the sellers to germs. We also want to make sure everything's qualified, and we have looked into all the preliminary checkpoints.&nbsp;

These are the three lessons that have made us better agents and citizens of our community. To learn more about this topic or anything real estate related, call or email me. I’d love to connect with you.
