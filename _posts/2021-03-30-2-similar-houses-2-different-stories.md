Right now, I have two listings on the same street that are similar in square footage. Today I’m going to show you why **these seemingly identical homes will end up selling for different prices.**

House number one has some nice features, but it’s a little dated. There’s bad carpet, laminate countertops, and things haven’t been kept in top condition. The house is 2,100 sq ft and listed at $399,000. It’s going to sell under that price mainly because of its condition.

The next house is in tip-top condition, and the homeowners made some improvements to the home as well. Fresh paint, new hardware, and great staging will ensure that **this home is going to sell over its $399,000 list price.&nbsp;**

Getting your home in its best condition with a light remodel is absolutely the way to sell for top dollarin this market. If you have any questions about selling a home or what you can do to ensure a top-dollar sale, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
