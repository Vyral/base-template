Sellers often ask whether or not they have to do an inspection before they sell their home.

This is a great question, to which the general answer is no. **As a seller, you don’t have to discover future or current problems; it is the responsibility of the buyer to hire an inspector and discover existing problems.** The seller is responsible for disclosing problems they’re aware of, like a persistent issue with the plumbing or something similar.

However, **some cities like Pasadena have what is called an occupancy inspection, which requires sellers to do an inspection of their home when selling**. The purpose of the program is to maintain the quality of housing in Pasadena. Mind you, not all parts of Pasadena have this requirement—Chapman Woods, for example, which is under county jurisdiction, doesn’t have this requirement.

Where required, a city inspector will come out to your home to check for certain things, like permits (if any) being pulled properly, peeling paint, or other structural/legal issues.

So generally speaking, sellers aren’t required to do inspections on their own homes when they sell, though some cities have those requirements.
