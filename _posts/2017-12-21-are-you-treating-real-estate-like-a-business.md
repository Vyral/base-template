The difference between business owners and real estate agents is that business owners tend to focus on profit, rather than commissions

This is because the point of a business is to turn a profit. I can’t tell you how many agents I meet with who don’t have any idea what their profits are like.&nbsp;<br><br>If you don’t know whether you’re on track with making a profit, you should. Based on your income level, what should you be taking home for a net profit?<br><br>I’ve got some great PowerPoint slides that can help you determine these numbers. They’re from the new Keller Williams course “Business by the Book,” and they’re available for download&nbsp;[here&nbsp;](https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/Jerimiah+Taylor/PDFs/Like+a+Business.pdf)and&nbsp;[here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/Jerimiah+Taylor/PDFs/Like+a+Business+(2).pdf).<br><br>If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
