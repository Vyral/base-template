As the market begins to normalize and more people come out to look for homes, you may find yourself competing with several buyers for a single home. If you want your offer to be accepted, take note of the following tips:

* Get Pre-approved: You need to get a pre-approval letter from a lender before you begin your home search. You need to have it ready when you submit your initial offer, or the seller won't take you seriously. We counsel all of our clients to get it done up front, so we can present an offer in a strong manner.
* Send copy of proof of funds and earnest money checks: Sending these documents will give the seller confidence in you. Many buyers don't go out of their way like this to show how serious they are, so this gesture will make your offer the most attractive.

These are just a few tips that can be done a day or two before you prepare to make an offer, but they could be the difference between getting your offer accepted and missing out on your dream home. If you would like more buying tips, or have any questions about real estate, give us a call. We would be pleased to assist you in any way possible!
