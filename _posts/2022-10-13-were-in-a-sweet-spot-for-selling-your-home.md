Are you trying to decide if you should sell your home now or wait? We have the answer for you\! **The current state of our market may be the sweet spot you have been looking for.&nbsp;**

The supply of homes has been increasing since January, but it’s still low historically. We would need much higher inventory to be officially in a normal or balanced market, so we are still in a seller’s market. In many areas, including Louisville, there aren’t enough homes to meet today’s demand.&nbsp;

This means there’s demand out there for your house, and you should also have more options to choose from when deciding where to move to. **If you have been putting off selling your home, now is the time to jump in.&nbsp;**

If you want help with this or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to call or text anytime. My number is (502) 376-5483. I look forward to hearing from you.
