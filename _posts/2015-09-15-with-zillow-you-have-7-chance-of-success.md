As a real estate professional, **I'm continually bombarded by the question, "Why does Zillow price my home differently?"**

If we go on Zillow's website, this is how they explain it: The Zestimate is created by an automatic software process designed by statisticians, and **there is no ability for humans to manually alter the Zestimate for a specific property.**

To make that more clear, let's say a home is estimated to be worth $500,000. If the Zestimate is off by 10%, that's a difference of $50,000! **If the home is underpriced, you're missing out on tens of thousands of dollars.** If your home is overpriced by 10%, it will sit on the market for awhile, and you might have to drop the price, causing buyers to wonder what's wrong with the home.

It's been estimated that **Zillow's home estimates are only right 7% of the time.** That means that they are wrong 93% of the time! That is a terrible success rate.

Remember, **Zillow can't take features or upgrades on your property and compare them to other recently closed homes** in your area, even though doing so gives you a more updated value on your property. Zillow doesn't walk through your home, and that's where my team can come in and place an accurate value on your home.

Ultimately, **if you want the most accurate price for your home, make an appointment with a real estate professional.** We will go over your home and the local market data in order to give you the most accurate home value.
If you have any questions, or if you're interested in a home valuation, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!
