Alys Beach and Rosemary Beach are two of the most luxurious communities along Florida’s Gulf Coast. Both of these amazing, masterplaned, urban communities are extremely pedestrian-friendly. When you’re in Alys Beach, you feel like your in the Greek Isles with all the whitewall architectural design, the broken stone walkways, greenspaces, and other amazing amenities. The neighboring Rosemary Beach is also extremely special, with beautiful contemporary design properties that are reminiscent of a European coastal town. CNN recently named Rosemary Beach as one of America’s most romantic towns, and for good reason—you’re surrounded by amazing parks, greenspaces, restaurants, shopping centers, and other family entertainment venues. I strongly encourage you to come by Alys Beach and Rosemary Beach today, as all your coastal desires will come true.
