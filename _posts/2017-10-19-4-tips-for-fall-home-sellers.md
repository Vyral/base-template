The nice, crisp fall weather has a lot of people out looking for homes to buy. If you’re thinking about taking advantage of the fall market by selling, **here are a few tips that will help you make sure your home looks its best:**

**1. Have great curb appeal.**When a buyer pulls up to your house, you want them to be impressed. Make sure any mulch you have is fresh, the grass is cut, and any chipped or peeling paint is repainted.

**<br>2. Make sure the home is well-lit.** As the days get shorter, make sure the blinds are open, lamps are on, and you make a good impression with a bright, inviting home.

**3. Take it easy with the decorations.** Don’t go overboard. Keep in mind that you’re still trying to sell your home, so you don’t want to mask or cover up anything that buyers would want to see.

**4. Make things cozy and inviting.** With the weather getting cooler, make sure your home is nice, warm, and inviting. Bake some cookies or a pie to increase the appeal even more.
