<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Don’t fret: Here’s what to do if your offer on a home was rejected.</em></p>

Sometimes when you make an offer on a home, the seller won’t give you a counteroffer, your offer will be rejected instead. There are a few reasons why this may have happened, but **in most cases, the offer was likely too low.** In the market we’re in now, and houses are selling at 98% or higher of their list prices.&nbsp;

In this situation, you’ll need to increase your offer closer to the list price, and I recommend making a clean offer, meaning you reduce closing costs and shorten inspection periods. These things will give you a higher chance of having your next offer accepted.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about how to write a great offer or real estate in general, please call or email me. I would love to help you.
