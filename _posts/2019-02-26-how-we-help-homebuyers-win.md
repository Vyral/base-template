I’m coming to you today from New Orleans at a Keller Williams Family Reunion. I wanted to take the time today to share another story with you from when I was working with a buyer just a few days ago.

**This buyer was negotiating on a house and we decided it would be best to come in at the price they were willing to pay rather than come in really low and risk being rejected.** We came in at a nice, round number with what we considered to be a very strong offer. The listing agent got back to me and told me to tell my buyers that the owner was going to take their offer.

I didn't do that. Why? **From my experience in the past, talk is cheap in this business and if it isn’t in writing, it doesn’t mean anything.** So, guess what happened. The owner didn’t sign it. They countered the contract at a higher number that was way over than what my buyer was going to pay.&nbsp;

That’s when I came back to my buyer and told them what happened. We came back with our original number. The seller and their agent went missing for a few days, but I was able to convince them to keep the deal alive. They countered again at a number my buyers weren’t willing to pay.&nbsp;

**At this point, I went to the buyer and asked them what was more important to them: winning the game or winning the house?** They could take the risk and try to win both, but if they really wanted the house and the numbers were right, what the seller was asking was only a few extra dollars per month.&nbsp;

We finally got the contract accepted, moved right along with the inspection, and got our buyer in a great home that they love.

If you need help in a situation like this or you have any other real estate-related questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
