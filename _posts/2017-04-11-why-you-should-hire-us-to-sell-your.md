If you’re thinking about selling your house this year, you need to reach out to us. Allow me to explain why.

If you’re thinking about selling your house this year, you need to reach out to our company.

We do a lot of things to sell your house quickly and for top dollar, including our **VIP Seller Program.** This is a ‘coming soon’ type of program that markets your home to thousands of people before it even hits the market. Our average days on market has been cut in half simply because of this program.

It could be the difference in you needing to make an extra mortgage payment or two on your home while you sell, and that’s huge.

We also offer a 151-step marketing tool, which we’ll happily send you. Whether you’ve sold a home recently or not, you’d be surprised at all the things we do to sell your house for top dollar every time.

We’d also be happy to send you our 2016 resume. **We sold more than 200 homes last year, and we’re well on our way to 250 to 300 sales this year. **

When you sell your house, most agents will come out for a comparative market analysis (CMA) based on square footage, but it’s impossible to know the exact condition that every single home sold under. It could have been the result of a divorce, an estate sale, or a short sale, to name a few.

We do a full equity evaluation based on a market absorption sheet. We’ll look at everything that’s happened in the last 12 to 24 months to figure out where we need to be and what we need to do to sell your house for top dollar.

If you’re thinking about selling, it’s a must. Just give us a call or send us an email if you’re thinking about selling, we’d love to help.
