<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Discount points can be used to save you money on your mortgage payment long term. Here’s how they work.</em></p>

Discount points are a fee that you pay a lender in advance in return for a lower interest rate through the life of your mortgage. **These can equate to huge savings, but you always have to look at it in a cost versus benefit situation.**

If you plan to be in a home for longer than five to seven years, it might make sense to pay a little more at closing in order to save on your mortgage each month. **It’s all about whether saving money later or saving money now is a better idea.**

Discount points are going to lower your monthly payment, but they also have tax advantages. Be sure to check with your tax professional first, but discount points have been tax-deductible in the past.

**Here’s an example of how discount points work in action.** On a $200,000 loan at 4.5% interest, you will have a payment of about $1,013 (not including calculations for taxes, insurance, HOA, etc). If someone would have paid $1,000 in discount points at the time of closing on this home, their payment goes down to $983 and that $1,000 recoups after roughly 28 months. If you’re going to be in your home longer than five to seven years, buying discount points makes a lot of sense.

Unfortunately, discount points are not always avoidable. If you have a lower credit score, usually sub-600, your rates are going to be much higher than someone with a credit score above 660 because the lender is assuming more risk in funding your loan. Due to this, it is often hard to qualify someone with a lower credit score and these individuals must use discount points to buy their rate down to a point that they qualify for the loan at all.
