You may have noticed a lot of misleading headlines about home prices in the news right now, and unfortunately, there will be more to come. However, I’m here today to help you understand what's truly happening.&nbsp;

Take a look at the graph at 0:22 in the video above. It shows the 48-year average for monthly home price movement, including the last few years that weren’t normal. This shows what normally happens in a healthy housing market: **Home price growth starts slow at the beginning of the year then ramps up in the spring and into the beginning of summer, which is the peak homebuying season.** Then it cools off toward the end of the second half of the year.

What you don't see in the graph are any red bars indicating prices falling. As we move into the second half of the year, price growth is going to slow down. The problem comes when headlines get it wrong by saying prices are falling.&nbsp;
