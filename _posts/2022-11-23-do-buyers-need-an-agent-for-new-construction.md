Do you need an agent when buying a new-construction home? As the market has changed, this has become a very interesting topic again. We went from new home builders shooing agents away to now getting daily emails where they incentivize us to bring buyers. You should always have representation when you're purchasing a home, whether it's new construction or not. An agent will ensure that you're protected and that you understand all the next steps.

Salespeople for new construction homes work for the builder. Their job is to sell the home for the highest price possible and under the terms that are best for the builder. You want somebody who will help you understand and negotiate those terms. You’ll sometimes get a credit to use their lender, but then you'll pay for it in fees in other areas. You need an expert eye to look at traps like that.

The best part is that it doesn't cost you anything. **The house won't cost more, but you’ll get representation from a Realtor to help guide you through that process.** When it comes to price, incentives, credits, upgrades, solar, and more, we negotiate on your behalf to get you the best possible deal.&nbsp;

If you have any questions, reach out to us by phone or email. We’d love to be your real estate resource.
