An iBuyer is an instant buyer, either an individual or entity that will provide sellers with an instant cash offer for their home instead of listing the home in the traditional way. Zillow and Opendoor are examples of mainstream iBuyers.

iBuyers aren’t as big of a deal in our market since we don’t have the same appreciation as some larger markets like Raleigh and Atlanta. However,&nbsp;**there are still many people who don’t want to deal with all the moving parts of a traditional real estate transaction**—buyers, agents, inspections, showings—and they’re looking for the ‘easy button.’ iBuyers do provide speed and convenience to sellers, but you also won’t typically make as much money by selling to an iBuyer as you would selling on the market.

Don’t hesitate to reach out to us with any questions you have about iBuyers or real estate in general. We’ll be happy to talk to you.
