I’m very excited about some of the content that we’ll be providing you as we move forward. Back in 2006, we saw that the new construction industry was faltering—builders were going out of business, and the market was slow.

Now, however, new construction is taking off everywhere. In future videos, I’ll be taking you on a tour of some new-construction communities so that you can see what your options are as we progress in the market this year. To hear my full message, watch this short video.
