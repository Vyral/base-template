Homeowners ask me all the time which home improvement projects they should invest in. While there are many great options available, there are three high-tech investments we highly recommend taking on as your next upgrade.

{% include pullquote.html %}

These three investments will provide a great upgrade to your home, decrease your impact on the environment, and help you save money and energy.

1. **Solar panels.** This is a very popular upgrade, which should come as no surprise given their numerous benefits. Apart from increasing your property’s sustainability, solar panels also promote energy efficiency.   <br> 
2. **Smart thermostats**. This piece of technology can be easily incorporated into any home and is a simple, affordable addition. Capable of being set to a schedule or controlled remotely through a smartphone, smart thermostats regulate heating and cooling in your household with optimum efficiency. Beyond that, they can also be connected to other smart devices in your home.<br> 
3. **Smart locks.** With this intelligent addition, your doors will lock behind you automatically when you exit your home. And because smart locks can be operated remotely, you can lock and unlock your doors with ease, even when you aren’t home. For added security, you will also be notified of all activity, including any instance of someone else unlocking the door.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are wondering what other smart technology you should invest in, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
