When selling your home, you may be wondering what you should be looking for in a real estate agent or Realtor team. Today I’d like to provide you with some examples of the kinds of services and advantages that we provide to sellers so that you can better determine which features you need most.

1. **Economies of scale, resources, and expertise.** Our team works hard to leverage technology and the information we have available to us when working with our buyers. Because of this, we have a great sense of the trends in the market. In addition, we do customized staging on all of our listings so that we know exactly what to highlight in your home in order to tell its special story.

2. **High-quality online marketing.** All of our marketing is focused on our international buyers in China and India to reflect the buyer pool here in Silicon Valley.

3. **Negotiation tactics.** For us, it’s no surprise that our negotiation expertise, in conjunction with our knowledge of technology and marketing, ultimately nets our home sellers a higher price on their homes than our competitors.

If you have any other questions selling your property or finding the Realtor team that’s right for you, don’t hesitate to send me an email or give me a call. I’d be happy to help you!
