We’re back again with part two of our conversation with Kim Drury of Angel Properties. Today we’re continuing our discussion about long-term leasing as a strategy for your clients. **Here are a few more questions we had for Kim as well as her answers to them:**

*“What can I expect from a leasing agent?”*

At Angel Properties, Kim and her team like to sit down with the owners first and hash out their goals. They work specifically to fit those needs, whether they want to lease the property out full-time or part-time. They really focus on how they can maximize their net profit and how they can reduce the costs associated with the property’s maintenance. Then they write a lease specific to those needs.

Secondly, they are always present at every showing in order to vet the tenant and show the property as its intended to be shown. From there, it’s all about facilitating the lease and securing a strong tenant for the property owner. A lot of their property owners don’t live in Park City, so they’re experienced in how to help them be successful, even from afar.

*“What are the benefits of working with an agent who has a good marketing strategy?”*

Online marketing is a big strength of Angel Properties. They have a top-rated website that shows up on the first page of Google results. They’re also part of the Park City Board of Realtors, and they have great relationships with other Realtors, insurance companies, relocation companies, and more.

That’s all for part two, **but stay tuned for our next blog, which will cover part three of our conversation with Kim.** If you have any questions for her in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out and give her a call at (435) 640-6025.

If you have any other questions for me in the meantime, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you soon.
