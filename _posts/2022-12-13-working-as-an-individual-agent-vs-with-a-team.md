Are you new to the real estate industry? If so, congratulations\! This career has helped so many succeed and reach their dreams. Every new agent has to decide if they want to be an individual agent or work with a team, and there is no wrong answer for this; it’s just about what’s best for you. To help you make the decision, though, I am listing out some of the pros and cons of each option.&nbsp;

**One pro of being an individual agent is you get to be your own boss.** Most people get into real estate because they want financial benefits, flexibility, and freedom. You can get these things as an individual. However, this does mean that you’re doing everything by yourself, which can also be a downside.&nbsp;

Working on your own means you won’t have help with administrative work, printing business cards, setting up a website, figuring out your brand, etc. These things take time and money, so you have to be willing to sacrifice that. **You might be making more money per deal because you’re not sharing it with a team, but your deals are often few and far between**, especially at the beginning. Therefore, working on your own takes planning and task management.&nbsp;

One advantage of joining a team is that you get to plug into a system. Most teams will provide qualified leads for you, and you’ll even get connected with their past clients. Also, **with a team, you can focus more on your particular expertise, and a lot of the heavy lifting is taken care of for you.** Lastly, being on a team is a great way to learn; often, mentors can help you with difficult or tricky encounters.&nbsp;

Again, there’s no right or wrong answer for this; it’s about what’s best for your individual needs and goals. Just be mindful of these pros and cons. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out\! You can call or email me anytime, and I would love to hear from you.&nbsp;
