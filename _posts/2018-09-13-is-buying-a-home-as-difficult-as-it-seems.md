Buying a home in today’s real estate market isn’t as difficult as you might think. Here are some tips to make things easier for you.

We’ve been getting a number of questions about down payments, financing, and getting a mortgage in general. There seems to be a lot of misconceptions out there about the amount of money needed for a downpayment. **A lot of people think that it’s very difficult to get a mortgage in today’s market, but that’s really not true.**

Here in St. Cloud, there are quite a number of people utilizing the rural development loan program, which allows you to get a 30-year fixed rate mortgage with $0 down. FHA programs only require 3.5% down, and many times we can build closing costs right into the purchase price of the property. **In addition, there are plenty of grant programs out there that will assist buyers with their down payments.**

Another thing that is happening is that lending criteria has loosened up a little bit. If you have a good, stable job and good credit history, there should be no problem getting a mortgage right now while interest rates are still good.
