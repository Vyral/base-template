<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you’ve got questions about short-term rentals, this great website will likely have the answers.</em></p>

People ask me all the time about whether their property could be used as a short-term rental, and my response is always the same: Do your homework. There’s no one-size-fits-all answer to this question.&nbsp;

Thankfully, I recently stumbled across a new company, AirDNA, that does market data research on short-term rentals. In response to the lack of data available about short-term rentals, AirDNA has taken it upon themselves to fill this niche. **You can see a few examples of their studies on their website: [AirDNA.co.](https://www.airdna.co/){: target="_blank"}** It’s free to sign up, and there’s plenty of interesting data to be found there.&nbsp;

They scrape information from Airbnb properties, VRBO properties, and tens of thousands of others. One of their most recent studies revealed that this summer marked a saturation point for short-term rentals. In other words, the growth stage we were previously in has ended. Supply and demand in the short-term rental market have largely leveled out. Of course, y**ou can learn more specific details of this and other developments in the short-term rental market by checking out AirDNA’s reports.** It’s a great resource for anyone thinking of converting a property into a short-term rental.&nbsp;
