Today, our home advisor, CJ Longenecker, is sharing with us how she started her career in real estate and how she came to be a part of our team.&nbsp;

CJ Longenecker's career in real estate began in 2009 when an opportunity for administrative assistance presented itself. With a natural entrepreneurial spirit, she decided to give it a try and soon discovered a passion for helping individuals navigate the process of buying or selling their homes.

Over the course of a decade, CJ gained valuable experience in new construction with the company she worked for. Additionally, she took on administrative tasks and actively sought a path toward financial freedom for her company. Eventually, **she met the Dave Hooke team, and it felt like the perfect fit and like she had found her home.**

Now, she enjoys working with buyers and assisting with new construction, offering clients the chance to design a home they love, and continuing to work in the resale market. Helping clients find their perfect forever homes has been a dream come true for CJ, and they look forward to continuing their work and changing their family's future.
