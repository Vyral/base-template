What’s the latest news from the commercial real estate market in Columbus? Today I’ve brought in Jonathan Wiggit, one of our lead commercial real estate agents, to discuss this topic with me.

Jonathan is our most experienced commercial real estate agent, and he holds real estate licenses in both Ohio and California. When he first became an agent, he worked primarily in residential real estate. He worked in many multiple asset classes, but his background mainly centered on industrial offices and flex spaces. After joining the Rellis Group, he shifted his focus toward commercial real estate and transferred his skill set to working more with multi-family investment properties.

According to Jonathan, **buyers are being much more aggressive with their offers in the commercial real estate sector right now.** We’re seeing shorter inspections periods, non-refundable deposits, and people offering to pay their own home warranty.

If you’re a seller, having a trusted advisor by your side can really help with dealing with aggressive buyers. We’re seeing retail buildings selling for pennies on the dollar, so if you can recondition and repurpose those types of buildings into an apartment or a storage unit, you may be able to take the money from that investment and reinvest it into other properties.

Jonathan also says **we’re often seeing properties sell that have both a retail and residential component.** For some investors, this is an ideal investment because of the tax implications and the way the property can be structured.

If you have any further questions for Jonathan or you’d like to get in touch with him, you can call him at (614) 826-2189.

As always, if you have any other questions for me or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
