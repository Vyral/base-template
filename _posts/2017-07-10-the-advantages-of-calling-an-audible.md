Do you have the guts to call an audible?&nbsp;

We recently worked with a company that underwent a significant change from an enabling company culture to an empowering one.&nbsp;

The leadership had built some enabling habits over the years. Basically, leadership would run in and save the day, which really handcuffed those who had the authority—and responsibility—to solve the problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;

**One of the leaders decided that he had the guts to call an audible.** He had just lost one of his five direct reports to retirement. Instead of rushing out and hiring for that role, he called his team together, explained the situation, and asked them to come up with a solution.&nbsp;

He realized that maybe their solution would be to hire for the role, but he didn’t want to assume that would be the only option.&nbsp;

A week went by and when the team came back to him, he was thrilled with the solution they came up with. They had rewritten their job descriptions to absorb the responsibilities of that position. As a result, this leader had more engaged and fulfilled employees, a more efficient team, and fewer payroll costs.&nbsp;

**Calling an audible means that you’re going to allow those closest to the problem to solve it.** Their line of sight can be very different from yours, and they may be able to see a solution that you would miss. That is what calling an audible is all about.&nbsp;
