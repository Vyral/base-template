<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We’re in the home stretch of 2019, and I wanted to make sure you knew about a few things heading into the new year that will benefit both of us.</em></p>

Today I want to talk to you about three things—first, a quick update on the Albany real estate market.&nbsp;

Thanksgiving has passed, and we’re in the winter doldrums. **If you’re thinking about selling in the spring, now is the time to get your ducks in a row to hit the ground running in 2020.** We’re still seeing good activity in certain price points and areas. Reach out if you want some more information about what’s going on in your neighborhood.

Second, I want to thank all of you who came out to our client appreciation day. We had a blast seeing all of you, loved getting to dress up, and enjoyed giving out all those pies. **If you couldn’t make it this year, make sure you mark it on your calendars next year\!**

Finally, I just got back from the city where I had a great meeting with Ryan Serhant from Million Dollar Listing. We spent some time talking about real estate and marketing, and he’s just an amazing, humble guy. **I’ve got some great ideas that I’m going to bring back to my business.**

Christmas is almost here and it has come to my attention that a lot of people are struggling. We never know what people have going on in their lives, but I see it all the time. In the spirit of giving back this year, **I want you to know if you or someone you know is going through a hardship like an illness or divorce and that’s forcing you to sell your house, I will sell the house for free for one of you.** How’s that for a Christmas gift?

If you have any questions for me about the market or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
