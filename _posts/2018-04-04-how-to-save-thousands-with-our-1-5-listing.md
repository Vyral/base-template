How can you save thousands of dollars when you list your home with Select Premier Properties?

We take pride in offering the 1.5% listing. How does that work?

When listing a home for sale, most agencies will charge you between 5% and 6% for commission. That 5% to 6% is then divided between the agency that represents the seller, the listing agency, and the agency that represents the buyer. Each agency will receive between 2.5% to 3%.

**When listing with us, you will only pay 3.5% to 4% total—you decide.**We keep 1.5% and the buyer gets the remaining 2% to 2.5%, which saves you thousands of dollars no matter the price of your home.

Let’s face it—when you hire an agency that charges 5% or 6%, you’re lucky if you get professional photography. You’re even luckier if your agent does a few open houses. &nbsp;

**Here at Select Premier Properties, we know that it takes more than posting a home on the MLS and hosting a few open houses to sell a home for top dollar.** Our extensive marketing plan gets every listing maximum exposure.

We offer pre-listing marketing, professional photos, aerial drone videos, a property website, social media marketing to targeted buyers, exclusive open houses just for the neighbors, mega open houses with 50 to 100 signs to drive tons of traffic, “Coming Soon” mailers, and much more.

If you would like to learn more about how we can help you sell quickly and for top dollar while saving you thousands, just give us a call. We’ll go over a comparable market analysis, a marketing plan tailored for your home, and a net sheet to show you how much you’ll profit and save with our services.

They say that you get what you pay for, but in this case, they were wrong. We look forward to hearing from you and selling your home for top dollar!
