After 19 years of working under RE/MAX International, the Wicker Homes Group has moved over to Keller Williams! We realized there was a bigger opportunity at Keller Williams after researching the company extensively. Here’s what they offer us that no one else could:

They know teams. They, literally, wrote a book on it 20 years ago. They are the leader in real estate teams. This is crucial for our team’s growth.

They’re number one in real estate training. Compared to other companies in different industries internationally, they are a prominent leader in employee training. In fact, they earned this title in 2015. For the past five years, they’ve been in the top five.

They know how to recruit effectively. We want to make sure every position on our team is filled with someone who is passionate and talented enough to serve our clients.

We made this move because we ultimately want to serve our clients to the best of our ability. This means having the best tools and resources out there! We’ve been thrilled with our transition so far.

If you’re thinking about buying or selling your Virginia home, give us a call or send us an email. We’d be happy to answer your questions about this topic or more!
