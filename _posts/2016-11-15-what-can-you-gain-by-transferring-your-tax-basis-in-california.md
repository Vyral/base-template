There are some important benefits of rolling your current tax basis in the state of California to a replacement property if you’re over 55 years old.

<br>The reason this is beneficial is that a lot of people who are 55 and older have owned their home for 15 years or longer, so you’re paying a much lower property tax bill than you would if you bought your house today because the value has gone up so much.

<br>There are two propositions you can follow to do this: Prop 60 and Prop 90. Prop 60 is for inter-county transfer, meaning if you live in Orange County, you’re staying in Orange County. Prop 90 is if you’re planning on transferring to a county outside of Orange County. Keep in mind, though, that there are only 13 counties in the state of California that allow you to transfer your property tax base from Orange County to theirs.

<br>Some of the rules that must be followed in order to qualify for this initiative include:

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;You or your spouse must be 55 or older at the time in which the current residence is sold.<br>** &nbsp; &nbsp;The transfer must be done from a primary residence to another primary residence.** For example, you can’t take your tax basis from a primary residence and move it into an investment property.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;**You must sell your house and purchase the next house within a two-year time frame.** If, for example, you sell your house and want to tour the world for a year, you totally can. You just have to make sure you do it within the remaining time frame, and the next property you buy is of equal or lesser value. If you make the purchase after a year, you actually get a 5% bonus. If you sell your house for $1 million, you can buy the next property for $1,050,000. If you wait two years to buy your next property, you get a 10% bonus. Sell for $1 million and you can buy the next property for $1.1 million. The lone caveat is that the price of the next house is based on the assessor’s value, not the actual purchase price. Most of the time, the tax assessor takes the most recent sale as the face value for the property taxes.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;This is a one-time transfer only. You can’t execute it multiple times after you’ve hit 55.
