Today, I’d like to bring you just a few messages. First of all, my team and I would like to extend our sincere thanks to everyone who joined us at our recent client appreciation event. **We collected almost 200 toys for the Cool Kids Foundation thanks to your participation.**

The second message I wanted to share with you has to do with our current real estate market. The spring real estate market in Maryland has been very busy.

With more hours of daylight than in the previous months, people have more time to spend out looking at homes. This allows buyers to visit listings during the week, instead of just on the weekends. As a result, homes stay on the market for shorter amounts of time.

Finally, there’s one more thing I want to let you all know about. **My team and I will be hosting a March Madness giveaway.** The person whose bracket gains them the highest points will become our lucky winner, so be sure to get in touch with me about how to enter.

If you have any other questions or would like more information about anything I’ve gone over today, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
