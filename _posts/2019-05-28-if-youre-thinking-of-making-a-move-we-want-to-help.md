Having spent more than 18 years in the real estate industry, our team knows that making a move can be very stressful. We’d like to make this important step in your life go more smoothly by not only helping to guide you through the market but also listing your property as a certified pre-owned home.

**Our team sends you through the inspection and appraisal process before your home ever goes live on the market.** This will prevent certain issues from sinking your sale once you’ve got a buyer on the line.

Along with these preliminary steps, our team also implements a “coming soon” marketing program that helps to build buyer interest in your property before it’s listed.&nbsp;

We know that when homes are priced correctly, in good condition, and are marketed well, they sell quickly and for top dollar. **When you’re ready to make a move, give us a call or send us an email.** We look forward to helping you sell for the most money, in the least time, and with as little hassle as possible.
