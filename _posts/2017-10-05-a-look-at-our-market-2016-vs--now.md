Today I want to bring you a quick look at how our market is faring right now. So, what’s been going on recently?
{: .present-before-paste}

Over the summer, home sales continued to soar. **Sales are up 14% compared to this time last year, and home prices have gone up as well.**

According to [chandlerreports.com](http://www.chandlerreports.com/Site/Default.asp), home prices have actually risen by 6%, though specific prices will vary slightly depending on your specific subdivision. You can look at [how things differ depending on municipality here.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/Melissa+Thompson/Blog+Attachments/municipalities.jpg)

Another notable statistic is the rise of overall home sales, which have increased by 21%. Additionally, **home sales over $500,000 are up 28%.&nbsp;**Home sales over $1 million, though, are the same as they were in 2016.

Two other things that haven’t changed much are interest rates and inventory.
