There are a ton of ways to succeed when selling your home, but there are even more ways that you can fail. For this reason, today I want to share three major mistakes you need to avoid when listing your home.

{% include pullquote.html %}

1. **Asking too much.** No one wants to take any money off the table, and our job as agents is to net you as much as possible. However, listing your home at a price that’s too high will actually damage your chances of a successful transaction. Not only will the high sticker price deter buyers, you’ll also miss out on buyers who look at your home as being outside of their price range. Overpricing your home will actually net you way less money. So stay within the range of your comparable properties. A high price can cause a home to sit on the market for a long time, which is never a good thing.

2. **Advertising too little.** Most agents don’t understand how to market. They merely put a sign in the ground, list your home, and hope it will sell. A lot of agents also don’t use quality photography to advertise their listings. If you go onto Zillow or Trulia right now, you will see a ton of home photos that have been taken from an agent’s cell phone. Working with the right agent, one who knows how to market and present your home, is going to be key to your success. Before you work with an agent, ask to see their marketing plan ahead of time. This way, you know exactly what to expect and can hold the agent accountable.

3. **Not making your home presentable.** Clutter can prevent a buyer from seeing themselves in your home. If closets are full, corners are blocked, and countertops are overflowing, all the buyer will be able to think about is your life in the home. They won’t be able to envision themselves or their belongings in your home. Make sure you always properly declutter, clean, and stage your home. Quality photos will draw a buyer in, but a truly well-presented home will help seal the deal.

Avoiding these mistakes will definitely boost your chance of success. Staging, marketing, and pricing are all key to selling your home. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
