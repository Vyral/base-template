As we head into spring, more and more people start to think about buying a new home in 2018. One of the main decisions buyers have to make is whether to buy a new construction property or a resale home.

If you do decide to purchase a new home, you should still hire a Realtor. A Realtor could save you a ton of time and money no matter what kind of home you decide to buy, and there are three main reasons why:

**1. Searches:** Nowadays, a lot of buyers can search for homes on sites like Realtor.com or Trulia. However, there are certain nuances to the searches that we Realtors can set up for you in the MLS to save you some time and find more specific results to get you to your goal a whole lot quicker.

**2. Making decisions:** When you buy a new home, you typically go to the design center and pick out the options you want to include in your house. An experienced Realtor can help you navigate some options you might not have considered in order to help you shape your lifestyle in your home. Those options can also influence the appraisal when you close.

**3. Negotiations:**If you went to an auction, it would be helpful to take someone with you who really knows what they were doing. They can tell you win to bid, how to bid, and how to get you the best price on whatever it is you want. Working with an experienced Realtor is like that. We can give you knowledgeable advice on how to play it and how to best get what you really want for your money.

As you can see, working with a Realtor can be very beneficial to homebuyers, even if they are buying a new construction property.
