We’re expecting 2020 to bring us more of a balanced market, as we’re already seeing some inventory levels rise and more sellers prepare their homes for sale—more so than last year at this time.&nbsp;

There’s been three straight years of a low inventory market, but with the amount of sellers that we’re seeing prepare for this year’s spring, things may be slightly different.&nbsp;

The prediction for 2020 (especially as we were heading into the 2019 holidays) was that there would be higher sales and lower interest rates. Of course, economic conditions always play a factor, so we can never be certain, but so far **low rates and higher sales remain in the forecast.&nbsp;**

The most active price points are always the entry-level homes. Whether it’s townhomes or single-family homes, this bracket sells quickly; it’s our lowest inventory product, so prices continue to rise.&nbsp;

We’re also going to see a continuance of seniors moving into one-level living situations, though there are fewer one-level spaces available at an affordable price.

Overall, we expect 2020 to be a strong, positive year; we’re excited to see how everything goes. We hope you have a great start to the new year and, as always, reach out to us if you have any questions. We would love to help you.&nbsp;
