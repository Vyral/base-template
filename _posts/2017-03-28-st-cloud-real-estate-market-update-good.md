There's good news all over the St. Cloud real estate market as we head into spring.

 As of right now, there are 717 homes on the market, which is great for anyone looking to buy a home because it's up substantially from the 650 we had just a couple weeks ago. If you're selling your home, it's a less competitive market and it's a good year to be a seller again.

 As of the first week of March, we had 286 home sales waiting to close that went under contract in the last 60 to 90 days. At this time of the year, that's a really good start. I think it's due to the great mortgage interest rates and the warm weather we've had lately. **The spring market started early.**

 It's a really good time to be in the market either as a buyer or a seller. If you'd like any additional information, give us a call or send us an email. **We look forward to helping you in this great market.**
