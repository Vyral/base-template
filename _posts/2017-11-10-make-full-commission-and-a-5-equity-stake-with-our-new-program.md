Neal Bros Home Renovations is offering a full commission for any agent who brings us a pre-MLS or off-market property that fits the criteria of homes we’re looking to buy and renovate.

I**f you bring us a property, we’ll pay you a full commission up front and give you a 5% equity stake in the home’s renovation.&nbsp;**We wanted to offer agents an easy, no-hassle way to make a transaction and get into the home renovation business, and this program fits that description.

Jim Bell is the first agent to participate in this program. He was able to make a quick and easy 3% commission on the sale of the property we’re standing in front of in the video above, and he’ll also be able to make 5% of the profits once we renovate and sell it.

Jim was working with a client on the purchase of a condo, and she mentioned to him that she had a property that needed quite a bit of repair. She was looking for a quick, easy sell and didn’t like the idea of putting it on the market, so Jim set up an appointment between us and his client and we were able to come up with an agreeable sale price.

**It was a win-win for all parties involved.&nbsp;**If you want to be the next agent to take advantage of this new program we’re offering or you have any questions about how it works, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to speak with you.
