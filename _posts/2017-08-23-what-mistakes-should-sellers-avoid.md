When people are preparing their homes for sale, there are a lot of things that can go wrong. Today, I’ll be going over five of the biggest and most common mistakes people tend to make during this process.

It’s no secret that preparing your home for the market can be stressful. However, knowing how to avoid mistakes before you make them will make a huge difference.

The first common mistake we see is overpricing. **A correctly priced house, even one with a poor marketing plan, will always sell above one that is overpriced.**

Next, don’t wait until after you list to make necessary, simple repairs around the property. Trying to fix these things once a home is already on the market will make things much more stressful than they should be.

Another common mistake is forgetting to declutter. Your home **should be a clean, open space that buyers can imagine themselves living in.**If clutter appears in photos of your home, many buyers won’t even bother coming to a showing. Clearing your space can be as simple as packing a few boxes and storing them in a garage or storage POD.

On the subject of showings, not allowing buyers adequate access is the fourth common mistake I see sellers make. If you aren’t flexible with availability during the showing process, buyers may not want to deal with the hassle of rescheduling.

Your home should be show-ready at all times. In fact, if your home is shown correctly this shouldn’t become an issue for you or your schedule. A well-shown home is more likely to sell.

Finally, remember not to get too emotional about the house. It’s understandable to feel attached to your home; however, **when you put it on the market you need to think of it as property rather than as your home.** In fact, you should start thinking of it as someone else’s home.

If someone wants to remodel or gives you a low offer, try not to be offended. Approach the transaction from a practical point of view.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
