Are you looking to sell your home this summer? While we're still in a strong seller's market, there's a noticeable gap between homes ready for the market and those that aren't. If you want your home to stand out, making it as attractive and ready for potential buyers as possible is key.

It's proven that more showings lead to faster sales and potentially higher prices. Here are three ways to get your house ready for the summer:

**1\. Take Care of Minor Repairs.** Buyers' top concerns right now are higher interest rates and affordability. They want to put as much money down as possible to secure the lowest monthly payment. By taking care of minor repairs upfront, you'll make your home more appealing to buyers, who may be willing to pay a premium for a move-in-ready property.

**2\. Do Some Staging.** Think about the ideal model home: clean, standardized, and impersonal. Aim to make your home as close to this image as possible. Remove personalized touches, such as unique furniture and family photos, so buyers can envision themselves living there. Packing away personal items also makes your move easier.

**3\. Have a Plan for Children and Pets.** Showings won't go smoothly if children and pets are running around. Work with your agent to create a showing schedule with specific time blocks. Consider putting dogs in kennels during showings to keep the house in pristine condition. Although it might be a bit of work, it's worth it to present your home in the best light.

If you need a detailed showing plan or a list of repairs to make before listing your home, don't hesitate to call or email us. We'd love to help you navigate this market and make your home selling process a success.<br>
