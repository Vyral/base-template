Today, we’ll be examining whether it’s better to sell or to rent your property out once you move on to a new home.

If you’ve been thinking of moving, you may be wondering whether it’s better to sell your current property or to simply start renting it out once you’re in your new home. Today, we’ll go over a few points that may help you decide.&nbsp;

First of all, you may be interested to know that the average listing today spends less than 42 days on the market. In other words, **homes are moving quickly and it’s still a great time to sell quickly and for top dollar.**

That said, it is also a good time to rent your home out. Rental rates have increased significantly and will continue to do so into the future. **If you’re looking to build another year or two of equity in your home, renting can be a fantastic option.**

Whichever option you choose, our team would be happy to help guide you. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
