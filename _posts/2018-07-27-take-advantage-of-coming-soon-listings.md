Whether you’re a buyer or seller, today’s update will let you know what changes are occurring in today’s market. **Certain trends allow buyers to be more competitive and sellers to get their homes sold faster.**

The market is still active, but it’s still a hot seller’s market. Inventory may be filling up a little bit, but it’s still a great time to sell.

If there aren’t “For Sale” signs in a yard, that means that the seller isn’t quite ready to put it on the market. **We’ve begun putting “Coming Soon” signs in those yards, and we’ve found that those homes are selling before they even hit the market.** We sold one of these listings just last night, in fact. Just last Friday, we had a Coming Soon listing that sold for $5,000 over the list price.

At any given time, we have about 20 or 30 homes that are being prepared for sale, but aren’t yet on the market. **The sellers allow us to show those homes, which is great for them as sellers and also for prospective buyers.**

Nevertheless, I still find that it’s very important for a seller to have their home in immaculate condition. **Homes in great condition show very well on online listings, which helps the home sell quickly.**

If you’re a buyer who can’t find a home you like online, contact us. We can give you access to a number of off-market homes that others won’t be able to find. Also, interest rates are still low so it’s still a good time to buy.

If you have any questions or are looking to buy or sell a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. It’s a great market for buyers and sellers, and we want you to be able to take advantage of it.
