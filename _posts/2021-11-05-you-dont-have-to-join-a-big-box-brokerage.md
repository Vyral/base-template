If you’re a newer agent or a brand-new agent who is interviewing brokers and trying to find the best fit, I have a piece of advice for you: **Don’t overlook the independent family-owned companies like ours.&nbsp;**

{% include pullquote.html %}

I have agents right now who are absolutely thriving in this marketplace. Some of my newer agents are my best agents. I have a 26-year-old who joined in January and already has 23 sales under their belt. Another agent who joined us two months ago already has three pending sales and is working on their fourth by the end of this week.

The only reason I’m telling you this is because I think there’s this perception out there that you need to sign with one of the big-box brokerages to have a successful career. **That’s just not true.** Our team is growing, we have leads, we have opportunities, and we have everything you need to build a successful real estate business.

If you’re thinking about a career in real estate or are looking for a brokerage to interview with, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I’d love to hear from you and have a conversation about how we can take your career to the next level.
