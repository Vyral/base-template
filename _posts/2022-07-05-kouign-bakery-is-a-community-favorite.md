Welcome back to our local business spotlight. Today I’m excited to showcase Kouign Bakery here in Wallingford, Connecticut. Kouign might be delicious enough to be one of the top three bakeries in the state, but I’ll leave that up to you to decide.

When you first walk through the doors, the scent of fresh-baked goods hits you immediately. They serve up some excellent items like croissants, danishes, scones, muffins, cookies, and cakes. **Not only do their pastries look and smell good, but they taste fantastic as well.** You can stop in and have a cup of coffee with your pastry or take it to go. If you’re going to stop by on the weekend, however, be sure to get here early—there’s often a line out the door.

Every day, you can find the owner of Kouign, Chelsea Tripp, hard at work behind the counter. Chelsea’s dad was a chef, inspiring her to attend the Culinary Institute of America. She likes baking because it’s an intricate, time-consuming process, but it feels so good when a product comes out of the oven looking perfect.&nbsp;

Though she and her family weren’t sure how well Wallingford would respond to another bakery, they were pleasantly surprised to learn how willing people were to support local small businesses. She thought she might have a few returning customers, but **she didn’t expect such an outpouring of support.**

If you know of a local small business that could benefit from a moment in our business spotlight or have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to hear from you.
