Are you ready to sell your house? If so, one of the most important steps you need to take is to price it at today's market value. The housing market is not as competitive as it was a couple of years ago; however, that doesn't mean you've missed your chance to sell your house. You just need an expert partner to help you price your house based on the current market.

**By pricing your house at today's market value, you can attract more buyers, maximize your return** and sell as quickly as possible. On the other hand, overpricing can limit your buyer pool and leave your house sitting on the market for a long time, while underpricing can make buyers wonder if there is something wrong with your property.

If you want to win when you sell your house, it needs to be priced at today's market value. For example, just a month ago, we put a home on the market for the perfect price. The following day, we had 87 showings. The next day, we received 11 offers, four of them cash, and the home will close 20% over what we listed it for. That's the power of correct pricing and marketing.&nbsp;

Let's work together to find the right price for your house. If you have any questions about your selling or buying plans, call or email me anytime. I’m always happy to hear from you.&nbsp;
