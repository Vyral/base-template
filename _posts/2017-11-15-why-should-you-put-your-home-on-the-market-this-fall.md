Should you sell your home this fall or wait until the spring market?

There are actually a few reasons why now may be the perfect time to put your home on the market.

**1. Buyer demand will continue to be strong in our market.** We are in one of the strongest markets we’ve ever seen. We are starting to see a slight increase in inventory but you will still face less competition at this time of year. Buyers are out in force right now. They are serious about buying a home. The average house sells in less than 30 days, so why wait to sell yours?

**2. There is less competition on the market this time of year.** We have seen a slight increase in inventory recently, but it’s nothing compared to the spring market. Most people wait to put their house on the market in the spring, even if they aren’t serious about selling their house. Right now, we have just over one month of supply. A normal market has a six month supply. We are in a strong seller’s market, so there’s no reason to wait.

**3. There will never be a better time to move up.** Nationally, prices are expected to appreciate by 5%. Our metro area has been outpacing the national numbers for some time, so homes should appreciate well above 5% in the next year. If you wait six months to sell your current home, you will have to pay more for that next house. You will have to pay more interest over time and it will be harder to qualify for that house. Why not get in now instead of paying a higher price? If you’re going to move and purchase another home, now is the perfect time to sell and take advantage of that lower price.

**4. Life is simply happening.** If you have no reason to move, then why not wait? You don’t need to sell just for the sake of testing the market. Maybe you have a new job, or you need a smaller or bigger house. But if there is a catalyst in your life that causes you to move, there is no reason to wait. We are definitely selling houses this fall.

As you can see, this fall would be a great time to sell your home. If you have any questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
