Today I’ll share an interview that demonstrates my best practices with virtual assistants so that you understand the many ways they can improve your own business.

**What is a virtual assistant?**<br>&nbsp;<br>In today’s technological age, we are now able to hire staff who can provide your team with administrative assistance remotely from a home office. Even if you don’t have enough space in your office to take on a new supporting role, it doesn’t matter with a virtual assistant—they might not even be from the same state\! They can do anything that an in-person assistant could do, except maybe providing coffee.

**In the video above, you can listen to my interview with Lou, a virtual assistant himself, to get a measure of my best practices with virtual assistants and learn the many ways in which they can improve your business.<br>&nbsp;**<br>If you have any questions about virtual assistants or about improving your business, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.
