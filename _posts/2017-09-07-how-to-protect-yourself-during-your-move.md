Whether you are moving across the city or to a different state, there are a few things you should do to protect yourself during your move.

**First of all, make sure you do your research.** Proper preparation can help you ward off many of the issues that can turn a move into a nightmare. The process really starts with a healthy dose of research. You should ask for a referral rather than risk working with the unknown.

Always watch out for moving scams. According to MSN, [MovingScam.com](https://www.movingscam.com/) maintains a blacklist of scams, as well as a message board with customer stories of the good, the bad, and the ugly.

Keep in mind that interstate movers must be licensed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. You can also check with the Better Business Bureau to see if any complaints have been filed and if the company is reliable.

**You also want to watch out for lowball bids.** When it comes to moving, you get what you pay for. In order to protect yourself, get several estimates and make sure to weed out any that seem too low. The desire to save money may be strong, but an unusually low bid is often a red flag.

When you shop for movers, it’s really best to get at least three estimates. If you get one that’s really low, then you know something is probably up. It’s better to go ahead and eliminate that one.

Next, it’s necessary to have a contingency plan. No matter how well prepared you are, the unexpected can still happen. What happens if the truck doesn’t show up on time? Are you prepared to live without your things for a few days or even longer? Just in case, pack a bag of essentials that you can have with you until you are successfully moved into your new home.

**Finally, pay a little extra for peace of mind.** According to the Better Business Bureau, it’s definitely worth it to accept full value protection. It may cost you a little more up front but it can eliminate a lot of headaches after you move.

Full replacement value protection means that any lost or damaged items will be repaired or replaced, or you will get a cash settlement at current market value no matter the age of the item. Full value protection must be included in the initial estimate in order for you to use it in an interstate move.
