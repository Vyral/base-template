<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s my answer when someone asks me if it’s the right time to sell.</em></p>

I’ve been hearing this question a lot lately from homeowners: “Sarita, it’s almost winter. Is it still a good time to sell my house?”

**The answer is an unequivocal YES\!, but let me explain.** Normally, we would expect to see some seasonality in the market around this time of year, with things sort of tapering off until the spring because of more rain, shorter days, etc.&nbsp;

This year, things have changed. **Due to the initial COVID lockdown, our spring market was nonexistent.** Our spring sellers became summer sellers and summer sellers became fall sellers. With more and more people working from home, more buyers are able to be flexible about seeing homes during the day.

**The No. 1 reason to sell now is our low inventory.** You have such little competition that you’ll likely receive multiple offers, even if you price on the higher side of your market value. There are holes in the market that we can exploit by listing the right home when there’s little competition. When the market is behaving like it is now, quick, profitable sales are the rule, not the exception.

If you have any questions at all about the market or your situation, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
