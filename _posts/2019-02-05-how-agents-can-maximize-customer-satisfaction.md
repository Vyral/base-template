By keeping a gold standard across the board, you’ll keep customers happy. Here’s how.

The business of real estate can be an incredibly busy one—there’s often not enough time in the day for us, as agents, to meet with each and every client. **So how can we keep their satisfaction high when we simply can’t meet with them all?**

When I first got into real estate, I handled absolutely everything you can imagine in the business. I dealt with brokerage management, listing photography, lead prospecting, home showings and listings, and so on. But as a jack-of-all-trades, I never felt like I was truly doing my best in any of these areas.&nbsp;

As our sales (and our team) grew and grew, we had to create specialized roles in order to keep up. Instead of juggling every facet of the job, I actually had to remove myself from various positions and allow others to handle them.&nbsp;

Part of my job now is to focus on marketing, accounting, and finance, so I don’t always have the opportunity to meet with all of our clients. **But those who do meet with them provide the same exceptional standard of service that customers expect from the Dave Hooke Team.** Customers don’t just want you—they want the standard you represent.

As long as we can create and uphold a standard among our team, client satisfaction remains high. But we must ensure that the client is clear about what is going on. **There’s nothing worse than a bait and switch**—they expect to be meeting with you but are instead met by someone else. To avoid false pretenses, we always have an in-depth review of our process and how our team works. If they’re uncertain, we always make it known that they can speak with other Realtors before making a decision.
