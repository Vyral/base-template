<p style="text-align: center;"><em>There are three main areas of your home’s design you need to focus on if you want to stay on trend in our market right now.</em></p>

What do the color of your cabinets, the paint on your walls, and the popular television channel HGTV have to do with selling your home? Actually, more than you may think. Staying on top of the latest design trends can make a big difference in your home’s value, which is why, today, we’re going to offer a breakdown of what’s “in” in 2019.&nbsp;

There are three main areas you need to focus on if you want your home to be on trend right now:

**1. The color of your kitchen cabinets.** Dark cabinets may be beautiful, but they just aren’t trendy. If your cabinets happen to be sporting a heavy hue, you may want to hire a professional painter before you sell. Having your cabinets repainted to white or gray will have a huge impact on how buyers see your home.

**2. The color of your walls.** White, cream, light blue, and light gray are all popular color choices right now. According to Zillow, homes with “on-trend” wall colors sell for $1,809 more on average.&nbsp;

**3. The shiplap effect.** “Shiplap” is a particular type of wooden board commonly used in coastal design trends. If you’re a fan of Chip and Joanna Gaines, you’ve almost certainly seen them implement this feature into homes they’ve worked on. Adding shiplap on a focal wall can really create a “wow” factor within your home.
