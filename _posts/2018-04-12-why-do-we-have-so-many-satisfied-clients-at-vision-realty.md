I’ve had some great clients over the years who I’ve been able to help buy, sell, and invest in real estate. I wanted you to hear from them about what their experience working with us was like. **Here are their stories:**

*“I’ve been working with Vision Realty for the last couple of years. They sold a couple of properties for us and we were very pleased with the job. They have been really patient with us. We actually got some extra cash that we weren't’ expecting. I highly recommend them.”* - **Reina**

*“I am going to give you a few reasons why I love Don Payne and why you should love him too. If you’ve got a house for sale, this is your guy. I think we all remember when things got really tough and the economy crashed. It was a tough time for a lot of people. I lost my career and I was in a bad place. I had this beautiful home that needed to be sold and needed to be sold quick. Really quick. Luckily, I knew someone who knew Don, and they gave me a great referral. Don came out, took a look at the place, told me what I needed to do, and before I knew it, my house was sold immediately at a very, very good price. I got great service from Don. He was honest, he was forthright, and he didn’t lead me to any unreasonable expectations. I knew about everything that was happening at the time it was happening and what to expect, the good and the bad. I couldn’t give a stronger referral. My next house will sell with him, and I will buy my next house with him. If you’re looking for someone great that you can trust and who has a world behind them and a ton of testimony behind him, he’s your guy.”* -**Kim**

If you’re looking to buy or sell real estate, don't hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
