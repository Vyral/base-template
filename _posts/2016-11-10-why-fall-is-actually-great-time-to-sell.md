The number one question I get from potential sellers this time of year is, "Should I list my home?" It's a very good question from sellers who are considering selling in the fall but aren't sure about the time of year. A lot of sellers want to wait until spring because they believe it's a better time to sell.

If we look at inventory levels over the year, spring has the highest level of inventory and the most homes sold. However, if we look at the number of homes sold versus the number of homes on the market, both fall and winter are very good times to sell. If you wait until spring, you're just like everyone else waiting until spring. When that spring market comes around, there is a lot of competition on the market.

You have to look at your own personal situation and decide what works best for you. The best thing about the fall market is that there is less inventory, so there is less competition. Also remember that if you're selling in the wintertime, you want to have someone come out and take photographs of your home ahead of time so you don't have to worry about it in the winter. You don't want snow on the ground in your photos, but you do want the beautiful leaves and colors that you can get this time of year.

Timing the housing market is just like timing the financial marketâ€“usually it doesn't work. Buying low and selling high is not something most people can do outside of a few professionals who do it day in and day out. The same goes for housing, which is why you really need to look at what works best for your situation. If now is the time to do that, know that during this time of the year, you'll be facing less competition.

 The other good thing about selling this time of year is that the buyers out looking right now are much more serious buyers. In the spring market, we get a lot of buyers out kicking tires, so you get a higher quantity of showings, but not as high of quality of showings like you do this time of year.

It's a good time to put your house on the market not just because of the decreased competition, but also because the numbers show that houses sell for a very good price.

If you have any questions about buying or selling a home this time of year or you're not sure whether your situation merits looking into selling in the fall, give me a call or send me an email. I'd love to help you!
