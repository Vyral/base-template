It’s finally happening; supply is beginning to increase. Our market has been defined by record-low supply for years, so what does an increase in housing inventory mean for our future? Let’s talk about it.&nbsp;

We can’t talk about this topic without discussing rising interest rates. Rates have increased faster than we initially expected, causing demand to slow slightly. As a result, homes are staying on the market longer, and inventory is gradually starting to increase.

This is great news for buyers since they’ll have more opportunities. However, **sellers need to be prepared for more competition.** This means they’ll need exceptional marketing to bring in both local and out-of-town buyers.

As inventory increases, contingent offers from buyers will be the norm. **Home inspections will become more common, but you can get ready by having a pre-listing inspection.** We encouraged our sellers to do this even before the market shift, but it’s especially important now.&nbsp;

Before, getting a pre-listing inspection and staging your home were considered extra things you could do to get the most money out of your sale. Now, they’re practically essential. If you have questions about what you should do to get ready for this market, give us a call at (209) 321-0916 or visit our website. We look forward to hearing from you\!
