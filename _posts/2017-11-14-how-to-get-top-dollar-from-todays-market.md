If you want top dollar in today’s seller’s market, price your home according to market conditions.

Today I’m excited to share with you some advice about how sellers can price their homes properly in a seller’s market.

One of the things we’re seeing in the marketplace today is that **it is absolutely a seller’s market.**

However, I want to illustrate why I believe that it’s a seller’s market that is kind of being held up on stilts. What I mean by that is that **we’re not in a market where you can just throw any price on a house and expect it to sell.**

We’re in a market where you’ve got to **price your house according to the market conditions.** By doing this, you’re increasing the demand for the house. Buyers will want your house because **the market is currently low on inventory of houses that are priced correctly, in good condition, and move-in ready.** Meeting these criteria will increase the net money in your pocket.

Something we’ve observed in the marketplace is **a number of homes that are being priced a little too aggressively.** Both Realtors and sellers are thinking the market is a little stronger than it truly is.

What we want for all of our clients is for you to be able to get top dollar for your house in as little time as possible, and for you to put as much money in your pocket as you can. To do that, you need to work with a real estate professional who will sit down, analyze the numbers with you, come to an agreement on what price the market is positioning your home for, and list your home accordingly.

If you have any questions, just reach out to us and let us know what we can do to help you with your situation. If you have a topic that you’d like us to cover, send it to us, and we would love to address it for you.
