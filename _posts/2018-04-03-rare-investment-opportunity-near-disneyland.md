Today I’m excited to give you a video tour of Mickey’s Retreat, our newest listing in Anaheim, California. This 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom home is a perfect family home.

**You’ll love the custom built-in entertainment center, as well as the beautiful, open kitchen.** Any home chef would love to cook here day in and day out.

The master bedroom features a king-size bed, great color scheme, and walk-in closet. The master bathroom has custom tiles, shower, and granite countertops.

The hall bathroom is Finding Nemo-themed, there is a princess-themed room, and there is a Cars-themed room for the boys.

In true Orange County style, what could be better than a heated pool? **If the pool isn’t your style, there’s a separate hot tub as well.**

The asking price for this home is $675,000. Give me a call today and we can arrange your private showing appointment. **This home can be purchased as a primary residence or as a short-term rental.** No new permits are being offered for short-term rentals in Anaheim, but this home is grandfathered in. The home comes with all the furnishings and even retains the reservations that have already been made. **From the moment you close escrow, you'll start generating cash flow.**

If you have any questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>
