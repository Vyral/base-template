Ever since the beginning of the pandemic, we’ve experienced a hyper seller’s market with very low inventory. Buyers have been losing house after house. We started 2021 with one month of inventory, and we went as low as 0.7 months. Even in June and July, we only had 0.8 and 0.9 months of inventory. Today I want to talk about what we’ve learned from this crazy market.&nbsp;

The No. 1 thing we've learned is that patience is rewarded. I've had so many buyers who put in offers on home after home and eventually decided to throw in the towel. However, those who kept going were rewarded. **This market's only going to get better.** We’re already seeing the market shift slightly. Instead of 10 to 12 offers on every house, there should only be three to four.

**The best way to hang in there is to be true to your goals.** Whatever the reason for your move, stick to it, be patient, and know that we’re going to find the right house for you. We can find off-market properties through our agent relationships and connections. We're going to get you the home you want.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out. We look forward to hearing from you.
