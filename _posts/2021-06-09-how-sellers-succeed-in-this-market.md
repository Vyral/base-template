Most sellers come to me with many questions about when the right time to sell is, how to get top dollar, and what their options are. All sellers want two things: the best price and terms and the least risk. They want an offer that will truly close because, in this market, some buyers are offering $100,000 over asking price and have to decide to offer that within a day, which means there’s a higher chance of buyer’s remorse, so the buyer may walk away.&nbsp;

To ensure you win as a seller with qualified buyers in this market, you need to do three things:

**1\. Get your house on the market right away.** Sellers think if they change the kitchen counters, paint, and so on, it’ll yield a better price, but with the market the way it is right now, if it takes you three weeks or more to prepare your home, we don’t know what the market will be like then. We know there’s currently a severe inventory shortage, so the quicker you can list your home, the more likely you will be to take advantage of the extremely high demand.

**2\. Make the house look great.** Don’t make any improvements that take a lot of time, but you do need to declutter and depersonalize. People watch HGTV and walk through other houses, so your house needs to look wonderful, and buyers need to have an emotional connection with it. Pick up your laundry, wash the dishes, and make sure it’s show-ready. Real estate agents like me have plenty of resources and connections to help you stage, store items, declutter, depersonalize, organize, and more. I also have an excellent handyman I can recommend.

**3\. Price the home right.** Just because your neighbor got $800,000 even though their house is worth $500,000, and you think your home’s better than theirs, doesn’t mean you can price yours at $900,000. We have to look at the market, the direction it’s moving, the psychology of pricing, and set a price that will produce a slew of showings and the best offer possible.

If you’re considering selling or have any questions, give me a call or visit my website. I’ll answer your questions, and we can talk strategy if you’re interested. I’d love to help you.
