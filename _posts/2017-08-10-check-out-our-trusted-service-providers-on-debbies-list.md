Finding a great contractor at a fair price isn't easy. We all have a laundry list of to-dos that we'd like to get done around the house, but many of the times, we just don't have the time or know-how to get it all done.

**That's why we created Debbie's List.**

If you're a contractor in the Northern Virginia area, you want to be on Debbie's list. The list is filled with contractors and service providers like plumbers, electricians, roofers, and more that we've used over my 30-year career with great success and reasonable prices.&nbsp;

If you don't see the type of contractor you're looking for, just give me a shout. If I don't have the name of someone on my list to give you, I'm a member of several different Realtor Listservs for agents only where I can ask my fellow agents for a great reference for a trustworthy service provider.

If I can help in any way with my 30 years of experience, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I'd be honored to serve you!
