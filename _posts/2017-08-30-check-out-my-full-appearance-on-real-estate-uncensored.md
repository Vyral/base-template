I recently had the pleasure of being a guest on the Real Estate Uncensored podcast with Greg McDaniel and Matt Johnson. We had a wide-ranging discussion that touched on a number of topics.

**[Click here to listen to the full podcast.](http://realestateuncensored.libsyn.com/podcast/dave-friedman)**

The main area of focus was how I went from being a solo agent doing 40 deals a year to being a team leader who was doing 400 deals a year in a short time. I also had some time to answer questions, both from the viewers and from Matt and Greg about my business. **Here’s a summary of our discussions with timestamps so you can skip ahead if any part particularly interests you.**

3:30- How I like to handle hesitant clients.

12:00- How I developed my method for getting more referrals.

19:00- How I'm continuing to grow my database even today.

25:30- How my 71-touch program is getting me a 55x ROI and making up a third of my business.

33:00- Why discipline and culture are the two keys to our dramatic growth.

36:00- How we discovered our team members' motivations and how that has impacted the culture.

47:00- How letting my system take over improved my business and my life in general.

52:00- Hungry and humble is the name of the game.
