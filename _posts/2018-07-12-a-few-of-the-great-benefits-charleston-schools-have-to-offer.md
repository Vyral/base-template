Today we’re taking a break from talking about real estate to talk about all of the great local schools in Charleston.

One thing I love about living in the low country is all of the great schools we have to offer. <strong>I know a thing or two about great schools, having been a teacher in both public and private Charleston County schools myself before getting into real estate.</strong>

My children go to school on Daniel Island, where I am today. They get to ride their bikes to school everyday, which they love doing alongside dozens of other students as you can see in the video above.

There are so many wonderful schools like this in the Charleston area. Public schools, private schools, charter schools—the possibilities are endless. On Daniel Island alone, we have a preschool, a K-8 elementary school, and a high school. <strong>There are many other communities like this throughout the area.</strong>
