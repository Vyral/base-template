Thanksgiving is just around the corner, which means it’s time for our annual pie giveaway.

**This is just our way of giving back to our clients.** We do this every year because our clients really enjoy it. It’s also a great chance for us to see everyone at our local office by Valencia High School.

If you would like to join us and stop by and get your pie, [please fill out the survey and respond and let us know we can expect you.](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/P7T5QDW)  Quantities are limited.

Then on Wednesday, November 22 from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., you can stop by our office for two or three hours, enjoy a drink with us, celebrate a bit, and then grab your pie.

I really want to thank you for being a valued part of our business and a valued part of my life. You are a big part of what I do. I invest a lot of time to be with you and help you reach your real estate goals. Over the years, a lot of my clients have also become my good friends, and I truly want to thank you for that. **That is a real blessing.**

After Thanksgiving, we’ll have our big end-of-the-year party, so keep an eye out for your invitation to that as well.

In the meantime, if you have any real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. Otherwise, I hope to see you at our Thanksgiving pie giveaway, and I wish you a great, safe Thanksgiving with your family.
