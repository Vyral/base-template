Thanksgiving is just around the corner, which means it’s time for our annual pie giveaway.

**This is just our way of giving back to our clients.** We do this every year because our clients really enjoy it. It’s also a great chance for us to see everyone at our local office by Valencia High School.

We’ll send you a survey soon so that you can pick out which kind of pie you would like to enjoy with your family this Thanksgiving, so keep an eye out for that email to reserve your pie.

Then on Wednesday, November 22 from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m., you can stop by our office for two or three hours, enjoy a drink with us, celebrate a bit, and then grab your pie.

I really want to thank you for being a valued part of our business and a valued part of my life. You are a big part of what I do. I invest a lot of time to be with you and help you reach your real estate goals. Over the years, a lot of my clients have also become my good friends, and I truly want to thank you for that. **That is a real blessing.**

After Thanksgiving, we’ll have our big end-of-the-year party, so keep an eye out for your invitation to that as well.

In the meantime, if you have any real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. Otherwise, I hope to see you at our Thanksgiving pie giveaway, and I wish you a great, safe Thanksgiving with your family.
