{% include youtube.html %}Today I am joined by Scott Stulen, the president and director of Philbrook Museum of Art. Originally from Minnesota, Scott, his wife, and two kids moved to Tulsa from Indiana two-and-a-half years ago. He studied studio art as well as art history before finding work in the museum field as an educator, curator, and, now, a director. He came to Tulsa because of a job opportunity and has loved the weather ever since.
