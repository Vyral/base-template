<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This upcoming event is a special thanks for all of your support and business, and we’d be honored to have you!</em></p>

We’re approaching fall and you know what that means: Our annual client appreciation event is coming up and you’re invited\! So clear your calendar for the afternoon of Sunday, September 15, and join us in the stands for the annual polo match held at &nbsp; . In addition to that, we’ll have activities for clients, friends, and family of all ages.

For the kids, that includes face painting, pony rides, and bounce houses\! And come hungry because we’ll have free food and drinks. You’ll have a front-row seat to all the action and excitement surrounding polo matches. What’s more is that it’ll be an interactive experience&#151;at halftime, attendees can run out on the field and stomp the divots, walk through the stables, and even pet the competing horses. Most importantly, you and your family will be able to enjoy the day on us as a token of our appreciation for your business.&nbsp;

Please reach out to me to be added to the guest list and we’ll see you out there\!
