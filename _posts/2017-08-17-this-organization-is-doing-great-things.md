Over 55,000 children in the Salt Lake Valley qualify for free lunch, but don’t get meals on the weekend. Lynda Smart Brown is trying to change that.

I want to spread the word as much as possible about a great organization here in Salt Lake City that is helping our most vulnerable people: kids.

I’m excited to be joined today by Lynda Smart Brown, the CEO/President of KidsEat! here in Salt Lake City. To me, she is simply an angel for what she does. **She steps up to help the alarming number of children in our backyard who don't have enough to eat.**

Did you know that there are 55,000 children in the Salt Lake Valley that qualify for a free lunch from the state every day? Lynda figures that at least half of those kids could benefit from food on the weekend and their numbers are proving that to be true.

What they do is pretty simple. They take backpacks and fill them up with seven balanced meals consisting of everything from fruit cups to graham crackers to macaroni and cheese. They then take these backpacks and distribute them to places like The Boys and Girls Club and elementary schools.

**Even with all the work Lynda has done, she still hasn’t been able to feed all of these hungry kids.** She needs our help to do this. I’m a big believer in this cause, and I’m proud to support it.

They go through a whopping $4,000 per month in food and distribute anywhere from 100 to 150 backpacks. If you’d like to support KidsEat!, you can do so right on their website. Whether you can donate time, money, or food, just know that you are helping to give a lot of these kids what so many of us take for granted.

KidsEat! also has a charity golf tournament coming up on September 15th at Murray Parkway. You don’t need to be an expert player by any means. They are looking for more female golfers in particular, but everyone is welcome to attend.

If you have any questions for us about KidsEat! or anything about real estate, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.
