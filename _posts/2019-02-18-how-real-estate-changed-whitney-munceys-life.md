Whitney Muncey began her career with Jeff Cook Real Estate in 2017. Since that time, her life has changed in so many ways. Joining our team has not only lifted a big financial burden off her shoulders, but it has also allowed her to set her own schedule so she can be present with her family when she needs to.

Whitney is also a huge part of our training. **During your first week, she will teach you how to prospect, how to manage your database, and how to present to buyers and sellers.**

Her favorite thing about working on our team is getting to meet new families all the time and the opportunity to meet so many of them.

**If you're considering jumping into a real estate career, there are a few different questions you’ll need to ask your prospective employer,** including how they are investing in you and whether they offer any type of training. Finally, what is their culture like? Will people be there to help you become a better person and a better agent?
