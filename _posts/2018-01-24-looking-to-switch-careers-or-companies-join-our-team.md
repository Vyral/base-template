I hope you’re doing well and having a great start to your 2018!

Here at McIntosh Realty, we are excited about our growth. We’re making preparations to add a couple new agents to the team early in the first quarter.

**We’re looking for both agents who have been successful in their independent roles and those who are ready to grow their business in 2018.**

Last year, our agents closed between 18 and 41 transactions and were able to meet their individuals through leads that our team provides, nurtures, and passes on to them to close.

As you may know, MacIntosh Realty recently branched out and rebranded as an independent brokerage, so our structure has changed considerably. It’s quite different from most other real estate firms.

We’ve worked hard to come up with **a commission structure that we feel is more favorable than any other in our market.**We consider it a win-win, and we would love the opportunity to share it with you.<br><br>If you’re currently a real estate agent and are interested in exploring a change, or if you’re a new agent and would like to discuss what we have to offer, **we look forward to hearing from you soon.**

Have a great, successful 2018!
