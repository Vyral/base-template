In the last few years, many institutional buyers (or iBuyers) such as Opendoor, Offerpad, and Zillow have entered the real estate market. We receive tons of questions from clients about how their buying process works, what their offers are, and whether it’s better to sell to them than go the traditional route. So **we created a program that gives our clients access to all the iBuyers that are buying homes in our area: the [Express Cash Offer program](https://ibuyerhomeoffer.com/){: target="_blank"}.** In the past few months, we’ve partnered with over 20 different institutional buyers in the Phoenix market.&nbsp;

Our process is simple: We come see your house, talk to you and get some information, then submit it to the iBuyers confidentially. Then within 48 to 72 hours we’ll bring you three or more offers and help you compare them so you choose the best one. We’ll also be bringing research on the retail value of your property so you’ll know whether it’s better to sell to an iBuyer for cash or list the traditional way.&nbsp;

If you’re interested in our Express Cash Offer program or have any questions, please call or email us. We’d be glad to help you.
