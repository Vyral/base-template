Here are three key tips to remember when staging your home.

Today I’m joined by Tess Bartman, co-owner of Holy City Home Staging and soon-to-be member of Healthy Realty Team, to share **three key tips for staging your home:**

**1\. Declutter and depersonalize.** Also, get rid of anything extra so that just your main furniture is left.&nbsp;

**2\. Paint with neutral colors.** This allows potential buyers to imagine their own stuff in the home.&nbsp;

**3\. Accessorize and style the home.** If you work with the Healthy Realty Team, we’ll bring in our own accessories and make your home look like a model home.&nbsp;

If you have more questions about preparing your home for the market, or there’s anything else my team and I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m here to help.
