As home buying season really kicks off, sellers are in a prime position to earn top dollar—that is, assuming they take the time to properly prepare their properties for the market.&nbsp;

If you want to sell quickly and for a great price, you need to make sure your home is in the best possible shape before you list it. But not all home upgrades are worth making.&nbsp;

Today I’d like to share a list of three projects that will bring a high return on your investment so that you can avoid wasting money on projects that won’t.&nbsp;

**1\. Improve your curb appea****l.** A fresh coat of paint and some landscaping can go a long way. The way your home looks from the outside serves as a buyer's first impression, after all. Updating your curb appeal tends to cost between $3,000 to $5,000—an amount you’ll more than likely earn back (and then some) because of the positive impact this upgrade has on buyers. If you need design ideas, check out local new construction properties in your area. This will help you understand current popular styles, color palettes, and more.

**2\. Upgrade your bathrooms—but not too much.** Mid-range bathroom upgrades bring about $1.71 for every $1, while high-end bathroom upgrades could actually hurt your bottom line. In other words, you need to choose your projects carefully. Adding in dual sinks, swapping out flooring, and changing out cabinets are all good upgrades to make, but make sure you don’t choose the most expensive options for each of these projects. Otherwise, your bathroom will look out-of-place compared to the rest of your home.&nbsp;

<br>**3\. Install new windows.** Mid-range, energy-efficient windows can bring you $1.15 return for every $1 spent. Not only do these new windows look nice, they will also help your home’s new owner save money on their energy bills.&nbsp;
