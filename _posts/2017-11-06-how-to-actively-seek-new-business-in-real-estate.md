If you think about any business out there, whether it’s a doctor’s office, a dentist’s office, a law firm, or a grocery store, all of them are in the business of procuring more customers or clients. They perform a service, but the business they’re in is getting more clients and then keeping them.

**If you want to get more business in real estate, you have to be a real estate agent 24/7.** That doesn’t mean you have to work 24/7. That just means that everyone you come into contact with needs to know that you’re a professional agent who sells houses. Whether it’s listings or buyers, that’s what you do.

So many people in the real estate industry act like they’re a secret agent. No one knows what they do, and they’re not proud of what they do. If you’re a real estate agent, be proud.

I highly encourage you to get shirts with your name or your company’s name on them so that when you’re out and about, people will strike up conversations with you. The No. 1 favorite thing people like to talk about—besides their children or their dog—is real estate. It’s something everyone has in common, whether you’re buying, selling, owning, or renting.

**If you’re present all the time and people know you’re a real estate agent, you’ll automatically sell more houses.**

If you have any questions about increasing your business, feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to sit down and talk with you.
