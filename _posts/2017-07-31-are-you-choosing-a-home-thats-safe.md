When you’re considering buying a home, it’s important to remember that there are many important factors to consider beyond the house itself. For example: what surrounds it?

Today, I want to bring you five specific essentials to think about when buying a home.

**1. Contained pool fun.** Pools are a great addition to a home and can be a huge draw, especially during the heat of summer. But as fun as pools are they also come with a lot of safety requirements, some of which could be specific to your area. Additionally, consider whether you’ll be able to control who enters the pool. If the pool doesn’t already have features like locks or safety gates, how much money will you need to spend to get them installed?

**2. Backyard fire zones.** Barbeques or fire pits are great for entertaining your family and guests alike. But, once again, safety is important. When it comes to fire zones, you should be especially careful of placement. Fire zones shouldn’t be placed near play areas. Remember to make that if you have small children or grandchildren, your yard and its features are being kept kid-friendly.

**3. Aging danger zones.** A deck or patio may be beautiful for a time, but without proper upkeep these features can become extremely rundown over time. On these kinds of features be sure to look out for wood rot and any other aging defects.

**4. Landscaping liability.**As gorgeous as trees can be as a part of a home’s landscaping, they can be dangerous and costly to remove. Make sure that any trees in your yard are removed promptly and correctly if they die.

**5. Curbing danger.**As a potential buyer, you may only visit a given home at a time of day when traffic is at a minimum. At other points of the day, there could be much more noise and much more danger. By talking to a Realtor who knows the area, you can be sure that you are choosing a home that is safe for you and your family.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
