If you haven’t been to Perry lately, there are some awesome things happening, and some **great community establishments downtown:**

\- The Tin Pig<br>\- Gamble Block Brewery<br>\- The Hotel Pattee<br>\- The Proletariat

Magnolia Park is located on the East edge of town, just off of Hwy 141.&nbsp; We have 3 new construction homes remaining right now, 2 of which are move in ready!&nbsp;
