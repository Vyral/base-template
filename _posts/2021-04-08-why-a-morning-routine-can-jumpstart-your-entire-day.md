Want to know the secret to a great morning? A great morning routine, of course\!

Most of us understand the value of starting the day the right way, but it’s still incredibly easy to get off track when it comes to sticking to a routine. I think it happens because we aren’t held accountable for the morning tasks we do—or they’re tasks that we don’t exactly care about. Other times, we haven’t visualized all the benefits we’ll receive when we thoroughly follow our routines.

**It’s normal to stumble, but we need to create more accountability for ourselves**. It plays a huge role in keeping us on track toward achieving our goals. Personally, I’ve found that part of my system involves sharing my goals with others. For you, it may mean tracking your activities or blocking out time to get your tasks done. Are you waking up earlier than others in your household in order to enjoy some quiet, introspective time?

One of my goals now—and one I still struggle with—is journaling every day. I want to put all my thoughts, ideas, and gratitude into one place so I can come back and reflect, as it’s an area of my life where I often feel scattered. That’s what I’ll be holding myself accountable for through our membership group, <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://yourjourneywithjennie.com/momentum"><em>Maintain Your Momentum</em></a></u>, which just started a 66-day challenge.

Books like “The One Thing” can help you turn baby steps into lifelong habits, while “The Miracle Morning for Real Estate Agents” can help you jumpstart your day and keep you on track. I also turn to page 308 from “The Millionaire Real Estate Agent” often to remind myself of the energy plan. If you think through all five of the energies and work with them each day, you’ll set yourself up for success.

What’s your morning routine? How are you accomplishing it? What do you hope to improve? **I’d love to hear from you and find out more about how you’re meeting your goals**. Until then, I hope my blog has helped you think a little more about your day-to-day routines, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
