Today we’re going to talk a little bit about the pre-certification process. One of the elements involved here is having your home inspected before it hits the market.

**One of the biggest reasons we encourage our home sellers to get a pre-inspection is to uncover any issues that you might not have known about.** Some issues can hide in a home for years. We don’t want a buyer to discover something is wrong before we do.

Another important element to the pre-certification is the fact that we’re going to provide the buyer with our home inspection report. Odds are they won’t believe it, but once they get their home inspection and it lines right up with ours, it will build trust. **We aren’t trying to hide anything in our report.** We want it to be identical with theirs.

This is just a quick peek at the services we provide for homes when they’re listed on the market. If you have any questions or need any assistance in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
