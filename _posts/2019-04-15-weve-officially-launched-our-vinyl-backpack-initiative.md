Jeff Cook Real Estate is known for our whimsical and creative billboards. People are always looking forward to what we come up with next, but after the billboards come down, that’s it.&nbsp;

This got us thinking: How can we continue to use our billboards to answer people’s question, “What will they do next?”

With that in mind, Jeff Cook Cares has officially launched its vinyl backpack initiative. **We’re recycling our billboard vinyl into backpacks, and for every Jeff Cook backpack you purchase, another will be given away for free to a child in need at a Title 1 school.** Every backpack is unique, and you’ll be contributing to a child’s education.&nbsp;

You might be thinking it’s a stretch to say that a backpack will help a child learn, but they’re more important than they appear. Having a place to put their books is a key in helping them stay organized, focused, and motivated in the classroom. It doesn’t hurt that they get to sport a one-of-a-kind backpack, either.&nbsp;

These backpacks fit students of all ages, but they’re not limited to students—you can use the backpack you keep for anything.&nbsp;

**To purchase your very own backpack and help a child in need, visit [JeffCookCares.com](http://JeffCookCares.com){: target="_blank"}**.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this initiative, feel free to give us a call or shoot us an email. We’d be glad to help.
