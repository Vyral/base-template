Here in the Houston area, we’re in a pretty busy real estate market, and 2019 is shaping up to be another record year.&nbsp;

**According to the latest numbers, we’re seeing a strong surge in the upper market** (i.e., homes priced over $750,000). Low interest rates and a robust economy in general have helped all price points across the board, but the luxury market has benefited especially well.&nbsp;

The next biggest gains we’ve been seeing are in the entry-level sector, or homes priced between $150,000 and $250,000. As I’ve said before, affordable housing is becoming a thing of the past, and many first-time homebuyers are getting priced out of the market in the lower price points.

Here’s what the numbers say specifically about our current market:

* Over 7,500 homes were sold in March—an 8% gain compared to March of 2018
* The median home price is $245,000
* The average home price is $315,000
* Inventory for single-family homes is at four months

**Four months of inventory puts us in a seller’s market, but keep in mind that this figure varies by area here in Houston because our marketplace is so big.&nbsp;**

In certain areas, we’re also seeing a bit of a “trickle-up” effect where a lot of homes are selling in the lower price points and creating a vacuum at those price points. In Bellaire, for example, a lot of homes are selling in the $750,000 range, and it’s created a very strong market in the $800,000 range.&nbsp;

If you’re a seller, research shows that your home needs to show well and you need to price it according to what the market commands if you want to sell quickly.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any questions about our market or you have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
