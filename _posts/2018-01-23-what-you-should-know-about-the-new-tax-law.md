Recently, we’ve been receiving a lot of questions regarding the new tax law. Today, we’ll be answering some of the ones we’re asked most frequently.&nbsp;

One of the main questions we’ve been hearing is, “How will this law impact investors?” Well, while we cannot give tax advice, we can certainly guide you through some of the key things you need to know. Simply set up a meeting with us and we would be happy to walk you through the ways in which you’ll be affected.&nbsp;

Another question we’ve been getting a lot has to do with capital gains exemptions. People have been asking, “If I sell, do the old rules still apply?” Actually, one thing that hasn’t changed is that **sellers still need only to have lived in their primary residence for two of the last five years to take advantage of capital gains exemptions**.&nbsp;

Again, we’re not tax professionals, but we do spend a lot of time with tax professionals. &nbsp;With that being said, we would be happy to direct you to a tax professional who can guide you through your individual circumstances.&nbsp;

At the end of the day, who cares about the tax law? **The law will affect everyone differently, so what you should really be concerned with is your individual circumstances**. We work with CPAs to help you take full advantage of your situation.

Ultimately, our point is this: You are not alone. We are here to help you understand these new changes. Our team has the knowledge, experience, and connections you’ll need to maneuver the tax process.&nbsp;

Also, it is worth mentioning that for most people dealing with real estate, your taxes will be less this year.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
