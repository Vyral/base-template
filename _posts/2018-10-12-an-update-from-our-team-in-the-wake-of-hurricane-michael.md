In the wake of Hurricane Michael, know that we at the Nathan Abbott Team are sending our thoughts and prayers to everyone in Panama City and the surrounding areas to the east. We feel thankful that most of Panama City Beach and the areas to the west of us made it through the storm with minimal impact. As always, weâ€™d like to thank locals and travelers alike for supporting our area. To see our full message, watch this short video.
