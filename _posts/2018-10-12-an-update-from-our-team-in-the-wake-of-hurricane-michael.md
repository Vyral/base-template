Hurricanes create supernatural skies.&nbsp; They always seem to deliver a beautiful sunset before and after the storm that wreaks havoc in between. Learning to navigate through the dark skies in between resembles life as we know it. Even in your darkest days, you can find light if you search for it.&nbsp; More beautiful days ahead. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in Panama City, Mexico Beach, and to the east which has a long road of recovery.&nbsp; We will be setting up our office as a headquarters to collect donations and needed items for relief efforts. We are located at&nbsp;[https://goo.gl/maps/5iF61fFhaDC2](https://goo.gl/maps/5iF61fFhaDC2){: target="_blank"}&nbsp; and will provide updates as we receive them. Thank you.&nbsp;
