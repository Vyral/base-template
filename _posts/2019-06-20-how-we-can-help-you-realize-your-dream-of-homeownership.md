Today I wanted to take a moment today to talk to you about some of the financing options and programs that are out there for you as a homebuyer—some of which are provided by the highly skilled and professional lenders we work alongside.&nbsp;

Some of our buyers enjoy 100% financing on their home purchase and others receive help with their closing costs. You might be convinced that you don’t have the money to move into a new home, but **with a decent credit score, we can more than likely make your dream of homeownership a reality.**&nbsp;

It won’t cost you anything but a few minutes of your time to talk to one of our buyer specialists to see if you qualify for one of our financing programs. It could even be that a 100% financing program isn’t tailored to your circumstances. If you have money to put toward a down payment, we can help you secure a better monthly mortgage payment and better terms.&nbsp;

Whatever the case, don’t settle for the first thing your lender presents to you. **Explore your options and, if 100% financing is right for you, we’re the team for you\!&nbsp;**

If you have any questions or need help selecting the option that best serves your home buying interests, please let us know. We’d be happy to connect you with one of our partnered lenders to get you into a home with special financing. We look forward to talking to you\!<br>&nbsp;
