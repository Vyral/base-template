If a buyer makes a speedy visit to your house, they’re probably not interested in it. Here’s why.

**Want to Sell Your Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.com/list/" target="_blank">Get the Value of Your Central or Southwest Virginia Home</a>
**Looking to Buy a Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.net/" target="_blank">Search All Homes on the MLS</a>

If a prospective buyer zips in and out of your house, they’re probably not a serious buyer—at least not for your house.

**There are a variety of reasons why a buyer would make a speedy visit.** Maybe when they drove up to your home, they didn’t like the landscaping, the exterior, or just the neighborhood in general. Perhaps when they walked into the house there was a smell or odor they didn’t like. Maybe it just wasn’t the right house for them.

A serious buyer, on the other hand, will stop and envision themselves in your house. They’ll take the time to imagine where their furniture would go and mentally pick out rooms for their children.

It’s very rare that a buyer zips in and out of your house and then comes back to make an offer on it. **If they make a speedy visit, you pretty much have your answer whether they’re interested in your house or not.**
