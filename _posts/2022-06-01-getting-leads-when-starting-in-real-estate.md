A lot of people have been asking me about how I built my business. I know lead sources can be confusing, so today I want to share a little bit about my journey by explaining a few of the pillars of my real estate business. Here are the three original lead sources that I used to build my real estate business:

**1\. Going door to door.** I used this method when I started in the business at 23 years old. I never once convinced somebody to buy or sell their home by simply knocking on their door, but I did come from a place of contribution. I answered their questions, gave them value, and slowly the phone started to ring from those sources.

**2\. Expireds and FSBOs.** Back in the day, I carried a 3x5 card around me to come from a place of contribution with people trying to sell their home on their own or who couldn't sell in the past. Again, I never convinced them to utilize my services from our initial conversations, but a certain percentage of them slowly found enough value in me to hire me to formally list their homes.

**3\. Sphere of influence.** I have always given a ton of value to those who already know, like, and trust me. Working with that group of people by building trust and solving their problems will slowly but surely bring in referrals. This source is still the very core of my business today.

There are some loose ends in those three lead sources, so if you want to hear the dialogues that I led with when talking to our sphere of influence, I'm happy to share them with you.
