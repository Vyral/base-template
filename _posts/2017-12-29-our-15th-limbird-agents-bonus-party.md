  We recently celebrated our 15th Limbird Agents Bonus party! When you list and
  sell your home with our LAB program, you are supporting the community we all
  live and work in. We have given $22,000 to charities in the Northwest Arkansas
  area. We hold these parties to give bonus commissions to our agents and thank
  them for all of their hard work. To see a recap of our latest party, watch
  this short video.

Did you know that between 1997 and 2014, **homes within a quarter of a mile of a Starbucks rose in value by 96%?**

Well today, I’d like to tell you about another great coffee shop: Heroes Coffee. Heroes has been open for just about a month in downtown Bentonville.

This location is their first of five in total that are coming to our area. Best of all, **each Heroes location is going to pick a charity to champion.**

With so many coffee shops popping up and so much growth here in the Northwest Arkansas market, one can’t help but wonder whether the statistic I mentioned earlier about living near a Starbucks also applies to local places like Heroes.

In my opinion, I think proximity to locations like these can absolutely play a role in your home’s value. Of course, **my team and I are always happy to give you our opinion on other ways to improve your home’s value.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
