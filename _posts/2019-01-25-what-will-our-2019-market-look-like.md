Now that we’ve entered the new year, let’s take a moment and share our predictions for what lies ahead. There are four main things we can expect moving forward.

{% include pullquote.html %}

* **Interest rates will probably rise.** Though rates are still historically low, they are set to go up at least twice in 2019. Now may be the time to lock in rates while they’re still between 4.5% and 5%.
* **Inventory will increase.** It’s likely that more homes will soon hit our market, meaning buyers will have greater choice in the near future.
* **The average days on market will go up.** Even in hot price ranges, the increase in inventory will likely cause homes to sit on the market for longer periods of time.
* **prices are going to level out or flatten.** Brokers throughout the country have already reported this trend, and our midwest market is sure to see similar conditions soon.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
