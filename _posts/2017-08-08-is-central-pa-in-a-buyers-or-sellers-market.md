{% include youtube.html %}Are we in a buyer’s market or a seller’s market?

Right now, we are definitely in a seller’s market. The combination of low inventory and very high demand means that **the market certainly favors sellers.**

Since we are so short on inventory, home prices are on the rise. Buyers don’t have many options to choose from, so sellers can demand a slightly higher price for their home. Compared to this time last year, both the average and median home prices have gone up slightly.
<br>{% include pullquote.html %}
<br>How do interest rates come into play in this market? If you have average credit, interest rates range from 3.875% to 4.25% depending on which program you go with: a VA, FHA, USDA, or conventional loan.

So, what does all of this mean for you?

**If you are buying a home, you have to be prepared to act quickly.** Make sure that you are pre-qualified and familiar with the inventory that is available.

As a seller, you can demand a slightly higher price this year than you could have last year.

If you have any other questions about this current market, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
