When selecting a buyer's agent or preparing to make an offer, there are a few essential tips you should follow. One of our team’s great buyer specialists, Naomy Swingle, has joined us today to explain these important points.

Naomy’s wisdom is especially crucial right now, given that we’re in a seller’s market. For those unfamiliar with what this means, a seller’s market describes conditions of low inventory and high demand. While sellers may benefit from these conditions, though, buyers can still succeed under the guidance of professionals like Naomy.

**Naomy’s first goal when she begins working with a buyer is to help them set realistic expectations.** She does this by explaining the current state of the market and how this might impact their deal, as well as the overall reality of the home buying process.

In a seller’s market like we’re seeing right now, this sometimes means she has to dispel some unfortunate truths, like the fact that most buyers’ first offer will be unsuccessful. This level of honesty ultimately helps Naomy’s clients be more confident in her guidance.

And **as a result of this confidence, Naomy’s clients tend to see very favorable results.** The advice she provides them with isn’t always what they’re expecting, but this is because her professional knowledge extends far beyond what the average person might believe about our market.

For instance, while many homebuyers assume that price is the most important component of an offer, this is not the case. **Pricing is not always the determining factor in whether a seller accepts a deal.** It’s also important to consider the terms of your offer.

With all of this in mind, it’s not difficult to see why working with a professional like Naomy is so significant.
