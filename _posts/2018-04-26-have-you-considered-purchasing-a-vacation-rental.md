One of the great things about the Orlando Property Group is that we can help you with your vacation property purchases.

If you’re looking for a property that you can use to generate income, but still use yourself from time to time, we would be more than happy to help you make this goal a reality.

**Running a vacation home in this way allows you to let other people pay your mortgage through rental fees**.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
