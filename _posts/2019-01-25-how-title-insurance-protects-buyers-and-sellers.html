I’m joined today by **Rod Gordy of [Fidelity National Title](http://www.fntic.com/){: target="_blank"}**, who will be giving us a brief explanation of how title insurance helps buyers and sellers alike.

**So, why do you need title insurance?**

Buyers get title insurance so that when they get a new loan, the lender is insured in the proper position on the home.

Sellers need title insurance so that when the new buyer takes ownership of a home, there isn’t anything that will cause any problems in the title policy. For example, if you bought a home that recently had a new roof installed, and a month later, the roofer says you owe them for it, the title company would step up and pay it.

**I’d like to thank Rod for giving us a quick look at what title insurance is used for.**

If you have any questions or need more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
