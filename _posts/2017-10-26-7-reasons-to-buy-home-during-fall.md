Why should you consider selling your home during the fall instead of waiting for spring or summer? **Here are seven good reasons:**

**1. Competition drops off in the fall.** Many people consider the fall to be the “offseason” for buying homes, but there is still quite a bit of inventory left on the market. Some of it’s new, some of its inventory that’s being re-positioned and re-priced to sell before the holidays. Either way, it gives you much more negotiating power than you'll see during the spring.

**2. Sellers are worn out.** Many times when sellers overprice their homes, they sit on the market for months without offers. If their homes are still on the market during this time of year, they will realize that they need to be aggressive with their pricing in order to get the home sold.

**3. Sellers are serious about selling.** In many cases, sellers need to close by the end of the year. Whether it’s for tax reasons, a job transfer, or something else, many sellers are motivated to make a quick deal. That’s always good news for buyers.

**4. You can take advantage of tax breaks for the whole year.** Even if you close on your home in December, you’ll still be able to take advantage of the mortgage interest and property tax deductions for the income you’ve earned in 2017. Even though you would only have owned the home for one month of the year, you would still be able to take deductions for the whole year.

**5. Fall is a safer time to purchase.** Although crime and burglary rates in this area aren’t high by any means, they do drop off significantly in the fall. Most break-ins occur during the summer.

**6. You will stand out.** During the fall, there tends to be a slowdown within the industry. As a buyer, that means you’ll receive more attention from the sellers who do have their home listed. This will help the transaction move along much more quickly.



**7. You can take advantage of year-end deals for your new home.** The end of the year is the time to buy if you’re looking to furnish your home with new appliances and furniture. You’ll need to get them anyway, so you might as well buy during a time of year where you can get a great deal.
