Or we allow distractions to get in our way or we just really need more help— which could be another person, or a system or tool or technology to leverage ourselves. Or we just aren’t clear on what matters most and we allow ourselves to be pulled and pushed by others. We simply can’t do everything and for sure not by ourselves. We can I guess, we’ll just be stressed out, cranky and eventually burn out.
