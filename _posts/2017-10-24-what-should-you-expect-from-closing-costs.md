What are closing costs? How much are they?

According to a recent survey of 1,000 first-time homebuyers by Closing Corp, 17% of buyers were unaware of closing costs and 35% were unaware of the actual dollar volume that came with them.

**Some of the factors involved in closing costs that surprised people were mortgage insurance, points, and taxes.** In our area, if you’re buying in a condo market, you’ll see associations asking for three, four, or five months of HOAs up front.

According to Freddie Mac, closing costs typically account for 2% to 5% of your overall sale price. This can be a large amount of money, and it’s why we sit down with our buyers before we look at properties with them to make sure we go over everything step by step and they know everything that’s involved with the home buying process.

**It’s important to speak with a lender before viewing any properties** so you know what’ you’ll have to pay out of pocket for your down payment and your closing costs.
