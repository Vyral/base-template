<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s something that will help keep you organized and consistent.</em></p>

Somebody asked me last week if there was one thing I did early in my career to set myself up for future success. **The one thing that comes to mind is consistency, and my daily activity record has allowed me to be organized and consistent.**

A daily activity record is a book or document that contains everything that happens day by day in both your personal and professional life. There should be places for goal setting and notes.

**I've been tracking every single hour of every day since 2011.** I can tell you what I was doing, who I spoke to, and what my goals were at any given date or time.

How does it benefit you? For starters, it helps you keep consistently organized. **If you incorporate it into your business, it can open up more time and freedom away from work.** Everything you need is in one place, and it goes well beyond the value of a simple planner.

This business can pull you in every direction if you let it, but this daily activity record will allow you to be able to shut your business down and open it up when you need to.

If you have questions about where to find a daily activity record or anything else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out to me via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
