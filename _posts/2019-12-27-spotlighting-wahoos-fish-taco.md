  For today’s video, I’m spotlighting the world-famous Wahoo’s Fish Taco
  restaurant chain by visiting their very first location at 1862 Placentia
  Avenue in Costa Mesa. Owner/founder Wing Lam started out serving hungry Orange
  County surfers with just a portable stove right on the beach while he was on
  academic probation at San Diego State University. After his parents sold their
  Chinese Restaurant in Newport, they gave him $30,000 to open his first
  restaurant and the rest is history. The amazing part of this story is that
  it’s one of the first instances of Asian-infused Mexican cuisine being brought
  to the market. They also offer vegan and vegetarian options in their menu—all
  at a low price.

**Watch the video above in its entirety to get a quick tour of the restaurant and a glimpse of what they offer.** The first three people who mention “taco” in the comment section below will receive a $5 gift card from me so they can sample their very own Wahoo’s taco.
