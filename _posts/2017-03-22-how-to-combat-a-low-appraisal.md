The real estate market is very hot right now, so we get asked about appraisals almost daily. That’s why we decided to talk a little bit about appraisals with you today.

Typically, most buyers will need a loan to buy a home, so **their lender is going to order an appraisal,** which the buyer will pay for while in escrow. Fortunately, most of the homes we sell will end up setting a new high comparable in that neighborhood.

To avoid a failed appraisal, we meet with the appraiser on sight and provide them with three different reports. The first is a marketing report in which we let them know how many people have come through the home, if there has been any feedback, or if there are any backup offers. We also present a comparables report in which we put together very detailed comps for them so they know what other homes in the neighborhood have sold for. The last report is an upgrade list. **This list features all the upgrades the home has compared to the other properties.**

**Out of the 200 homes we’ve sold, only three haven’t appraised.** When we feel there is a potential of a home not appraising, we will have the buyer agree to pay up to a certain amount over the appraisal during the counter offer. We make sure your home sells for the best price.
