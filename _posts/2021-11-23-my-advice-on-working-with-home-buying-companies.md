I’m sure that you’ve been getting inundated with phone calls, text messages, letters, and emails from companies who want to buy your home. There are multinational companies, iBuyers, and other investors trying to buy up properties with the promise of cash and a quick close.

**If you’re a homeowner, I suggest that you have real estate representation if you’re considering selling to one of these home-buying companies.** It’s important to look through the contracts with a keen eye because the language could be setting you up to fail. It’s a good opportunity for you, but it’s always important to read the fine print since they don’t use the standard contract.

If you have any questions about iBuyers, selling your home, or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
