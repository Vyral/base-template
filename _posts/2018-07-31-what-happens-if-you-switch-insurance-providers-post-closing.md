Getting insurance quotes each year is something I highly recommend to all homeowners, as this will ensure you’re working with a provider who offers great service at a competitive price.

But, if you’ve recently closed on a new home and decide to change your insurance provider after the fact, **don’t forget to provide your lender with any and all information regarding your new provider when you switch.**

Beyond that, it’s also essential that you cancel service with your previous provider. It is your responsibility as a homeowner to see to each of these tasks. Lenders need up-to-date information so that your taxes and insurance can be paid correctly when they come due.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, don’t hesitate to reach out to myself or my team. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
