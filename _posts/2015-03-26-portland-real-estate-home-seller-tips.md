With the spring selling season in full swing here in Portland, I wanted to share four inexpensive ways to add some value to your home. These things can easily be done right before a sale, and they can put some extra cash in your pocket at closing.

1. Appliances: Many of our homes have older appliances within them, and you might be surprised at how inexpensive it is to get new appliances. A company I know of called ABT is able to swap out all of your appliances to get you the stainless steel that buyers like to see these days.

2. Painting: This may be one of the easiest ways to add value to your property. Fresh paint is an extremely cost-effective way to add value to your home, and can go a long way to make buyers believe that your home is brand new. Just make sure that colors throughout your home are uniform, and buyers typically prefer lighter earth tones.

3. Staging: We provide a free stager when you work with us, and she will come out to arrange your home in an enticing way. Homes that are dolled up and staged often sell for more money than homes that have not been altered prior to selling. This is a fantastic way to put some extra cash in your pocket at closing.

4. Depersonalize and declutter: Buyers don't like to see messy homes, and they also need to imagine themselves living within the space of your home. Cleaning up and organizing your home can go a long way towards making potential buyers feel more comfortable within your home. Remove any collections of photos, art, or other personal items. You don't need your home to be empty, but don't let your particular lifestyle be readily apparent to everyone who walks inside your home.

As you prepare to sell your home this spring, I hope that these tips will be able to put some more money in your pocket. Often times the repairs that you think might net you more money are not the ones that you need to be making. Be sure to speak with us before your home sale so you don't waste your money on unnecessary repairs.

As always, consider me your #1 resource for real estate in Portland!
