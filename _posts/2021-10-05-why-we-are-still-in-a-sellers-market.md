Did you miss the market? We have talked with a lot of people who are worried that they’re too late. The simple answer is no; you haven’t missed the market.

Okay, we’re not getting 48 offers on a house over the weekend. **We’re going into a more normal market, but it still favors sellers quite a bit.** Prices have not dropped by any stretch of the imagination, but homes just aren’t selling for $100,000 above the list price.

We’re seeing a lot of buyer fatigue. They’re discouraged from having to compete in multiple-offer situations, but it still is a good opportunity for any buyers out there. You won’t get a discount on a home, but they will lock in our fantastic interest rates.

For sellers, **if you list your home right, have your house ready, and work with great Realtors, you will sell your home.** You can still downsize or move out of state without sitting on the market for months; it’s still a seller’s market, just not the seller’s market on steroids that we were in earlier.

If you have any questions, please give us a call. We’d love to talk about our market in more detail.
