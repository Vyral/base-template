<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Refusing to budge will lead you nowhere. Instead, collaborate on a great outcome for all.</em></p>

Many people assume that negotiation means drawing a line and refusing to cross it. This tactic is called competitive negotiation, and while it may work in some instances, it’s not guaranteed to get you what you want.

**The best option is collaborative negotiation**, which uses various methods in order to find the other party’s motivation. In other words, to increase your chances of a successful transaction, you need to understand the buyer or seller you’re dealing with.

If you find out what matters most to them, be it timing, finances, or bonus incentives, you can begin to structure the transaction around that. **You can offer these items in exchange for something you want**, thus creating a win-win situation where all parties feel their needs have been met.
