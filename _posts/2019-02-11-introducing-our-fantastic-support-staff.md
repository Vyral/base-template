Today we’re excited to introduce you to three of our fantastic support staff members here at the Kohler Group.

**Hannah Burke is not only the operations manager of the Kohler Group, but she is also a licensed agent.** She is responsible for transactions from start to finish and will be your main point of contact here at the office. She can answer almost any question that arises or direct you to the right person to answer it for you. She also has an encyclopedic knowledge of trivial facts.

**Allison Rucinski is our transaction coordinator and your go-to person from contract to close.** She is a lifelong Dekalb-area resident and just recently purchased her own home.

If you have any questions for or about our support staff that you met today, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
