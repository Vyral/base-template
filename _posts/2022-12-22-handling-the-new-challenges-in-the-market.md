There’s no doubt that the market is much different than it was a year ago. As things change and become more difficult, I was reminded of a video of Kara Lawson, the basketball coach of the Duke Blue Devils. She talked to her team about learning how to “do hard better.” The same concept can be applied to this market.&nbsp;

**As the market continues to shift and evolve, it's up to us to handle the new challenges better.** If you're getting into real estate, understand that this is a time when other people are getting out, and this could be a critical time for your professional career. For us to succeed, we need to do things that will get us out of our comfort zone and will be difficult for us.&nbsp;

Whether we want to work harder or not, the choice is up to us. My former coach, who I admire greatly, shared this with me: For us to grow, we need to do the hard things even when we don't want to do them.&nbsp;

Whether you're a current Realtor or looking to get into the business, know that the market will change. I**t's up to us to handle the new challenges and simply “do hard better.”&nbsp;**
