<center><em>Utah has many attractive amenities for homebuyers.</em></center>

<br>Why has the former CEO of Zappos, Tony Hsieh, been buying millions of dollars’ worth of real estate in Utah?

No one could have foreseen how the pandemic ended up affecting real estate. **People are looking for peaceful sanctuaries** with access to nature and beautiful properties, which is why Utah is desirable. People are cooped up in their houses or apartments, maybe working from home, and they want to get out of their small spaces, so they’re realizing the charm that Utah provides.

Home sales in Park City alone increased by 62%, but it’s too soon to tell whether this is just temporary or a long-term trend. New construction sales are also rising all over the state, and **home values have grown substantially**. Interest rates are at all-time lows, but that’s just one part of it. Utah offers so much access to trails, parks, and nature; it’s all close and easy to get to when you need it.

Utah’s school districts and athletic programs have remained open, which is another reason people are flocking here. In other states, you hear people moving to a particular city or area for a great school district, but almost anywhere in Utah has an excellent school district.

We have many fantastic things going for us in this state, and that’s why people like Tony Hsieh are rushing into Utah.
