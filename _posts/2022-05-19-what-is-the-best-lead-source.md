What's the No. 1 recommended lead source to build your real estate business? We have access to 15 lead sources. Some of them are prospecting-based, which require time, not money. Some of them are marketing-based, which require money, not time. However, they all have a distinct return on cash and time investment.

The No. 1 place to develop a real estate business is your database and sphere of influence. These are the people that you’ve met who already know, like, and trust you. It takes a lot of time, money, and energy to build trust in a relationship, but that’s already built with these people. You want to target those folks and offer your services to them.

**If you contribute to and enrich the lives of people that already know, like, and trust you, they will want to reciprocate.** When they have a life change, you'll be the first person on their mind. 76% of people who experience life changes use the first Realtor they think about. Don't waste the trust you've already built.

I can provide you with a short document that outlines how you can grow your database and focus on referral business. I can also share some of the dialogues we use to lead conversations and give value to our database. Reach out to me at (717) 216-0860 or [dave@davehooketeam.com](mailto:dave@davehooketeam.com). I look forward to hearing from you.
