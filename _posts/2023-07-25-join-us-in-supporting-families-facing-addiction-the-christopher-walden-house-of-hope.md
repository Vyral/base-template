Today, we're taking a break from our usual real estate topics to share something close to our hearts. We want to tell you about a nonprofit organization that we've developed with a mission to make a positive impact on families facing addiction issues. Allow us to introduce the Christopher Walden House of Hope.

After the heartbreaking loss of our beloved son, we realized that we could use our experience to create something meaningful. The Christopher Walden House of Hope was born with a vision to support families struggling with addiction, ensuring they never have to face these challenges alone.

At the Christopher Walden House of Hope, we raise funds to assist families dealing with addiction, whether it's a parent or a child affected by alcohol or drug dependency. **Our goal is to provide the necessary support and resources to help these families navigate through their difficult journey toward hope and healing.**

We are excited to announce our fourth annual 5k run on the Hilltop, which serves as a key fundraising event for our cause. We invite you to participate as a sponsor or a participant. Your sponsorship, whether $500, $1,000, or $1,500, will go directly back to the community, making a significant impact on the lives of those in need.

**You don't have to be an avid runner to be a part of this incredible event.** Anyone can join! Whether you walk or run, your presence and support will mean the world to us and the families we help. The race will take place on August 12, and you can register on [www.skinnyravens.com](https://runsignup.com/Race/AK/Anchorage/MiniMountain38K) for the "Christopher Walden House of Hope 5k Hilltop Race."

If you are a company or an individual looking to make a difference, we would be honored to have you as a sponsor for our event. Your contribution will directly impact the community and make a positive change in the lives of those struggling with addiction.
