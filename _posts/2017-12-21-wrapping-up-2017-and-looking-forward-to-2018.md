I have a short holiday message to share with you as we end 2017 and look toward 2018.

I appreciate all the emails and private messages of everyone who’s been watching our video blog all year long and asking questions and advice. **I enjoy sharing the knowledge and experience I have in real estate and coaching and mentoring newer agents,** whether you work for my company or somewhere else.

Remember that 2018 will be a record year for real estate, so make sure you have your systems, processes, and leverage in place.
