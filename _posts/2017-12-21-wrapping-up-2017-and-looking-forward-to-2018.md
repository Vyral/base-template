I have a short holiday message to share with you as we end 2017 and look toward 2018.

I appreciate all the emails and private messages of everyone who’s been watching our video blog all year long and asking questions and advice. **I enjoy sharing the knowledge and experience I have in real estate and coaching and mentoring newer agents,** whether you work for my company or somewhere else.

Remember that 2018 will be a record year for real estate, so make sure you have your systems, processes, and leverage in place.

As always, if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. In the meantime, happy holidays and have a happy New Year!
