I love working with For Sale By Owner (FSBO) homes. It’s really just somebody asking for help. **A lot of these homeowners don’t realize that hiring an agent will actually help them net more when they go to sell.**

Although you do have to pay an agent a percentage of your sale price to your agent, the cost of sitting on the market without an agent could easily be much higher. In many cases, you could sell much quicker and for much more money by hiring an agent in the first place.

**Another big benefit of having a licensed Realtor in your corner is their negotiation skills.** They could end up getting you much more money, thus saving on the commission you were worried about.

The buyers who look at FSBO homes are looking for good deals. They think that because they aren’t buying a home from a professional, they will get a great deal. **It’s similar to the difference between buying a watch at a jewelry store and buying one at a garage sale.** You’re automatically going to haggle the price at the garage sale, but you won’t in the jewelry store because you’re buying from a professional. The same concept rings true in the real estate world.

If you want to learn more about the benefits and disadvantages of selling your home FSBO or anything else about our real estate market, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
