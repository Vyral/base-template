I’m not sure what it is, but recently, I’ve talked with a ton of clients that are having boundary disputes with their neighbors. These can be emotionally charged issues, and they’re essential to solve before you sell your home. That’s why today I want to share a few tips to help you resolve your boundary issues:

**1\. Explore their story.** Just the other day, I met with a client’s neighbor and did nothing but sit there and listen to what he had to say. After hearing his side, I realized it didn’t make much sense that he was so upset over such a small issue. However, when I asked him how long this had been going on, he told me it had been an issue for over a decade. Suddenly, the dispute made a lot more sense. It was a tiny problem, but this neighbor had a ton of time invested in it. Plus, he used a lot of keywords, such as fair and unfair. I realized that this dispute was no longer about the land for this neighbor; it was about getting his fair share.&nbsp;

**2\. Understand and validate them.** Try to put yourself in their shoes. If you were in this person’s position, how would you feel? If you can begin to see things from their side, you can begin to validate their feelings. Often, this is the first step toward reaching an agreement.&nbsp;

It’s still possible to buy a great home in this market.

**3\. Look for win-win situations.** Property disputes often get heated because both parties feel like it’s a zero-sum game. However, this is rarely the case. I’m not an attorney, but from a sales perspective, you should disclose your boundary dispute to your buyers. I would also encourage your buyers to speak with the neighbor and discuss the issue with them. Often, without the personal history, things can work out.

Hopefully, you found today’s topic helpful. If you have questions about today’s topic or need a mediator in your property dispute, please call or email me. I am always willing to help.
