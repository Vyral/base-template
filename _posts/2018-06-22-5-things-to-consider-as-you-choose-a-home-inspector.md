After your offer has been accepted, the next step in the home buying process is the inspection.&nbsp;

Home inspections allow you to uncover potential issues with the home before the deal is finalized. This presents you with the opportunity to negotiate the price of the listing, ask the seller to cover repairs, or even to walk away from the deal if the inspection reveals something you find to be unacceptable.

When my clients reach this point in their transaction, it is my responsibility to advise them on which of these choices they should proceed with. But there is another critical decision to be made before this choice will ever arise. Buyers should be careful when choosing an inspection company, to make sure the person they hire is truly adept to handle the job. There are five things I recommend buyers do when choosing an inspector:

**1. Check their qualifications.** Finding out what is included in your inspection and if the age or location of the home may require the attention of a specialized professional.&nbsp;<br><br>**2. Ask to see sample reports.** The more detailed the report, the better.

**3. Check their references.** Ask for the names and phone numbers of past clients who will be able to share their experiences with the company.&nbsp;<br><br>**4. Check if the company is affiliated with any memberships or organizations.** If an inspector carries a membership with any state or national organizations, it likely means they are engaged with continued education in their field.<br><br>**5. Check if they have errors and omission insurance.** Inspectors are only human, after all. So it is possible that they may miss something.

With these five things in mind, I also recommend that you tag along with the inspector you choose as they look over the listing. This will allow them to point out their findings in real time. Do not be surprised if you see the inspector crawling around on the floor or scaling the roof. It is the inspectorâ€™s job to make sure you are protected against unpleasant surprises.&nbsp;

The bottom line is this: Work with a professional inspector who you feel you can trust, so that you can make an educated decision as you move forward with your home purchase.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
