The Flathead Lake real estate market is changing fast, and if you’re planning to make a move this year, you need to stay informed. **That’s why today, I’m breaking down what happened in 2024 and explaining what the numbers mean for your plans this year.**

Waterfront homes had a solid year with 29 sales in 2024, up from 26 in 2023. That’s great news for sellers, but buyers are facing limited inventory—there are only 26 homes for sale right now, with just three pending. This means **the market has less than a year’s supply of homes, making it competitive for buyers.** If you’re selling, realistic pricing is key because overpriced homes are sitting unsold.

The condo market is another story. Sales dropped by half compared to 2023, primarily due to limited inventory. Even so, demand hasn’t gone away. Properties are still selling, and there is an opportunity for a rebound if more condos hit the market in 2025.

**Vacant land is the rarest asset on Flathead Lake right now.** Sales fell from eight in 2023 to five in 2024—not because buyers aren’t interested, but because there are so few lots available. Only three vacant properties are currently listed, making the land highly competitive. Buyers should act fast and come prepared to make strong offers.

Overall, **Flathead County stayed steady**, with sales figures matching 2023. However, across western Montana, transaction volumes are half of what they were in 2020. The market is adjusting, but prices have slightly increased, and activity is expected to pick up in early 2025 if interest rates decline.

What does this all mean for your buying or selling plans in 2025? In my opinion, what happens in the first quarter of this year will tell us a lot about the future of our market. Sellers could see more activity if buyers enter the market, and buyers might find better opportunities as inventory increases. Being prepared and informed is the best way to get ahead no matter what your plans are.
