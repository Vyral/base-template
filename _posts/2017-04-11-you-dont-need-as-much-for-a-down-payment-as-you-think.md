I’ve talked to a lot of first-time homebuyers recently that are under the impression that they need to save up a lot of money for their down payment. You should know that there are plenty of down payment options out there for different loans.
<br>
<br>You don’t need 10% or 20% to purchase a home. In fact, **you can get into a home with FHA financing for just 3.5% down.** Rather than saving for years to get to that level, let’s talk about getting you into a home now so you can start looking sooner rather than later and lock in a low rate with a low down payment.

If you have any questions for me or want to hear more about the different financing options out there, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
