There’s a saying in the real estate business: When you sell a house, you’re not just selling it once—you’re selling it three times: once to the buyer, once to the lender, and once to the appraiser.&nbsp;

**Failure by agents and sellers to take this into account when selling a home has led to the downfall of many real estate transactions. How does this happen, though?**

To give you an example, there was a time in California when home prices were accelerating so rapidly that buyers were bidding tens of thousands of dollars over list price. They recognized that the property wouldn’t appraise, and they planned on negotiating the price back down based on the appraisal, which was tied to actual prior sales.&nbsp;

We don’t have that type of crazy market here, but nonetheless, while buyers, sellers, and agents may all be convinced of a home’s value, the appraiser has a set of rules they follow to determine that home’s value. This is based on various professional standards and the rules of various parties they have looking over their shoulders.

So how does the appraisal process work? **Dave Baka, the vice president of mortgage lending with Guaranteed Rate Affinity (GRA), describes it as follows:&nbsp;**

“The appraiser prepares his appraisal, or opinion of value, which is typically reviewed by an appraisal management company (also known as an AMC). Providing the appraisal passes the AMC’s quality control test, it’s then passed onto the lender. The lender has underwriters on staff who review the appraisal to ensure the appraisal is satisfactory to the lender. If all goes well, the appraisal is approved. There can be communications back and forth between these players and adjustments may be required in arriving at a final approval of an appraised value.&nbsp;

An approved appraisal doesn’t necessarily translate to an approved loan, however. If the appraisal is less than the approved contract price of the home, negotiations between the homebuyer and seller then ensue to arrive at an acceptable price, typically requiring additional cash from the buyer or a reduction in sales price from the seller, and sometimes both.&nbsp;

Sometimes neither party agrees and the deal blows up completely. Fortunately, more often than not, the buyer and seller, with the assistance of their experienced and skilled (one hopes) agents, are able to arrive at a decision or compromise that’s acceptable to both buyer and seller. Proper pricing in the beginning by the seller, with the assistance of a skilled agent who understands key appraisal limitations, can minimize the likelihood of an under-appraisal. Buyers and sellers with skilled agents can minimize the stress should a property under-appraise.”&nbsp;
