<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Our market has slowed, but you can still buy and sell amid COVID-19.</em></p> 

During the pandemic, I keep getting asked the same questions: How’s the market, and am I still selling homes? When the health crisis hit, we were in a very busy market here in Chicago. We’re now a month into the shelter-in-place order, so naturally, the market has slowed. However, if you’re still considering buying, selling, or investing in real estate, please give me a call, I’d love to speak with you. Homes are still being bought and sold, even during the coronavirus. To hear my full message, watch the short video above.
