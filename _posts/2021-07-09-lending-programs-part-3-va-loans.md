Last time, we discussed the different programs available to assist buyers. Today I’m joined once again by lender Abel Tejeda, who is here to answer questions about VA loans in particular. The VA home loan is specifically designated for veterans and those still active in the military. It’s an excellent program for down payments, credit lenience, and the benefits it provides to those with disabilities.

**What is the credit requirement for the VA loan program?**

The VA loan is probably the most lenient loan available in the country. After the pandemic, the necessary credit score to qualify rose to 640, but as of a couple of weeks ago, all you need to qualify is a score of 580. 620 is the optimum score to get a better rate.

**Can those in active duty apply their housing pay to their mortgages?**

Those in active duty can apply 125% of their BAH, BAS, and any permanent entitlements toward their mortgage qualification. That means, for example, if they’re getting $1,000 in housing pay, we can use $1,250 to help them qualify. **How does the VA loan program benefit disabled veterans?**

If you’re disabled, you can get the VA funding fee waived. That’s a lot of money—right now, it’s 2.3%. The average sales price here in San Diego is around $600,000, so on a home of that price, they could save around $12,000.

On top of that, if they’re completely disabled, they’re entitled to a property tax break once they purchase a home. The county recorder’s office can help calculate how much that will ultimately amount to. Mind you, that doesn't mean they’re tax-exempt, but they do get a huge tax break.

**What should homebuyers be aware of when it comes to the VA loan?**

First, there’s no longer a loan limit on VA loans, allowing veterans to purchase a home of any price as long as they qualify based on debt-to-income ratios.

Second, it’s a misconception to think that you’re only able to have one VA loan at a time—you can have multiples. However, when you have more than one loan, loan limits do come into play.
