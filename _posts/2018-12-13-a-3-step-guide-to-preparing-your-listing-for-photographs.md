If you are about to have a photographer capture pictures and videos of your listing, there are three areas of your property you’ll need to spruce up beforehand.

According to a study by the National Association of Realtors, 94% of buyers begin their home search online. This means that the photos and videos that represent a listing online are absolutely critical. They can make or break any listing.

Hiring a professional photographer to capture your home is a great first step, but this alone will not be enough. You will need to prepare your home before photos and videos are shot to make sure it looks its best, and today we’ll be highlighting the top three areas you should focus on as you do so:

**1. Your curb appeal.** You only get one chance to make a first impression, so you need to make sure your home makes a good one on potential buyers. Your walkways should be clean and clear and your landscaping should be neat and trimmed.

**2. Your kitchen.** It sounds obvious, but make sure your counters are clear of clutter before you let a photographer into your home. Kitchens are often a major selling point for buyers, so yours will need to shine in the photos and videos that appear of it online. How you live in a home is a lot different from how you list it. You need to see your home through the eyes of the photographer and the eyes of the buyer.

**3. Your bathrooms.** Similarly to what you must do with the kitchen counters, bathroom counters should also be cleared off. This can be difficult, as many of us tend to store toiletries and other personal products on these spaces, but it is important nonetheless.&nbsp;
