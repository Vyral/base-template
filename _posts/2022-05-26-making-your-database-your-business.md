Your database is your business, and your business is your database\! We’re sure you’ve heard this before, but we want to chat about it because it is crucial to building a successful business.

We know all about databases here at The Wolek Group because databases are where people live. Your buyers, sellers, clients, friends, and everyone else you know and want to help should be in your database.

**We believe everything starts with the lead-generation model, which begins with four laws of lead generation.** If you want to follow along, you can find this on page 38 of “The Millionaire Real Estate Agent.”&nbsp;

Numbers one and two are to build your database and feed it every day. Building it means putting all your people in one place, and feeding it means you are adding to your database daily. Maybe it’s a new person or new data about a person; either way, it’s important.&nbsp;

We also must communicate with our database in a systematic way, which is the third step. This is your touch plan, your marketing, the conversations you have with your database, etc. Finally, for step four, service all the leads that come your way. When you finally get the opportunity to help them buy or sell a home, deliver an excellent experience. Have a system and communication plan so that they have a great time. Hold their hand through the entire process because your goal is to generate repeat and referral business and reviews.&nbsp;

We also need to know what you’re going to say when you have the opportunity to talk to your database. If you haven’t been great about keeping in touch with your database, it’s okay; just start at the beginning. This is called a care call or a check-in call. Ask them how they’re doing or what’s new with them.&nbsp;

You might need to reestablish your relationship. Maybe you’ve gotten off track and feel weird calling them. In this case, what if you called them to say happy birthday or happy home anniversary? You aren’t using this phone call to sell them anything; you don’t want to turn them off, especially if you haven't stayed in touch.&nbsp;

The last thing in the call category is what if you don’t naturally have the gift of gab? **We use the F.O.R.D. script to help us remember important things to talk about when calling people from our database.** This acronym stands for family, occupation, recreation, and dreams. Each one is a conversation topic to get people talking, and guess what happens when you bring them up? They’ll begin asking you similar questions in return.&nbsp;

You also want to implement social media; it’s part of our world. Maybe as you’re making your quarterly calls to your database, confirm you are Facebook friends with them or like some of their posts on Instagram or LinkedIn.&nbsp;

You have to be a real person when it comes to social media, not a salesperson. We really like the phrase, “It’s better to be interested than interesting.” Don’t beat yourself up about what you’re going to post or say today. Instead focus on engaging with your people. **You don’t have to be the wittiest or funniest person to get likes; those will come naturally.&nbsp;**

Another thing we like to do is alternate our post messages. When we’re being more personal,&nbsp; we might mention something like our kids, our dog, being out and about in our city and community, etc.&nbsp;

Lastly, we need to know our buckets. When you’re posting on social media, what is something you’re passionate about that others might find value in as well? These could be things like cooking, travel, exercising, getting out and about, etc.&nbsp;

Let us know how you are utilizing your database, how you’re communicating with your database, and other ways you are focusing on making your business your database and your database is your business. We look forward to hearing from you\!
