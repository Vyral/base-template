<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you’re thinking of buying your first home, the first thing you should do is meet with a lender. Here’s why.</em></p>

What’s the first thing you should do if you’re thinking about purchasing a home?

The advice we give to our clients when they ask us this question is to **meet with a lender.** Before meeting with your lender, though, there are a few questions you need to ask yourself, according to Jake Bernhard of United Heritage Credit Union.

First of all, how much do you have saved for a down payment? Also, how much can you afford to pay out each month for your mortgage payment? How will that affect the funds you use to make other monthly payments (auto loans, credit card loans, etc.)?

**Once you know your budget and how big of a down payment you can afford, you’ll have a better idea of what kind of house you can qualify to buy.** When contacting a lender, it’s always a good idea to have your financial information at hand. Key documents include your most recent bank statement, your W-2s from the previous two years, and your most recent pay stub. If you’re self-employed, have your tax returns from the previous two years handy.&nbsp;

If you’re not a first-time buyer but are considering upsizing and think you can double your current mortgage payment, give yourself a couple of months to save the necessary funds. Pretend you’re making a double mortgage payment by putting half of your budget toward your actual mortgage payment and keeping the other half in a savings account. That will indicate whether you’ll be comfortable paying your new mortgage or if it’s too much of a stretch.&nbsp;

As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help.
