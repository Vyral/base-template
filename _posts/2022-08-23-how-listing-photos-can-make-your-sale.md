One key to selling your home quickly and for top dollar is taking great listing photos—there’s no way around it\! Having high-quality photos can make or break your home sale. All of us are drawn to photos that look better, and if your goal is to attract people to your house, you’ve got to start here. I’ve even had a seller client who almost didn’t want to sell her home after seeing the great photos we took for her\! Pictures impact people’s emotions and opinions.&nbsp;

It is important to have good angles, lighting, and the whole nine yards. **Hire someone who takes photos with a real camera instead of just their phone.** They also need to have the experience and training to know how to get the best photo possible.&nbsp;
