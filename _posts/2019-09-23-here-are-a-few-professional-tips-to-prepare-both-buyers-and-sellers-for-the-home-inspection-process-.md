<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Here are a few professional tips to prepare both buyers and sellers for the home inspection process.</em></p>

If you’re thinking of buying a home, you might be wondering if you really need to get a home inspection. And if you’re selling a home, you might wonder about how to prepare for that inspection. Today we’ll follow the HomeTeam Inspection Service as they undergo an inspection, and hopefully, their advice will help answer both parties’ questions about this critical stage of the real estate process.

**Feel free to follow along in the video above, or use the timestamps below to navigate the video at your leisure:**

The HomeTeam’s checklist is a great boon to homeowners preparing their home for the market. For those buying a home, it will also give you an idea of what actually goes on during a home inspection. If you’d like a copy, send me an email with “home inspection” in the subject line.

We can also send you a handout detailing the 150 steps it takes to sell your home faster and for more money. For a copy of this handout, send me an email with “selling your home fast” in the subject line.
