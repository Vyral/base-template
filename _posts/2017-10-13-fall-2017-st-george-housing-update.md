Friends and Clients —

 Fall is upon us, (the best season :) ), and with what it what can be some of the STRONGEST months in St. George Real Estate.

 And if you're thinking you've missed your chance to sell your home, let me reassure you…..

 **This autumn actually presents a fantastic moment to sell.** Here's why.

 First off, housing inventory is still incredibly low. In some areas of St. George inventory is so low that we’re selling homes BEFORE THEY EVER HIT THE MARKET!

 In fact, according to data from the Census Bureau and the National Association of Realtors, inventory remains well below historic averages, and is 50% less than the peak in 2006….and we thought no market could ever be that hot again. Go figure!

 Second, while mortgage rates also remain very low, recent announcements by the Federal Reserve might cause them to finally start rising.

 This would make mortgages less affordable and **might turn away a significant number of potential buyers.**

 This is even more of a concern when you consider the continuing growth of home prices—6.9% in the last year alone.

 Third, contrary to conventional wisdom, Fall is generally a great time to list your home.

 **Buyers in the Fall are likely to be more serious** because they have probably been searching for months without success. (For more on that, check out our recent post on <a href="http://gostgeorge.blogspot.com/2016/08/st-george-real-estate-agent-tips-for_17.html" target="_blank">bidding wars</a>.)

 Also, because fewer homes are listed in the fall, **this means there's even less competition** than we’ve seen due to the general low inventory.

 **So what do you get when you put all those things together?**

 Arguably the finest home-selling environment St. George has seen in a decade. Some will wait because it makes sense, others will wait because they’re trying to “time” the market….and will look back with regret.

 **Here are a few resources to help you with whatever next steps you are considering:**
