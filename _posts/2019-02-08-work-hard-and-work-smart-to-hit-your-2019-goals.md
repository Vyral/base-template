It’s crazy to think about, but we’re already about 8% done with 2019. Are you making significant progress with your 2019 goals?

I’ve had the opportunity to speak with many agents over the past few days, and I’m impressed with the energy and commitment they’ve demonstrated in accomplishing their goals. This experience also made me think of a personal story I want to share with you that relates to today’s topic: **How we apply our energy toward our goals.**

Back when I was 16 years old, I worked for my dad’s construction company. One day he asked me to deliver a dump truck to a job site in Nevada. I’d only recently learned how to drive a stick shift, but I agreed to it. During the drive, though, as I worked the truck into fifth gear, it would only go as fast as 45 miles per hour. At the same time, I noticed the RPM gauge redlining. We were putting a huge amount of stress on the engine, but we were barely making 45 miles per hour.

After a while, I pulled over at a gas station and called my dad (remember—this was before everyone had cell phones). When I explained the situation, I heard him laugh on the other end of the line. As it turned out, that particular truck was a split transmission. Basically, there was a switch on the stick shift that allowed you to switch over to another transmission with higher gears, but I completely missed it. All those other gears were available to me the whole time I was overheating the engine just to get to 45 miles per hour, and I had no idea.

I see a lot of agents putting a ton of time and energy into accomplishing their goals, which is great, but I’m also worried that some of them will burn out because they’re not putting their energy into the right activities that will produce optimum results.

For me to get into sixth, seventh, eight, and ninth gear in that truck, all it took was noticing a minor detail on the stick shift. Realistically, all some agents need is a small tweak in their energy and focus to really hit all of their goals for 2019. **You don’t need to apply twice the amount of energy to duplicate your goals—you only need to change how you apply your energy.**

If you think you need to change how you apply your energy in accomplishing your goals, there are a couple of questions you need to ask yourself.

First, is your time blocking designed to match your goals in 2019? You need to commit to protecting your time—both your business time and your personal time.

Second, are you spending enough time on dollar-producing activities? You don’t want to be maxing out your RPMs while only going 45 miles per hour.

If you have any questions about the best way to apply your energy toward your 2019 goals, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you achieve your greatest success this year!
