Don’t believe the hype; winter is a perfectly viable time to sell your home.

This week we’re going to talk about selling your home in the winter.

Many people think that homes don’t sell in the winter. Surprisingly enough, you’d be amazed at the number of sales that we have in the winter.

Let’s face it—when you have to sell your home, you have to sell your home, whether it’s winter or summer. However, if you have the convenience of waiting, many people prefer to do that.

**Waiting can often be a mistake.** Inventories in the fall tend to drop down, and buyers have fewer choices to pick from, which can often drive the pricing up on your home that is for sale.

The other thing is that in the summertime, you typically have more showings than in the winter, but **often you get a lot of what we call “looky-loos”** out there shopping and half-heartedly looking around. A lot of people like to go to open houses and look at homes for remodeling purposes.

**In the wintertime, you have fewer showings. However, those buyers are typically more serious.** They’re not out dragging themselves through the snow because it’s fun, but because they need a home.

Do not be afraid to put your property on the market in the winter. Yes, it is slower, but property still sells.
