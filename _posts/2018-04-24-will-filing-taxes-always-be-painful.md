I just wanted to bring you a quick message. I know you’ve been thinking about buying a house, but right now is an especially painful time for you. **You’re probably realizing that you could have saved a few thousand dollars more this year if you had just purchased a house.**

When you pay your landlord, you’re throwing away that money and investing in their mortgage. When you own the home, you’re investing in your own home by paying your mortgage. **You can get huge tax benefits, and at least a few more thousand dollars in your pocket.**

**Give me a call now to get your home purchase started today** so that next year when you file, you’re filing with a smile on your face. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
