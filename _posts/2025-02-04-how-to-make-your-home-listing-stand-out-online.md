How can you make your property stand out from the competition? I’m proud of the way we showcase our clients’ homes on the market. Early on, I learned that presenting your home online is crucial, and that’s why when a client lists their property with me, I put in time and effort to ensure it looks beautiful online.

I’ll be honest: before the pandemic, I focused on providing a full luxury digital marketing experience for higher-end listings. However, I didn’t always offer the same level of detail for some of my entry-level, lower-price-point listings. Things have changed, and I believe every property deserves the best representation possible.

Homebuyers nowadays expect to know everything about the property before they schedule a visit. That means having access to virtual tours, beautiful high-resolution digital photography, and interactive floor plans where you can click on dots to explore each room. **Buyers want to engage with the home digitally before they decide to visit.**

To meet these expectations, I create customized websites and use 3D dollhouse tours to give a comprehensive view of the home. I even use drones to capture aerial shots to make your property stand out.

I understand that selling your home is a bittersweet experience: happy to be moving on but a little sad because you’ll be leaving a house with many memories. My goal as your Realtor is to commemorate that bittersweet moment by presenting your home in the best way possible.

**Digital marketing is everything in real estate.** While it does cost money and requires experience and know-how, I believe it’s worth it. Unlike many agents who just take your listing and wait for calls, I focus on beautifully showcasing your home. If your property doesn’t sell on your terms, I want you to feel confident that I did everything possible to make it shine.
