When selling a home, there's nothing better than receiving multiple offers. The problem is deciding which offer to accept. It goes without saying that every offer isn't created equal, but it can be difficult to determine the best one. Today, we want to share some tips that might help you during the process.

Recently, an incident happened to one of our team members we thought we should share. They submitted an offer with everything that's needed in our Tuscon market and gave it to the listing agent. The listing agent responded by telling us the seller didn't want to entertain any contingency offers. Our offer was contingent on the closing - our client already had their house under contract, had the inspections and appraisals completed, but was simply waiting for the official close.

We had to explain to the listing agent that over 70% of the buyers in the market have contingencies of some sort - they need to get equity out of an existing property in order to make their next purchase. That's why, when you're selling, you should expect certain contingencies when you receive an offer. The important thing is to separate the offers that have inconvenient contingencies from those that have minor ones. We are experts at this and would love to help.

If you have any questions about accepting offers, or have any general real estate questions, don't hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to hear from you!
