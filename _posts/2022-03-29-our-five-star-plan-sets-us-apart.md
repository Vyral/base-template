The key thing that sets us apart from other Realtors is that we’re design-forward. We sell with style**. We prepare our homes by professionally cleaning, staging, and marketing them with HD photography and a full 3D walk-through.** We also provide all of our buyers with a one-year home warranty.

We do all of this because we don’t want our sellers to have to worry about a thing. We cover all the costs involved with our five-star plan, which allows our buyers to move into a home that’s ready for them. This process helps sellers improve their home’s aesthetic, and buyers will pay more money because they see the value in what we’ve done.

Once we recognized that visual marketing is the key to getting more for our sellers’ homes, we came up with this plan, and it works. **We sold more homes last year than we ever have just by implementing our five-star plan.**

If you’re interested in selling your home, reach out today, and we’ll get a walk-through set up to plan the next steps to get your home sold for top dollar. If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to contact us via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
