What’s the latest news from our real estate market? I recently came across an interesting article about the effect of rising housing supply that I’d like to share with you. This trend impacts buyers and sellers in our market. If you’re a buyer, it means more options are arriving, so the time to act is now. If you’re a seller, it means you shouldn’t wait much longer to sell.&nbsp;

Watch the video above in its entirety to listen to me explain the main points of the article. **You can read the article in its entirety**[**here**](https://www.wardrealtyservices.com/blog/supply-rising/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**.**&nbsp;

If you have questions about this or any real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.
