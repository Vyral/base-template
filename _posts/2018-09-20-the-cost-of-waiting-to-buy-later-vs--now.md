  Does waiting to buy seem like the right decision for you? It may not be. To
  help me explain why this is, I have invited Steve Hankla from Doorway Home
  Loans to take a look at the cost of you waiting instead of buying now. Since
  the market is expected to correct itself which could mean higher interest
  rates.

Should you buy now or wait? I have been asked this by potential buyers a lot recently because of how home prices have increased over the last 10 years. To help me answer this question, I have invited Steve Hankla of Doorway Home Loans to talk about what it costs today to buy a home versus what it may cost a year from now.
