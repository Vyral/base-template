Should you buy now or wait? I have been asked this by potential buyers a lot recently because of how home prices have increased over the last 10 years. To help me answer this question, I have invited Steve Hankla of Doorway Home Loans to talk about what it costs today to buy a home versus what it may cost a year from now.
