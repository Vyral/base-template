**How We Helped Ronni By Being Responsive**
<br>
<br>“I bought a home. I was looking online and I came across one of Michael’s listings. I spoke to other realtors as well but, I kept coming back to Michael. I thought I was going to move down to Fort Charlotte. So, I went down to visit and we looked at some properties and I ended up picking something out! It was a long distance transaction because I live in Connecticut. If I had any questions he was quick to get back to me, no matter who was selling the home. He was very helpful. Once I had decided on a property, Wendy arranged for the inspection and handled everything for me. She did everything for me. I didn’t have to do anything and it was a very very easy experience.”\*
