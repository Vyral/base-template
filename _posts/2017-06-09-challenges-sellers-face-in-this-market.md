One of the common questions we’re asked when we’re in a seller’s market is, “Is it easy to sell homes?” It is easier to sell homes in a seller’s market, but that comes with a host of challenges as well.
<br>
<br>One of the challenges is the appraisal coming in low. A typical appraisal will come in at the purchase price in 90% of the cases, but in a seller’s market you have multiple bids coming in from buyers who want that home. To get around that situation, people are offering up to $20,000 above list price and waiving appraisal contingencies to win the bid.
<br>
<br>**But is that home worth what they’re asking?** That’s what a bank appraisal is for. The bank comes in to say what it’s worth. When you hire an appraiser, they will look at comparable sales like a good listing agent would.
<br>
<br>So, what exactly does it mean when an appraisal comes in low? Say a seller and a buyer agree to a purchase price of $100,000. When it comes in low, it might appraise at $80,000, so typically the two parties will renegotiate the purchase price.
<br>
<br>**Either the seller gives up that additional $20,000 or the buyer agrees to pay the additional money over the appraisal value.** Someone who didn’t have that additional money in their budget may lose out on that home due to a low appraisal.
<br>
<br>One way to get around that is to price your home competitively and going with an offer that is strong and matches what is an acceptable selling price for you.
<br>
<br>Another challenge that we’re seeing in this market right now is selling your home quickly, but not having anywhere to move. We’ve had clients sell their homes in just a few days and not have enough time to find another property before the buyer wanted to move in.
<br>
<br>A good listing agent will combat that problem by an upfront negotiation of what we call “possession,” which means that **you will be able to stay in your home until you find suitable housing.** Another option if you’re planning on selling your home and buying a new property is to plan on renting for three to six months after you sell your home. I just sold my home recently and that is what I did.

<br>
<br>**Another challenge that we’re seeing for sellers is buyers are wanting to waive inspections but then come back later requesting a repair.** Make sure that you as the seller give shorter inspection periods, as well as giving buyers access to the property. A lot of sellers are accepting offers from buyers who have never even seen the home, and then they walk through the property and they don’t even want it anymore.
<br>
<br>**Additionally, it’s best to not accept an offer for the first 7 days**to give people enough time to walk through the property and allow you to receive quality offers. It may also be a good idea to prepare to accept a primary offer, and perhaps one or two backup offers for your home. This market is incredibly tight right now, so you need to be prepared for that occurrence.
<br>
<br>Finally, I wanted to address a common fear that home sellers have: “What if my home isn’t selling?” **There’s usually a pretty solid reason why the home doesn’t sell in its first 15 or 30 days on the market: it’s overpriced, the condition isn’t solid and may need some small renovations or updates, or needs to be restaged.** If that’s the case with your home, we’ll take it off the market after 60 days and spend two weeks updating the interior and reassessing the listing price.
