When selling your home, there are five costly mistakes you should try to avoid:

{% include pullquote.html %}

1. **Mispricing your home:** This is common because everybody thinks their house is more valuable than their neighbor's. If you price too low, you can leave money on the table and if you price too high, you won't get any offers. Then, as buyers look at other homes, they'll start thinking there's something wrong with yours. Price is the most critical point in presenting your home.
2. **Not doing necessary repairs before listing:** Most people just want to move on without investing in their home, but if you want to get the most value, it's better to do these repairs first. Buyers don't want to have to buy a house and then put in the sweat equity themselves; they don't see the future value.
3. **Not presenting the home correctly:** This means not staging it or not depersonalizing your home. Think of the buyerâ€“they want to imagine living there, not see all your clutter. Make your home open so buyers can see themselves living there.
4. **Not having professional photos:** This is a critical aspect of presenting your home because 90% to 95% of people now start their home search on the Internet by looking at photos. If you don't have professional photos, your house will not stand out. Hiring a professional will pay itself off in the long run.
5. **Not hiring a real estate professional:** Hiring a professional can be expensive, yes, but they will take care of all the little things I've mentioned like getting professional photos and marketing your home. They'll also have a team behind them to help you through this stressful process.
