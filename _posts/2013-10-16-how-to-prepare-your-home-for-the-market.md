{% include youtube.html %}Homeowners ask me all the time how they should get their home ready for the market. Well, I have a list for you! This list tells you how to prepare your home for showings, photographs and appraisals!

So, let’s start on the outside. You want your home to have curb appeal. This means fresh cut grass, hedges are trimmed, seasonal flowers are planted, etc. Make sure everything is fresh!

Now, once you’re inside, the two main focal points are the kitchen and master bedroom. Clean off all counters and put away the dirty dishrag!  For the bedroom, make the bed and put away all clutter.

In your dining room, set a simple place setting. It helps the buyer imagine living in the home. Open the drapes in your entire house to make it feel airy and spacious.

Your main goal is to make your home appeal to as many buyers as possible. Clean the home, inside and out!

These are just a few things you can do to get your home ready for market.
