Our team’s head stager Shani Weiss and I are back at our beautiful listing at 24 Lincoln Street in Demarest, New Jersey to show you the difference between sterilizing a home and neutralizing it before it’s on the market.

To demonstrate how we approach every room, we will focus on this home’s living room. When we did our initial consultation, the room had beautiful red damask wallpaper. That wallpaper, though, was too specific, so we painted the room in a nice, neutral color. Once we decluttered the room, we also found some gorgeous furnishings that were owned by the homeowner.

From there, we decided extra furniture was unnecessary. All it needed was some trendy items and accessories (pillows, fabrics, etc.) to make it come alive. **We always try to stay on trend and add color to rooms to help them visually pop**, and here we refashioned the room’s white sofa by adding a few cerulean blue pillows. Suddenly, that traditional sofa became a more updated, more transitional sofa.

**Someone without our unique perspective on design and home sales might have just taken everything out of this room, which would have been sterilizing it instead of neutralizing it.**

Across the room, you will see a bench that was originally in another part of the home that Shani added to the room because its color matched that of the added pillows. Between those two items, you will see a big, empty coffee table that Shani was able to make more exciting, personable, and marketable.

But that is a story for our next video, so stay tuned for the next installment of our home staging series.

In the meantime, if you have any questions about home staging or you are thinking of buying or selling a home soon in our market, please feel free to reach out to us. My team and I would love to help you.
