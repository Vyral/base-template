How much do you know about what’s truly going on in today’s market? **Contrary to what you might have heard from friends and the media, homes are indeed selling.** While the market's pace has eased compared to recent years, homeowners are witnessing sold signs appearing in yards every day. By analyzing current home sale data, I can confirm this trend.

We're set to exceed 4 million home sales nationwide this year, equating to around 11,000 homes sold daily across the country. Breaking it down further, that's roughly 450 homes per hour or eight homes every minute. In Louisville, about 64 homes go under contract daily, which is roughly three per hour.

Just last week, I listed a home and received an offer through community buzz before it even hit the MLS. Within hours, the client and I had a full-priced cash offer, sparking a bidding war. Feel free to contact me for more details.

This isn't just talk—it's a hot market. **We back our claims with action and due diligence.** To see the proof, reach out to me. If you've delayed selling because of market uncertainty, rest assured that there's no need to worry. If you're considering selling, don't hesitate to call anytime at (502) 376-5483. I’d be happy to help you!
