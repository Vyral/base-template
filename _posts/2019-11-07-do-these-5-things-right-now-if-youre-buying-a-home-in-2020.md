<center><em>If you&rsquo;re gearing up to buy a home next year, follow these five steps.</em></center>

&nbsp;

Buying a home is nothing to take lightly. There are many important decisions and critical steps to take as you work toward this goal, and many of these steps come before you even start your home search.&nbsp;

**If you’re thinking of buying a home in 2020, there are a few things you need to do now to prepare:**

1. Check your credit score and work on improving it, if necessary.
2. Avoid opening new lines of credit
3. Ask for financial gifts from relatives over the holidays to help fund your purchase.
4. Talk with a lender and get pre-approved for a mortgage.
5. Give Vision Realty a call and let us put you on the path to real estate success.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are ready to start working toward buying your next home, feel free to give me or my team a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
