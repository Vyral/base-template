When selling your home, it is very important that you price it properly.

The success of many other facets of your home sale boils down to whether you price your home properly or not. Studies show time and time again that **if you overprice your property, you’ll likely sell it for below its market value.**

Overpricing your home will cause it to sit on the market longer, which will force you to go through several different price reductions. These price reductions will make the home look stale, and the longer your home stays on the market, the more apt buyers are to think there’s something wrong with it. Furthermore, they’ll assume they’ll be able to lowball you due to the perceived lack of interest in the home.

This is why I advise all sellers to **sit down with their agent and set an appropriate price for their home.** Not doing so can cost you up to tens of thousands of dollars.

If you have any questions, you’d like to know the market value of your home, or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
