After you define the market, message, and medium you’ll use to deliver your messages, it’s important to understand the different kinds of leads these messages will generate. The book “Predictable Revenue” by Aaron Ross and Marylou Tyler places leads in three categories: seeds, nets, and spears. Seeds are leads you receive by word of mouth, nets are those you’ve received through inbound marketing, and spears are those you’ve gotten via outbound marketing. When you implement a strong outbound strategy, many of your leads will fall into this last category, and your revenue will become more predictable as a result. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
