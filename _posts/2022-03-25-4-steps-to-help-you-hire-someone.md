Many people in the real estate industry become burnt out because they don’t have leverage; it’s an epidemic. They don’t have anyone helping them with marketing, social media, transaction coordination, assistance with showings, etc.&nbsp;

Ultimately, if you do too many things for too long, you’re average at all of them, and that can lead to burnout. I’m passionate about leverage, so I’m sharing the four steps to making your next hire so you can take your business to the next level and get some time back for your friends, family, and most importantly, yourself, which is crucial for your well-being.&nbsp;

These are the four key steps to hiring someone to help you:

**1\. Create a savings account.** Make sure you have four to six months’ worth of that next hire’s salary in the account. There’s nothing worse than not having an emergency fund when you hire someone. Having that money saved will give you peace of mind and time to start lead generating and get your finances in order so you can pay them.

**2\. Delegate and elevate.** I want you to Google “unique ability, delegate and elevate framework”. It’s a chart and framework to help you decide what you need to delegate next. It’ll help you come up with lists of activities that bring both the lowest and highest return on investment in your business. You’ll be able to see that those low-return activities should be done by someone else so you can focus on the high-return ones.&nbsp;

**3\. Develop a position description.** This is an outline of the things you’ll be delegating to your new hire.&nbsp;

**4\. Interview and hire someone.** Interviewing and hiring someone is a whole different process. If you’ve never hired someone before, it can take quite a bit of time. If you private message me, I’ll provide you with all of our interview and hiring questions that we’ve been using for the past three to five years. As a bonus, I’ll share our pre-written position description for the very position you’re hiring for. These will save you a bunch of time and get you further faster.

If you have questions about these four steps or anything else, call me at (717) 216-0860 or email [dave@davehooketeam.com](mailto:dave@davehooketeam.com). I would love to help you.
