As we head into the summer months, let us take a moment to examine the current state of the housing market. Many people have been asking us if the market feels a little strange lately. We think that overall, it’s still the same, but somehow there’s truth to that; the market does seem a little bit different this year.

While we are still experiencing a very traditional spring market, concerns from both buyers and sellers remain the same. So, what makes this spring market different? There are two main factors:

**1\. Unpredictable transactions.** Some homes are selling quickly with multiple offers, while others are stagnating on the market. Transactions are a bit more unpredictable, and there is no particular reason why this happens, but one factor that impacts this trend is the economy in general, which is affecting rates.

**2\. Townhomes in the market.** In the past few years, single-level living options (with or without basements) and patio homes featuring main-floor master bedrooms, laundry, and HOA amenities usually get snatched up the moment they are on the market. But now, we’ve seen a few of those still available for sale longer than usual. This isn’t a major concern since this is a reflection of a more traditional timeline for these types of homes. We’ve just become used to the fast turnover of these kinds of homes in recent years.<br>

Now that we’re approaching the early part of summer this June, things tend to get unpredictable in the real estate world. Based on past years, activity slows down slightly as families adjust to summer schedules, vacations, and kids’s activities.

While the market slowing down doesn’t necessarily mean that there will be fewer showings if you are selling your house during this time, it's good to keep that in mind, especially if you are planning to move late in the spring or early in the summer.

Hopefully, this helped you understand the market better and ease some of your concerns about it. If you have any questions or would like to discuss them further, reach out to us. Call, send us an email, or DM us; we would be happy to talk with you.<br>
