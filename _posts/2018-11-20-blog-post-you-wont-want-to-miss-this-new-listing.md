At 3814 Southeast Martins Street, surrounded by mature trees on a hidden road, stands a hidden gem: The original house of Eastmoreland.

This Queen Anne, New England-style farmhouse was built in 1892, and its breathtaking Victorian character still shines today. It’s been an adored family home for the past 20 years, and some may remember it from the 1998 Disney Channel original film, “Halloweentown.”

On the outside, this three-story home has a large, dividable lot with lots of potential and three covered porches. **The interior main level features large, formal rooms with high ceilings that open into each other and really showcase the benefits of a Victorian floor plan**—not to mention all the exquisite, hand-milled woodwork and large picture windows. The large, open kitchen has original birdseye maple cabinetry built in and a farmhouse pantry with storage galore.

**The second level includes three large bedrooms and a separate family room/office**, and the master bedroom comes with an enclosed sitting porch. There are two staircases in this house, and the back staircase will take you all the way up to the third floor. This level has an open space with two additional bedrooms and a turret tower that is sure to inspire you. The open space is ready to become a new master suite, a bonus room, an art studio, or whatever your imagination fancies.

As a final touch, this home has two wood-burning fireplaces with handmade tiles and wood carvings.

The lucky new owners of this property will not only have an irreplaceable piece of Southeast Portland history, but they’ll also have the best of both worlds—they’ll have a direct path into the center of Eastmoreland and its top-rated schools and beautiful parks and they’ll be located only a few blocks away from the hot shops and local restaurants of Woodstock.

If you’d like to know more about this one-of-a-kind home or schedule a showing to see it live and in person, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
