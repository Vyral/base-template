What is the inspection period (also called due diligence)? This period is the time to do all your inspections and verify the condition of the house. We had a buyer about three months ago that couldn’t decide whether they wanted to do an inspection or not. You don’t need to do an inspection, but it is recommended.

When you hire an inspector, they will make sure everything is in working order. You should also get a termite and moisture inspection. If the home you're purchasing has a pool, consider a pool inspection. If the home was built before 1979, have a lead-based paint inspection. If the home is not on a public water system, get a septic inspection. **All these inspections will help protect you from making a purchase that you’d regret and ensure that you're happy with the home.**
