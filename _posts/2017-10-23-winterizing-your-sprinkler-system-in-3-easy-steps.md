To winterize your home’s sprinkler system and avoid costly damage, there are three steps you need to take. You can follow along in the video above as landscaping expert, Aaron Strong demonstrates these steps on a typical home sprinkler system.&nbsp;

First, go inside your home’s utility room and find the sprinkler feed that runs from the inside to the outside of the house. **Shut off the feed by flipping the lever 90 degrees so it runs parallel to the pipe.** Next, open up the drain beneath the lever by unscrewing the cap. Put a bucket underneath the drain to catch any excess water that trickles out of the pipe during steps two and three.&nbsp;

**Second, move to the outside of the home and turn off the valves on your backflow preventer and sprinkler manifold.** You can shot off the valves on your backflow preventer by turning them to a 45 degree angle. This will prevent any water that could be behind the ball valves from freezing by allowing it to escape. Turn the screws on the backflow preventer to a 45 degree angle as well. Some systems have a valve at the bottom of the pipe leading back into the house and some don’t, but if yours does, unscrew the cap and let the excess water drain out.&nbsp;

Some valves for the sprinkler manifold have automatic drains and some don’t. If yours has a manual drain, open it up so it drains all of the water out of the pipes in the manifold and there’s nothing left that could potentially freeze and bust the pipes.&nbsp;

Lastly, go back inside the utility room and **make sure the valve is open and draining properly.** That will allow the water that’s in the line to drain so there’s is no water outside in your backflow preventer. When that’s done draining, your system will be winterized and ready to go.&nbsp;
