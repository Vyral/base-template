Instead of purchasing a starter home, millennials are purchasing their dream home for their first home. Today I want to talk about this phenomenal new trend and explain why millennials are saving their money so they can put down a larger down payment on a larger home.&nbsp;

According to the National Association of Realtors, **30% of millennials are purchasing homes over $300,000.** That is up 14% since 2014. The definition of a starter home is a 1-, 2-, or 3-bedroom home with prices varying depending on the market. Here in Wilmington, the price range of a starter home is $100,000 to $250,000.&nbsp;

Part of the reason that we may be seeing this is because of increased competition in the lower price ranges. If you can wait and save up a little more money so you can buy in the $300,000 to $400,000 range as a first-time homebuyer, then you’ll face a lot less competition. In this range, there aren’t as many bidding wars or multiple offer situations.&nbsp;

If you are looking to buy a home in the Wilmington market, **my advice is to work with a seasoned real estate professional.** This person can help guide you in the right direction and talk to you about different locations and different price ranges.&nbsp;

You also need to have a qualified mortgage professional who can tell you exactly how much you can afford. You may be able to afford more home than you were thinking and that will take you out of the multiple offer situations and bidding wars seen in the lower price ranges.&nbsp;

If you have any additional questions or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
