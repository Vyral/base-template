{% include youtube.html %}Today I wanted to speak about four reasons why you should hire an agent to sell your home in Sacramento. A real estate agent can represent you and your best interests, so here are four reasons why you should hire one to sell your home.

1. Agents outsell FSBO's: A FSBO is a for sale by owner property. A Realtor can get you up to 6% more for your home, and that can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars in a sale. Studies show that homes priced correctly will sell faster and for more money.
2. You have a negotiator on your side: There are a lot of different people to negotiate with throughout the process of selling a home, and it pays dividends to know how to speak with these people and get their attention. Realtors already have relationships with these people, and you'll find it much easier for them to negotiate than doing so on your own.
3. Realtors have professional marketing experience: Real estate agents have the ability to display your home on hundreds of different websites and this is important because over 90% of buyers look online when they begin a home search.
4. More guidelines in the lending world: With all the rules and regulations in place in the lending world, it's increasingly difficult to sell your own home. We have partner lenders that simplify this entire process quite immensely.

If you have any further questions about how we can help you, please don't hesitate to ask. We can sell your home for more money, and in less time.

We hope to hear from you soon!
