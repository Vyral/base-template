In Utah, July is known for many things. One of the lesser-known things is the fact that it’s also the month we get our property tax assessment notices in the mail.

I’m not an expert as to how the county calculates property tax values, but I do know one thing: they’re not always on the mark. The assessment is comprised of your proposed tax assessment for 2016 and the change in value from 2015 to 2016.

We’ve been helping our clients dispute these tax evaluations for years, so **if you feel like your 2016 property tax assessment is too high, send us the front part of your notice.** We’ll take a look at the value and provide you with three to five comparable sales to your property that may show a lower value. You can then fill out the official appeal form and send it in by September 15th along with the comparable sales we provided you.

If you purchased your property in the past year and the purchase price was less than the assessed value, you can simply fill out the appeal form and send in the HUD settlement statement you signed at the title company.

If you had an appraisal done in 2016 or early 2017 that came in lower than the tax assessed value, you can send in a copy of that appraisal with your appeal form.

This is a free service we offer to our past clients, current clients, and anyone who’s sent us a referral. **Once you’ve sent in your appeal, you should know where you stand.** Hopefully, the final decision rendered by the county is one that benefits you.

If you have any other questions about disputing your property tax assessment or you’re looking to buy or sell a home in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to assist you.
