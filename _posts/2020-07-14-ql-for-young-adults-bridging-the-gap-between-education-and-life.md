Join us for an at-home Guide to Mega Growth for Young Adults\!

### **Event Details:**

This is a two-hour online event for ages 18-28 with the opportunity to apply for a $500 scholarship from Keys to the City for Tulsa-area students.

**July 24, 2020 12:00 p.m. - 2:00 p.m.**<br>Hosted By: Jennie Wolek + Brittany Whinery

Are you looking for a way out of fear and uncertainty? Right now, the world is offering an opportunity for each of us to step up and be leaders—to forge a path toward a brighter future.

It starts with you focusing on your own growth—putting your own oxygen mask on first. Maximize Your Potential is intended to help you do exactly that; to help you become a Waymaker.

**A Waymaker is someone who:**

* Has a clear purpose
* Finds a way in challenging times
* Paves a path that others can follow
* Steps up courageously and leads

Powered by the success materials found in Gary Keller’s Quantum Leap (QL), this learning experience is about understanding what matters most to you and utilizing proven models and tools to take action.

Choose to be a Waymaker for yourself and others. Let’s take action together\!

Additionally, our non-profit, Keys to the City, will be providing two (2) $500 scholarships to students who attend this workshop\!
