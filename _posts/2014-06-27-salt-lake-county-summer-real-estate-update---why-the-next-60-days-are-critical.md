In our latest video, we're sharing some recent developments in the Wasatch Front housing market, and what they mean for you. Our local market is on par with the nation as a whole, with pending home sales rising only one half of a percent since last month. While that's less than expected, here on the Wasatch Front we've seen a surge in home sales in the last 45 days. In fact, homes priced under $300,000 have less than a four month supply.

What does this mean for you?

For homeowners looking to sell, the next 60 days are crucial. Now is the perfect time to put your home on the market, as there's not enough inventory for all the people looking to buy,

For buyers, you have more of a selection than earlier this year, but there are a lot of buyers out there you'll have to compete with. This means you have to take a few extra steps to set yourself apart from the competition. Here's what you need to do:

* Work with an agent who knows how to win a multiple offer situation.
* Get pre-approved.
* Know the difference between must-haves and nice-to-haves.

The current surge in the market makes now an ideal time to consider buying or selling a home. Give us a call or shoot us an email and we'll help you take the right steps to make your move this summer.
