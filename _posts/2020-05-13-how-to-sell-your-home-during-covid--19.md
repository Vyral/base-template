<center><em>Our goal is to help serve your real estate needs no matter what.</em></center>

<br>We received an amazing response regarding <u><a target="_blank" href="https://hbrteamblog.com/the-relationship-between-recessions-and-the-housing-market.html">our last market update</a></u>. While it's a great time to sell, we'd like to ensure the process is being done correctly in order to get top dollar for your house. Those that went pending were priced right and cleaned inside and out, receiving multiple offers because of it.

Weâ€™re aware that everyone has a friend or relative that sells real estate. We do, too, and they always want to offer their opinions. However, keep in mind that when you hire a real estate team like ours, **we have your best interests at heart**. We want you to get your home sold quickly for top dollar and we appreciate your trust in us.
