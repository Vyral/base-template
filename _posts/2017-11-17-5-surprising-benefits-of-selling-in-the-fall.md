If you’ve been thinking of waiting until next spring or summer to get your home on the market, you might be surprised to hear that there are a number of advantages that home sellers only see in the fall real estate market here in Memphis. Here are five good reasons to consider selling your home in this market:

**1. Tax breaks.** If the transaction is completed before the end of the year, you will receive a tax break and a number of different write-offs as well.

**2. A home for the holidays.** We recently sold a home to a young couple. They are so excited to move into their new home just in time for the holidays. Right now, we can get you into a new home in just about 22 days, so you’ve still got some time to make your decision if you’re debating it. Keep in mind that homes show well when decorated for the holidays.

**3. The price is right.** We aren’t seeing as many multiple offer situations as we have in the past, but the limited inventory is still putting the pressure on buyers to make winning offers.

**4. Less competition.** Although this means that you’ll have to wait a bit longer if you’re in the market to buy a home, it’s great news for you if you’re a seller.

**Interest rates have continued to stay low, making this a great market to buy and sell in.** Perfect conditions if you’re looking to move up into a bigger and better home. If you have any questions for me about the market or about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
