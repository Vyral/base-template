We’re delighted to be joined today by Chelsey Reilly of Landmark Home Warranty to talk a little bit about home warranties, what they cover, and how you can get one if you don’t have one already.

**A home warranty isn’t a true warranty on the home itself; it’s actually a service contract providing coverage on major systems in the home and appliances within the home.** It covers the major systems in your home, like your HVAC, your plumbing, as well as appliances like your dishwasher, refrigerator, and washer/dryer.

In the event of a major malfunction to one of the systems or appliances in the home, a home warranty will allow a homeowner to place a call to their warranty company and make them aware of the problem. You will explain everything you know about the problem, then they will send a licensed contractor out there to diagnose the system or appliance and determine whether or not it should be repaired or replaced.

The cost of a home warranty will range anywhere from $300 to $600. **Landmark Home Warranty has rates between $300 and $500.** When you consider the out of pocket expenses for repairing a major system or replacing an appliance, the $300 to $500 bill is an incredible savings.

If you have any questions for us about home warranties or anything else relating to real estate, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. You can also contact Chelsey directly at (503) 444-1151 or email her at chelsey@landmarkhw.com. We look forward to hearing from you.
