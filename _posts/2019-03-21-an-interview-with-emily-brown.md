I’m joined today by Emily Brown, one of our team’s top real estate agents. She’s here to share a little bit of her backstory with us, as well as give the reasoning behind why choosing a top agent is so important for first-time homebuyers (or any homebuyer, for that matter).

In our office, we actually call Emily “Puff.” The nickname stuck after she told one of our admins that she ate Puffins for breakfast. It’s also somewhat necessary because there are actually two Emily Browns working in our office, and this helps with differentiation.

When Emily begins the home buying process with her clients, **the first step is always to get them pre-approved for a loan**. She works with our great in-house lenders on a regular basis, and our clients get the chance to speak with them about the various options for loans. After this, it’s time to start looking at homes.

Her advice for first-time homebuyers? Don’t be afraid—Emily is great at walking clients through the process and telling them exactly what they need to do and when to do it. **It’s not as scary as it may initially seem.**

It’s also important for homebuyers to interview more than one agent before making a decision. There are over 8,000 real estate agents in the Triangle area alone, **but the majority of homes are sold by about 200 of them**. You want to be sure that you’re working with an experienced, full-time agent.

I’d like to thank Emily for sharing her insight with us today. **She’s an amazing agent who sells 10 times more real estate than the national average.**

If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
