Today we’d like to introduce our buyer specialist Miranda Haws.

Miranda first heard about our great success on the radio from hosts Rick Hamada and Sean Hannity. Once she’d heard about us, she began to think about joining our team.

Miranda was curious as to what set Team Lally apart from other real estate teams here in Hawaii. Most agents compete against each other, but **here at Team Lally we compete for each other.**

This is just part of the reason why we’re so successful. The opportunity for collaboration that this mindset brings is what Miranda says she enjoys most about working on our team.

Each agent brings something different to the table, so **everyone on the team combines their experiences and outlooks to find the best solutions for any transaction.**

In her role as a buyer specialist, Miranda works with families who are looking to purchase homes.

To help find the home that will best fit their criteria and lifestyle, Miranda sifts through a number of properties before finding the right ones to show them.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
