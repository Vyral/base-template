If you think we’re headed for a market crash, today you’re in for a pleasant surprise. There are plenty of reasons why you don’t need to worry about this happening anytime soon.

First of all, **there are many key differences between today’s market and the market of 2005**. In 2005, subprime loans totaled out to $620 billion and comprised up to 20% of the mortgage market. In 2015, they totaled just $56 billion and comprised just 5% of the mortgage market.

Second, **banks have raised their lending standards**. According to CoreLogic’s Housing Credit Index, loans originated in 2016 were among the highest-quality loans of the past 15 years. In October of 2009, the average FICO score was 686. In 2001, the average FICO score was between 490 and 510.

Third, tighter lending standards have made a difference in the flip market. Lenders in today’s market only finance up to 55% of a home’s value—the home flipper is responsible for the rest of the funding. During the subprime crisis, banks were lending up to 80% or more of a property’s value.

Also, **the number of national home sales is down 20% compared to the pre-crash peak**, and we only have four months of inventory. As a result, only 64% of all Americans own their own homes. Back in 2017, it was 68%.

Home sales are lower because the recession limited young people’s ability to start a career and save enough money to buy a home. When faced with a poor job market, many decided to further their education to better position themselves for the marketplace. Now these people are burdened with huge student loan debts, which makes it less likely they’ll be able to save enough to buy a home. This is why demand is expected to be lower for quite some time.

In addition, **home prices have outpaced the average worker’s income**. The average housing- income-to-housing-cost ratio is just 30%. In some metro areas, it’s skyrocketed to between 40% and 50%. Since metro areas are where the jobs are, many young people are deciding to pay more rent in order to be in a better location and avoid a long commute, even though their job doesn’t pay enough to allow them to buy a home.

Roughly 32% of all current home sales are from first-time homebuyers. According to the NAR, that average is historically closer to 40%. The average first-time homebuyer is around 32 years old, earns around $72,000, and can pay up to $182,000 for a home. The average couple can afford a home worth up to $208,000.

Another reason is that **homeowners aren’t taking as much equity out of their homes anymore**. The total amount of home equity rose to $85 billion back in 2006. After the market collapsed, that total dropped to $10 billion, and it remained there until 2015. By 2017, it had only risen to $14 billion, and Obamacare was the reason for that. Bankruptcy filings have fallen by 50% since the Affordable Care Act was passed. In 2010, 1.5 million people filed for bankruptcy, whereas in 2016, only 770,000 people did so.

Some who worry about an impending crash point to the fact that national home prices have exceeded their 2006 peak, but keep in mind that once we adjust the value for 11 years of inflation, prices are close to where they were in 2004. Between 2012 and 2017, home prices only rose 6.5% per year on average. Between 2002 and 2006, they rose an average of 7.5% per year (in 2005, they skyrocketed 16%).

Lastly, home builders focus on high-end homes. New homes are larger and more expensive—the average size of a home today is 2,700 square feet. Back in 2005 and 2006, the average square footage of a home was 2,500 feet.

As you can see, a market crash is by no means imminent. If you’re curious what your home is worth in today’s market or you have any other real estate needs I can assist you with, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to help you.
