Now that the weather has turned cold and winter is upon us, I’d like to share some tips for getting your home sold during this time of year.

Here in North Carolina, we’ve got to be prepared for the unexpected. This includes snow. Because of this, it’s important to time your photos around the season. **Photograph your home when it looks its best.**

Don’t wait until the trees are barren and the grass is brown. Take your photos beforehand. Alternatively, you could take photos of your home when it looks like a winter wonderland, but only if you make sure your walkways are pristinely shoveled and the yard is without distracting footprints.

As an additional tip, **don’t overdo any holiday decorations.** Deck the halls, but don’t go overboard. Homes often look their best during the holidays, but too much of a good thing can turn buyers away.

Also, don’t forget about your curb appeal. Just because it’s winter, it doesn’t mean sellers can let things slide. Make sure the exterior of your home is clean, inviting, and, most of all, safe. Be sure to shovel your sidewalks and put salt down on icy patches.

However, even the cleanest walkways in winter will leave shoes less than clean. **When showing your home, make sure buyers have a place to wipe their feet.** Visitors to your home might not notice this detail, but they certainly would notice if your entryway was a mess, instead.

Another unique challenge of the winter season is the lack of natural light. For this reason, make sure your home is well lit. Turning on all the lights before showings is more important than ever, and don’t forget the exterior. Accentuate your outdoor space with landscaping lights.

Last but not least, listen to your Realtor. Listing in the winter can present a lot of great opportunities. As your agent, I can help you develop a winning strategy for your listing.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
