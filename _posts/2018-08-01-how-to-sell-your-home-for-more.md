Today I’ve got a few pro tips for you that you can use to prepare your home to sell for top dollar:

**1. Declutter.** When people are walking through your home, it needs to feel like a model home. &nbsp;Our society's been spoiled by HGTV—buyers expect your home to look like an HGTV house. You may want to rent a shed so that you can put all your extra items in there. That way, your home is show-ready.

**2. Clean.** I can’t stress enough how important being clean is. People will look at your baseboards, the grills in your AC system, and more; if they see that your home isn’t well-maintained or clean, they may not want to buy it.

**3. Decor.** Try to take out the things that are older or aren’t up to date and just leave your rooms staged enough to show what the rooms are used for. You can set up a blow-up bed on top of some boxes in a spare bedroom and cover it with a pretty quilt and pillows. Even if that is the only thing in the room, it will show the buyer what the room’s purpose is.

If you’re interested in buying or selling a home or if you have any questions about prepping your home for sale, please feel free to reach out to me. I’d be glad to be your resource.
