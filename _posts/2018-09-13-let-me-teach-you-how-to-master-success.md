As a millionaire agent seeking to help others achieve their greatness potential, I’m going to be teaching a live class on September 18th from 4-5 pm. There is no cost to attend and there are no strings attached, which is pretty rare in today’s time. I’ll teach you about the six paths to personal mastery and the science of success. By mastering each of these six perspectives, you will begin to see the subtle, then sudden, aggregation of these traits in your personal and professional success. If you’d like to start on this path, join us at 2121 S. McClelland St., Suite 201 in Salt Lake City, just above the Habit Burger. Space is limited, so RSVP today. I look forward to seeing you there.
