It’s time once again for our annual golf tournament, and, as always, you’re invited! This year, **the tournament will take place at noon on Friday, September 14 at Mountain Branch Golf Course.**

We’ll be hosting a lunch before the tournament starts, as well as a prime rib dinner with all the fixings after the day is done, so make sure to come hungry. This event is going to be a great time, so we sincerely hope you’ll join us for food, fun, and the chance to win great prizes, including jewelry, tech gadgets, and more.

And when you buy your tickets before August 30, the cost for a foursome ticket will be reduced to $600—a savings of $60 from our usual price. Space is limited, so make sure to reserve your place as soon as possible.

Best of all, **100% of the proceeds from this event will go toward providing enrichment opportunities and college scholarships for kids between sixth through 12th grade.**

We look forward to seeing you on the course, but until then, feel free to give us a call or send us an email if you have any questions or would like more information. See you at the tournament!
