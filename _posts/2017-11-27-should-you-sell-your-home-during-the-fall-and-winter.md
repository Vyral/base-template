If selling is in your future, you may be thinking of waiting until spring to put your home on the market. However, there are a few reasons why it may be better to sell during the fall or winter.

First of all, **there is less competition this time of year**. Spring is usually when a lot of “For Sale” signs go up. The more “For Sale” signs there are in people’s yards, the more competition you will have and the less likely it is that someone will choose your home.

When you sell in the winter, there is less competition, which increases the chances that your home will get looked at. You may even sell faster and at a higher price. &nbsp;

It all comes down to the simple law of supply and demand. If there are fewer homes to choose from, than a buyer is more likely to pay a higher price for your home.

Secondly, **the buyers who are looking for homes tend to be more serious this time of year**. Ideally, they probably wouldn’t choose to move in the winter when it’s snowing and the weather is cold. There is a reason that they are looking for a home. Whether it’s a job change or some other life event forcing them to move quickly, their offers tend to be stronger and they will jump on a house when they find one that meets their needs.

Winter homebuyers also have a limited time frame in which to find a home. Spring buyers tend to take their time. You also get a lot of tire kickers who just want to see what’s on the market. Winter buyers have to make a purchase, and they won’t waste your time.

**Finally, your home will look beautiful this time of year**. Stage your home with wonderful holiday decorations. Since many people expect company this time of year, your home will be at its cleanest. What better time of year is there to showcase your home?

Buyers will see your holiday decorations and fall in love with your home. If you create a beautiful, friendly, inviting environment, that will give buyers a warmer experience than they receive in spring or summer. Invite those buyers in, let them fall in love with your home, and let’s get you a higher offer.
