Conversations around mortgages are some of the most uncomfortable conversations during the home buying process. **However, it’s essential to talk to a lender prior to starting the process so that you make sure you’re prepared to write an offer when the time comes.** The only question people ever seem to ask is, “What is my interest rate going to be?”, but you need to ask a few more questions to get a better picture.

The APR is the total cost of your loan, but the one with the lowest interest rate may not have the lowest APR. If you have a score of 740 or above, you’re going to get the best rate possible. However, you can get a loan with pretty much any score.

**I urge you to talk to your mortgage professional and real estate professional for further guidance.** If you have any questions or need my help in any way, don't hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.
