What’s been going on with our market lately?

Many homebuyers are tired and frustrated because as they think about buying a home, prices continue to rise. And now, rates are increasing as well, which means **they’re being priced out of the market.** If you had bought that same home last year, by now you would have made about 10% on your expenditure. If you continue to sit on the sidelines and wait another year to buy, you may lose another 3% to 10%.

At some point, you do want to own your own property and pay your own mortgage, instead of your landlord’s. You also want the **tax benefits of owning a home**, as well as the benefits of being able to do whatever you want with your property, instead of asking permission from your landlord.

If this sounds like you, feel free to reach out to me. Let’s analyze your situation to see if today is the day to get pre-approved so you can **move forward toward making your dream of homeownership a reality.**
