Today I’d like to help you get an idea of what type of house, lifestyle, and price point that you’re going to find on the Sun Coast so you can determine where you should start looking for the perfect home.

**Our most popular type of home search is a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom, with a pool that is close to the beach. Here’s where you can find a home like that in different areas along the coast.**<br> <br>In Bradenton, the northwest corner is right out near the beach. The lifestyle out there is beach-oriented. The price point for the type of home we mentioned above can be found for around $250,000 to $350,000. **It will be a bit of an older home.**

**Sarasota is a mini-city and has a nice metropolitan feel to it.** There is plenty of nightlife, arts, and culture here. A lot of younger people live here. You can find a pool home here in the $300,000+ range. It will be a little older like the ones in Bradenton, but it’s a great community to be in. If you want a newer home, it might be best to look elsewhere.

Venice, Florida is a small town with a nice little downtown area and a vibrant restaurant scene. **The pool home here starts in the mid-to-high $200,000 range.** The $300,00 + range will give you a newer home. It’s a bit of a more mature community.

Coming south out of Venice we have the Englewood Rotonda and Northwest Port Charlotte. This area is quite a bit more suburban than Sarasota or Venice. **You’re going to find a pool home here starting at around $250,000.** Englewood Rotonda is a great area near the beaches and most of the homes were built in the 90s and 2000s. Port Charlotte does have some great pool homes, but it’s around 45 minutes from the beach.

The big takeaway here is that **the further south you look for a home, the better deal you’ll get on a home.** You’ll get more home for your buck. I think the sweet spot on the sun coast is the Rotunda, Englewood, and the Port Charlotte area. There are great prices, great inventory, and everything else you’re looking for.

If you have any other questions for me about pool homes, the Sun Coast, or anything else, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
