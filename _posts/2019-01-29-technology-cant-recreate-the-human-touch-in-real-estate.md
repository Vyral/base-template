<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Though technology can be a big helper, real estate will always need professional agents.</em></p>

In a recent meeting with my business coach, we focused on one big facet of our industry: **personal contact.**

Like many parts of our society, real estate is becoming increasingly digitized. While it’s great to be able to find quick answers for many questions, real estate is far more complicated and holds many moving parts. A computer can’t give solutions that cover the case-by-case nature of most real estate situations.

**Our job is to walk people through the process, guide them through what to expect and what will likely happen, and help them through market shifts.&nbsp;**

We had a buyer who had credit issues and their lender didn’t address it correctly. Though it looked as if the transaction would not go through, we were able to step back, look at the situation, and find a quick and easy solution. A computer wouldn’t be able to do this.

Not too long ago, there was an inaccurate deed from 1932—a computer would have no way of fixing this either. We were able to make a call, take care of the problem, and close the transaction on time.

We’re here to answer your questions, respond to you quickly, and be your guide throughout the real estate process. Though we take advantage of technology, **we provide the personal touch you need—especially when the unexpected arises.** And with all our years of experience, we’ve likely solved problems like yours before.

If you’re looking for your own guide in real estate, have any questions, or need more information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
