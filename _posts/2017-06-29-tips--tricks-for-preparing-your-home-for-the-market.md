{% include youtube.html %}If you’re a home seller, here are a few tips you can use to get your home ready for the market.&nbsp;
{: .present-before-paste}

First, **clean up the landscaping,** especially in front of the house. Buyers like to do drive-bys of houses to see what they look like in person. If the shrubbery in front of your house is overgrown or dark and drab, it will definitely turn buyers away.&nbsp;
{: .present-before-paste}

A lot of times shrubbery starts out small but grows over the years to completely cover things like your home’s windows, which can make your home look small. Cut away the shrubbery and pressure-wash the newly exposed areas to move buyers from the outside to the inside.&nbsp;

Second, **apply a fresh coat of paint to your home’s interior.** It can be a bit of a pain to get done, but it’s relatively inexpensive and can go a long way.&nbsp;

<br>Third, get all of the carpets and floors professionally cleaned.

Fourth, change out all of the old hardware, especially if you have all that old 90s brass hardware. Maybe take a look at some of the fixtures too and consider changing them out.&nbsp;

Bonus tip: look at your air conditioner vents. If they’re dirty, clean them. If they’re rusted, replace them.&nbsp;
