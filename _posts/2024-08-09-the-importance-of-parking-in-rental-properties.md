Having a hard time looking for tenants because your rental has no parking space? Parking is an important part of any successful rental property. **Spacious and well-maintained parking spaces increase your property’s value and tenant satisfaction.** At Hi Pacific Property Management, we recognize the importance of parking and require all rental units that we manage to have designated parking stalls.
