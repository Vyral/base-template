  Today I want to address a very important, but very unpopular, topic: taxes.
  The changes in our tax laws that were put in place at the end of last year
  have caused many people to consider moving to a more affordable state. How
  does that impact us here in South Florida? Both buyers and sellers can take
  advantage of this situation, but they need to act now. To find out why, watch

The changes in our tax laws that took place at the end of 2017 have many people across the country thinking about moving to a more affordable state. Here in South Florida, both buyers and sellers can take advantage of this situation. 

One of the great things about South Florida is **it’s more affordable in terms of taxation.** Why? For one thing, we have no income tax. Secondly, our property taxes are more affordable. Economists speculate that states like California and New York will see as much as 800,000 people per year move out of state to a more affordable state. States like Minnesota, Illinois, and New Jersey should also expect to see their residents move out of state to more affordable states like ours. 

If you’re thinking of buying, **you should buy now before those people start moving here** and taking advantage of our beautiful weather and our more favorable tax situation. 

If you’re thinking of selling, **there’s an opportunity here to get top dollar for your home.** In fact, that opportunity has started today. Right now, we have buyers from the Northeast who don’t want to live there anymore and are ready for our beautiful weather.

Additionally, we’ll see businesses moving their entire companies to South Florida because it’s such a positive, welcoming place for businesses. In fact, I recently did a radio interview explaining the benefits of moving a business from the Northeast down to South Florida, specifically Palm Beach County. If you’re a business owner, take this into consideration, because you’ll love bringing your employees down here.
