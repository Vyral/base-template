{% include youtube.html %}These days, a lot of sellers are worried about finding their next home. They say, “We know our home will sell quickly, but we just can’t find the perfect home on the market. What should we do about that?”

**On our team, we work to make up for that challenge every single day.** We have a team of five agents who are dedicated to getting on the phone for two hours every morning to call homeowners in the neighborhoods our buyers are looking in.

This happens every single day from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. You can even stop by our office and see our team in action!

We call these homeowners to let them know that we have a pre-approved buyer interested in their neighborhoods. We tell them, “Our buyer has seen everything currently on the market. I’m calling to see if you know of anyone in your area who wants to sell their home.”

Neighbors are giving us the inside scoop on who wants to sell in their area. Sometimes, the homeowner that we call ends up selling their home. It’s been a lot of fun to take our buyers out to these neighborhoods and show them a home that doesn’t even have a sign in the yard yet.

**So, if you’re scared of this market, just know that you don’t have to be.** There are proactive agents out there doing whatever it takes to find you a home. I can tell you right now that we have not let any of our clients go without a home in this market.

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. My team and I would be happy to help you!
