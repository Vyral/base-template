<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Real estate isn’t for everyone, but those who put in the work will thrive. Here’s why.</em></p>

A career in real estate has its pros and cons, and today we’ll be taking a brief look at life in the industry.

I’ve learned a lot since I started in real estate 17 years ago. **The biggest thing to understand is that, as a real estate agent, you are a small business owner.** And, like any small business, the rate of attrition is high.&nbsp;

According to the National Association of Realtors, the average full-time agent made $42,000 in gross income last year. If we include part-time agents, that number drops dramatically. Since the barrier to entry is low, there’s a lot of competition. **Only a small percentage can make it a full-time career and make their primary income from real estate.**

On the upside, however, you get out of it what you put in. **If you work hard, you can define your own future and develop a flexible career.** In the early years, you won’t have much flexibility—you’ll be taking on a lot of clients and trying to serve them on their time. There are a lot of sacrifices that must be made in the beginning of your career in order to get your name out there. But if you stick through these tough beginning years, you’ll find flexibility as well as a high income ceiling.
