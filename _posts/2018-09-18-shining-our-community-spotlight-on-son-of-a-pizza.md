Son of a Pizza is a family-owned-and-operated business that serves a small clientele in a small-town environment. If you don’t know anyone when you get here, you’ll end up knowing someone by the time you leave.

The location we’re at today has been open for nine years, though the first Son of a Pizza was first opened in 1985. **The restaurant is open from Tuesday to Sunday,** generally starting business at 10:30 a.m. (except for Saturdays, when they open at 11:30 a.m.) and closing up at 11:00 p.m. (though they will stay open if there are still customers there—they haven’t closed on time in nine years!). 

At Son of a Pizza, **happy hour is from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Friday.** They offer two-for-one domestic drafts, $5 pitchers for NFL games, and they run lunch specials throughout the week.

Despite what most people think, the name “Son of a Pizza” has nothing to do with loving your sons—it’s actually not a family-orientated name. When Mike, co-owner and husband to Debbie, was set to open his first Son of a Pizza in 1985, he was nearly two weeks away from opening and he still didn't have a name for the place. He was in Key West, drinking in a Sloppy Joe’s where someone was performing Jimmy Buffet songs. **As the singer was performing “Son of a Sailor,” Mike transposed the lyrics to “Son of a Pizza,” and there you have the origin of the restaurant’s name.**

Mike has been working with pizza for even longer than his plans for owning a pizza restaurant, having bussed for Dino’s Pizza since he was 10. He would stay after work and learn how to make pizzas, and since then, it’s all he’s ever done.

Son of a Pizza doesn’t have a most popular dish, since the tastes of the clientele seem to vary. Sometimes pizza is the hot-seller, but sometimes it’s seafood, the chicken wings, the lasagna, or the hot Italian subs. 

**The restaurant promises to customize any meal if it’s possible for them to do so.** They enjoy seeing people’s ideas for food, be it a steak pizza, lobster pizza, or even scallops.

Debbie and Mike try really hard to make people happy, and that is what makes them happy. They provide an enjoyable meeting place for locals and their families to enjoy, sometimes leaving standing room only. They get a thrill from looking across the room and seeing people eating, smiling, and talking.
