2019 has gotten off to an incredible start for the Crystal Coast real estate market. There has been a surge of buyer demand, which is great news for anyone thinking of selling this year.

However, there is no time like the present. **Experts like Nick Ron (CEO of Home Buyers of America) agree that selling this year will yield far better results than doing so in years to come.&nbsp;**

The opportunity to earn the best possible deal for your home has not yet passed so we need to get started with the process. **Why? There are a couple of crucial reasons:&nbsp;**

**1\. Mortgage rates are still historically low.** Because of this, buyers are eager to lock in a low rate while they still can. This gives sellers an incredible amount of leverage.

**2\. Supply is down.**There are more buyers than properties available on the market at this time.

**For any sellers savvy enough to see the “bigger picture,” this means just one (very important) thing: less competition.** It’s simple supply and demand—the fewer competing sellers there are in our market, the better chance you’ll have at selling quickly and for top dollar.

What does this all mean for you? It means that NOW is the time to act if you’re thinking of selling. Delaying much longer could cost you dearly. The good news, as I’ve already indicated, is that our market remains strong for now, but no one knows what the future may bring.

I'd love the opportunity to give you an idea of what you could earn for your home. I’m very familiar with our market and would be happy to help you make the most of this opportune moment in real estate.

If you’re ready to take advantage of current conditions as a seller or buyer, please give me a call or send me an email right away\! I look forward to hearing from you soon\!
