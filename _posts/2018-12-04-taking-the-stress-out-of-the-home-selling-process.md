We work with people all the time who are thinking of putting their home on the market but are concerned about the potential stress involved in the home selling process and how that will affect their family and their lifestyle. This fear of the unknown can cause them to delay their decision.

If you find yourself in this same situation, your first step should be to hire a great real Realtor. A great Realtor will shoulder a lot of the stress for you by doing three important things:

**1. Setting expectations.** Most people undergo the home selling process four to six times in their life, but we Realtors do it every day, so we can tell you what you can expect during the process from start to finish.

**2. Eliminating surprises.** For example, we eliminate surprises for our sellers through our Certified Pre-Owned Home program. Over the years, I’ve found that the most stressful part of the home sale process for sellers is usually when their home goes through its inspections.

You can take great care of your home, but certain things you’re not aware of might still show up once an inspector starts digging through it. It’s a terrible feeling to be at the mercy of the buyer’s home inspector, so taking this preemptive approach is how we take control of the situation.

**3. Communicating.** This means communicating through the good times and the bad times. Time and time again, I’ve heard from buyers and sellers that the most disappointing part of working with a real estate agent is when they don’t communicate.

On our team, communication is our strong suit. Each member has a specialized role that allows them to focus on a key part of the home sale process. This not only helps with facilitating our communication, but it also helps with setting expectations and eliminating surprises.

If you’d like to talk more about making your home sale as smooth and stress-free as possible or you have any other real estate needs I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak to you.
