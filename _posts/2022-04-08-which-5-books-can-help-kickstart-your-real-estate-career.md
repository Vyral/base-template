Today I want to share five amazing books that will help you in your real estate journey. As I look back on my 20 years in the business, there are five books that have had a profound impact on my career and life. Here’s my list:

**1\. “7 Habits of Highly Effective People” by Stephen Covey**

**2\. “High Trust Selling” by Todd Duncan**

These two foundational books got me from zero transactions a year to learning empathy, managing my time, and leading with high-trust selling, not some sales pitch.

**3\. “The Millionaire Real Estate Agent” by Gary Keller. **

**4\. “The One Thing” by Gary Keller**

“The Millionaire Real Estate Agent” helped me construct a real estate company complete with an economic model, a budget model, a lead-generation model, and everything in between. “The One Thing” helped me a lot with discipline. It taught me how to focus my attention, be disciplined, and get one thing done at 110% instead of trying to catch multiple rabbits at once and not catching any of them.

**5\. “Traction” by Gino Wickman.**

This book has really taken my business to the next level and given me clarity to develop a strong culture focused on people, mission, and the customer.

If you want another list of five books in addition to this list, just **private message me, and I’ll send you my full list of 10 powerful books. **

If you have any other questions about the real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
