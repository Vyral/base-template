Today I’ve got some great St. Charles MLS data comparing the current market to the market a year ago. **Here are the numbers that stood out to us:**

* Market time is down by 7%
* The number of homes on the market is down by 8%
* The average sale price is up 4.5% to $357,000

This is all great news for sellers. **There is a break in the market right now and a big opportunity for home sellers and buyers.&nbsp;**

For home sellers, now is the time to get your home sold for top dollar. For homebuyers, now is the time to get off the fence and lock in a low interest rate. Fresh inventory will be coming on the market every day this summer.

If you’re thinking about buying or selling a home anytime soon, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.
