*Here’s a little bit about what we Realtors actually do for our clients.*

&nbsp;

As Realtors (pronounced “Reel-tor,” not “Reel-Uh-Tor”), our job is *not* to spam people’s emails with all the available listings on the market. These days, every homebuyer has access to a host of real estate websites that can give them a feel for what’s out there. We also don’t just drive around and provide people access to properties. That’s more like what an Uber driver does.&nbsp;

**Our*****actual *****role is to find the properties that fit the criteria necessitated by the goals of our clients.** The only way to do that is to sit down with clients for a buyer’s consultation and ascertain their needs, wants, and general home-buying goals. While it’s true that we’ll ultimately have to arrange access to choice properties, there’s a lot more that must happen before that point. How do we know if a matching property is even a good value?&nbsp;

We have to look at other relevant sales in the neighborhoods that our buyers may want to live in. The more detail we can provide we can provide in that regard, the better our clients will be able to understand the market. Of course, each property will have different location benefits, features, and upgrades—**no two homes on the planet are exactly alike.&nbsp;**

Continuing on in the mission to provide our buyers with as much information as possible, we must connect with the listing agent. What is their client looking for with respect to the sale price, timelines, contingencies, etc.? Once we can discover what’s most important to the seller, our buyer can then use that information to either structure a stronger offer or inform their decision to pass on the listing. Again, it’s just about locating the right homes, it’s about vetting them against the market and helping our clients hit their goals.&nbsp;

If you know anyone who’s entering the market as a first-time homebuyer, feel free to send them this video. I believe there’s a chronic lack of public understanding when it comes to what we actually do as Realtors; **it’s my pleasure to educate and empower.** As always, don’t hesitate to reach out by phone or email if you have questions about the market or any real estate needs we can help you with. We’re here for you, and looking forward to chatting soon.
