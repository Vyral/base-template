Now that spring is here and we are moving closer to summer, which market trends do you need to keep an eye on moving forward as a buyer in 2018?

**The movement of interest rates is an especially important trend right now.** One of the biggest questions buyers are asking right now is how much they can afford for their monthly mortgage payment. Interest rates play a big part in answering this question, and though rates have started to increase lately, they are still at historic lows.

For the past five weeks or so, the average for a 30-year fixed rate has held steady at right around 4.25%. By the end of the year, this average is expected to climb to nearly 5%. This means **if you are a buyer and you have been sitting on the fence, now is the time to get pre-qualified before you start searching for homes.** The specific rate you get depends on a few different factors, including which loan program you choose, what your FICO score is, and what your loan-to-value ratio is.
