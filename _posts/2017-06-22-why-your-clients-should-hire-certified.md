We've all been trained to give the names of three home inspectors when your clients ask for a referral, but I suggest that you **highly encourage them to seek out a certified inspections expert.** Since home inspectors are not regulated by the department of commerce, so this certification provides valuable benefits to your clients.

For starters, they provide a **90-day warranty** for any items that were inspected and deemed to be in good order. This is important because not all of your clients will buy a home warranty plan, even though you recommended it. That 90-day window is critical because many things that can go wrong will go wrong during those first 90 days in the home.

With a certified inspection, your clients can also get sewer and septic inspections that use cameras to inspect the pipes and other areas. They can also bridge the gap between the inspection warranty and home warranty, which is another nice added benefit. Additionally, they have a national resource line that homeowners can call with questions.

They also have specific coverages pertaining to mold, which can be an issue sometimes up here in the mountains. They also have very specific **roof leak protection** that I haven't seen in the general home inspection process. 

If you have any questions about this topic or you'd like to talk further about how it can benefit your clients, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I'd love to talk and help you with your career however I can.
