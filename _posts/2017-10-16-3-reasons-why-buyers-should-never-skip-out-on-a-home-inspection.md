There are three very important reasons you should always order a home inspection when buying a home.&nbsp;

**First, a professional inspector may uncover present or potential future issues with the home that a buyer wouldn’t normally find.** As the saying goes, “You can’t judge a book by its cover,” and the same logic applies when buying a home. The inspector will go through the home from top to bottom, checking over the electrical and plumbing systems, the furnace, the AC unit, and everything else. They’ll then inform you about anything that needs to be maintained and offer tips to avoid any future issues.&nbsp;

**Second, your offer is contingent on the home inspection.** After you get an inspection done, you have the option to walk away from the deal if you don’t feel comfortable with the results of the inspection. This is one of the only opportunities to back out of the deal without losing your earnest money.&nbsp;

**Third, you have the option to make any repair requests to the seller** after the home inspector gives you the report. In this scenario, you and your agent would sit down and negotiate with the seller and their agent about the inspection’s findings. You and your agent would then decide on which items to look past and which to ask the seller to take care of. You would then negotiate once more to make sure those items get done before you move into your new home.&nbsp;
