You’ve got questions, and we’ve got answers—today, we’re going to talk about down payments.

How much should your down payment be? Well, **that’s totally up to you**. Can we meet your financial budget? Can we meet your monthly payment requirements? Can we buy the house that we want to buy with the certain down payment that you have in mind? We’ll help you decipher those questions.

{% include pullquote.html %}

**Most of our clients put down between 3% and 10%;**&nbsp;some put more down and some put less. We even have programs that require zero down payment.

Give us a call! We’ll walk you through the process. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us via phone or email. We’d love to help you out.
