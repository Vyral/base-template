RED Day, which stands for&nbsp;**Renew**,&nbsp;**Energize**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Donate**, is our annual day of service. Each year on the second Thursday of May, we celebrate RED Day as a part of our&nbsp;**legacy worth leaving**.

Making a difference in the lives of others and bettering the communities that we serve lies at the heart of the Keller Williams culture. This observance defines who we are and is a natural extension of our commitment to the highest level of professional customer service.

Over time, a growing number of our family members and friends continue to participate in this extraordinary event. It&nbsp;**embodies the generous spirit and commitment associates have to “giving back"**&nbsp;to the cities and towns they live and work in.

In Westlake Village, our team of almost 300 agents came together for three causes. We had a team of people working together, cutting and tying 200 yards of fabric to make blankets for My Stuffed Bags – which is a charity that gives children who have been separated from parents, possessions and home, bags that are stuffed with handmade blankets, toys, books, school supplies and more.

Outside, in our parking lot we had another team working a blood drive – save a life, give your blood\! Our third team headed over to Many Mansions – a local organization that serves low income residents of Ventura County.

Our team was involved with a beautification project resurfacing cabinets at one of their local complexes. Keller Williams believes to serve oneself, is to serve another and we love being able to partake in giving back to our community.

If you have any questions about local real estate in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help.
