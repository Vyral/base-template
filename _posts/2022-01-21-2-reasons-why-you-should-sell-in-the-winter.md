Recently, a lot of clients have asked me if they should sell now or wait until spring. The market tends to heat up in the spring, but there are many benefits to selling during the winter. Today I want to give you two big reasons why now is still a great time to sell your home:

**1\. Inventory is low.** During the winter, inventory is usually as low as it gets. That means you’ll have less competition, and you might be able to negotiate a better price. Inventory is very low right now, but I’ll make sure to keep you updated on any changes.&nbsp;

**2\. Life changes are causing people to move.** This is the time of year when people make new year’s resolutions and transfer for jobs. If you want to take advantage of these buyers, now is the time to put your home on the market.&nbsp;

Of course, low inventory and high demand can make things difficult for buyers. If you are looking to buy a home, I recommend you get your finances in order and start searching soon. Interest rates are likely to rise later this year, so get into the market while your buying power is still high.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about today’s video, please call or email me. I am always willing to help\!&nbsp;
