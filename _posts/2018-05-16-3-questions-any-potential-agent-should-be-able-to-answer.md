There are three questions I recommend asking any agent before partnering with them to accomplish your real estate goals. 

1. **What’s their experience?** This doesn’t necessarily mean how many years they’ve been in business, but rather how many transactions they’ve completed in the last 12 months. The average Realtor sells about seven homes a year, so any agent selling less than this probably lacks the kind of experience you should expect from the person you hire. 
2. **What is the contact information for their last three clients?** An agent who has had success with their past transactions should be happy to put you in contact with people who can vouch for them.<br>{% include pullquote.html %}
3. **What will this agent do to make your home stand out?** The summer market is quickly approaching. It’s important to find out how an agent plans to set you above the competition, especially if you’re a buyer. Multiple offer situations are common in the summer months, so it’s important that the Realtor you hire has a strategy for your success. Sellers, on the other hand, need to work with someone who will be able to help them capitalize on these hot conditions.
