We get a lot of questions about the real estate market. Today, we’ll answer the top five:

1. Are we in a buyer’s or seller’s market? It really depends on which neighborhood and price point you are looking in. Neighborhoods and price points that are in demand tend to lean more towards a seller’s market. You need to talk to a local agent who understands what is happening in each neighborhood and price point.
2. What does the current housing inventory look like? Right now, there are 11,700 homes on the market. At this time last year, there were 13,200 homes on the market, which means that inventory is dropping.
3. What’s happening with interest rates? For a conventional, 30-year fixed loan, rates are hovering between 4% and 4.25%. Rates are expected to trend up over the next 12 months.
4. What does this mean for buyers? If you are a buyer, now is the time to get off the fence. The market is very stable right now, but inventory is dropping, interest rates are going up, and prices are on the rise. You still have a small window to get a great deal and a great interest rate.

5. What does this mean for sellers? As inventory drops and demand increases, our market will become a seller’s market. You need to work with a real estate agent who truly understands our local market in order to sell your home quickly and for top dollar.
