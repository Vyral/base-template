In our industry, productivity is key. So how can you be more productive? Well, aside from keeping a well-organized calendar, the next best way to boost your productivity is by talking to potential clients each and every day. You can’t get new business without talking to people, and you can’t talk to people (effectively, at least) without having a goal in mind. Usually, when calling leads, this goal should be to get business from or through them. Even if you’re simply chatting with a friend, think about asking whether they know anyone looking to buy or sell. Many people will feel uncomfortable doing this, but you’d be amazed at the results if you give it a try. Good things happen when you step out of your comfort zone. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me or my team a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
