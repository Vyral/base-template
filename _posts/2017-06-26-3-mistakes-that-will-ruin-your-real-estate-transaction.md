I have seen a lot of things happen during real estate transactions, and there are three things that will almost definitely ruin your home sale every time:

**1. Don’t quit your job in the middle of escrow.** It’s very important that you stay in your current job for loan approval. Even if you are thinking of changing jobs, you don’t want to do it while in the middle of a transaction.

**2. Don’t make major purchases.** Of course you’re excited and you want to buy that new TV or washer/dryer for your new home, but you should wait. Just wait. Don’t buy a car or major appliance while you’re in escrow. Those purchases will impact your credit score, and you don’t want to jeopardize your credit mid-transaction.

**3. Don’t lie.** Be open and honest with your loan officer and your Realtor. We are your trusted partners during this transaction. If anything happens, you need to share it with us. Do not lie under any circumstances. Tell us what is going on. After all, we’re here to help. No matter what you’re going through, we can come up with a plan to get you through this real estate transaction.

If you avoid these three mistakes, then your transaction will be on the path to success.
