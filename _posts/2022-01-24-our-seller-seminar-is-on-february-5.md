We’ve finally picked a date for our upcoming seller seminar. Join us on February 5 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. to learn all about the home-selling process.&nbsp;

We’ll have guest speakers, inspectors, appraisers, and we’ll feed you lunch. **It’s a free event, but seating is limited to about 60.&nbsp;**

If you’re interested in attending, RSVP by giving me a call, sending me an email, or [registering here.](https://www.alaskatopagent.com/Pages/Seminar.aspx)&nbsp;
