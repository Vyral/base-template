How do homeowners association fees work in Hawaii? Generally speaking, they are very common. These fees help maintain the roads, grass, and other features of a community that wouldn’t otherwise be taken care of.&nbsp;

**However, HOA fees also hurt your potential investment’s ROI.** It might be difficult, but if you’re looking to buy an investment property in Hawaii, try to look for a house that does not have HOA fees. Usually, all townhouses and condos will have HOA fees, so you’ll probably need to stick to single-family housing.&nbsp;

If you have questions about how you can avoid HOA fees or mitigate their impact on your investment, please call or email us. We’d love to speak through the issue with you.
