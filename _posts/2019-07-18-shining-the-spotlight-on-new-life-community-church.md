*In today’s “Brand Ambassador” video, we’ll take you to New Life Community Church to learn about the program and why they’re one of our beneficiaries.*

The Brand Ambassador program, in a nutshell, is a powerful market system. **The goal of the program is to partner with small businesses in the Carlisle/Cumberland County area to magnify their brands.** By partnering with us, these businesses get to tap into a marketing system that took 17 years to build—that’s pretty powerful stuff. As the Brand Ambassador program grows in partnerships, the amount that it can give back to the community grows, as well.

We’re now on our way to go meet Ryan Brown, who leads New Life Community Church. On the car ride over there, I learned more about Ryan, his organization, and what they’re all about.

New Life Community serves people in need. The teachings of Christ say to take care of people—good people, bad people, and broken people—Ryan and New Life Community Church follow those teachings. Ryan has a heart for those without homes or food, those in abusive situations, &nbsp;and those in the community with addiction issues.

When we arrived at New Life Community Church, Ryan welcomed us with open arms, and we went to the conference room to talk more about the program, the vision of New Life, and how we could help.

**The New Life Community Church is a diverse group of people living out their faith and who want to do church in unique ways.** Within their Carlisle facility there are many organizations that have office space. Those organizations seek to meet community needs through specific ministries and partnerships.&nbsp;

New Life's purpose is to meet people right where they are in their lives and walk them toward healing and growth. “New Life Community is a church that connects with a diverse group of people, and the way that we do that is through partnering,” Ryan says. “We partner with anybody and everybody who has similar values and desires to see people be accepted and healed—people who have hope.”

In order to keep New Life’s purpose right-side-up, the business model can easily end up upside down, meaning that **as more people find acceptance and hope under the New Life umbrella, New Life grows in its responsibility to serve and walk with those people.** They want to help people whether they attend church or not, so if the only funding source is traditional tithing, New Life stretches its resources very thin. That’s where the Brand Ambassador program comes into play.

As the Brand Ambassador program grows, the amount of money it can give to New Life Community will grow, the number of people New Life can serve will grow, and the ways New Life can invest in those people will also grow.

Needless to say, Ryan and the New Life Community Leadership are definitely on board with this program. The funding from this program can help Ryan do what he does best: help people and help make the Carlisle/Cumberland County areas better places to live. **That’s the overall goal of the Brand Ambassador program.**

The next step of our journey is to go out and talk to actual business owners to see if they’re willing to sign up. Hopefully, you can be a part of that, too, and we'll gain some traction with the Brand Ambassador program.

Until next time, if you have any questions about the program or how to become involved with our efforts to change the community for the better, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to speak with you.<br>&nbsp;
