The Christopher Walden House of Hope is a nonprofit organization, we have found a facility for addiction therapy that’s badly needed in the state of Alaska. There are so few treatment options, and **we are enthusiastic about bringing a facility like this to our community.**

A friend of mine has graciously donated her late husband’s gorgeous Harley Davidson motorcycle, a 2014 StreetGlide valued at around $16,000. We’re holding a raffle for the bike, with each $100 ticket going toward the Christopher Walden House of Hope. We will be working with a rehab program here in Alaska.

As many of you may know, our son passed away after a battle with addiction. As hard as it is, we’re passionate about taking this tragedy and turning it into something positive.

**Anybody out there who is looking to be a new Harley owner, head on over to&nbsp;**[**christopherwaldenhousehope.org**](https://www.christopherwaldenhousehope.org/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**.** You can get your tickets there under the “Harley Raffle” tab. There are only 500 total tickets that will be sold, and every penny will go toward helping those in our community who need it.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I’d love to hear from you, and I look forward to giving away this bike\!
