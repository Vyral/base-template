There are seven big mistakes that I commonly see people make when selling their house. Here's how to avoid them.

When you sell your house, there are some common mistakes that I see too many sellers make:

**1. Picking the wrong agent:** Most people pick an agent they know or a relative rather than one with proven track record who sells homes full time and has experience in the area.

**2. Overpricing the home:** There's a fine line between getting the best price and asking too much and selling too cheaply in the end. Get a professional's opinion on the value of your house and listen to them!

**3. Not making simple repairs to their home like cleaning and new paint:** Some sellers don't even want to replace minor things like missing fixtures or handrails. A good agent can advise you on what to repair.

**4. Too much clutter:** We all have too much stuff, so get rid of all that clutter when selling.

**5. Not allowing adequate access:** Most buyers will want to see your home by appointment, and sometimes they might want to see it on shorter than a day's notice. Let them in; they're ready, willing, and able buyers.

**6. Staying during a showing:** You want to leave while a buyer looks at your home so they have an environment where they can open up to their agent and ask questions without feeling like they're intruding on your privacy.

**7. Leaving pets in the house during showings:** Cats and dogs are great, but they can be a distraction.
