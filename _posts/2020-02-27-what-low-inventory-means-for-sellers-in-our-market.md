<br>Where has the inventory gone? That’s the question everyone’s asking.

Buyers are out in full force because interest rates are once again at an all-time low. **It’s a wonderful time to buy, houses are selling quickly, and we’re seeing multiple-offer situations again**.

Inventory is particularly low in certain price points. In Tracy, for example, there are only a handful of houses available in the $400,000 to $800,000 range.

While this is happening, builder confidence is skyrocketing. They’re building as fast as possible to keep up with demand. When interest rates were creeping up toward 5%, the market slowed down a little bit, but once they dropped again, demand rose. Consumer confidence is high at the moment, and people are anxious to buy.

If you’re thinking about selling your home, **now’s a great time to take advantage of this trend and get top dollar for it**. When the market gives you a gift like this, you take it.
