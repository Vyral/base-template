What should you expect to see on the market as we transition into spring? I have information and advice that you might find useful.

Today, I’d like to talk about what we can expect in terms of the market now that we’re leaving winter behind and transitioning into spring.

**Spring is when the real estate market really starts to get busy.** Sellers are occupied with preparing their homes for the market by painting, cleaning things out, emptying closets, making whatever repairs they need to, and freshening up the curb appeal. Buyers, on the other hand, are waiting for homes to start popping up on the MLS.

However, **there is a general shortage of inventory**; pockets here and there have either almost none at all or plenty to offer. If you’re unsure where your location is in terms of inventory, give us a call and we can help you figure out what’s happening in your segment of the market.

For the last five and a half years, we’ve been doing “**coming soon**” listings. These allow you to prepare your home to list but also get some marketing done before you actually go live. We can give you more information on how you can use this to your advantage. For buyers looking for the coming soon inventory, be sure to ask our agents. We can now search for those listings in our MLS.

Things are starting to heat up this time of year. **You should expect to see multiple offers more and more, especially in the busy segments of the market.**

If you have any questions about this or would like more information on prepping your house for sale or what your home’s value is, please reach out to us. We’ll be glad to assist you.
