Today I’ll go over the weekly information about what's going on in the housing market in Clarksville, Tennessee. This market is still a win-win situation for both buyers and sellers.

**Right now, we have 450 active homes on the market.** At this time last year, we only had 428 active homes. That tells me this market is still thriving, and homebuyers still have great choices.

Last year, homes had an average price of $228,000. **This year, homes cost around $268,000.** There's still a great opportunity for homeowners to sell their homes for their equity. Then, you can either upgrade to your dream home or downsize and use the additional equity for other investments.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me via phone or email. I’d love to hear from you and answer any questions you may have.
