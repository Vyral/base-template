As your property management company, we take care of pictures and videos of your property for you.

Pictures and videos are very important. If your car is not washed and shiny, it doesn’t look its best. **We make sure that your unit is clean and vacant before we send a professional photographer in to take pictures and video.**

We also promise and commit to taking new pictures and videos every time your unit goes vacant. We need to have everything date-stamped for the court system. In case an unfortunate event happens and we have to evict somebody, we need before and after pictures at the ready.

**These pictures come as part of our service at no cost to the owner.** We’ll take pictures each time we get a new tenant in as part of our 10% fee. There are no rental fees, rental buffers, or maintenance buffers.

If you have any questions, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
