In the wake of Hurricane Irma, I hope you and your family are safe and that your property is without any significant damage. Whether you were able to evacuate or not, there is a lot to think about following such a massive storm.

My family and I were able to get out in time. But in our absence, we were left worrying about what would happen to our home.

Our house happens to be located in Flood Zone X, where flood insurance is not mandatory. That being said, we did not have flood insurance. **If something would have hit in our area, we would have been in a very dire situation.**

If you look at a map of the area showing where flood insurance is mandatory, you’ll find that there is actually very little correlation between that area and the area that is actually affected in the event of a storm.

<br>**The range of a upper-category hurricanes actually goes well into the areas where flood insurance is not mandatory.** This means that many people who didn’t opt into coverage could very well be left without a means of recovery.

If you get impacted by water intrusion and don’t have flood insurance in place, your homeowners insurance simply will not cover the damages.

After such a close call, the decision to contact our insurance provider and reevaluate our coverage was an easy one. **I would highly recommend calling your insurance provider and asking about flood insurance options.**

Even if you live in an area where flood insurance isn’t mandatory, you can still be affected by storms. You don’t want to be left without help. You may be surprised to learn that coverage can be more affordable than you think. And, ultimately, it could be well worth it if disaster strikes.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
