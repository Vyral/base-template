<br>What’s happening with the Federal Reserve and interest rates?&nbsp;

**The Fed met again recently and decided they would lower interest rates.** A lot of people think this applies directly to [mortgages](https://thewhitegroupblog.com/get-a-mortgage-for-less-out-of-pocket-money-with-the-zero-plus-program.html){: target="_blank"}, meaning that anytime the Fed lowers interest rates, mortgage rates drop as well.&nbsp;

This is partially true, but the effect isn’t always immediate. Sometimes the mortgage industry anticipates these rate drops and prices themselves ahead of the Fed meetings.&nbsp;

Now that we’re into the fourth quarter of 2019, rates are at an all-time low. **It’s a great time to buy a home, and we have a product called the&nbsp;[Keller Mortgage ZeroPlus loan](https://thewhitegroupblog.com/get-a-mortgage-for-less-out-of-pocket-money-with-the-zero-plus-program.html){: target="_blank"} that can help you.** It’s a no-fee mortgage (no origination fee, processing fee, or application fees), which essentially makes it a free mortgage. They still have competitive rates, too, because the lenders don’t spend a lot of money advertising for their business.&nbsp;

Additionally, the “Plus” part means that if the mortgage balance is over $150,000, you’ll get a $1,000 lender credit that you can use for third-party expenses at closing. This is also a great option if you’re looking to refinance.
