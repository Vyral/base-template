Welcome back to the second segment of “Casey’s Corner”—a great new series in which I’ll be interviewing special guests from around north San Diego County about their contributions to our community.&nbsp;

My second interviewee in this series is my good friend and financial/tax advisor Thomas Boles. In 2007, he became the president and owner of Telesis Tax & Financial. Though it started solely as a financial firm in 1984, when Thomas took the reins, he expanded it to include a tax element. Among other things, Thomas is a registered tax preparer and an IRS-enrolled agent.&nbsp;
