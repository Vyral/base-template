Today I want to take a departure from our usual subject of real estate to talk about something a little different.

The St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital is hosting a marathon. To help out with what we believe is a very worthy cause, Kyle and I have committed to running in this event.

Kyle will be running a full marathon and I will be running a half, and **we need your help. We have a goal of raising $5,000 total, or $2,500 a piece, to go towards helping children in need.**

For those of you who may not know, St. Jude’s helps children with serious illnesses like cancer.

The St. Jude Memphis Marathon will be taking place on the weekend of December 1st through the 3rd. This is an incredibly important cause, and we want to do our part to help. We hope that you’ll be able to help us do so.
