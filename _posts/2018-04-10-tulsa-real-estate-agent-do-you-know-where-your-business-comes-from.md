If you keep track of relationship patterns, you’ll see that making one contact can lead to a windfall of transactions down the road.

If you look in the video above, you’ll see I’m holding a piece of paper I’m really proud of that I want to share with you. It’s a flowchart of a relationship pattern my team and me have been tracking.

What this shows me is that **making one contact, making one relationship, and helping one family with their relationship needs can lead to over 30 other transactions.**

If you take those 30 units and multiply them by our average commission of—let’s say—$5,000, that’s over $300,000 of gross commission income we can bring in as a team, all by being purposeful and having a database that applies systemized touches. And, it’s fun!

So, **make sure you notice relationship patterns.** The reason I was reminded to share this with you is that Nate, one of our sales associates, has been working with some new clients buy and sell homes, and we retraced those transactions to a friend I went to college with whom we helped buy and sell a home last year.

That sign in the yard led to another listing across the street, which led to an open house guest, which led to four other families we now get to help. Celebrate these kinds of patterns and don’t forget to reward the people who help you with your business.  

As always, if you have any questions or there’s anything else I can assist you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
