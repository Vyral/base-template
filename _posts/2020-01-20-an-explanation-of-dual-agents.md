On a recent appearance on “Ask the Experts” I answered the common question, “What is a dual agent?” **Essentially, a dual agent is someone who represents both the [buyer](https://leewillbuyit.com/){: target="_blank"} and [seller](https://quiz.localexpert.co/Lee_Garland_The_Moving_On_Team_Home_Valuation-3){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;in the same transaction equally.** They have a fiduciary duty to both sides, so they can’t tell a seller that a buyer would pay more or tell a buyer that the seller would take less. It’s a bit of a tricky situation, but it’s quite common. If you have any questions for me, feel free to reach out anytime via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
