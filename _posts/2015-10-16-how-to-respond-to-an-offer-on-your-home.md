Today I wanted to answer a question I’ve been getting quite frequently. A lot of sellers have been asking me about how quickly they should respond to offers on their homes. **Normally, when an offer is written, a buyer is going to want to get an answer pretty quickly**, usually within 24-48 hours, unless it’s a weekend.&nbsp;

The quicker you respond to an offer as a seller, the better chance you have of putting the deal together. What are your options? **If you like the offer, go ahead and accept it. If the offer is not acceptable to you, we strongly recommend making a counter-offer, so you still have a chance at getting a deal done**, at least more so than if you would have declined the offer.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this process and what your options are, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We can’t wait to hear from you!
