Victor Cortese is joining us once again to answer another common investor question: “What are the things that I need to look for in a property manager? What questions should I ask them?”

According to Victor, you want to enter with a framework of a partnership. Part of that is managing your tenants and making sure there's proper customer service in managing your tenants. **Trust and transparency are critical as well to protect your asset and make sure that your ideal margin is maintained.**

A lot of our clients are looking to buy multiple properties at once and want to take these assets to help them meet their retirement goals. Protecting that margin is important, and you want a management company that is proactive and performs preventive maintenance to avoid bigger issues down the line. **A maintenance reserve of a few hundred dollars usually takes care of this, but we'll talk about that next time when we talk about the costs of hiring a property manager.**

In the meantime, if you have any questions for Victor, you can reach him at (484) 450-8908. If you have any other questions for me, feel free to reach out anytime via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
