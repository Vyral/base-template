Have you considered investing in real estate? There are many advantages to owning an investment property.

**The first benefit is cash flow.**Cash flow is when you take your income – what your tenants are paying you – and subtract monthly expenses such as your mortgage payment, property manager expenses, utilities, and any maintenance that may occur. Whatever is left over is your cash flow.

When you buy an investment property, you want to make sure that you have positive cash flow. Imagine that you own one property that brings you $500 a month in cash flow. Now imagine that you own 20 properties that bring in $500 a month! That is really the goal of investing in real estate – you want to create a portfolio of rental properties.

**There are also many federal tax benefits that are given to real estate owners.** One of the largest tax benefits is that the IRS allows you to depreciate the value of your property over time. Not only that, but this passive income is taxed at a lower rate than your active income because there is no self-employment tax on your passive cash flow income.

Another benefit to buying an investment property is that you can use other people’s money, which is a huge advantage over buying gold or stocks. You can get a 30-year mortgage and have your tenants pay it back. Over time, the tenants are also paying down your principal. That means you are creating wealth every single month. Owning a rental property is like having a guaranteed savings account.

**We should warn investors to buy the right property.** Don’t buy a property thinking that, because the market is hot, the property will continue to appreciate quickly. Property appreciation is a lovely bonus at the end of owning a property for 15 to 30 years and is not guaranteed in the short term.

Investors who hung onto investment properties during the downturn saw great benefit from the rise in rental rates even though appreciation stopped. Their investments were still profitable because they had positive cash flow, which is what the true investor should focus on first.
