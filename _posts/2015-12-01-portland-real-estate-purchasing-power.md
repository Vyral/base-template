The National Association of Realtors published a national study on what motivates buyers to purchase a home in today’s economy. Their conclusions included three specific reasons.
1. People want the opportunity to build equity. They’re using a home to augment or enhance their net worth, in addition to any other investments they have. Data reveals the average family wealth among homeowners has gradually increased since 2010. Conversely, renters continue to maintain the same amount of wealth with a slight drop. Indefinitely, owning a home has a dramatic impact on your family’s net worth in the economy.

2. People want a safe and stable environment to live in. This year’s Rent.com market report orients around property managers. The study results show 88% of property managers increased rent over the past twelve months without intention of stopping; 68% predict rents will continue to rise next year by an average of 8%; and 53% were more likely to bring in a new tenant at a higher rate rather than negotiate and renew a lease with a current tenant.

3. People want to choose the environment they live in. We conduct business with clients we admire. Likewise, we want to foster a neighborhood community with people who share similar values. We often run into clients who are focused on school districts, who else lives in the neighborhood, what other kids are living in the area, etc. That’s why it’s important to us.
