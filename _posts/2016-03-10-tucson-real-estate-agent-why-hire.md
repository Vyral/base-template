We expect this to be a great year for home sellers in Tucson. Rising interest rates will push home buyers out onto the market, and you can capitalize on this if you are looking to sell in 2016. It could be a very profitable time to put your home on the market.

Keep in mind that the most important thing you do while selling your home is finding an accurate price for it. The best person to talk to about this is your local Realtor. My team will come out to your property and run a competitive market analysis. We research the market and comparable properties around your home in order to find a reasonable sale price.

Another option is to hire an appraiser to come take a look at your home. This will cost a bit more, but it’s a good way to get an independent estimate for the price of your home.

Something we like to do is analyze the three C’s of your home. This is the condition, the competition, and the consumption in your area. These statistics can tell us a lot about what buyers might be willing to pay for your home. Ultimately, it is the buyer that will determine the final sale price of your home.

If you have any questions, or would like to schedule a time for us to come and speak to you about your property, please don’t hesitate to contact me.
