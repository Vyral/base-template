So you made an offer, it was accepted, and&nbsp; now your next task is to have the home&nbsp; inspected prior to closing. More often than&nbsp; not, your agent may have made your offer&nbsp; contingent on a clean home inspection.

This contingency allows you to renegotiate&nbsp; the price paid for the home, ask the sellers&nbsp; to cover repairs, or even, in some cases, walk&nbsp; away. Your agent can advise you on the best&nbsp; course of action once the report is filed.

Now, what to expect when home inspecting?

**How to Choose an Inspector**

Your agent will most likely have a short list of inspectors that they have worked with in the&nbsp; past that they can recommend to you. Realtor.com suggests that you consider the following 5&nbsp; areas when choosing the right home inspector for you:

**Qualifications**&nbsp;– Find out what’s included in your inspection & if the age or location of your home may warrant specific certifications or specialties.

**Sample Reports**&nbsp;– Ask for a sample inspection report so you can review how thoroughly&nbsp; they will be inspecting your dream home. The more detailed the report the better in&nbsp; most cases.

**References&nbsp;**– Do your homework. Ask for phone numbers and names of past clients that&nbsp; you can call to ask about their experience.

**Memberships&nbsp;**– Not all inspectors belong to a national or state association of home&nbsp; inspectors, and membership in one of these groups should not be the only way to&nbsp; evaluate your choice. Often membership in one of these organizations means that there is&nbsp; continued training and education provided.

**Errors & Omission Insurance**&nbsp;– Find out what the liability of the inspector or inspection company is once the inspection is over. The inspector is only human after all, and it is possible that they might miss something they should have seen.

Ask your inspector if it’s okay for you to tag along during the inspection. That way they can point out anything that should be addressed or fixed.

Don’t be surprised to see your inspector climbing on the roof, crawling around in the attic,&nbsp; and on the floors. The job of the inspector is to protect your investment and find any issues&nbsp; with the home, including but not limited to:

* roof
* plumbing
* electrical components
* appliances
* heating & air conditioning systems
* ventilation
* windows
* fireplace &&nbsp; chimney
* the foundation & so much more!

**Bottom Line**

They say ‘ignorance is bliss,’ but not when investing your hard-earned money in a home of&nbsp; your own. Work with a professional you can trust to give you the most information possible&nbsp; about your new home so that you can make the most educated decision about your purchase.
