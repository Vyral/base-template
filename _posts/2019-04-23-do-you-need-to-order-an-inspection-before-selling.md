Many sellers ask me whether a pre-listing inspection is worth it, and, typically, **my advice is to only seek one out if it’s required by your city.** You can see a full list of cities that require such an inspection below today’s message.

If you live in a city that doesn’t require a pre-listing inspection, though, it’s generally best not to order one. Some may argue that an inspection will help you identify and resolve issues in your home before you list, but the truth is that you and your future buyer will likely have very different ideas about what’s worth fixing. As a seller, it isn’t your responsibility to discover new problems—it’s your responsibility to disclose existing problems.

\*\*There are some rare circumstances in which a pre-listing inspection can be beneficial, but as a general rule, it’s best to hold off. \*\*

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

**Finally, below is the list of cities that require reports prior to closing escrow.** Every city has in place its own policies and requirements for the sale of real estate, so please check with your city for further information.
