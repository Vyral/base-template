The ongoing health crisis has reshaped the lives of many Americans. Our lifestyles and needs have changed, and many homeowners are realizing that their living spaces aren’t providing what they’re looking for anymore. A lot of people are moving in order to find homes that suit them better, and here are the main reasons why:

**1\. Working from home:** Remote work became a new normal during the pandemic, and many businesses have decided to make telecommuting permanent. Now, people don’t need to live so close to the office anymore. They can get more for their money if they move further away from the city, so they’re deciding to pick up and get out of town. Others are trying but failing to create an office space within their home, leading them to find a bigger place to live.

**2\. Space for fitness and activities:** Staying healthy is a top priority for many Americans, and many people dream of having the space for a well-stocked home gym. Others need a place they can devote to their favorite hobbies and other activities. As a result, many people are selling their homes to find a larger space for fitness and fun.

**3\. Outdoor space:** Sixty percent of homeowners want to add an outdoor kitchen. Additionally, gardens are growing in popularity, as many people are growing fruits, vegetables, and herbs in order to help supplement their pantry. Others are simply looking for secluded outdoor spaces to relax in privacy. Outdoor space comes at a premium in many areas, though, so some people are choosing to move.

Today’s market, as well as the shift to remote work, provides a great opportunity to get more home for your money. If you’re ready to buy or sell a house, or if you have any questions about our market, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
