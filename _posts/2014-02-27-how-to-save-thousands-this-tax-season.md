I just wanted to reach out to you today to remind you that with spring on the way, it's time to act accordingly if you're in the process of selling a home.

It's been very warm here in Burbank lately, and because of this I wanted to remind you to make sure that your lawn is looking nice and fresh. This can include:
* Making sure your sprinklers are working correctly
* Manicuring your lawn to make sure the grass is as green as possible
* Planting your flowers in their beds
* Trimming your trees and bushes

These are just a handful of ways you can improve your front yard to attract potential buyers. Curb appeal is very important in the spring, and because it has been so warm in Burbank, it's time to put our best foot forward. Take advantage of this warm weather and prep your home, as well as your yard, for sale.

If you need help finding gardeners or landscapers, please contact me because I have a few trusted workers that I can recommend. Also, if you want any help buying or selling Burbank real estate, call me at (818) 953-5300 or email me at Brad@BradKorb.com
