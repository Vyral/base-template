We put our virtual assistants through rigorous screening to ensure that we only provide the best help to our clients. Out of every 60 applicants, only about five will pass our test.

How do we at 1000 Calls A Day find the best virtual assistants for our clients?

First of all, we hold our applicants to a very high standard of quality. **Out of the 60 applications we receive every day, only about five typically make it past this initial screening.**

From there, we show the remaining applicants what to expect out of a typical day-in-the-life of one of our virtual assistants. By showing them what to expect, giving them basic scripts and roleplay assessments, as well as having them shadow our tenured virtual assistants, we do all we can to ensure that they are fully equipped to do the most for our clients.

Once applicants have made it this far, we like to make sure that they have updated software and computer systems as well as a stable Internet connection.

They then move on to a more difficult segment of our roleplay assessment. After they pass that, they become one of our virtual assistants.

We truly only take the best applicants to work for our clients.

To learn more about how to grow your business, or if you have any questions, feel free to give us a call or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
