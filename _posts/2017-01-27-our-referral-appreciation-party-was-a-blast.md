We appreciate every referral a client sends us. To thank all our clients for their referrals, we held a casino night.

We’ve got some great footage of our referral appreciation party to share with you. This was a celebration for all of the people who have referred friends, family, and coworkers to us that we have been able to take care of.

To say thank you to all of these people, we decided to hold a casino party, which was a blast. We had craps tables, mice races, and more for people to bet on. Check out some great footage from one of the mice races in the video above.

We just thought we would give you a quick taste of some of the fun things we like to do for our clients when they refer business to us. If you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell in Kansas City, we would love the opportunity to take care of them too. All you’ve got to do is give us a call or send us an email. We are always here to answer any questions you may have about real estate.
