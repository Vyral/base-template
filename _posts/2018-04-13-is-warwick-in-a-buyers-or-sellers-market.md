What’s going on in the Warwick market? Is our area in a buyer’s or seller’s market?

**Right now, it’s most certainly on the seller side.** Current inventory is low, which means if you’re considering listing your home, now is the time to do it because you’ll be able to get top dollar for it. There are many buyers out there and not enough homes to keep up with demand.

If you’re a buyer, interest rates are still at historic lows, which means now is also the perfect time for you to get pre-qualified, find your dream home, and lock in a low rate before they go up.&nbsp;

If you’re thinking of buying or selling a home or you have any more questions about our market, give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you.
