Are you tired of looking at Zillow and not getting up-to-date real estate information? If so, I’ve got a solution for you today.

Those of you who know me know that I am a huge advocate of Zillow. I want to be Charleston’s poster girl for Zillow because **I think it’s such a great company and a great place to start your home search.** However, I hear from my clients over and over that the homes on the site are not up to date according to our MLS. This can be very frustrating for homebuyers.

**So we have created an app that will solve that problem.** Our app, Charleston Properties, is coordinated with our local MLS so everything will be as accurate as possible. If you’d like to take advantage of our regularly-updated information, search for the Charleston Properties app on the App Store or Google Play Store and download it.

Once the app is downloaded, you can see every home that is an active listing on the market. You will also be able to see upcoming open houses and create a search that matches your specific criteria. **You can search for homes according to the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more.**

As a former school teacher, I also love that it gives a great school report card feature. This app will give you the most up-to-date information possible.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
