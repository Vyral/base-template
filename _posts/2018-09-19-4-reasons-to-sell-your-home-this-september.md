Real estate prices and values are always changing in our community. As a top broker here at Century 21, I look at properties and prices pretty much every day and I know what's happening with your real estate’s value.

It’s true that homes are taking longer to sell this year than they did last year. **However, we still only have two months of inventory, well below the balanced market standard of six months.** With such low inventory, it always surprises me when sellers tell me they want to wait until spring. Why would you wait to compete over homes later when you can win now? More competition means less money, and you’ll have much less of that when you list now. Here are three ways you can be a winner by listing in September:

{% include pullquote.html %}

**1. Price your home at market value.** We have more inventory now and buyers aren’t overpaying like they used to. Pricing at market value will ensure that you win and get the most possible money for your home.

**2. Serious buyers are looking now.** In this summer market, we have a lot more buyers, but a lot of those buyers are just lookers. Right now, our agents are working with about 15-20 active, pre-qualified buyers at a time that are ready to buy. When do you want your first offer? Let’s make that happen.

**3. Investors are looking for transactions now.** Many investor buyers, including the ones we are working with, need to buy before the end of the year for tax reasons.&nbsp;

**4. There’s less competition.** This is the most important factor in selling this September. Less competition equals more money.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me or you're ready to be a winner in this real estate market, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
