We’ve developed an in-house down payment assistance program that can help clients who previously wouldn’t have been able to afford a down payment.

Today I want to share some exciting news regarding down payment assistance.

In the past, we’ve had clients that didn’t quite have enough money saved for a down payment. In response to this, **we’ve developed an in-house down payment assistance program for up to 3.5% of the sales price.** The credit qualifications are minimal and the income caps are much higher than the state-funded DPA programs or bond programs.

We’d love to help you achieve the path toward homeownership, so if you have any questions about this new program, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We look forward to helping you!
