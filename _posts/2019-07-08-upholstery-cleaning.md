Have you ever tried to shampoo your sofas, ottomans, or other upholstered furniture to get rid of those food stains that accumulate over time? Some of them seem like they’re just impossible to defeat.

Well, today I’m joined by Walter Pope, owner and operator of Grayson Smith Carpet & Upholstery Cleaning, so that he can give us some insight about what makes him the best upholstery cleaner in all of Memphis.

One thing that sets his company apart from the rest is that **they don’t send out technicians to your home.** Though Walter is one of the owners, he’s also the one who’ll come to your home to complete the job. That means you’ll benefit from his experience in the industry, as well as his personal and professional desire to do the job right the first time.

**He’s also committed to honesty.** If he spots a stain that he believes he won’t be able to tackle, he’ll let the client know outright before starting the project. If they change their mind about working with him, then he’ll simply shake their hand and go on with his day.

Walter admits that he’s in this business to make money, but **his focus is to do what’s right for the client. “It pays off in the long run,” he says.**

If you would like to learn more about the services Walter offers or if you need advice about tackling another home cleaning issue, reach out to us. We’d be happy to put you in touch with him and to answer your questions.<br>&nbsp;
