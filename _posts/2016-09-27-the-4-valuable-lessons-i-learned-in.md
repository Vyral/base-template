Today I wanted to switch things up a bit and share with you the four lessons that I learned while on vacation in Greece. There are lessons all around us everywhere we go.

 The first is to **be open-minded.** One thing I was really concerned about was the cuisine because I wasn't sure if I'd like it. I didn't like Greek yogurt, but what I discovered was that I just had never had great Greek yogurt. In Greece, we enjoyed fresh Greek yogurt every morning, and it was delicious! Imagine if I had been unwilling to try something new— I would have missed out on discovering one of my new favorite things.

 The second thing I learned was to **be willing to try something new.** We also rented scooters and ATVs in Greece, which scared me a bit because we weren't familiar with the area, and honestly, they drive a little bit crazy over there. We decided to try something new, though, and we got to see parts of Greece that we would never have gotten to see if we hadn't been willing to just give it a try.

Another thing I learned was to **treat everything like an adventure.** Even something like getting lost can be fun. Look at life that way— what are you doing in the moment, and how can you make it fun and exciting instead of just looking at what's wrong.

 Finally, the fourth thing I learned was to **set big goals and allow yourself to dream bigger.** My husband and I were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary, and we thought back to our honeymoon. It was very different than this trip; it was a very short weekend trip, which we thought was wonderful at the time. Because we've allowed ourselves to think big and dream big, we were able to take this amazing trip.

 I hope you'll take these four lessons I've learned and give them a try to create something amazing for yourself. If you have any questions for me, please don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I'd love to keep this conversation going!
