This is a quick reminder about our seller’s seminar on February 8.

Thank you for signing up for our seller’s seminar\! We’re just sending a reminder about this event since we have limited seating. **The seminar is on Saturday, February 8 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.** We will be providing lunch. We will also supply a pencil and a pad of paper for you to take notes on.&nbsp;

If for some reason you can’t make it, please call and let us know. Remember, we only do this seminar once a year, and others may want to take your place. We have much to teach you. We look forward to seeing you there.

If you ever have any additional questions about real estate, please feel free to reach out to us via phone or email. We would love to help you.
