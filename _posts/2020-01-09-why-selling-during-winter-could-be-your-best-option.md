Should you sell your home during the winter or wait until springtime?

I’m amazed at how many calls my team and I get from prospective sellers asking this very question. As I always say, **it doesn’t matter what time of year you list—you just have to adjust your selling strategy to whatever the market is bearing at the time.&nbsp;**

Usually, our market slows down in September, but that didn’t happen in 2019. It stayed busy up until Christmas time. In certain price ranges, homes are being snatched up within the first week of being listed, and sometimes within the first day. This makes now a great time to sell. You’ll face less competition from other sellers because there may be fewer homes on the market.&nbsp;

There may not be as many buyers out there, either, which makes now a good time to buy, as well. Additionally, this may make sellers more motivated to sell.&nbsp;

**At the Air Assault Team, we offer three ways to sell your home:** our guaranteed home sale program, an instant offer, or the traditional listing method. We’re always ready to sell your home quickly and for top dollar.&nbsp;

If you’d like to know more about which listing method works best for you or you have any questions about our Clarksville market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
