A lot of people have been asking me lately about the Bay Area real estate market and whether we are in a market that’s better suited for buyers or sellers. **The truth is, it depends on what price range you’re looking at.**

 In the luxury market, anything over $1.4 million is in more of a buyer’s market. We are seeing less and less multiple offer situations, and people are no longer bidding 10% to 15% over list price like they used to. **If you’ve been thinking of buying in this segment of the market, it’s a great time to get a deal.**

 For homes under $1 million, with how low interest rates are and how strong the rental market is, it doesn’t make sense for anyone to pay their landlord’s mortgage. **It makes more sense to buy a home by taking advantage of low interest rates and investing in your own equity.**

 If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
