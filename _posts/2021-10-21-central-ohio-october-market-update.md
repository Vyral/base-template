Today I’d like to share a quick overview of our Central Ohio real estate market. We have about one month of inventory, which means if no new houses came onto the market, we’d have none for sale in about 30 days. Properties are staying on the market for an average of 11 days and are selling at 102% of their list price, so everything is selling at or above list price. **This is an incredibly competitive market due to our low inventory.&nbsp;**

The current average sale price is around $259,000, which has increased from October of last year. We’re in a fairly aggressive seller’s market. However, there are ways you can still buy in this market: You need to be pre-approved for a loan, ensure you have the funds for your down payment, then we need to strategize to win you the home.&nbsp;

If you have questions or concerns about how to buy in our market right now or any other real estate matter, I can be reached via phone or email. I would love to help you.
