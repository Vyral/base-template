Today I want to give you a quick update on what’s happening in our real estate market. There’s been a lot of negativity in the news, but are things as bad as you’ve heard? Let’s take a look at the latest numbers and find out.&nbsp;

Right now, the Anchorage market only has about 230 active listings, which comes out to around one month of supply. **I know some people think it isn’t a great time to sell, but with inventory so low, many sellers are still receiving fantastic deals.**

The average sales price in our area is around $467,000, and in January 2022, it was around $417,000. This means prices are still way up since the beginning of this year. Meanwhile, most homes spend anywhere from 15 to 65 days on the market. Homes that are priced right and in good condition are still selling fast, while overpriced houses are staying on the market a little longer.&nbsp;

Meanwhile, the Valley has around 1.7 months’ worth of inventory; however, around 50% of their houses are currently under contract. The average list price here is $409,000, which is about a 12% increase since the beginning of the year.&nbsp;

**The bottom line is that sellers shouldn’t drag their feet.** Now is still a good time to sell your home, so call or email my team if you’d like to make a move. I look forward to hearing from you\!
