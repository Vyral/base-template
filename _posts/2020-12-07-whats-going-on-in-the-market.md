<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you need of more space in your home, you’re not alone.</em></p>

With the COVID situation continuing to affect the world, a lot of people are spending more time in their homes. Many have realized or decided that their current space isn’t a good fit for them and they need to make some changes.&nbsp;

**Many families are determining that their house is either too big or too small for them.** We’ve seen that most people are either downsizing due to financial situations or upsizing due to lack of space.

If you need to make a move, now is the time to get your home ready to go on the market so we can get it sold and find you something different. **Interest rates are as low as they’ve ever been, and if you can lock in a rate now, you should.** It’s a great time to refinance as well. I’d be happy to connect you with some great local lenders or other home service providers as you need them. If you have any questions for me or any real estate needs that my team can assist with, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We would be happy to help you.
