<center><em>These three tips will help you avoid a low appraisal when it's time to sell.</em></center>

<br>Here are a few steps to take if you want to avoid a low appraisal when it comes to selling your house:

First, **make a list of repairs and upgrades** that you’ve done to the home recently to give the appraiser so you can justify the price that you’re asking for. The appraiser can attribute the home’s value to those improvements.

Next, **compile a list of comparable sales** in your neighborhood from the last 90 days up to the last six months so that the appraiser can factor them into their evaluation.

From there, we’ll **present your upgrades list and your comparable sales to the appraiser** either in person or via email to show them the market conditions of your sale. For example, if your home went on the market and received multiple offers, some for well over asking price, you would want the appraiser to know about the market conditions associated with that contract negotiation as well as what price was settled on.

If you have any other questions about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to schedule a free consultation.
