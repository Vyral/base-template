I’m back once again for part three of my “Shift” series. We’re continuing our examination of the change we’re experiencing in the market right now along with the book “Shift” by Gary Keller.

**Shift tactic No. 3 is effective people leverage.** Essentially, we’re talking about surrounding yourself with the right people who fit your culture, help you grow, and scale your business.&nbsp;

In a shifting market, it’s super important that your talent fits the acronym SAME. The S stands for “smart.” It’s as much about emotional intelligence as it is IQ. The A stands for “attractive to clients and to others.” The M stands for “motivated,” and E stands for “ethical.”

**As you bring talent into your organization, follow the chart at 2:29 that says what talent is and what talent isn’t.** Specifically, focus on the talent you want in a role. You need someone who finds solutions, shares your goals, pushes you, and is continually raising the bar. You’ll find that your ability to scale your business will be that much quicker and better.

As you’re looking to grow your team, I always find the people-leverage decision tree chart helpful. You can find it at 3:15 in the video above. It all starts with the initial question, “Do you have people to help you?” Depending on your answer, you go from there.&nbsp;

**People are more important than ever as we go through this market shift.** If you have any questions about hiring people, leveraging them, the shift, or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I’d love to hear from you.&nbsp;

P.S. Let me know if you need your own copy of “Shift,” and I’ll send one out to you\!
