Today, I'm here to address questions I get a lot about roof repairs before selling a property. This can be a tricky subject, so there’s a lot to unpack. When a trustee or homeowner prepares to sell their property with an active roof leak or recent history of leaks, the decision to repair depends on a few things.&nbsp;

**First, we consider the supply and demand dynamics of the housing market.** For instance, we recently encountered a situation involving a sizable ranch house of approximately 2,100 square feet with five active leaks. Despite the need for roof repairs, given the absence of comparable properties on the market and no imminent rain forecast, we recommended delaying repairs. Instead, we suggested offering a credit to potential buyers, allowing them to address the roof according to their preferences while assuming liability. Interestingly, the eventual buyer didn't prioritize the roof repair, leading to substantial cost savings and no liability concerns due to our transparent disclosure.

In some instances, especially with entry-level homes where buyers might require financial assistance, or if the roof issues pose a risk of mold formation, we may advise immediate repairs. However, such cases are relatively rare, and **our default approach is to disclose the issue to potential buyers and offer them a credit to do their own repairs.**&nbsp;

Ultimately, whether to repair or replace the roof hinges on your unique situation. If you have questions about this topic or anything else, please call or email me. I am always willing to help!
