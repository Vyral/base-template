{% include youtube.html %}<br>I’ve got some very exciting news: The Wicker Homes Group is hiring!<br><br>We’re looking for two people who are enthusiastic about seeking a career in real estate. If hired, you would be mentored by me, personally. As a 30-year veteran of the business, I have a lot to offer new agents.

But, we’re not seeking just anyone. **We are looking for candidates who are client-focused, who aren’t afraid of hard work, and who want to truly dig in and help clients to the best of their ability.**

We want agents who are high-touch and high-service. If you think you’ve got these qualities and you’re interested in pursuing a career with our team, get in touch. **We would love to meet you and see if you’re a good fit.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
