Today I want to talk about the three things that are going to have the biggest impact on New Jersey home values in 2018:

**1. Tax deductions.** As of January 1, state and local taxes that can be deducted from your annual tax bill are now capped at $10,000. In areas where taxes exceed that amount, it can and will have an adverse effect on home values, particularly in the higher end of the market.

**2. Interest rate hikes.**The Federal Reserve is also expected to raise interest rates three times in 2018, but even after the hikes rates will remain historically low (around 5%). These factors will put further pressure on the market.

**3. Mortgage interest deduction.** Your mortgage deduction is now reduced on homes with mortgages of $750,000 or less.

What do these changes mean for buyers and sellers? If you’re in the higher end of the market and thinking about cashing out, consider speeding up your plans before these reforms and rate hikes take effect. There continues to be a lack of inventory up to the median price point.

For buyers, even if the market goes down, the hike in rates could erase any perceived gain. There’s still a consistent lack of inventory even if you’re in the high-end range.

If you have any additional questions for me about any of these changes or about the market in general, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.
