Appraisals are a common topic of interest among buyers and sellers alike, so today I’ll answer nine questions about this topic to help you gain a better understanding of them no matter what side of the transaction you find yourself on.&nbsp;

**For your convenience, I’ve cited timestamps below that will direct you to each question and its corresponding answer in the video above. Use these timestamps to browse specific topics at your leisure:** &nbsp;

0:23—What does an appraiser do?&nbsp;

1:26—What information does an appraiser compile to do their appraisal?&nbsp;

2:17—How do improvements affect a home’s valuation on an appraisal?&nbsp;

3:12—How are other home sales used in the appraisal process?
