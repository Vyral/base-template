Do we have our own vendors? Yes\! We have a long list of quality vendors you can trust.

We have vendors who can do landscaping, plumbing, masonry, concrete, and more. **We’ve worked with all of them for years, and we’ve vetted them thoroughly.** We wouldn’t let our vendors overcharge for their work.

Your PM and I look at all the invoices before they make it to you. About 99% of the time, their prices are fair, but occasionally, something costs a bit more than it should, and we bring that up with the vendors.&nbsp;

Our job is to protect your home and put money in your account, and our vendors help us do that. If you have any questions, feel free to call or email us. We’d love to help.
