Today I’m joined by Micah Hahn of Patterson Associates Insurance to discuss three important factors you need to consider when buying insurance for your home.

First, **look at your deductible.** Some companies offer a standard 2% deductible, while others offer 1.5%, but the standard for our area is 1%.

Second, **look at the water coverage you’re getting.** Water coverage in Texas is very different than it is in other places. Most policies will give you what’s called a “sudden and accidental” water coverage, but many won’t give you coverage for slow water leaks or sewer backups, and they won’t give you foundational coverage, either. These are all coverages Micah recommends.

Lastly, **look at how your valuables are covered**. If you have any small, expensive items such as jewelry, collectibles, or musical instruments, make sure you talk to your insurance agent about getting special coverage for those items. The last thing you want is someone breaking into your home, stealing these items, and then finding out that they’re not covered.

If you have any more questions about insurance coverage, you can call him at (214) 253-2577 or email him at micah@piainsure.com.

As always, if you have any other questions for me or there’s anything I can assist you with, feel free to reach out to me anytime. I’d be happy to help you.
