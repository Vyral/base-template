</i>  <div style="text-align: left;">What are interest rates like in our current market?<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">According to Brandon Moss, our preferred lender, **2017 has been a great year for interest rates.** Weve seen them hover just above historic lows the entire year. 30-year fixed rates are still right around 4%, and fixed-rate adjustable-rate mortgages (or ARMs) are in the mid-to-lower 3% range.<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">However, the Federal Reserve is scheduled to meet this December, and there is a very good chance theyll hike up interest rates. Because of this, **Brandon suggests that all buyers and sellers get out there and take advantage of these rates while you still can. **<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">Right now is a great time to be a seller,  because more and more buyers are jumping off the fence and entering the market. Its also a great time to be a buyer because you wont face as much competition due to the season. <div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">You dont need a large down payment to get into a property these days. <div style="text-align: left;">Another question we often get from buyers is, Do I really have to come in with 20% down?<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">No, you do not. **There are a lot of great mortgage programs out there that dont require you to put 20% down. **If youre a first-time homebuyer, you can put as little as 3% down. If youre a move-up buyer buying a jumbo property, you can put down just 5% or 10%. Even investors can get in with just 15%. You dont need a large down payment to get into a property these days. <div style="text-align: left;">
