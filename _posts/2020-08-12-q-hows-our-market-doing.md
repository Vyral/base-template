It’s been a challenging time for many of us both professionally and personally. Markets have fluctuated due to uncertainty, and that includes our real estate market.&nbsp;

If you’re in the market to buy a home, there is a great opportunity to invest in a new property. However, fewer sellers are putting their homes on the market due to worries about the pandemic. **This is creating a huge inventory shortage.&nbsp;**

Our year-to-date sales are up a little over 19% from 2019. The average price per square foot is also up over 7% and our list-to-sale price ratio is up 12.3% as well. Days on market were down by 6.5% as well. Things are selling faster and for more money.

This shows how strong of a seller’s market we have. Inventory is down by 42% from last year and there is a crunch in supply. **You can really take advantage of this market whether you’re buying or selling a home.&nbsp;**

We’ll keep you updated going forward, but if you have any questions about buying or selling now, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
