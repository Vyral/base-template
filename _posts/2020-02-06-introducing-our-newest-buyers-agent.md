<center>We&rsquo;re proud to introduce you to Chris, the newest buyer&rsquo;s agent on our team. Here&rsquo;s what he had to say about joining Team Lally.&nbsp;</center>

&nbsp;

Chris, an Ohio native, has lived in Hawaii for four years now. He’s quickly become a valuable member of Team Lally as a buyer’s agent who helps ensure a top-notch experience for our buyers. We asked Chris some questions so that you can get to know him a little bit better, and here’s what he had to say:

**How did you hear about Team Lally?&nbsp;**

I honestly hadn’t heard about the team prior to my job search. At that time in my life, I was really looking to do something more. Team Lally’s job posting was so captivating that it genuinely made me want to learn more. Before applying, I did some research on the team and was immediately hooked—I knew at that moment that I didn’t even want to consider any other team.

**Why motivated you to join Team Lally?&nbsp;**

Aside from the captivating job posting, I was struck by the team’s core values. They align with the U.S. Army values, and my personal values as well; it just felt right.

**What do you enjoy most about working on the team?&nbsp;**

What I enjoy most about working on this team is that you really get to build relationships with your teammates. It truly feels like a family, and since my actual family is scattered all across the country, it’s great to have that support here. Being on a team helps you move forward when times get tough, and I’ve quickly learned that everything in the real estate business takes time—there are no immediate results.

Now that you've learned a bit about Chris, know that he's here to help with your real estate needs. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to him anytime\!
