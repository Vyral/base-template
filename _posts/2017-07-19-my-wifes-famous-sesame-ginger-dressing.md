Welcome to another episode of “Hacking Your Health.” We’re here in the kitchen today to make a very special recipe that we wanted to share with you—my wife’s famous sesame ginger dressing. It tastes good on just about everything.&nbsp;

**Here’s what you’ll need for the dressing**:

* 3/4 to 1 Cup of Bragg's Liquid Aminos (less Bragg's if you do not want it as salty).
* 4 Cloves of Garlic
* A Knob of Ginger
* 1 Tablespoon Tahini
* 5 Tablespoon Sesame Oil
* 1-2 Tablespoon Raw Honey
* 1 Tablespoon of Rice Wine Vinegar
* 1 Cup of Orange Juice
* 1/2-1 Cup of Olive Oil

Blend everything together except the olive oil. After everything is mixed up, slowly add in the olive oil while the blender is on. After about 30 seconds, your dressing is ready to go.
