{% include youtube.html %}Located just minutes south of downtown and right next to Lewis And Clark College, this safe community offers the best of both worlds with huge estates and an amazing school system. The Riverdale school district in Dunthorpe has the high school and the elementary school with 18 students per classroom and an average of $14,000 spent on each student.

I’m joined by Andre, who just moved to Dunthorpe from Pasadena, California, to talk about Dunthorpe and his favorite parts of living here.

“The location allows us to be almost in a country-like environment right here in Dunthorpe, and yet we are 10 minutes away from Lake Oswego, we are 15 minutes away from downtown, we have access to the Five Freeway very easily,  and we have a number of ways that we can go downtown,” Andre said. “The access from this position is outstanding.”

Andre has already found several favorite restaurants here in “The City of Restaurants,” as he says, including Tucci and A Cena for Italian and Tavern on Kruse for a modern option, and of course a number of restaurants he frequents downtown both on the East Side and West Side.

Lewis and Clark offers a wonderful library, lectures, and music, all of which Andre plans to take advantage of, living just walking distance from the college.

I also want to show you this beautiful custom home built in 2007 between the Willamette River and Highway 43 on Riverwood road, in one of the most exclusive parts of Dunthorpe. It recently sold in 2015 for just under $1.6 million.

Take a look at Elk Rock Gardens, one of my favorite spaces in all of Dunthorpe. Elk Rock Gardens boasts about six acres of English gardens designed by an amazing firm in New York City that also designed Central Park. It’s a great place for a picnic where you can sit knowing you can be here seven days a week.

Thanks so much for joining me in our tour through the beautiful Dunthorpe neighborhood. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions. I look forward to hearing from you!
