As most of you already know, I’m a big fan of home staging, and recently I went on a local morning show to talk about it. Today I’m going to share with you what I discussed, in case you missed it.

**Let’s talk about what’s happening in the market right now.**

The Portland/Vancouver market is super hot right now, and that’s mainly because we don’t have a lot of homes for sale, so things are going quickly. Basically, we have two months worth of inventory. To put it in layman’s terms, if we stop taking listings today, it would take us about two months to sell everything on the market. Anything below six months is considered a seller’s market, and anything above is considered a buyer’s market. We’re firmly entrenched in a buyer’s market right now.

**Does that mean there’s competition for those homes that are out there?**

There’s competition from the buyers, absolutely.

**Do you expect the market to slow down at all?**

You know, we’ve been hearing about interest rates going up, and they probably will go up in the near future, is my expectation. That will cool demand a little bit, which will cool the market. Not a bubble, like people seem to be scared of, but more of a normalization in the market—we’ll see like 4% to 6% appreciation rates, instead of the 10% to 12% we’ve been seeing. That’s sustainable, unlike right now.

**If someone is having trouble selling their home—which they really shouldn’t be in this market—does staging help sell it faster?**

It helps it sell faster, and for more money.

**Explain what staging is, first of all.**

It’s taking the owner’s personality out of the house and putting a more neutral, warm personality into the house. In general (hopefully the house is vacant, or the sellers are willing to take some of the furniture out) the staging company comes and in places some warmer, neutral, maybe more modern furniture in the home, making it more marketable.

(For a before-and-after photo of what staging can do for a home, refer to the period between 2:20 and 3:00 in the video above.)

**Well, how much does it cost to stage something?**

Right, so it can range anywhere from $2,000 to $4,000, and that can be a hit on someone’s pocketbook.

**But you can do things on your own, can’t you?**

One of the things we suggest if you can’t afford staging is to at least have a staging consultation with an interior designer; it’s only a couple hundred dollars for a consultation. They’ll give you assignments to do with your own furniture. You can also do what we call virtual staging, which is relatively new. For this, you’ll have to have vacant rooms. We’ll come in and take professional photos, and we put them into a software that places furniture and artwork in the room to make it warmer and more marketable.

**From what I’ve heard, isn’t the number one rule to depersonalize your house?**

Right, it sounds kind of cheesy and cliche, but it’s true. It makes it more possible for people to see themselves in the house.

**And obviously, if you can get more money for it, that’s perfect.**

Well that’s the goal, right? That’s what most sellers want: the most money in the shortest amount of time. Staging really does that for you.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my interview. If you have any questions about selling your Portland or Vancouver home, just give me a call or send me an email. My team and I would be happy to help you!
