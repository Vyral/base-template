When it comes to buying and selling properties, there are three main benefits of working with an agent who’s a part of a team instead of a solo agent.

The No. 1 benefit is if you’re the type of client who has a busy schedule and you’re prone to making last-minute changes, **they can accommodate you.** For example, let’s say you schedule a showing with your Realtor at 2 p.m. but work kept you late and you can’t get to the house until 3 p.m. If your Realtor works with a team and they have another appointment at 3 p.m., they can simply send one of their teammates to meet you. A solo agent usually isn’t that flexible, and you would probably have to reschedule for another day.

The second benefit is **that agent’s team will hold them accountable.** The last thing you want to do as a client is forget to schedule an inspection and then schedule one on the day it’s due. A team will keep your agent accountable to prevent that situation from happening.

The third benefit is **the team will be able to help that agent answer all of your questions** and concerns. A team is full of experts in various fields within our industry, whereas a solo agent is a one-stop shop who might not have all the answers.
