Here at the Margolis Team, we work in real estate because we love to help people.

**One of the most enjoyable parts of the job is helping people learn about Kauai.** Sure, we can help you learn about its properties and negotiate for them on your behalf, but we also want to help you understand what life is like here, tell you about its great resources, and share what we’ve learned after living in Kauai for 15 years. This gives you all the support you need—not just in real estate, but in all aspects of your life here on the island.  

When working with sellers, for instance, it’s rewarding to understand what their needs are and help them as if they were a member of our church or our family. We put our whole hearts into getting you the results you need, and when we get those results, it’s fulfilling for us as well. When we don’t get the results we want, we at least know we’ve given it our all.

**Another reason we do what we do is so we can have the time and money to contribute to some of the great causes of Kauai.** One of the nonprofits we support (and I serve on the board of) that’s particularly relevant to this time of year is Aloha Angels, whose mission is to enhance the quality of life of middle and elementary school teachers and students.

One of the initiatives we’re working on right now is something called “Adopt an After-School Club,” which works to improve after-school clubs. This year, we’ll have about 50 clubs on the island. This project serves an important need because Kauai middle schools and elementary schools normally don’t have after-school programs. By creating these enrichment programs, we’re providing emotional support for kids who may not be getting it from their own families.

It’s very fulfilling to be able to help these kids, and it is similar to what we experience when working with buyers and sellers. If you’d like to learn more about Aloha Angels or you’d like to help them with their mission, you can visit their website [AlohaAngelsKauai.org](https://alohaangelskauai.org/). It’s a great opportunity to interact with kids and share what you’ve learned with the next generation.

As always, if you have any questions for us or you have any real estate needs, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to help you.
