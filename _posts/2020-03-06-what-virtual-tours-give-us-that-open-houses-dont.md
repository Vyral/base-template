We have been getting a lot of questions about virtual tours. Here’s my opinion on them.

A lot of people want to know whether virtual tours are as effective as open houses. I’m here to answer that question today.

Over the years, even before the internet existed, open houses typically generated anywhere from 2% to 3% of sales. **It’s not the ideal way to sell, but it was a great way to expose a property to the market.** Many times, there are people out looking casually, or out for decorating ideas instead of an actual home to buy.

With the advent of the internet, we’ve gained tools to improve this process. Virtual tours allow people to “walk through” the house online. **Instead of having an open house for a few hours on a Sunday, these virtual tours can be accessed any time at any place.**

Virtual tours do two things for sellers:

1\. They give us a chance to present the house in its best light.

2\. They help us eliminate buyers who aren’t a good fit for the property.

If you’d like to learn more information about open houses or virtual tours and how we use them, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
