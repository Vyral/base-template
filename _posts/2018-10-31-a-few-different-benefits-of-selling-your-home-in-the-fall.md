I’ve been getting some calls lately from clients who are wondering whether it’s a better idea for them to sell now or wait until spring.&nbsp;

**First of all, our fall market is doing very well.** We currently have about 275 pending sales, which is up quite a bit from what we saw last year.&nbsp;

Second, one nice thing about selling in fall is that you have fewer showings, but the quality of those showings is very good. In the spring market, we tend to have a lot of showings where buyers aren’t 100% serious about buying. **In the fall, that ratio of serious buyers is much, much higher.**

The fall is a beautiful time to sell, but if you don’t think you’ll be ready in time, we can still do a few things now to help you prepare for next spring. We can take pictures of your home this fall while it looks fantastic, do private showings of the home in the winter before we list it, and more.

If you have any questions about selling your home anytime in the near future, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
