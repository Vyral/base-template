Whether you want to sell your home to an instant offer company like Opendoor or list it the conventional way boils down to three factors: time, convenience, and money.

**The question you have to ask yourself is, which of these factors do you value most? **

You see, what companies like Opendoor do is the same thing investors have been doing for ages. The only difference is that they buy stressed and unstressed properties, whereas investors only buy stressed properties.

**If time and convenience are most important and you absolutely have to sell right now, then instant offer companies are definitely a viable option.** Remember, though, that you won’t sell for top dollar.

Why? Once you reach out to them, they’ll ask you about your house and give you an estimate of its value. They’ll then send one of their inspectors to the home, and after they see their inspection report, they’ll subtract whatever repairs costs are needed. On top of that, they charge a service fee and a convenience fee. After all is said and done, if your home is worth, say, $320,000, you might sell it for as low as $260,000.

**If money is the most important factor and want to sell for top dollar, selling on the open market is your best option.** That way you can stage your home properly and give it time to attract multiple offers. It takes time and money to make a home show-ready, though, and you have to be accountable to buyers who want to see your home, so it’s not as convenient as selling to an instant offer company.

**If you want to combine time, convenience, and money, another option would be to reach out to our team.** We’ve worked many clients over the years who needed to relocate and sell their home quickly. Not only are we competitive with companies like Opendoor in terms of time and convenience, but we can also sell for more because we know many investors who’d be willing to buy instantly, and we can get multiple offers for it just like you’d see if you listed it on the open market.
