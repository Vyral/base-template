There are many Realtors out there for you to choose from. How do you know which Realtor you should work with?

**First of all, you need to work with someone who really cares.** Look for a Realtor who has the heart of a teacher. They will come in prepared to discuss the current market and explain how your choices will impact you down the road.

You need a Realtor who will be a strategic partner with you, someone who will map out a plan. Your Realtor should be your trusted advisor. A good real estate agent can give you advice and good news, but a great agent knows how to deliver the bad news whether you want to hear it or not.

As you go through the home buying process, it’s important to work with someone that you’re comfortable with and confident in. Your Realtor should be someone that you want to have lunch with, but they should also pay attention to you and listen throughout the process.

My favorite movie as a kid was The Swiss Family Robinson. In the movie, the family dug some pits and covered them up, hoping to catch some wild animals. A fierce, ferocious tiger came along, saw some meat, reached out to get it, and fell in the pit. The same thing can happen to home buyers and sellers.

Sometimes, we get too excited about a house or an offer and forget to look around us, so we end up getting trapped.** You need to work with a trusted advisor who knows how to avoid those pitfalls.**
