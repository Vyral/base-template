Your mortgage payment isn’t the only cost you’ll have when you buy a home. There are certain costs that buyers tend to forget when they are going through the buying process. **Here are three extra costs associated with homeownership that you should take into account in your budget:**

1. **Property taxes.** They are paid once every six months in California. However, you can deduct all the property taxes against your revenue line.

2. **Utility bills.** When you are coming from a property where you lease with a landlord, they could be covering some of your bills. When you own your own home, you will have to pay those costs out of pocket. I’d budget at least $200 a month for this.

3. **Furnishing bills.** To furnish a 3-bedroom house, it’s going to cost you $15,000 to $20,000. Don’t go out on a spending spree before the sale is closed and you hold the title. The lender can pull your credit up to that moment and even deny your loan.

 If you have any questions for us or you’re looking to buy a luxury property in the area, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
