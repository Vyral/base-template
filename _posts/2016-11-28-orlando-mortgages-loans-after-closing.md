What happens to your loan after you close? It gets sent to our post-closing department where they package everything up and ship it off to secondary market investors to be sold on the secondary market.

After your loan closes, it gets sent to our post-closing department where they package everything up and ship it off to secondary market investors to be sold on the secondary market. This is done for a few different reasons.

The first is that this is how we mortgage bankers make money in our industry. We sell your loan with hundreds of other loans that month. That’s how we get paid, but the benefit for you as the buyer, the borrower, is that you get access to the bigger banks and their interest rates. The second reason is that it allows us to keep our fees very low compared to our competition because we’re not having to charge origination fees or discount points to make money on your loan.

Does this change my payment or loan in any way? When your loan gets sold on the secondary market, the only thing that changes is where you make the payment to. Your interest rate, the loan balance, and the term of your loan has to stay exactly the same.

Do you sell my loan to a bank of my choosing? Unfortunately, no. When we sell the loan on a secondary market, we have a group of investors that we at Success Mortgage Partners sell to. It may end up with your financial institution, but that institution may be one we’re either not approved to sell to or not actually involved in mortgage loan servicing, to begin with. From a lending standpoint, it depends on who we can package your loan with and who we can make the most money with.

We understand that the post-closing process can sometimes be a little confusing, so if you ever have any questions about it, don’t hesitate to reach out. It is our goal to be your mortgage lender for life, whether it be for your next home purchase or a refinancing of the home you own now. Just call or send us an email and we can talk about it.
