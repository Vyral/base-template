What should buyers look for when they're out shopping for their next home with their buyer agent?

I know when a lot of people look at a home, they're taken by “the feeling.” The home may be staged beautifully with great furniture, and it just feels good. However, a lot of people don't look at some of the most important factors when purchasing a home.

First, I think the most important factor you should consider is the **resale value** of the home. If you buy the most expensive house in the neighborhood, you'll probably have a tough time selling it or getting the value back out of it. Don't go looking for the most over-the-top house in the neighborhood—get a beautiful home that you love that's not the most expensive one on the block.

Secondly, look out for **structural issues.** When you walk through a house, a good telltale sign to look out for is whether the tops of the door frames are crooked. If they are crooked, you may want to hire a structural engineer to assess any possible structural issues with the home.

Thirdly, I like to have my buyers **look at the big-ticket items** that could turn into a large out-of-pocket expense: the age of the roof, the HVAC system, and the windows. Will the roof need to be replaced soon? Does the home have a heat pump or central air? Are they about to go out? Are the windows updated or are they single-pane? Older windows can rob your home of energy efficiency and cost you thousands and thousands of dollars to replace.

If you have any questions or you're thinking about buying or selling a home in the northern Virginia area, give me a call or send me an email soon. Don't forget, you have a friend in the business!
