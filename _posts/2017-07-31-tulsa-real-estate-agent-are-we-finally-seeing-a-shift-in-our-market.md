As we start to see our local market trend away from the seller’s market we’ve been enjoying, it’s more important than ever to stay educated about what’s going on locally.

We are seeing a shift in our market. I know that some people might have a little fear about that word, but we are always seeing shifts in this market throughout the year. As real estate agents, we are always prepared for these types of shifts.

Based on the last few months, we’re seeing a bit of a change in the market. You’ve heard me talk about home sales above $200,000 slowing down. Homes in the $100,000 to $200,000 price range which have been selling within days over the last few months have also seen a slowdown in sales as well.

We have put great homes on the market in the last month in the $150,000 to $185,000 price range that I thought for sure would be easy sellers, and they haven’t sold as quickly as we thought.

**If you’re a consumer, just know that the market is always changing.** You should always pay attention to what’s happening locally, and pay less attention to what’s happening on a national scale. There are other markets in different parts of the country that aren’t seeing the same type of shift that we’re seeing locally.

Here at the Wolek Group, we make sure to pay attention to those local trends and statistics. All the Keller Williams agents in town do their best to ensure that we’re sharing the same message to the consumers. We want to be open and honest about what’s going on, especially now that we’re starting to move away from the seller’s market we’ve been enjoying for quite awhile.

**Make sure that you’re choosing an agent that is really researching the market and understands what’s going on in your neighborhood.** As a final note, I wanted to assure you that homes still are selling, so don’t be afraid of the market if you’re looking to dive in. Just make sure to be educated on what’s going on.

If you have any questions or need anything at all, give me a call. I’m happy to help!
