Mortgage insurance has a bad reputation, to be sure. However, the reality is that it is an insurance policy that you, the consumer, pay to benefit us, the lender, in case you default as a borrower.

This is important because back in the day, banks did not often lend more than an 80% loan-to-value; people once had to put down a very large down payment. **Mortgage insurance came along, and that changed the scene dramatically.** Now you are able to get into a home with a lower down payment. As a result, mortgage insurance is now included with the mortgage.

**There are a multiple ways you can structure your mortgage insurance policy.** Most people are familiar with having it included in your monthly payment, but you can also factor it into the loan amount, or build it into the interest rateâ€”each has its pros and cons.
