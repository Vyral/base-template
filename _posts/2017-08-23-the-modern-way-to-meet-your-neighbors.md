Have you heard about Nextdoor? It’s a social networking site for neighborhoods and today we’re discussing some of its features.

Recently I had the opportunity to speak with Karilyn Thibodeau from the social networking website Nextdoor.

If you aren’t already familiar with Nextdoor, the main thing you need to know is that it’s a networking site for neighborhoods.

Since the trend of introducing yourself to the neighbors in person has become less and less prevalent, Nextdoor’s goal is to connect communities.

The thing that sets Nextdoor apart is that everyone must be verified. If someone is shown as living in a home on Nextdoor, **that information is verified by the site to ensure that you know who you’re really connecting with.**

Additionally, everyone must upload their real name and photo. Putting a face and name to your neighbors can make a big difference.

Nextdoor has also recently added a new Pet Directory feature. In fact, one major use people have found for Nextdoor is communicating with their neighbors to find lost pets.

When you upload your pet’s information on Nextdoor you’re not only taking preemptive steps in case they’re ever loss, you’re also letting your neighbors get to know you a little better.

Many people have been in a situation where they’ve approached a neighbor on a walk to ask their dog’s name. With Nextdoor’s Pet Directory feature, you’ll already know.

Karilyn was also excited to let me know about another exciting feature coming soon to Nextdoor—a real estate section. **Homeowners understand that listings in their neighborhood directly affect the value of their own homes.**

When you live in a neighborhood, it’s natural to be curious about what’s going on in the world of real estate as it relates to your community.

The real estate section in Nextdoor is different because, as with everything else on the site, what you are able to see is always specific to your neighborhood. You’ll be able to see what listings are priced at, what agents are working with those listings, and more.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
