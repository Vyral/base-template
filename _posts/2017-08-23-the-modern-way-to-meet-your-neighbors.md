</i>  <div style="text-align: left;">Recently I had the opportunity to speak with Karilyn Thibodeau from the social networking website Nextdoor. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">If you arent already familiar with Nextdoor, the main thing you need to know is that **its a networking site for neighborhoods.**<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">Since the trend of introducing yourself to the neighbors in person has become less and less prevalent, Nextdoors goal is to connect communities. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">The thing that sets Nextdoor apart is that everyone must be verified. If someone is shown as living in a home on Nextdoor, **that information is verified by the site to ensure that you know who youre really connecting with. **<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">Additionally, everyone must upload their real name and photo. Putting a face and name to your neighbors can make a big difference. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">Nextdoor has also recently added a new Pet Directory feature. In fact, one major use people have found for Nextdoor is communicating with their neighbors to find lost pets. <div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">Putting a face and name to your neighbors can make a big difference. <div style="text-align: left;">When you upload your pets information on Nextdoor youre not only taking preemptive steps in case theyre ever loss, youre also letting your neighbors get to know you a little better. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">Many people have been in a situation where theyve approached a neighbor on a walk to ask their dogs name. With Nextdoors Pet Directory feature, youll already know. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">Karilyn was also excited to let me know about another exciting feature coming soon to Nextdoora real estate section.** Homeowners understand that listings in their neighborhood directly affect the value of their own homes.**<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">When you live in a neighborhood, its natural to be curious about whats going on in the world of real estate as it relates to your community. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">The real estate section in Nextdoor is different because, as with everything else on the site, what you are able to see is always specific to your neighborhood. Youll be able to see what listings are priced at, what agents are working with those listings, and more. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: left;">If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon. ">If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
