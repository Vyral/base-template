Did you know that we have a Facebook group built specifically for our past clients? If you have any questions, you should join us\! **At Jeff Cook Real Estate, we’re devoted to serving you to the best of our abilities,** even after the deal is done. Often, in any real estate transaction, after finalizing the paperwork, you’re left with unanswered questions.&nbsp;

So we’ve created a Facebook group where you can interact with agents in real-time to answer all your questions. When you join you’ll have access to our agent’s expertise and years of real estate knowledge. Stay up to date with our current marketing campaigns, real estate trends, and upcoming events created especially to celebrate you. On Facebook, search “JCRE Family and Friends” to joining our group, or click the link below.&nbsp;

We will be announcing a contest for a Honey Baked Ham gift card for Easter. The contest will begin on March 25th, and in order to win you need to join our Facebook Group and then share your favorite picture with the Easter bunny. The contest will end on April 8th.
