Are you better off selling to an iBuyer or listing your home the traditional way? Let’s compare the pros and cons of each situation.&nbsp;

As a company or investor that buys a house sight unseen, iBuyers pay cash, don’t ask for any inspections, and offer a quick closing. Typically, they don’t pay the most amount of money for a house, but if you need fast cash or you need to sell a house quickly, they’re a viable option.&nbsp;

**If you have more time to list your home the traditional way and target a higher sale price, you should consider listing with a broker** (or trying the FSBO route). It may take longer due to all the potential showings, inspections, and other steps you have to go through, but the end goal is to gain more money.

Regardless of your situation, I always recommend contacting a local real estate professional to get a second opinion on your best course of action. A simple sit-down won’t cost you anything and doesn’t require any obligations.&nbsp;

One last factor to consider is cost—always compare the cost of listing with a broker to selling to an iBuyer and make sure there are no hidden fees involved.&nbsp;

If you have any more questions about this topic or you’d like to list your home the traditional way and need a broker, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;
