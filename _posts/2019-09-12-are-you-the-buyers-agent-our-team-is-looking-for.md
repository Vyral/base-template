If you aspire to become a real estate agent or you’re looking to make a career move, we have a message for you: We need some new buyer’s agents to complement our team\! There’s a list of reasons why you should think about joining Team Lally, but here are just a few:&nbsp;

**1\. You’ll experience personal and professional growth.<br>2\. You’ll receive lots of leads.&nbsp;<br>3\. You’ll receive career coaching.&nbsp;<br>4\. And, best of all, you’ll have fun\!&nbsp;**

And when you come aboard, you’ll receive an **“80k guarantee,”** meaning if you don’t make at least $80,000 in your first year with us, we’ll write you a check for the difference. It’s even spelled out in writing\! In fact, one member of our team who only just joined in January is almost to that $80,000 mark, and we haven’t even reached the fourth quarter\! &nbsp;

If this opportunity grabs your attention, check out [JoinTeamLally.com](https://www.teamlally.com/careers/){: target="_blank"}. And if you’re interested in attending one of our career nights, you can RSVP for one of the future dates at HawaiiCareerNight.com.&nbsp;

If you have any questions or would like more information, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with us. Thanks and Aloha\!
