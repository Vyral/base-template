How does housing inventory affect your home’s value? **With fewer homes on the market, that affects the demand for those homes, which in turn drives up housing prices.**

Over the last few years, we’ve seen a real shortage of homes. Right now, throughout southwest Indiana, we have just under a three-month supply of homes. In case you don’t know, the typical market supply is right around six months. Anything under that mark would be considered a strong seller’s market. Anything above would be considered a strong buyer’s market.

With our 2.8-month supply of homes, there’s a strong need for additional homes to hit the market. **Since there is a huge shortage of available homes, your home might be worth more than what you think.**

If you’re looking to get an updated value of what your home may be worth, you’re thinking of refinancing your home, or you plan on selling it soon, give me a call so I can help you with that.
