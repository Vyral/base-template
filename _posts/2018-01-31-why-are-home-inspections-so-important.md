Today we’re here with Dylan Margerum from Peak Home Inspections to discuss **why it’s important to do a home inspection.&nbsp;**

Getting a home inspection isn’t required when you get a home loan, but we highly recommend it.&nbsp;

When Dylan inspects a house, he checks everything from the roof to the foundation. He looks at HVAC systems, plumbing, electrical systems, and more. “Anything we can get our hands on, we check, we inspect,” says Dylan.&nbsp;

**It is so important for the buyer to do their home inspection and do their due diligence.** If there is a problem with the roof, it’s much better to spend $150 on a home inspection rather than thousands of dollars on repairs.&nbsp;

You can also use the home inspection report for negotiation purposes. If you want to move forward and buy a house that needs a new roof, you can ask for a new roof. If there’s hail damage, we can send pictures that Dylan takes. If you need the furnace to be fixed, we are able to send that over.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for Dylan, you can reach him at [CONTACT]. As always, if you have any real estate questions for us, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you.
