There’s a big difference between decorating your home for pleasure and preparing it to sell. If you’re pining for a purple bathroom—like mine is—I say go for it, but there are five decorating trends you need to avoid if you’re preparing your home for the market:

**1. Wallpaper.** Bold wallpaper has been a big trend, especially in tiny bathroom spaces. I’ve seen trippy tropicals, astounding animal prints, crazy cacti, giant geometrics, and just about every other kind of pattern in bright colors and metallics. Whether or not this trend has peaked, it’s a big “no” for anyone selling their home.

**2. Intricate tile.**Bold-pattern cement tiles are popping up everywhere, which is exactly why you should avoid them. The pattern may be trendy now, but it could become outdated soon and turn buyers off. You want buyers to see potential in your space—not be distracted by potentially divisive tile choices. Minimize patterns, even in non-permanent items like duvets and furniture.

**3. Too much purple or yellow.** Purple is the Pantone color of 2018 and Gen Z yellow is trendy, but use these color with caution. Purple walls will only appeal to a small population of buyers. Color is key for resale value, so your home’s colors should be a neutral paint in an eggshell finish.

**4. Too much “cold” white.** If your home is ultra-modern, make sure it doesn’t come off as “cold” or uninviting. A sleek, monochromatic palette may be fashionable, but it lacks the warmth buyers are looking for. This doesn’t mean you have to repaint. If you’re already in on the all-white trend, just add some warm tones with accessories like pillows or throws.

**5. A statement door that makes too much of a statement.** A colorful front door upgrades your home’s curb appeal and gives it a welcoming first impression, but make sure you pick the right color. For years, doors have been trending toward fun colors like teal, yellow, and bright blues, oranges, and greens. What are buyers’ favorites, though? They’re black and red.

I know it’s hard to shell out for renovations that aren’t your taste, but your restraint will pay off once you sell.
