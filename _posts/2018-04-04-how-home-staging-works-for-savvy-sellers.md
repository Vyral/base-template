There were also a number of personal photos…<br>And other wedding memorabilia in the dining room…<br>It turns out that the buyers were so distracted by all of these personal items…<br>They never really looked at the house…<br>After that…<br>We came in and made sure to pack away all personal photos that were in that dining<br>room.<br>The kitchen walls were brown and covered in pictures as well…<br>So we cleared everything away…<br>Opened up the windows, and…<br>Made the house clean and shiny…<br>It sold right away…<br>As you can see…<br>Staging your home makes a huge difference…<br>See for yourself at…<br>www.3201Garfield.com<br>To learn more about the value of preparing your home for the market…<br>You can sign up here for my next Staging Workshop”<br>I’ll let you know about the next one…<br>Thank you for watching “What’s Working Now!”<br>Be sure to tune in next time…<br>For more on decluttering…<br>In the meantime…<br>If you have any other questions about real estate…<br>Or our current market…
