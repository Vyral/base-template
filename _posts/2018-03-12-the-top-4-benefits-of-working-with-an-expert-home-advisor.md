Here are the four advantages of working with an expert home advisor when buying a home:

**1. We can make sure you get the best home for the best price with the least amount of stress.** We believe so strongly in our ability to do this that we will sell your home for free if you don’t love it.

**2. You’ll get a home warranty guarantee.** We believe you should have a home that’s move-in ready, and we’ll make sure you have a home warranty to cover any unknown things that can happen. If we can’t negotiate it, we’ll pay for it out of our own commission.

**3. We work with the best lender and mortgage companies.** This means we can give you our best rate guarantee. This fact can often get overlooked, but it can save you tens of thousands of dollars over a 15-, 20-, or 30-year period. This is a completely free service, and if you already have a lender that you like, we can at the very least get you a second opinion and possibly save you at least $1,000.

**4. You pay nothing out of pocket to use us.** The seller pays for our services!

If you have any further questions about how we can benefit you during your home search or you have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help you.
