On today’s episode of “Facebook Friday,” I’ll be answering a few questions about home repairs.

I’m joined today by my guest, Bree, who is here to ask me some questions about home repairs that you may have been wondering about yourself.

**1. “Why does it seem like all home repairs cost $1,000?”** Sometimes repairs can be overestimated in terms of cost, but it does seem like that figure comes up from time to time. So what can be done to help cope with the shock and pain of that cost? Well, you can start a rainy day fund, putting money back little by little for repairs when the need arises. Homeowners will have to deal with repairs anyway, so it makes sense to be squaring money away for that purpose.

**2. “Are do-it-yourself (DIY) projects beneficial?”** If your project isn’t too major, making certain home repairs isn’t infeasible. Stores like Home Depot and Lowe’s have a broad range of home repair supplies, and video tutorials can usually be found online. Assuming you have the knowledge and the tools to complete those projects, you can save money on labor costs.

**3. “If I use a contractor, can I negotiate on the price?”** You absolutely can. If you have a general idea of what a project is going to cost, don’t discuss that with a potential contractor; let them take a look and give you their estimate first. I highly encourage you to get several estimates before settling on a contractor. After you select one, then you can negotiate to work out your best price.
