Hereâ€™s how the Charlotte real estate market has changed since October of 2018.

We have seen some new listings in our market, but the number has been on a three-month drop. October of 2019 is the first month that theyâ€™ve gone back up. The number of homes for sale has dropped and it continues to do so. Closed sales are up, which shows that as new listings come on the market, theyâ€™re being bought up almost as soon as they hit the market. This has caused the days on market to drop and the median price to increase.

New Listings:

* October 2018: 4,835
* October 2019: 5,119

Itâ€™s important for buyers and sellers to pay attention to the market. If your real estate agent canâ€™t tell you whatâ€™s going on in your area using real data as opposed to their feelings, then it might be a good time to talk to a different agent.&nbsp;
