Welcome to Be Better DSM, our free educational coaching page dedicated to helping the Central Iowa real estate community learn the tips and tools that have made us successful.

When I launched the Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate brand in 2017, we took to heart one of the mottos our agents follow: be better.

To me, being better isn’t just about how you improve yourself. It’s also about being an agent of change in our local real estate community, helping raise the standards of professionalism, and being collaborative about what we know works well in the Central Iowa market.

At Be Better DSM, we:

* **Give market updates and market analysis.**
* **Do masterminds to collaborate with different agents at different stages of their career.**
* **Host business planning workshops where agents from all companies are welcome to talk about how to build a successful real estate business.**

We’re excited to have so many great real estate agents here in Central Iowa, all with the goal to be better. Feel free to explore everything this page offers.

If you have any questions or you’re interested in collaborating with us, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to speak with you.
