If you’re a home seller, overpricing your property right out of the gate can cost you thousands of dollars.&nbsp;

To help explain why, I want you to imagine two different scenarios. First of all, let’s say you’ve decided to move and you’ve found the perfect home for you and your family. In scenario one, you catch the seller right as they’re sticking a “For Sale” sign in the yard. In scenario two, you come across the home after it’s been on the market for 170, 190, 210, or even 240 days. How much different would your offer be between those two scenarios?&nbsp;

If you’re thinking you’d offer much less in the second scenario, that’s exactly my point: **The longer a home is on the market, the less buyers are willing to pay for it**. We agents can’t sell properties for more than their market value, but we can make sure your home doesn’t have a stigma following it around because of its high days on market.&nbsp;

That’s why you must price your home properly right out of the gate.

If you’d like to know more about how to price your home to sell or you have any other real estate questions I can answer, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
