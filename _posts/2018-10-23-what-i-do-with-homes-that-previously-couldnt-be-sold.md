&nbsp;

A few months ago, I received a phone call from a home seller who was very frustrated that their property hadn’t sold.

When I looked their property up, I learned that it had been on the market since 2015 with other companies. When I went to visit the house, I thought for sure that something would be wrong with it, but it showed very well and there were no major issues. This home was over 5,000 square feet, sat on nine acres, and was located only 15 minutes from the beach.

The home was priced at $590,000, which I thought was fair, so **we kept that price, I invested heavily in marketing, and we managed to get it sold for 98% of its list price**.

If you have a home that you’ve tried listing before but it just didn’t sell, we’d love the opportunity to see the home, meet with you, and discuss how we can help you get it sold. Just give us a call or send us an email.
