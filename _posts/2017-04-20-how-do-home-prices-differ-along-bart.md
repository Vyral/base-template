*The Bay Area is a great place to live. However, it can get pretty expensive depending on where you choose to buy a home.*

Welcome back to another edition of the East Bay Market Minute, the fastest 60 seconds in real estate. We’ve got an interesting topic for you today. We’re going to take a look at the cost of homes in terms of average price per square foot along the BART lines.

**If you’re not from the Bay Area, BART stands for Bay Area Regional Transit and the BART lines are basically the mass transit system around here. **

The graphic in the video above shows you where the BART lines go and what the average price per square foot is in each of those areas. The lines go up into the Richmond area in the northwest and North Concord in the east, and as far down as Millbrae in the southwest and Fremont in the southeast. As you can see, the price per square foot varies quite a bit. **As you get into the city of San Francisco, the price goes up over $1,000 per square foot!** At the same time, homes in Oakland are much more affordable at an average of $300 square feet.

It’s not surprising that we’re starting to see people living in San Francisco move out to the East Bay. Obviously, the price per square foot is advantageous out here, but when you combine that with good schools and good communities, a lot of people from the city are moving here and increasing demand.

If you want a copy of the graphic in the video above for yourself, let me know and I’d be happy to send it over. If you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
