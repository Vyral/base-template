<span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Have you been wondering whats going on in the world of low down payment loans? Today, we are going to discuss a great mortgage loan down payment option that you have right here in Portland. We are here to discuss things with Peter Wease of Fairway Independent Mortgage, our preferred lender. **Many people think $0 down home loans are a myth, but we can assure you they are not.** They are here, and you could get one today.

<span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">USDA loans are loans from the department of agriculture and are intended for rural housing, which expands beyond the urban growth boundary. **You can get a USDA loan with 100% financing, meaning you will pay $0 down.** There are a couple caveats with this loan, including that the home has to be past the urban growth boundary, which is detailed in the video above in the non-shaded areas. **Your household income also may not exceed 115% of the median income. ** 

<span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">This is a fantastic opportunity for someone to get in the market and own a home with no money down. **Rents are going up, and this is a great option for telecommuters who would be working from home anyways without the need to commute. ** 

<span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">If you have any questions for us or are interested in using a loan like this to purchase a home, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to talk to you! o talk to you!
