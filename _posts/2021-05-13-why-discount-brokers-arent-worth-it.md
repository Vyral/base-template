Discount brokers aren’t worth the savings they promise.

How a home is prepared for the market and presented online will drastically impact how many buyers actually see that home in person and how many make an offer on it, as well as how high they’re willing to bid. Even in a competitive seller’s market (which I’m sure you’re aware that we’re in), **if your home isn’t properly prepared for the market, it won’t generate the same effect**.

The second thing to consider is how negotiations and conversations are handled between agents during the initial offer process and inspection and appraisal phases. This can also drastically impact your bottom line as a seller.

If you’d like to know more about how discount brokers operate or have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.
