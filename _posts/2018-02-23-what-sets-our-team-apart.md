One thing that differentiates myself and my team from the average agents out there is one of the things that we offer to all of our sellers: a pre-certification process. **It allows us to prepare their home perfectly before it goes onto the market so that it makes the best impression possible when it goes live.**

This pre-certification process has three parts:

1. Professional staging

2. A pre-inspection by a licensed inspector

3. A pre-appraisal by a licensed appraiser

In addition to these things, we also offer a “coming soon” program. **This will allow us to send your home to over 20,000 potential buyers before it even hits the market.**

Finally, we also offer a quality of life upgrade analysis, as well as professional photography. Each of these services is designed to give your home the best possible first impression with buyers online and in-person.

If you have any questions about how we help sellers or you’re interested in hiring us to help you sell your home, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
