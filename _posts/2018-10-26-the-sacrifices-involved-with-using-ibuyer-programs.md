Many home sellers are considering a quick and painless sale with an iBuyer program. Here are the pros and cons of using these as a home-selling solution.

**I want to make sure that you’re not leaving money on the table when it comes time to sell your home.** You’ve probably seen a lot of iBuyer programs out there from companies like OpenDoor, OfferPad, and Zillow.

However, there is something you should know about these programs. The people who are buying houses through these methods are only looking out for their best interests. When you call into their system, you are a customer in their world and you have no representation.&nbsp;

**As you can see in the video above, homes in Phoenix have risen nearly 10% in value over the last 12 months.** When an online buyer comes in, they’re going to make you an offer below list price in order to turn a profit. They claim that their method is much better for you because it’s easier and you don’t have to go through showings.

**However, if you do take the time to get the home ready for showings and price it right, it’s going to sell for much more than you’ll get with one of these programs.** More likely than not, selling your home traditionally is going to be worth any kind of hassle involved in order to put much more money in your pocket.

If you have any questions for me about this topic or about anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
