The final numbers for the 2017 Tampa Bay real estate market are in, which means it’s time for your market recap.&nbsp;

By every measure, 2017 was a very strong year for our market.&nbsp;

**The overall home sales were up by 7.85%, with a closed sale count of 36,044 homes.** That is a huge jump from 33,422 sales in 2016.&nbsp;

Pricing in Tampa Bay went up by 6% year over year by the end of 2017. How does that compare with the increases we’ve seen in past years? In 2016, our increase was actually at 11%; in 2015, it was 7%.&nbsp;

So, the pace of growth was a little slow in 2017. A lot of that growth is fueled by new construction here in our market.

Experts predict that 2018 will be another strong year for the market, but the pace of that growth might slow just a little bit.&nbsp;

**If you have a home to sell, it’s certainly a great time to put it on the market.** I’m happy to share with you the best time do that based on your own particular situation.

Inventory has been a huge topic of discussion lately since it’s so low. For homes under $300,000 in Tampa, there are less than three months of inventory available on the market. When we get up into the $1 million and up range, there are 11 months of inventory on the market, so there’s no shortage there. It all depends on your area and price range.&nbsp;

Keep in mind that a lot of the new construction that is out there for buyers is not listed in the MLS and therefore not reflected in these inventory numbers.&nbsp;
