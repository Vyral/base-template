Here are four cost-effective tips that will help prepare your home for the market and boost its value in the eyes of buyers.&nbsp;

First, **improve your landscaping.** Curb appeal is crucial to a buyer’s first impression when they pull up to your home, so freshen up the bushes, mow and remove weeds from the yard, and plant some brand-new flowers.&nbsp;

Second, **clean the outside of your home.** A dirty exterior will make buyers think the interior has not been taken care of either.&nbsp;

Third, **make repairs.** You want your home to be in the best condition possible, so take care of any major defects like broken windows, faulty doors, or any kind of foundational issues.&nbsp;

Lastly, **make your front door inviting.** Put a fresh new coat of paint on it that contrasts with the rest of the home.&nbsp;
