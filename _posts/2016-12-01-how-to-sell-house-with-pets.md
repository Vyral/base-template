Selling a home when you have pets can be a bit of challenge, but these steps will make it markedly easier.

Selling a home with pets doesn’t have to be a challenge. Just make sure you take the right steps before you sell your home to ensure a smooth transaction.

**First, check with your insurance.** You know your pet would never hurt anyone on purpose, but you may be liable if they mistake a buyer for an intruder and attack. Next, you want to prepare your yard. Buyers will walk around the yard and you don’t want them to step in anything or roll an ankle in a hole your dog dug out. Check the lawn before each showing. If you can’t seed for new grass to cover bare patches in time, you can cover ugly patches with new sod.

**Removing odors left by pets is one of the biggest challenges you need to take care of.** It’s easy to store a litter box, but it’s not easy to cover up years of accidents on rugs or hardwood floors. If a bacteria-eating cleaner doesn’t help, you might want to hire a professional cleaner. If the smell persists, you may need to replace the carpet.

If you have fish tanks, make them sparkle with a daily swipe of an eraser sponge.

Next, make sure you clean all pet hair. **Pet hair not only makes a home look messy, it can trigger allergies** and send buyers wheezing out the door. Vacuum and dust before each showing or consider buying a Roomba vacuuming robot. If you have a pet that sheds, brush them frequently outside to avoid getting fur in the house.

Since pets—like kids—tend to accumulate lots of stuff, you want to hide evidence like leashes, toys, water bowls, and food. Store away everything you can and wash pet beds to remove odors, dirt, and hair. Only keep them out if they’re attractive.

You should also consider keeping your pets in a crate or a confined area of the house while you’re out or during showings, and make sure your agent knows where they are. Keep them busy with toys or long-lasting treats. The best option is to find a play date for your pet before a showing.

**Remember that pets have emotions, too.** When you do things like store their food and toys, crate them, and bring strangers into your home, some pets may get confused and anxious. Before you make any major changes in their life, talk to your vet.
