Hi, I’m Kevan Cohn from Southland Real Estate and I have some exciting news to share: I have officially partnered with the White Group of the Keller Williams Ballantyne area\! The reason I’m so excited about this is that it means so much more for you, our clients. The White Group has world-class service, and I’ve already learned so much from them. In the near future,you should expect to start receiving awesome communications from them, and I just wanted to let you know who they are. Thank you all for your support in everything I’ve done over the last five years of business. I fully expect this development to only increase the level of service I provide you. As always, if you have any questions regarding this new partnership or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help\!
