Hey everyone, thanks for visiting us today. Our clients have been asking us a lot of great questions lately, but one that keeps coming up is, "What are the essential elements to a smooth home sale?"

In my opinion, there are 3 elements involved in a great home sale:

1. Proper preparation<br>
When selling your home, you want to make sure you get the advice of a great local stager on how to properly prepare your home. You want things like improvements, decluttering, and cleaning to be done ahead of putting your home on the market. You also want to have a good plan in place for getting the home ready for the camera and the buyers.
2. Proper pricing<br>
Make sure you are pricing your home in accordance with the market. Get the advice of an agent on how to price competitively in your market.
3. Proper promotion<br>
You want to make sure you are taking advantage of social media, and the web in general, to spread the word about your home. Getting your professional photos out to as many eyes as possible is the first step.

If you have any questions for us at all, don't hesitate to reach out. I would love to help pass along any information I can to help make your experience as smooth as possible. We look forward to hearing from you!
