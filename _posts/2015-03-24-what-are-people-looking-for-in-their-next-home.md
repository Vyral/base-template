{% include youtube.html %}I recently read the report called "The Housing Satisfaction Gap." What's interesting about this report is that it shows what features people have in their current homes, and what they would look for if they decided to buy a new home. It's a good indicator of what buyers are looking for in the market. In the report, there were 7 things that stood out as the features people are craving the most in a new home. Here they are:

1. Energy efficiency - Is your home green? Having energy-efficient appliances and utilities is one of the main things home buyers are looking for.

2. Renovations - People are looking for updated homes, with newly built add-ons and features that add value to the home.

3. Updated kitchens - everybody wants that beautiful upgraded kitchen with modern new appliances

4. Age-friendly design - Many people are looking for a forever home where their family can grow together and a home accommodates them as they grow older.

5. Privacy - Privacy comes in many forms, whether it is a secluded backyard, a balcony, or simply a greater distance between neighbors.

6. Safe neighborhood - This is kind of a no-brainer. Safer neighborhoods help to put more value in your real estate purchase as well.

7. Storage space - It is a fact that Americans love to shop. What they want is enough space to store their acquisitions in a safe and organized place{% include pullquote.html %}If you are thinking of renovating or selling your home, keep these things in mind.
