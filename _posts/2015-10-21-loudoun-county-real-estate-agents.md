Are you planning on moving outside the Loudoun County area? If you are and want to get connected with an agent you can trust in another area, we are here to help.

We belong to two of the most successful referral organizations on the planet. One of them is our real estate coaching organization and the other, of course, is RE/MAX International. We want to make sure you are aware of the fact that we have great resources to connect not only you, but your friends and families, to the best Realtors across the United States and overseas.

Even if you know someone from out of state who is making their move elsewhere, don't hesitate to reach out to us. We have had a lot of success connecting great agents with clients. Two times this year, I've had clients who were contemplating a move to Nashville, Tennessee. I found a terrific agent for them and each of them went to Nashville on separate visits, had a terrific time with the agent; they both made a point to come back and thank me for connecting them with a great agent. They explained that they had a new-found confidence even though they were moving a significant distance!

If you have questions about how we can help you, a family member, or a friend find an agent outside of Loudoun County, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to make the moving process as smooth and stress-free as possible!
