If you are a local business owner, I’d like to help you out by getting you more customers. I’ve been in the real estate business for over 30 years and have helped over 6,000 people buy a house in the Northwest Valley.

With a large database of great past clients, I’d like to see if I can connect them to your business to help it grow. I’d love to sit down for breakfast, lunch, or coffee with you and learn a little bit more about you and your business.

If it seems like a good fit, I’ll put your business in the referral directory I send out to all my past clients. I can then refer them to use your services and vice versa.

One of my goals in 2017 is to have a deeper connection with all of you and make you part of my life by helping you grow your business. If you have any questions for me or you’d like to have lunch, don’t hesitate to reach out. Just give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
