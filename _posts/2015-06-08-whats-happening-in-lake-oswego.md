{% include youtube.html %}Today we're in Lake Oswego, a charming town just south of Portland, and one of our favorite destinations when we just want to get away for a while.

We're in the Millennium Plaza Park of Lake Oswego, where there is fine dining, movies, music, and much more. It's a wonderful little area for anyone and everyone looking to relax for a bit. Maybe if you're lucky your parents will take you to Salt & Straw for a gourmet ice cream cone.

One of the great parts about this area is the school system. Both high schools in Lake Oswego were in the top 15 in Oregon, and this is just one of many reasons why people are choosing to move here.

Our favorite neighborhood in Lake Oswego is called First Addition, and it was established in 1888, making it the oldest neighborhood in the town, and also the most desirable.

If you're interested in properties in this town, please don't hesitate to ask us about them. There is a lot of buzz surrounding this community right now, so don't miss your chance to invest before it's too late.
