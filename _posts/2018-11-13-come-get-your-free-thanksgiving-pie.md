I am so grateful for all the support my clients, friends, and family have given to The Vera Group. I could not have had such a great year without you. In return, I’d like to offer you a token of my appreciation this Thanksgiving: a free apple or pumpkin pie.

<br>To make sure you get your dessert before the holiday, please make sure to [RSVP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYnc6XQ6dDt-8l8lhWXBWnT646jYZsOFFxKGNi4el4sJALew/viewform?vc=0&amp;c=0&amp;w=1) as soon as you can. We’ll be handing out the pies on Monday, November 19 at 5:30 at our office, 884 Eastlake Parkway #1629 (in the same shopping center as Sprouts/Trader Joes). I can deliver your pie to you personally if you can’t make it, but keep in mind, we’ll have around 15 to 20 bottles of wine to share with those who come to pick up their pies.

I look forward to giving you a gift you can share with your family and friends. Once again, I thank you for everything you’ve done for me and wish you a happy Thanksgiving and holiday season!&nbsp;
