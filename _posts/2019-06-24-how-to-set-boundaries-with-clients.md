One of the biggest complaints among those working in real estate is that it’s a 24/7 job. In truth, though, it doesn’t have to be. In fact, it shouldn’t be.&nbsp;

Have you ever found yourself up in the middle of the night texting or emailing a buyer or seller? If so, then it’s time to establish some boundaries.&nbsp;

But how do you do so? What’s the best way to establish boundaries with your clients?

There are three main steps you need to take:&nbsp;

**1\. Think about what you want your life to be like.** For some, this means being off-the-clock by a certain time of night. If you don’t want clients to text you at 11 o’clock at night, then make it clear from the beginning that you’re only available until 6 p.m. Making a clear distinction between which points in your day (and your week) are dedicated to clients and which points are dedicated to your personal life will be essential to maintaining a good work/life balance.&nbsp;

**2\. Figure out how much you want to work on weekends.** Many showings occur on the weekends, but this doesn’t mean you have to be available at every waking minute of every day. If a client calls you and wants to see a house, simply tell them when you’re available. Keep that window of time consistent so that you still have time for yourself and your loved ones. Everyone needs time off, after all.&nbsp;

**3\. Don’t break your own boundaries.** If you give an inch, people will take a mile. For your own sake (and for your family’s sake), make sure that you stick to the boundaries you set for yourself. Doing so will improve your well-being both on and off the clock.&nbsp;
