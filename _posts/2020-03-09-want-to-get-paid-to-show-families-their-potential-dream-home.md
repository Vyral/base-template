<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Showing homes to clients only makes up about 5% of what an agent does, but you can make it 100%.</em></p>

For the latest episode of my podcast with Van and Bonnie, I have exciting news to share: **The Misty SOLDwisch Home Selling Team is looking for showing agents to show houses for our team. &nbsp;**

It’s no secret that I love real estate. There are so many different aspects of it, and we’re making a difference in people’s lives. Being in real estate also means you have to be good at many different things. It’s not just about showing a house—you have to do paperwork, handle inspections, etc.&nbsp;

That’s the advantage our team brings to the table. We have people who fill specialized roles, and this new role we’re launching is designed for people who love focusing on the fun part of real estate and don’t want to handle the more challenging aspects of it.&nbsp;

A lot of people tell me they want to sell real estate because they love looking at houses, but the reality is that showing houses is only about 5% of what a full-time agent does. **This new role makes showing homes 100% of what you do.**

The agents in this new role will set their own schedule to show houses for our clients. Instead of working on commission, you’ll earn an hourly rate for simply being there for our clients during the fun part of real estate. Having a real estate license is a requirement for the job, but your schedule can be very flexible.&nbsp;

This position is a great fit for anyone that loves spending time with people and helping them find their dream home. You can work as many hours as you want. The right candidate can be part-time or full-time, depending on what your needs are.&nbsp;

No one else in the industry offers this role to the same degree that we do, but I’m excited about it because I know there are some great people out there who’d love to be in the business on a more expanded level. If they have a real estate license and aren’t putting it to good use or their career hasn’t turned out exactly how they wanted it, this could be their solution.

So if you want to get paid to show a bunch of brand-new houses to families looking for their dream home, give me a call today or visit www.SOLDinCentralIowa.com. I’d love to hear from you.&nbsp;
