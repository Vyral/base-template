Aloha and happy holidays from beautiful Kaua’i!

**My wife and I have been very blessed to have helped people find or sell homes for the past 13 years.**Whether people come to Kaua’i for retirement, to find a slower pace of life, or to find a more exciting life hiking, biking, surfing, and golfing in this beautiful area, it’s a place where families come together to make memories for a lifetime.

This holiday season, we want to say thank you to those we’ve had the privilege to serve. To those of you who may one day own a piece of paradise or need to sell a property here, we value the opportunity to be of service in the future.

As we reflect on 2017, we know that you have made it possible for us to give back and serve our community in many ways. As some of you may know, Gwen and I serve through rotary. I am also an active board member of Junior Achievement, where we provide a financial education to our kids. I’m also a board member with Aloha Angels, a beautiful nonprofit which has raised over $2 million in the last four years to make lives better for teachers and students and improve education on Kaua’i.

I am grateful to work with my wife, Gwen, my superb assistant, Bailey Hutton, and our transaction manager to provide the highest level of service, attention, and dedication to those we’ve had the privilege to serve.

After all, this is likely the largest transaction of your life. **I am proud to be part of a team that is committed to your success regardless of any challenges.**

On behalf of my team, I would like to wish you joy, health, peace, and abundance through the holidays and the new year. May you spend time with your family and be filled with gratitude and recognition for all that you have been blessed with.

As always, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us.
