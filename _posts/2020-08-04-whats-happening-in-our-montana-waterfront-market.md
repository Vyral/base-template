Here’s the latest from our Montana lake region real estate market.

As we wrap up the second quarter of 2020 and push on to the back half of the year, it's a good time to reflect on how our market has fared. Today I’m sharing the latest stats\!&nbsp;

**Cited below for your convenience are timestamps that will direct you to various points in the video. Feel free to watch the full message or use these timestamps to skip to topics that interest you most:&nbsp;**

0:41 — Residential and vacant land stats: Northwest Montana region (Lincoln County)

1:33 — Active, sold, and pending homes around Flathead Lake

2:52 — Vacant land sales around Flathead Lake&nbsp;

3:24 — Flathead Lake condominium activity&nbsp;

4:12 —&nbsp; Residential and vacant land stats: Swan lake&nbsp;

5:40 — Residential and vacant land stats: Echo Lake and Lake Blaine&nbsp;

7:22 — Residential and vacant land stats: Ashley Lake, Bitterroot Lake, and McGregor Lake

For all of the lakes, we’re seeing fewer properties for sale but an increased number of transactions. 2020 has been nothing short of an interesting year (to say the least), so I’m curious to see what’s in store for our real estate market—come whatever may, I’ll be keeping you informed\!&nbsp;&nbsp;
