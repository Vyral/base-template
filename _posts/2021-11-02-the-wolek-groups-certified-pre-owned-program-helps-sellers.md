Imagine that you’ve made the big decision to sell your home. After some cleaning and organizing, you get your home on the market. Immediately you have many showings scheduled, which means that you must keep the house picked up and get out of your home at various times of day for potential buyers to view it. Maybe then you get multiple offers to choose between (a great problem to have), and then finally… a pending contract\! Whew, that was a rush and all very exciting\!

As you may have noticed, **our Tulsa area real estate market still has very low inventory**. This means that there is a high demand for properties. You’d think this would detract buyers from hopping into the market, however interest rates are still historically low, so it is a great time to buy as well.

With the low supply and high demand, there is a strain on the whole process of buying or selling. Quite simply, sellers may be able to get more money than they could even a year ago (in many areas 30% more), and when buyers are paying higher prices, they want homes that are in excellent condition. As you can imagine, if you were a buyer paying full asking price, likely without any concessions given by the seller, and possibly having to make a quick decision to write an offer, due to the stress of other competition for the same house, you may have some buyer’s remorse. That’s where we come in to help.

From our years of experience, we know that even though there is a contract between a buyer and seller, the deal is not done until the closing date. There are many points inside of the legally binding agreement that allow a buyer to cancel the contract or at least renegotiate terms. **The Wolek Group offers an option to help protect our sellers**, to ensure defects and potential issues are discovered before we put your home on the market. This eliminates the majority of the reasons that buyers cancel contracts and allows them to feel confident and comfortable with making a strong offer and then moving forward to closing.

Welcome to our Certified Pre-Owned Home Program. When you list your home with us, we will cover the cost of upfront inspections, staging, and professional photography to ensure you get to the closing table with the first contract you receive. When a contract busts due to inspections, you’d need to address any defects or at least disclose them, so why not do it in advance?

Along with covering the cost of upfront inspections, when you list with us, **we also provide a free tool to help you get your home market-ready**. This is a unique staging program that allows you to start pre-packing and staging your home like a professional designer. It’s easy to implement and lots of fun\!

Once the inspections are performed and the property is ready for professional pictures, we’ll send our photographer to document your space and show it in its best light. Then we’ll launch our strategic coming soon plan to ensure we build up lots of buyer and agent excitement while maximizing initial interest and showings. Our proven plan has helped hundreds of families move in the Tulsa area for over 20 years. We know that our professional team can help yours too\!
