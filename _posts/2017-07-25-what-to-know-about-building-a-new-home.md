Before deciding to build a new property, there are a few key things you should be aware of first.

The first and probably most important tip to know is to choose a builder who is reputable and won’t leave you hanging during the process. Unfortunately, some builders will vanish before the job is totally completed and leave the buyer with a load of unpaid bills.

A good builder will not only meet your building needs, but will also service your house under the long-term warranty. **Talking to people within your community, especially your agent, can help you choose the right builder.**

While building a home may sound like a good idea, make sure you take add-ons and upgrades into account before deciding if this is the best move for you. Both of these things will drive up the price, and will be charged for a premium. You may be able to do some negotiating, but ultimately you should make sure that the add-ons and upgrades you’re choosing are actually best for you and your home.

That being said, remember to stay involved in the building process. Visiting the site, keeping in touch with the builder and contractors, and scheduling regular meetings will help you make sure that you are aware of everything that’s going on. This way you’ll be able to tell right away if something isn’t being done correctly.

Also, learn the neighborhood. **You can choose the way your house is built, but once it’s finished you need to consider the neighborhood you’ll be left in.&nbsp;**Partnering with an agent who knows the area will help you avoid any mistakes or conflicts.

Keep in mind, too, that building is a lot different than simply buying a home. It is a messy process, so you’ll need to be patient and flexible. Deadlines may shift and issues will come up, so make sure you have contingency plans in place.

During the process always plan a walkthrough. Because they have experience on their side, your agent will have the knowledge to tell you what to look for when you do this to make sure everything is as it should be. **Hiring an inspection team to check the home throughout the process is also a must.**

Use your agent as a resource to help you look into home warranties, as well. Agents want the process to go smoothly and will have all the information you need for things like home insurance.
