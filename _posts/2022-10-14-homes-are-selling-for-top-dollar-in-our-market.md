Today, I want to discuss selling your home in the fall market. New England is world-renowned for its foliage, and in my experience, **fall is the best time of the year to put your home on the market**.

We’re selling homes for top dollar right now. Inventory is still low, and sellers have a slight advantage in this marketplace. I know many people generally think that the spring market is the best time to list your home, but in my 24 years of experience selling homes in Connecticut, fall has the most opportunities.

We can highlight and market your home in ways we can’t do in the spring—especially with the beautiful fall leaves. We have a ton of buyers who have been looking for months and are desperate to get into a home. Some buyers have even been looking for something specific for over a year.&nbsp;

If they see what they’re looking for, and your home matches those desires, they’re **willing to pay top dollar and move very quickly**.

If you’re thinking about selling your home, call us at (203)-980-6886, or send us an email. We’d love to help you\!
