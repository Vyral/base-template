With regards to how our market has fared since the election, there is some good news and some bad news.

First, the bad: mortgage rates have shot up since the election.

From a low of 3.74% on November 7th, the average fixed 30-year mortgage rate increased to over 4% by the end of November.

**Economists are saying this kind of volatility is likely to continue, with day-to-day changes driven by the moves and statements of the new administration.**

The good news is that there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic down the line.

Promised tax breaks for high-earners could reinvigorate sales of luxury homes, which have seen a glut lately.

This could have a ripple effect throughout the rest of the real estate market, spurring sales and construction of mid-level and lower-priced housing.

Also, looser financial regulation could make it easier for buyers to obtain mortgages.

One piece of good news is that the election is finally over. Also, you might have seen that the stock market has been surging in the past few weeks.

That might be a vote of confidence for our President-elect and his anticipated business-friendly policies as the inauguration draws near.

**It certainly seems things are getting back to normal as people come to realize the world's not ending.**

In fact, many people who were waiting on the sidelines while the election was going on are now entering the real estate market.

It's a great time to take advantage of this if you are selling.

<br>If you want an idea of what your home could sell for in the current market, just send me an email to [myhomesvalue@jteixsells.com](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(109,121,104,111,109,101,115,118,97,108,117,101,64,106,116,101,105,120,115,101,108,108,115,46,99,111,109))) with your address in the subject line and I'll get back to you.

And if you're looking to buy, there are two things you should know.

First, even though mortgage rates have gone up, they are still historically very low, and worth taking advantage of.

Second, many new homes have entered the market since the election, and more new listings will arrive as the spring market approaches.

It's definitely worth investigating what's available around DFW right now.
