<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Real estate is considered an essential industry, which means that the Dar Walden Team is still operating.</em></p>

Though I’m sure we’ve all had our fill of hearing about the COVID-19 pandemic, I just wanted to reach out and let you know that even while 97% of the country is under stay-at-home measures, the Dar Walden Team is still operating.

We take the safety of our clients very seriously, which means that we have to do business a little differently to mitigate the risk of spreading illness. We may be working from home, but all our team members are still taking care of business.

If you need anything, anything at all, you’re more than welcome to reach out to us. We’d love to help however we can. To hear my full message, watch the short video above.
