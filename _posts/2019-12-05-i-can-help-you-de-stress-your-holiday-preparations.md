<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Don’t stress about the holidays\! Here is a quick tip to help you get your home ready for guests without adding stress to your life.</em></p>

It’s almost time for Christmas—are you all ready?

I’m getting so many calls from clients who are stressed out. Christmas is not about stressing out, but rather having fun with friends and family. If you have guests coming over for the holidays and a honey-do list full of projects like pressure washing the driveway and cleaning carpets that you don’t have time to finish, give me a call.

**I most likely have someone on my list of vendors who would be able to come and help you complete those pre-holiday projects so that you don’t have to stress about them.**

Once you are ready for your guests and you start thinking about presents (if you haven’t already), here’s something to keep in mind: **Do not adopt a pet for someone else as a gift.** That is a very bad idea; you can’t be sure that they’re ready for that responsibility, or if they even want it.

Every December, we see a lot of pets brought in who are in need of rescue. So if you do want to adopt a pet—adopt, not buy—do it for yourself. Christmas is the perfect time to do so since you’ll have more time to spend with it.

And don’t forget: **We’re accepting donated pet toys and food for the animal shelter, as well as toys to be donated to human children.**

So if you have any household projects that you need assistance with, you’re interested in adopting a pet into your loving home, or you have any questions about real estate at all, reach out to me. In the meantime, have a wonderful holiday season\!
