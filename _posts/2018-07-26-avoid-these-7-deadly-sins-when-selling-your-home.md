Do you know about the seven deadly sins of selling a home? Today I am going to share them with you, so that you can avoid them and sell your property for top dollar, instead.&nbsp;

**1. An unkempt yard.** Many people think that it’s on the inside that matters. But if your home looks like a tornado blew through the yard, potential buyers may never actually get inside.

**2. Keys that do not work.** If the potential buyer and their agent cannot get in, they may become frustrated by the experience.

**3. Dingy or faded front door.** The front door will serve as a buyer’s first impression, so make sure its in great shape before they arrive.&nbsp;

**4. Animals.** I love animals, and I think that most people do, too. However, it’s important to clean up after them by eliminating messes, hair, and odor before buyers enter your home.

**5. Furniture arrangement.** If a room has excessive or poorly arranged furniture, it may appear less spacious than it actually is. Buyers will have a very difficult time looking past ineffective staging.&nbsp;

**6. Junk drawers and packed cabinets.** Overly full storage areas will reflect poorly on your home.&nbsp;

**7. Cluttered countertops.** Showcasing your counter space is critical, so make sure to remove all unnecessary items before buyers tour your property.&nbsp;

If you have any additional questions or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
