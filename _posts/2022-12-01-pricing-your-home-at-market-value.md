In today's shifting housing market, overpricing your home is a mistake. Most sellers that I work with want to maximize their sales price, minimize the hassles, and sell their homes as quickly as possible.

Although we're still in a seller's market, things have changed quite a bit from just a few months ago. Things really changed around June 1, so we need to consider how to price your house based on where the economy is at right now. **When you price your house at market value, you'll boost interest in your home and attract more buyers.** That will also maximize your sales price. Pricing your home right will then make it sell faster.

**You don't want to overshoot your target price.** Price the home too high, and it will sit on the market or require a price reduction. Price it too low, and that may lead to buyers thinking something's wrong with it. Hitting the bullseye is what I do. As your agent, I'll look at all the factors to help you maximize your sales price in today's shifting market. If you have any questions, contact me at (502) 376-5483. I look forward to hearing from you.
