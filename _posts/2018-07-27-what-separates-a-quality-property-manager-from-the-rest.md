Today we’re joined by a special guest, Peter Lohmann from RL Property Management, to discuss what people should look for in a property manager.

**As a property manager himself, Peter’s perspective is particularly valuable, especially given that his company manages about 320 residential units here in Columbus.** It all began five years ago, when he saw an opportunity in our community to, in his words, “do property management right.”

His company is 100% focused on residential management, so, suffice it to say, he is extremely qualified to identify what separates top property managers from the rest. And in order for someone to make this same distinction themselves when selecting a property manager, Peter believes there are a few important considerations and questions people should keep in mind.

First, he says that **people should ask property managers or property management companies about their structure and about the total cost they charge.** Having this knowledge will help you budget accordingly.

Yet this first question is also the most obvious. Peter says that it’s important to dig a little deeper when selecting a property manager. One way to do that is by considering whether a given property manager will be a good personal fit. Their style must be conducive to your needs, desires, and goals.

According to Peter, there are two main styles of property management. For the first, the property manager is very, very hands-on. They will call you for every little thing, and almost act like your personal assistant. The second style, which is closer to what Peter’s company does, involves them asking their clients to let them take control. He believes that, **since they’re the experts, they should have a significant say in how things operate.**

A property manager should be able to handle all of your needs, be well-connected locally, and have a maintenance team available. And, speaking of maintenance, your property manager must be aware of which issues are the responsibility of the tenant and which must be handled by the landlord.

The bottom line is a good property manager should be willing to communicate with you. While they will handle the bulk of the decision-making process, it’s still crucial that they keep you in the loop.
