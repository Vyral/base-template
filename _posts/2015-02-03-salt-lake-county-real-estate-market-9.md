We have been having a great 2015 so far, and wanted to let you know today what to expect in the coming year, because a lot of our clients have been asking us.

First, let's talk about interest rates. They have been historically low for quite some time now, but as the saying goes, "All good things must come to an end." Most experts are predicting that interest rates are going to increase significantly, by as much as 1% this summer. 

Because of this, we should see a little increase in days on market, and a little decrease in the list-to-sale ratio. However, we are torching industry averages in both of these areas, and should see little to no movement as the Wasatch Front market continues to level out.

We will check up on these predictions soon and throughout the year, but if you have any questions for us, be sure to reach out. Pick up the phone and give us a call, we would love to help you out.
