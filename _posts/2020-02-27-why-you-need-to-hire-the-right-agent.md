In a previous video, I talked about how a lot of homes in this market are selling before they even hit the market. Here’s what’s happening: **The market is hot, nice properties are selling fast, and the agents who have a majority of the inventory are talking daily.&nbsp;**

A lot of consumers these days want to find deals on homes by looking online in places like Facebook and Zillow. However, the majority of these houses are circulating amongst the agents who control the market before they’re even listed.

For example, there is a property that we’re getting ready to list in Salem. It’s a 4-bedroom, 2-bathroom home that’s worth around $300,000. I’m going to reach out to my connections because my seller wants to sell the house with as few people walking through his house as possible. I’ll let them know about the house, the price, and see if they have anybody who may be interested. **My client doesn’t want their life disrupted, so I’m going to do what I can to find a buyer as soon as it’s listed on the market.**

You must find an agent that you know and trust. They should be very involved in the market and have connections so that you can access these houses before they hit the market, too.

If you have any questions for me or need any help buying or selling a home, feel free to reach out via phone or email. I would love to hear from you.
