I’ve been getting a lot of great feedback from a lot of you recently so I wanted to take some time to answer a few of the most common questions I keep seeing. Here are five important questions with five (equally as important) answers.

**1. What are closing costs and who pays them?** Closing costs are paid by both the buyer and the seller. They include, but are not limited to, title fees, insurance fees, HOA dues, attorney fees, and escrow application fees.

**2. What is a contingency?** Essentially, it’s a get out of jail free card for the buyer. One of the most common contingencies out there is the home sale contingency. This is something buyers use when they need to sell their current home in order to afford the purchase of a new one. In an aggressive market like ours, you will actually see people waive certain contingencies, such as the appraisal and inspection contingencies. {% include pullquote.html %}

**3. Should I buy or rent a home?** Either way, you’re going to be paying a mortgage. You might as well pay your own and start building towards your retirement. With low rates right now, there is a great opportunity to take advantage of a low interest rate.

**4. Do I need to be there for the home inspection?** If you’re a seller, no. If you’re a buyer, absolutely. You don’t want anything to get lost in translation between you, your agent, and the inspector, so being there is very important.

**5. What kind of credit score do I need to buy?** Anything over 700 is good, but there are plenty of loan programs out there for those with lower scores.

If you have any additional questions for me or need any help buying or selling a Hoboken home, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
