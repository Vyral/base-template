*Many buyers aren’t sure if getting a home warranty is worth it, so today we’ll get to the bottom of this question.*

Buyers often ask whether they should get a home warranty when purchasing a new property. Actually, yes—getting a home warranty is generally a good idea, especially given that sellers typically pay for a one-year policy at closing. And since a comprehensive policy tends to cost about $550 (or more if the home comes with a pool or some similar amenity), this is a great deal.&nbsp;

So unless the buyer is specifically opposed to doing so, our team almost always includes this request in their sales contract.&nbsp;

But why is a home warranty important?

Well, let’s say your refrigerator breaks down after a few months of living in your new home. **Would you rather pay to fix, and possibly replace, it yourself, or would you rather the expense be covered by a home warranty policy?** The answer is a given.&nbsp;

Buying a home is expensive enough as it is—a home warranty helps ensure that living in the home isn’t quite as pricey.&nbsp;

**Home warranty companies require policyholders to work with the contractors they provide.** You don’t have the option of working with a contractor of your choice. Of course, when you work with our team, we will only refer you to the very best professionals. If you ever have a bad experience, please let us know. We would be happy to advocate for you and your needs and to make sure that you get the level of service you deserve.&nbsp;

The bottom line is that if you’re buying a new home, you should absolutely ask the seller to pay for a home warranty.&nbsp;
