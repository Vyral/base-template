Wherever I go, people always ask me how the Truckee or Tahoe market is doing and how it has changed since last year.

When we look at the number of homes that have sold, we are down 10%. **At this time last year,  we had 742 sales, whereas this year, we’ve sold 668.** The good news is that the average price is up 32%, and the median price is up 8%. This means that although we have fewer sales, the sales that we have seen are at higher price levels.

Of course, different neighborhoods are showing different statistics with different sales volumes. For example, **in Tahoe Donner, the sales volume is down about 9%** and the average price is up 13%. In some of our other areas such as Truckee, the actual sales are up 13%, while the average price and median price are up 22% and 25%, respectively.

Some of our higher-end markets such as **Martis Camp are increasing the average sales price for us in the general area as a whole.**

In Donner Lake, the pricing has sort of flattened. The average price and the median price are both down 2%. There are currently 33 homes for sale in the Donner Lake area, while there were 36 available at this time last year.

If you have any questions about a particular neighborhood or your home's value, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
