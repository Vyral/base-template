We’ve noticed a lot of different design trends lately in Orange County. **Buyers know what they want, and it shows in the number of features we are seeing in new homes.** Here are some of the most popular trends right now:

**1. Open floor concept.** People love that great room feel where the kitchen and family room flow together. When people buy resale houses, they tend to knock down walls to accomplish this feel.<br>**2. Window walls.** These are becoming increasingly more popular.<br>**3. State-of-the-art kitchens.** Stainless steel appliances have been popular for a while now, and that trend continues to be hot. We are also seeing a trend away from granite countertops and toward quartzite and marble.<br>**4. Bathroom finishes.** These are always changing because it’s a popular area of the home to remodel. People want a relaxing, spa-like feeling for their bathrooms. Free-standing tubs are becoming more popular too.

Outdoor living spaces.** You are seeing more and more outdoor fire pits, covered ceilings, and built-in heaters. They even make outdoor waterproof TVs.<br>**7. Closet space is a necessity.**We all have a ton of shoes and clothes, so extra closet space is always in high demand.<br>**8. Low water landscaping.** We’re in a drought and have been for a number of years. Grass is going away and cities are providing incentives to put turf in.
