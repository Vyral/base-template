As a real estate agent, one of the worst feelings one can experience is letting a lead or referral “slip through the cracks” or neglecting to nurture the needs of an existing client just by unintentional forgetfulness. If this has happened to you, you’re certainly not alone.

Amidst the busyness of our day-to-day lives, it can be easy to completely forget to connect with those you should be serving. Of course, that’s business you’ve now lost and is a stumbling block for you in reaching your goals. **But it isn’t just about what you’re missing out on—it’s also potentially one less family that could have been helped in a timely way.**

This all-too-common occurrence has motivated us to take up what my team and I call “No Lead Left Behind.” The principle behind this initiative is familiarizing ourselves with the needs of our clients and being responsive when those needs arise.&nbsp;

My team and I have wasted no time in getting on the same page and making sure that we’re all working in a collaborative way to address all clients, referrals, and leads. This is, after all, how we can ensure that there’s No Lead Left Behind.&nbsp;

And let us know if there are any tips or “hacks” you’ve put into practice that you think might be worth mentioning!&nbsp;

Please don’t hesitate to connect with us. We’d love to hear your thoughts!
