In one of our recent messages, I shared with you the story of a client who wanted to buy a home in Cleveland Park. As you may remember, I went on to share my “1-2 Punch” method. **If you happened to miss that episode, you can see it [here](https://youtu.be/7aRQQahHC3U).**

The truth is, however, that the information I shared last time isn’t where this story ends. I told you about the happy ending, but I didn’t explain everything it took to get there. That changes now. Allow me to share the rest of the story:

In order to find this client the perfect home, **I knew that merely scouring the MLS wouldn’t be enough. It was time to start looking at homes that weren’t listed yet.**

My assistant, my client, and I joined forces to come up with 160 homes that fit their criteria, and then it was time for the second phase of our plan. It was time for me to start knocking on doors, leaving notes on houses, mailing letters, and making calls to homeowners. When I had done this for all but 10 remaining homes, I got a call.

**“Marjorie!” said the caller. “We want to sell our house.”**

The system had worked. All the hard work we put into the search paid off, and we were able to find our client a hidden gem.

If you’re in the same boat as our client was, it’s time for you to give my team and me a call. **We would be happy to help you find your own hidden gem.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, please reach out. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
