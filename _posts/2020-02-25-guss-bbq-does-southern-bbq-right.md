<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s my review of California’s favorite Gus’s BBQ and their amazing menu staples.</em></p>

The recently opened Porter Ranch location of Gus’s BBQ is a prime cut above the competition. I had the pleasure of chowing down on an entree of brisket, pulled pork, and fried chicken, complemented by fresh greens and creamy mac n’ cheese. It was a must-have dining experience that I recommend to everyone\! **Here are some helpful things that potential patrons should know before visiting Gus’s:&nbsp;**

* Happy hour is Monday through Friday, 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.&nbsp;
* Monday’s weekly special: an oversized, smoked, bone-in beef rib with two sides, only $27.95&nbsp;
* Tuesday’s weekly special: specialty burger with fries and an old-fashioned&nbsp;

Since I have a soon-to-be 4-year-old, I know the parental pain of ordering a full meal for your child only to have them not eat it. Thankfully, at Gus’s, they have a plethora of options for kiddos. One of my favorites is the grilled cheese plus a side of fruit and french fries for just $5.95\! You can’t even get that much at a fast-food restaurant for that price.&nbsp;

**There are also many great beers on tap,** and their wine and spirits selection is top-notch.

One of the most impressive things about Gus’s BBQ is that all of their meats are very juicy. The fried chicken just melts in your mouth, and the blend of seasonings on it strikes a rare balance of flavor.&nbsp;

No knife is necessary to cut through the tender brisket. There’s also no such thing as a thinly sliced piece of brisket at this restaurant. On the side, the greens were cooked perfectly and seasoned well, while the mac n’ cheese was not too heavy.&nbsp;

Here’s a little bit about how Gus’s approaches the art of Southern barbecue—and boy, will it leave your mouth watering:&nbsp;

*“All of our meats are seasoned overnight and smoked low and slow over whole pecan logs for up to 16 hours. Our rubs and sauces are made from scratch daily, and when it comes to inspiration, we look toward the simplicity of a true Southern kitchen and let the food speak for itself.”*
