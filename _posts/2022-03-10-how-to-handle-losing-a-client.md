Losing a client is something that happens to most of us in the industry. It hurts and has a way of eating at you. When it does occur, how do you move on from it?

Sitting in anger or hurt isn’t productive. For my part, when I lose a client, **I tell myself that there’s more than enough real estate to go around**—something else will come along. That might just be me trying to make myself feel better, but to be honest, it works.

**Second, examine what happened that took you to the point of losing the client.** Every time we lose a client, it’s on us. There’s something that we didn’t do that we should have done, whether that’s being more proactive, more communicative, or what have you. If you had done everything ideally, the deal would have gone through. Granted, that doesn’t mean you did something wrong, but the client’s perspective is different from yours. If you don’t immediately understand how your actions might have led to the client leaving, assess it from the client’s point of view.

**Third, I strongly e****ncourage us agents to collaborate.** After all, when you lose a client before their transaction has closed, chances are they’re still going to need someone to help them with it, meaning that they’ll move on to another agent. We also need to assess how ethically we’re acting on the other side—I think that’s something that’s missing from our industry. For example, one ethical question to consider is whether or not the agent that the client goes to owes the first agent a referral fee. I’m not making any hard prescriptions here; this is just the kind of ethical framework I believe more agents should operate within.

If you have any questions about how to handle losing a client or what you can do to try to make sure that doesn’t happen again, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you become the best agent you can be.
