So you’ve decided to put your home on the market, but you aren’t sure if listing right now makes sense or not. Maybe you’ve heard that it’s better to wait until the spring or summer when the market is hot. However, now might be the perfect time to list. Here’s why.

**It all comes down to competition.** Yes, there are more buyers on the market during spring and summer, but there are also many more sellers. Because of that, the difference in the number of sales versus the number of homes on the market is basically the same whether it’s June or January.

**If you’re the kind of person who doesn’t want to fight the crowds and the competition you’ll see in the spring, now might be the perfect time for you to get your home on the market** and get it sold quickly.
