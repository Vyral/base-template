We see a lot of posts on Facebook from our clients who are looking for vendors for various reasons—plumbers, painters, handymen, etc. Today we wanted to let you know that we have a resource just for this.

We work with a lot of different people in different industries, and have put together a list of vendors whom we know well and trust to do a good job for you. **Their prices are fair, and we are positive that you will be happy with them.**

Some of these posts we see are from clients who have already hired someone. Looking at the vendors they chose, we probably could have saved them a lot of money. **Our preferred vendors often have special deals specifically for our clients.**

In addition to our list of vendors, **we also get discounts at different places** like Sherwin-Williams—there, we get 40% off, as well as wholesale rates on carpets.

If you would like a complete list of our preferred vendors and the discounts you will have access to, you are encouraged to reach out to us. We will be happy to provide it to you.
