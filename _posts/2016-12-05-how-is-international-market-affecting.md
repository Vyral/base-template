South Florida is a destination spot for many international homebuyers, but which two countries will affect the real estate market the most?

The biggest impact will come from our neighbors to the east, China. **China is planning on investing $21 billion outside of their country over the next few years**, and a decent amount of that will be poured into the South Florida market. Not only is South Florida attractive for its stability and opportunity, but our rental market is incredibly strong, making the area very attractive to Chinese buyers.

Canada will be the other country impacting our market trends. Over the past few years, Canadians have been a huge influence on the South Florida real estate market. However, we currently have a currency issue. Because the U.S. dollar is so strong right now, Canadians have to pay 25% more to make the same purchase they would have made a few years ago.

 It’s very important that South Florida home sellers are in the know when it comes to the international market. **We make sure our clients’ properties are put right in front of international buyers** by using our customized marketing approach. We know who the buyers are, where they are located, and how to get your property in front of them.

We are also introducing a new game called “Where’s Lisa?” I will be at different locations in South Florida in our videos, and the first person to guess where I am wins a prize.
