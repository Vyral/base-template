Today, I’m here with Karin Marganian and she works for Style My Space. She’s going to give us some pointers on how to stage your home. You want your home to look its finest, so you can earn top dollar!

Small changes can easily separate your home from the competition. For example, declutter your property.  Clear off the countertops in the bathrooms and kitchens. Put unnecessary items in storage. Move some furniture around in order to maximize the space  in your home.

Also, ensure your yard is maintained well and clean. Curb appeal is incredibly important. You only get one chance at a first impression, so make sure the outside of your home is inviting.

Another simple tip is to air out your home so that everything smells fresh. That way, when potential buyers come in, they will feel at ease in your space. 

Karen can come out and walk through your home room by room to figure out the best way to stage your property. We’ll give you pointers and tips to get you top dollar in today’s market. If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
