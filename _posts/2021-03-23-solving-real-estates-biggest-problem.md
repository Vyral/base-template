The No. 1 problem in real estate right now is that many folks want to move but need the equity out of their current home to buy their next one. Furthermore, they don’t want to put their current home on the market without first knowing where they’re going. This is doubtless a tricky situation, but thankfully, we’ve been working on a practical solution.&nbsp;

In a fast-paced, low-inventory market like ours, the best way to buy your next house is with somebody else’s money. Sound too good to be true? Hear us out:&nbsp;

We’ve partnered with an exceptional company called Homeward. You can send in an application for review via their site. **If you’re approved, they’ll actually give you the cash you need to buy your next house.** That makes you a non-contingent cash buyer in the market, which is a powerful position to be in.&nbsp;

Using Homeward’s cash, you can buy the home you want, move into it, and then put your old house up for sale. When you finally get your equity out so that you can get a mortgage, you just buy it back from them. Of course, they do charge a fee for that—that’s how they’re able to be in business. More often than not, though, that fee is far outweighed by the convenience of being able to shop without severe restraints. Don’t rush into your next home; leverage Homeward’s resources to make the right purchase.&nbsp;

This is a great tool to have in our tool belt. This seller’s market can be brutal; **we want to share this game-changing information with as many burnt-out buyers as possible** in the hope that they finally feel empowered.

If you or someone you know is either knee-deep in the home-buying process or soon to get started, please reach out to us today. We’d love to hear more about their specific needs and help them craft an actionable plan that gets them into a home they can feel proud of.
