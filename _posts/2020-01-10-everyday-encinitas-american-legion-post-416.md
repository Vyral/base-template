On the latest episode of “Everyday Encinitas,” I’m spotlighting American Legion Post 416 and chatting with Christian Schilling, one of its executive board members. The American Legion is a veteran-based nonprofit organization, and aside from having the coldest beer on F Street, Post 416 serves as a hub of community outreach.
