Welcome back. Thanks for joining me today. I wanted to talk about home inspections.

Home inspections are important for both buyers and sellers, but today I wanted to focus especially on why it’s important for sellers to get an inspection prior to listing their home.

Why?

A lot of sellers aren’t aware of the true health of their home. When was the last time you checked the foundation of your home? What shape is your roof in?

Once a seller gets the report on their home, they can make the necessary changes. That way when a buyer makes an offer, you can hand them the report. There also won’t be any surprises when a buyer has their inspector come through.

If you have any questions about how to prepare your home for the market, give me a call 818.958.5300

Thanks for watching!
