Is a brick-and-mortar office necessary for agents to achieve success in their career?&nbsp;

The short answer is no, of course not. We can point to many examples of agents achieving a high level of success operating virtually and not having a physical space in which to meet with their fellow agents, manager, broker, etc.&nbsp;

Let me phrase this question differently, though: Does having access to a brick-and-mortar office—and the resources it provides—maximize the opportunity for agents to take their career to the highest possible level? **The answer here is a resounding yes.&nbsp;**

To illustrate my point, I’ll share a chapter of the Abby Realty story. We grew within 18 months to a team of 200 agents with no brick-and-mortar office. Of course, we like to tell our clients we had lots of “offices”—we were meeting at Starbucks, title companies’ conference rooms, our lending partners’ training rooms, etc. In a way, we had offices all over town.

Not having a brick-and-mortar office didn’t hurt us. We grew rapidly and our agents were happy and productive. From this perspective, you could say an office wasn’t necessary. However, several months ago, we finally moved into our own 6,000-square-foot office in Spring, Texas.&nbsp;

Has it made a difference? **I think all of our agents would answer with another resounding yes.** Now, they have 24-hour access to a professional workspace. If they need to meet to mastermind with other agents or attend training classes, for instance, we can make that happen ourselves. We don’t depend on the graciousness of our vendor partners, so we can run training classes morning, noon, and night.&nbsp;

Even the agents who don’t live in close proximity to Spring can benefit from our office. Having our own training room allows us to set up our own AV equipment so we can livestream all our training classes. All they need is a good internet connection to participate.

The bottom line is this: **If you can find a real estate company that maximizes the potential of cyberspace and has a brick-and-mortar office and all the resources that entails, you’ll get the best of both worlds.** You’ll be able to maximize your career opportunities and income potential as a real estate professional.&nbsp;
