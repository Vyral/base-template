<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’m excited to share another Brand Ambassador video with you all today\! This time, I’m focusing on the Dairy Queen in Carlisle.</em></p>

The thing I love about the Dairy Queen in Carlisle is that it’s an icon in the community—it’s been here since 1981. I grew up coming to the restaurant, and now I bring my own family here to enjoy one of their Blizzards or other ice cream treats to beat the summer heat.

I also love the family who owns the Carlisle Dairy Queen. They’re a hard-working, honest, local family that does a lot to give back to the community. They hold fundraisers and other charitable events for churches and nonprofits in the community throughout the year. **That’s what the Brand Ambassador Program and these local businesses are all about—giving back.**&nbsp;

Here’s something about the Carlisle Dairy Queen that I only just learned: In their commitment to keeping people coming back for more, they haven’t raised their prices in over 12 years\! Further to that, **they gave away over 3,000 ice cream cones on the first day of spring**; on that day, we saw vanilla ice cream cones all over town. And none of that’s to mention their 50-cent hotdogs, which I recommend highly (they’re all but giving them away\!).

Finally, there’s a sign in the front of their lot that advertises a can’t-miss special: **For just $2.49, you can get a massive ice cream sundae\!**

Hopefully you get the chance to invite your own friends and family to the Carlisle Dairy Queen. My family and I will probably be there, and we hope to see you there soon\!

If you have any questions about the Brand Ambassador Program, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.
