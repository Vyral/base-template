Today, we're going to talk about bigger homes and why now might be the time to make your move on the Wasatch Front. The other day, we saw a report on CNN that talked about average home size. It said the average home is now 2,600 square feet, which is 500 square feet larger than it was only 20 years ago. Have you always wanted a great room, or a few extra bedrooms? How about a home office? It's likely your family's need have changed since you moved into your current home, so now might be the time to get an evaluation done on your property, so you can get that newer, larger home before school starts.


The key is figuring out how much your home is worth so you know how much you have available for a down payment on your next home. We can help you determine what you can afford, and what upgrades might be better than others for your particular situation. We're always available to chat about your options, so give us a call or shoot us an email with your real estate needs. We'd love to help you out.
