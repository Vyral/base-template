Where is our Denver market headed from a short-term perspective? Let’s look at a few key factors and analyze their numbers.

Inventory for condos and single-family homes for the month of September was at the highest level it’s been since 2013. For single-family homes, there were 7,950 available listings, which was an 8% increase compared to September 2016. For condos, there were 2,075 available listings, which was a 22% increase compared to September 2016.

From August to September, the average sale price of single-family homes dropped from $466,055 to $457,836, but that latter number is still a 5% year-to-date increase from September 2016. For condos, the average sale price also dipped slightly from August to September to $311,157, but year-to-date that’s up 8% compared to September 2016.

**Is demand keeping up with the increase in inventory? Absolutely.** By the end of September, there were 35,597 total sales recorded since the beginning of the year, which a 9% increase compared to the year-to-date total of September 2016. The year-to-date number of sales for condos was 13,095, which was also a 9% increase compared to last year.

Lastly, the average days on market for single-family homes was 28 days, which was pretty close to last year. For condos, the average days on market was 22 days.

Looking back at these numbers, **we’re having a tremendous year with one of the highest sale totals we’ve ever recorded.** Interest rates are also holding steady right around 4%, which is a historic low. The bottom line is it’s a great time to buy or sell.
