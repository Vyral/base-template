In real estate, it can feel like we’re always “on.” However, when we step back and look at our business, we might be doing the same things over and over again without making progress. Sometimes it just feels like we’re wasting time. **Burnout is the No. 1 most common problem for busy agents.&nbsp;**

How can you get some more of your time back using technology? **Here are my two recommendations:**

**1\. Use Google Calendar to timeblock your week.** I have a whole training session on how to timeblock your week that utilizes planning sessions and intense focus. I can share that with you if you message me. Make sure you’re timeblocking the week in advance and not getting distracted by your phone while you’re doing focused and intentional work.

**2\. Get good at video and start recording.** Anytime you find yourself explaining the same thing more than three times, create a process on video and send that out in the future instead of restating it yourself. This one thing alone is likely to save you weeks throughout your career. It’s the art of process creation. You never want to do processes over and over if they can be repeated exactly. They can be handled through an automated video process.

These are the top two principles for saving time with tech in the real estate world. If you have any questions about how we use this technology or anything else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
