<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Today I’ll take you on a tour of the new MUSC Shawn Jenkins Children’s Hospital.</em></p>

With their state-of-the-art medical supplies, welcoming emergency and admissions areas, and their mother/baby care units, the MUSC Shawn Jenkins Children’s Hospital has so much to offer its patients and their families.

There will be an aquarium installed where kids and their families can go to enjoy the soothing sight of exotic fishes during what can be a difficult time in their lives.

The children’s hospital has large, comfortable waiting rooms for family members. But it’s not just the waiting rooms that are large—the patient rooms are expansive, as well. They come equipped with smart TVs that allow kids to interact with loved ones who aren't there in the hospital with them. The hospital has playrooms on most floors, allowing kids to remain kids during playtime. There are healthy dining options and a family laundry area for those who stay at the hospital long term. You can also see gorgeous artwork comprised of stained glass.&nbsp;

All in all, there are so many conveniences for families to enjoy when they stay with their loved ones here at MUSC Shawn Jenkins Children’s Hospital. This truly wonderful facility opens on December 14, and we’re thankful to have such a facility to take care of the children in our area and throughout the country.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out\! We’d love to hear from you.
