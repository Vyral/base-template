<center>Today I&rsquo;m discussing the importance of home inspections.</center>

&nbsp;

Today I want to discuss a topic I get asked about all the time: home inspections. When you have a property in contract, contact a professional inspector to take a look at it and **make sure you ask to see their license.** In the state of Ohio, home inspectors must now be licensed. Inspectors will go through a property and evaluate its condition.&nbsp;

A home inspection will find things wrong with the property. There’s hardly ever a situation where they find nothing wrong. The question is: Are they big-ticket items or are they small things? Speak with your real estate agent about these issues to see whether they can be negotiated.&nbsp;

It’s critical to have a home inspection done and you should read through it meticulously. Typically, home inspections are 30 to 40 pages long, but I’ve seen some as long as 100 pages. They’re extremely specific and let you know what’s going on with your home. **Some people get anxious about inspections, but they’re nothing to be intimidated about.&nbsp;**

If you have any other questions or concerns, call or email me. I would love to speak with you.
