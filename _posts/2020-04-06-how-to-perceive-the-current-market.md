<center><em>How has the coronavirus affected our market? Today I&rsquo;m sharing what&rsquo;s going on with real estate right now. Here's a quick rundown.</em></center>

<br>This video comes to you from my walk because, as many of us with kids are discovering, we need to get creative to find quiet spaces. This is, of course, not the spring market we anticipated and we're revved up for. **Real estate has slowed significantly during the health crisis**, and it appears it may stay that way for the foreseeable future.

Right now, if it’s not an urgent circumstance and you’re not suffering from hardship, it may be in your best interest to wait on your real estate plans until the crisis settles down, but we're here to help you evaluate that. We believe it might take some time for people’s priorities to shift again after this is all over.
