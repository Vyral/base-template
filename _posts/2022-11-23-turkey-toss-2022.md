On the weekend before Thanksgiving, we held our 2nd annual Turkey Toss for our past clients. **We gave away over 90 fresh Thanksgiving Turkeys\!** So many past clients of our team came through the line to grab their turkeys. We had the best time connecting with these Gorman Residential clients, chatting with them, seeing their families grow & giving out hugs. We love this unique event as our team feels it allows us to be a part of such a special holiday centered around Giving & Thanks\! We are THANKFUL for everyone in our Gorman Residential family. Save the Date for next year\!
