How do you manage to still live comfortably in your home while it’s listed on the market? Today I’d like to tackle this key question.

Keeping a home clean, organized, and show-ready can be a daunting prospect for sellers. These tasks are vital to earning top dollar, but are not easily accomplished while also juggling the matter of a move. 

Thankfully, there are a few simple tips you can follow to ease this predicament. 

**1. Price your home competitively.** Pricing too low could result in you leaving money on the table, but overpricing could also cause major issues. An overpriced home will often sit for months on the market, which equates to months of keeping your home spotless and show-ready as you wait for willing buyers.

**2. Hire an agent with an aggressive marketing plan.** The more showings you can have on the front end, the more successful your listing is likely to be. So an agent who can create a high level of exposure will be essential to achieving a quick sale. Getting several potential buyers through the door will also present a great opportunity to receive and address feedback in the event that there’s anything about your listing that may deter people from submitting an offer. <br><br>**3. Do your best to maintain the home’s condition.** Most of the time, you will have at least a day’s (or half a day’s) notice before a showing. This should give you adequate time to tidy up, but keeping your house in a generally clean and organized state will save you significant hassle while it’s listed on the market.  

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>
