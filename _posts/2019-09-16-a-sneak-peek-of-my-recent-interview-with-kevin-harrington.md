I’m taking you behind the scenes once again to give you a glimpse into an upcoming report on the Sokoler Medley Team. Before I tell you more about this report, though, let’s take a look at what’s happening in our Louisville and Southern Indiana real estate market.&nbsp;

First of all, buyers were thrilled to see interest rates drop by approximately one-and-a-half points in less than a year. National news headlines recently touted this development as a great time to buy or refinance. But the tide is beginning to turn, and talk of a coming recession has now dominated the news cycle.

However, some believe these recession predictions to be politically motivated. It’s hard to say right now as to whether this is the case or whether a recession is truly on its way, so we’ll keep you updated as new information surfaces. For now, let’s get back to the report on my team that I mentioned earlier.&nbsp;

To give some context to this report, allow me to remind you of Mr. Kevin Harrington—one of the original hosts of NBC’s hit show “Shark Tank”. Much like co-host Barbara Corcoran, Harrington knew what it took for a business to be successful. So when my son Greg and I were asked to be interviewed by him, we, of course, said yes. And this interview is exactly what brought us to Tampa, Florida, where we’re shooting this report. Check out the video above at 2:35 for an exclusive sneak peek at this report. The finished interview will air in a couple of months, until then, we hope you enjoy this update.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
