How does what you hear and read about the condition of the real estate market affect you? I get this question quite often and I’d like to help answer it today.

On November 1 this year, we sent out a video blog that said we are beginning to see a shift in the Memphis real estate market from a seller’s market to a buyer’s market. **How does this change affect the value of your home?**

The answer to the question depends on a combination of local conditions, your resources, personal decisions, and the timing of those actions. That’s why the national, regional, and county statistics can’t give you a specific answer about your neighborhood, your street, and your choices.

This past month, we sent out another email that offered a free, personal home value report. We want you to know the current value of your home so that you can understand the effects that a shift can have on your property. **At the Peterson Team, our core values are to lead, guide, and protect you by listening and understanding your wants and needs.** We also want to interpret each change for you and protect you, your family, and your home.

While a good number of our clients have already reached out and asked for their free, personal home value report, **if you missed the email, all you need to do is give us a call, text, or email today, and we’ll be happy to get yours out to you.**

If you have any other real estate-related questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
