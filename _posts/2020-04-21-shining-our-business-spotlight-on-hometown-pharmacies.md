<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’m back with another Brand Ambassador local business highlight\! Today we’ll shine a light on Hometown Pharmacies.</em></p>

Richard Gobin founded Hometown Pharmacies in 1967, but before Richard got into the pharmacy business, he taught at a school and was moonlighting to make ends meet. Eventually, he had the idea to go back to school and get another degree, so he left and went back to Temple University in Philadelphia to get a degree in pharmaceuticals. The rest is history.

**Hometown Pharmacies is actually a group of pharmacies located here in South-Central Pennsylvania:** [Holly Pharmacy](https://www.hollypharmacy.com/), [Big Spring Pharmacy](https://www.bigspringpharmacy.com/), and [Quality Care Pharmacy](https://www.qcpharmacy.com/). If you have any pharmaceutical needs or questions, click one of the links to learn more about what each pharmacy has to offer. For example, Quality Care is also a compounding pharmacy, which allows them to make prescription drugs that aren’t readily available from scratch.

One of the most common questions Richard’s pharmacists receive is, “Will this medication interact with any of my other medications?” Fortunately, **all his pharmacists are knowledgeable and prepared enough to advise and educate each patient about drug interaction**, and much more besides. They treat all their customers like neighbors, and they even tend to know their names, which isn’t something that just any pharmacy can boast\!

Beyond prescription drugs, Hometown Pharmacies also offers services and patient care, but **what sets them apart is their dedication to solving patients’ problems** if it’s at all possible.&nbsp;
