How can you prepare a buyer for our current market, where inventory is tighter than it’s been in the past?

To answer that question, I’ve brought in KW Associate Broker David Dorius. David is a 30-year veteran of the Wasatch Back market who's been named salesperson of the year by the Park City Board of Realtors and is currently on the Board of Directors for the Wasatch Back MLS.

The first thing David likes to do is **have an in-depth discussion with the buyer to figure out what their needs and objectives are for buying.** This also prepares them for the possibility that, because we’re in a low-inventory market, they’ll have to compete with other buyers for the home they want.

To get them to better understand this fact, David has to deal with the reality that most buyers today pre-shop for homes on the internet before meeting and consulting with an agent. The websites they use are valuable to consumers and helpful to us Realtors, but their information can also be out of date, which is why **it’s important to make them understand that the homes they see on those websites might not be available.**

“I need to get them in tune with allowing me to provide them accurate, current data and information about what’s available and what’s sold through our multiple listing service,” David says.

I want to thank David for joining me today to share his thoughts on this important question. Stay tuned for part two of this series. In the meantime, if you have any questions or there’s anything I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to speak with you.
