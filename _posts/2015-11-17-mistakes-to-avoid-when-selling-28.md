Many people are getting ready to put their home on the market this holiday season, so today we wanted to talk about the most common mistakes when selling a home. We want you to avoid these when it comes time for you to sell, no matter what time of year it is. Here’s what you need to avoid as a seller:

1. The home isn’t ready
Nothing kills a transaction like a home that’s unprepared for the market. Here’s what you need to do to ensure your home is:

	* Declutter-  Decluttering is a big deal, but you already know that.
	* Flat surfaces- Make sure you clean off all flat surfaces, which include fridges, countertops, bookshelves, and more. Make sure they only have decorative items on them.
	* Curb appeal- Make sure to repaint your front door and remove any debris in your yard to help buyers feel more relaxed and comfortable when they walk into your home.
	* Pay special attention to the kitchen, master bedroom, and master bathroom.
	* There is nothing worse for your price than showing or photographing a home that’s not ready.

2. Too many improvements
	* Most improvements that you make on your home should be for yourself and your family, because you enjoy them. Many don’t generate a positive return. Even putting granite countertops in will only get you seventy cents back for every dollar you spend. Improvements also make things that are unimproved stand out like a sore thumb, which isn’t good.

3. Not hiring the right people
	* This is one of the most common mistakes I see as a listing agent. After you sign a contract with an agent, it’s hard to get out of because you have to honor the contract. With our contracts, they are day-to-day, up-front, and in writing.

Don’t make these mistakes! If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!
