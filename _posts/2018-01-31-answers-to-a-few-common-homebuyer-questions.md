  Today we’re answering a few questions I’ve been hearing a lot recently from

Today I wanted to answer a few commonly asked questions I get about buying a home. If you’re thinking about buying a home anytime in the near future, listen up. This is important information for you to know.

How long will it take to buy a home?

**It depends on the buyer, but we know that once we get a home under contract, it typically takes 30 to 45 days to close on the home.**The speed also depends on factors such as the type of loan, the time of year, etc. The home search portion of the process could take a few days or could last as long as six months. Statistically speaking, people start looking for homes online six to 12 months before they’re ready to purchase. Knowing your timeline in advance helps things move along more smoothly.

What does a Realtor do for a homebuyer?

Everything. I’m not exaggerating. **The job of a Realtor is to help a homebuyer narrow properties down, disseminate information, provide context, and help you pick the perfect home.** Once we enter an agreement, we will negotiate with the seller and their agent to help you get the best price and the best terms on your contract. Then we will monitor the closing process, the inspection, negotiate any repairs, make sure the title is clean, and coordinate everything between the buyer, seller, lender, and closing attorney to make sure the home closes on time.

I hope these answers were helpful to you. If you have any more questions like this or any questions relating to real estate, feel free to reach out and give me a call or send me an email anytime. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
