I’m kicking off a new series of videos on leverage. The Leverage Series will cover ways to use leverage in your business.

Today, we’re speaking with Nick Caravaglia and Carol Anne Kret from E7 Park City Real Estate to explore how they leverage their partnership in their business. Here’s what they had to say: &nbsp;

**When did you two decide to become partners?**

Nick: Back in 2009, I was a relatively new real estate agent. I took a listing with eight new condo properties and thought it was an ideal time to learn from an established agent. I had known Carol for about 20 years, and I knew she was a firecracker and one of the best agents in Park City. So, who better to work with than a longtime friend who I trusted and respected?

**What are the primary benefits of your partnership for both of you as business owners?**

Carol Anne: There are many benefits to being partners with Nick. We complement each other’s skill sets. There are things I like to do more and things Nick likes to do, so we kind of divide those tasks out. He always puts the open house signs out for me. It’s a simple thing but it’s such a pain for me to do. We’ve got a lot of synergy and we’re able to bounce ideas off of each other, whether it’s a marketing program for a listing, negotiating techniques, responding to counteroffers and the like.

**How does the partnership affect your business revenue?**

Carol Anne: Keller Williams has structured the commission structure to encourage partnerships and teams in a financially advantageous way. It encourages leveraging, working together to achieve more, and it makes financial sense as well.

**How has the quality of your life improved with your partnership?**

Nick: Carol Anne knows that my children are the two most important people in my life. I’ve always believed that once you take a client, you want to treat them with velvet gloves. It’s nice to have a partner like Carol Anne because I know she’ll take care of the client just as I would. I’m also able to spend more time with my children by taking them to school and going to school events.

Carol Anne: I’m not a morning person. Morning is when I do my workouts or walk my dogs. I like to be in the office in the afternoon. Having Nick as my partner has greatly enriched my ability to have a personal life, and that’s really important. Real estate can be all-consuming. It is a very demanding career and we love it, but it’s a never-ending challenge to find that balance. Having a good solid partner like Nick who’s got my back and will make sure our clients are getting the best possible service is essential.

**The two of you have a unique brand. You’re known as Elevation 7 Park City Real Estate. Tell me about E7.**

Nick: Luxury real estate is elevated in Park City, and isn’t everything better over 7,000 feet? One thing that’s great about Keller Williams is that Keller Williams allows us as agents to brand ourselves. We get to create a unique brand within Keller Williams and we still get all of the support and backing from them. Keller Williams is a family that supports our brand, E7.

**It’s very creative.**

Carol Anne: I love our logo and the branding. It’s important to set yourself apart versus being another one of 1,100 agents in town. We are a unique brand. It’s a fun logo, and to be backed by such a strong international brand as Keller Williams makes it all better, makes it work.

The E7 Park City Real Estate team has received a number of awards over the years, and I have no doubt that 2017 will be another one of those years. Thank you to Nick and Carol Anne for sitting down with me to discuss how they leverage their partnerships to benefit their business and their personal lives.
