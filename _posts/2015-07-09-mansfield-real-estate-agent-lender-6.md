Welcome back. Today we are asking one of the most common questions we get asked, "What is the first step in the real estate process in Mansfield?"

My answer is almost always the same. Unless you are paying cash, call a lender. It's a really important step for us to know how we can help you and what you can afford. There are a lot of steps involved in the process and the more you can anticipate, the easier and more stress-free it will be.

Even if you're not a first-time buyer, finding a good lender is still essential to your transaction. They will let you know exactly what you can afford and what type of home you can purchase.

Lending guidelines are constantly changing, so it's important you are working with someone who is always up to date on the latest changes. If you are looking for a good lender, we always recommend asking a good agent. If they are a good agent, they will have a preferred lending partner.

We have a lender that we refer all our clients to, and that is Trevor Kerr at Gateway Mortgage, who you can contact at (972)-822-7408. There is no one else I would refer my clients to.

If you have any questions for us, or are looking to buy or sell a home in Mansfield, give us a call or send us an email! We would love to hear from you!
