You may not be in the market (yet) to buy another home, but when you do, here are nine things to consider.&nbsp; And if you are selling your home, these things also apply.&nbsp;

**1\. Good View = Higher Price:**&nbsp; The view really doesn’t matter. It could be a pond. A view of a mountain or valley.&nbsp; The rule of thumb is that you can expect to pay a higher price.

**2\. Sold AS IS**\:&nbsp; Sellers will sometimes negotiate the price or give a dollar concession rather than put the home back on the market and start all over again.

**3\. Gated community:**&nbsp; It might have a gate—but what does that really mean?&nbsp; Can anyone push a button to open the gate?&nbsp; Or is there a special card or access code to gain entry?&nbsp; If security is an issue, it pays to find out.

**4\. Curb appeal:**&nbsp; If the yard is neglected, the weeds are taking over or the outside paint job is fading, the inside is usually neglected too.&nbsp; Get a home inspection and be especially careful to look for hidden maintenance items.&nbsp;

**5\. Check the area for crime:**&nbsp; It’s still about location, location, location\! &nbsp;You can get crime stats from your local police or sheriff’s department.&nbsp;

**6\. Check out the school system:**&nbsp; Same as above.&nbsp; In addition, use the Internet to do some of your own research to compare it to other schools in your area (including private schools).

**7\. Don’t buy into the “marketing” fluff:**&nbsp; Beware of descriptions such as “cozy, cute, fixer-upper, charming,” etc.&nbsp; Pay more attention to the “facts”\!

**8\. Lowest price in the neighborhood:**&nbsp; This is a red flag because people usually don’t sell at a lower price because they don’t need the money.&nbsp; It’s priced low because of some other issue.

**Don’t believe what you read:**&nbsp; Remember that the real estate agent is the one who creates the marketing strategies – and it’s all in the way they “perceive” it.&nbsp; So if you are interested in the home, go ahead and view it, but make your own decision.&nbsp; (If you are selling, ask to review the listing information before it is published.)
