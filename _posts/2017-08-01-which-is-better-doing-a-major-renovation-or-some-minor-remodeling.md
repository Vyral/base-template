One question I’ve been getting a lot lately is, “When I list my home, should I do a major renovation project or am I better off doing some minor remodeling?”

The answer I give to 99% of the people I meet with is to do a minor type of remodeling or upgrade, as this will bring you a better return on your investment. Don’t get me wrong—a brand-new kitchen or bathroom will help your home sell hand over fist, but by the time you get done with that type of project, there’s usually a lot of unanticipated costs that can also cost you time and prevent you from getting top dollar for your home sale.

Research indicates you should start your upgrades outside. Buyers are drawn to things like curb appeal and attractive landscaping. Avoid getting too customized with your renovations, though. Not everybody likes a certain color or style, so you’re better off maintaining neutrality.

Lastly, do some decluttering. It’s an often-overlooked task, but it’s an easy one to accomplish. I understand if you have things you appreciate lying around the house, but clutter can become distracting to a potential buyer.

If you have any questions about which minor upgrades you can make to increase your home’s value and saleability, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be glad to help.
