Is the holiday season a good time to sell your home? If you want to list your home on the market, should you wait until spring?

Actually, the holidays can be a great time to sell. I have personally tracked my sales every year for the past several years, and I’ve found that I’m usually very busy during the holidays.

**During the holidays, inventory is typically low and buyers tend to be very serious**. There also tends to be less competition than there is at other times of year.

While the number of transactions does rise during the spring and summer, this doesn’t mean it’s inherently better to sell during those seasons.

Don’t think you’ll get more for your home during the spring and summer. This isn’t the case.

So, if you are going to list your home during the holidays, this brings up a couple of questions. For instance: What about decorations? Should you put them up?

In my opinion, yes. There’s something warm and inviting about holiday decor. Just be careful not to go overboard. **You don’t want to put so much stuff out that your home becomes cluttered**. Feel free to make things look nice and homey, but keep things neat and clean for showings.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
