If you’re thinking of making some upgrades to your home, here are a couple contractor scams that you need to be aware of. 

**Scam #1: “I’ll need the money up front.” **

According to the Better Business Bureau, this scam is the most common one. Your contractor explains that because he needs to order materials and rent earth-moving equipment to get the job started, he’ll need 30% to 50% of the project price up front. Once you fork over the cash, one of two things happens—either the contractor disappears or starts doing a half-hearted job knowing that you can’t fire him because he is in possession of thousands of your dollars. 

**How can you protect yourself? **

Never prepay more than $1,000 or 10% of the project price—whichever is less. This is the legal maximum in most states, and is enough to establish that you’re a serious customer. The contractor can then work you into a schedule, which is the only valid purpose of an advanced payment. As to the materials and earth-moving equipment, if your contractor is a professional in good standing, their supplier will provide them those things on credit.

**Scam #2: “Take my word for it.” **

When you first meet with a contractor, they are very agreeable about doing everything exactly to your specifications, and they might even suggest their own touches and upgrades. However, some of those details don’t make it into the contract agreement. You figure it doesn’t matter, though, because you two had such a clear verbal understanding. 

Pretty soon, you notice that the specifications you discussed are going unbuilt. When you confront the contractor, they tell you they forgot to include those features in their price, so you’ll either have to live without them or pay additional money to redo the work. 

**How do you protect yourself? **

Unfortunately, you have very few, if any, legal options against your contractor because you signed a contract that didn’t include all the details you wanted. This is why you need to make sure everything you agree upon with your contractor is written in the project description in the agreement. Add any items that are missing, write your initials next to each addition, and have the contractor initial it too. Do this all before you sign the contract.
