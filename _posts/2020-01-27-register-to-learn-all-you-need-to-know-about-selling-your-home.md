On February 8, 2020, we’ll be holding our annual seller seminar to familiarize homeowners with the selling process from start to finish. Will you join us?

Once every year, the Dar Walden Team holds a free class to help home sellers learn all they need to know about the sales process. This year, **the class will take place on Saturday, February 8, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., and I hope you’ll join us there\!&nbsp;**

During this seminar, we’ll walk you through the sales process from start to finish so that you understand what to expect when it comes time to sell your home. Even if you’re not thinking of selling your home in the immediate future, this will still be a great, informative session to attend.

We’ll also **review the costs of selling a home** and introduce guest speakers to explain their roles in the process, including professional appraisers, home inspectors, mortgage lenders, and title companies. As a seller, why would a lender’s perspective benefit you? Well, lenders do control a big portion of the real estate process, and it’s helpful to know what your buyers will be going through at the same time so you can anticipate each new step of the process.

Lunch will be provided, and we also have a few door prizes to give away. After the class is over, there’ll be time for a question-and-answer period.

**Click**[**here**](https://www.alaskatopagent.com/search/ResidentialAdvancedSearch.aspx) **to sign up for the seminar.** You’d better hurry though—there were only 35 seats available, and around two-thirds of them are already full. First come, first serve\!&nbsp;

Once you register, someone from the team will contact you with all the information you’ll need. If you have any questions about the seminar or real estate in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to hear from you.
