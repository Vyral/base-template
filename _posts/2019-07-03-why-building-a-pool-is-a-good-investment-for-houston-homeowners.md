*Building a pool on your Houston property can be a great investment—here’s why.*

Our current economy is doing great, which means a lot of people from all over the country are moving to the Houston area. Since we’re in the middle of summer, many of these homebuyers want homes with pools, but there are only so many properties out there with pools already built into them. Thus, I’m fielding a lot of questions about pools lately.&nbsp;

Specifically, is building a pool a good investment?

If this were 10 years ago, my answer would have been no. My opinion has changed, though, and **I now think building a pool is a good investment**, depending on your home’s price range. You probably won’t get a 100% return on investment, but the important thing to remember in this regard is your lifestyle.&nbsp;

If you build a pool and you and your family get to enjoy it for however long you stay in the home (the average timeline is five to seven years), **it’s a good investment because you’re investing in your lifestyle.** Plus, you’ll still be able to recover most of your return on investment.

For example, let’s say you build a pool for $70,000 or $80,000, and over the course of seven years, you’re able to recover $60,000 of that cost. That’s $10,000 to $20,000 you’ve lost by investing in your family’s lifestyle, but during that time, your home’s equity is also going up.

Two of my clients built brand new pools and enjoyed them. I was able to sell both homes while not only recovering their money, but we also received multiples offers and sold for higher than asking price.

Two other clients of mine bought homes with existing pools and gained equity. Again, we sold both homes for above asking with multiple offers. This shows that market demand for pool homes is higher and it's no longer true that building a pool is a bad investment.

How do you pay for the pool in the first place, though? **We know lenders who offer special programs for buyers who plan on building a pool.** They’ll draft the cost of building the pool into your overall mortgage payment, so you’ll only need to make one payment.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this topic or you have a home with a pool that you’d like to sell, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. In the meantime, take a dip and escape the summer heat\!
