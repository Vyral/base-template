What's going on in the Mississippi gulf coast real estate market right now? How might it affect you as a homebuyer or seller moving forward this year?

On average, our market has six months worth of inventory, which technically puts us in a buyer's market. We've had a drastic decline in the last year going from 12 months to six months of inventory, however, and we're definitely trending toward a seller's market across the coast.

**Different areas and neighborhoods are in seller's markets, though.** For example, Ocean Springs has four months of inventory and Biloxi has five, putting them in seller's markets. The city of Gulfport had 10 months of inventory a year ago and is now down to six. Long Beach is experiencing the same thing.

As you can see, we're trending toward a seller's market.

<br>We must also consider interest rates when looking ahead in our market. The current rate is about 4.25% for a mortgage. These are great rates, but before the election, rates were even lower at about 3.375%, which were even more phenomenal. They're definitely trending upward. **Experts predict that rates will be at about 5% by the end of the year.**

What does this all mean if you plan on buying or selling a home? If you're buying a home, you'll have a lot less to choose from. Lower inventory means selection will be down, but it also means prices will go up. When you couple that with rising interest rates, you see why a lot of buyers are entering the market to lock in the lower rates while they still can.

This is further decreasing supply and lowering demand. Additionally, higher interest rates mean lower affordability. You'll pay more toward mortgage interest and less toward the principal payment.

When you see a great home come to market and you think it's the one you really want, other people are probably thinking the same thing. You'll probably find yourself up against multiple offers, so you want to come out strong.

If you're thinking about selling your house, you know that last year didn't look good. Homes were on the market longer, prices were lower, and sellers had to make multiple price cuts to sell. Today, however, **we're seeing fewer days on market and sellers getting top dollar for their house.**

If you have any questions about our market or you're thinking about buying or selling a home, give me a call or send me an email. I'd be glad to help!
