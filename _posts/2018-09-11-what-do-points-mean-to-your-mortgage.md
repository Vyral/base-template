Most people when they hear the word “points,” they associate it with a higher cost on their loans.

However, the reality is one point equals 1% of the loan amount. This means that ​if you are borrowing $100,000, paying one point would increase the closing cost by $1,000.

Yet most people don't realize that points can work in reverse, as well. ​In exchange for you agreeing to a higher interest rate, you can actually receive a lender credit which can go to lowering some of the closing costs. ​This is called premium pricing.

Whether or not you pay points or get lender credit depends on your particular situation. We can analyze that as part of a cost break-even analysis to determine which one is going to be appropriate for you given your holding period and your goals.

**Keep in mind, though, that one point equals roughly a .25% difference in interest rate.** Therefore, if you pay a point, you can expect the interest rate to be about a quarter of a percent lower. If you increase the rate by a point, or if you get a lender credit for a point, you can expect it would be about a quarter of a percent higher.

I don't want you to think that if you pay a point, your interest rates will be a full percent lower. This is not how it works. **It is just a rule of thumb.**
