What are my five tips that will help you slay your credit score in 2019?

First, shoot for perfection! By that, I mean **shoot for a score of 850.**

If 850 isn’t possible for you, **try shooting for 750**—the second-best score you can attain. Even at this mark, lenders will be fighting for your business, and they’ll give you a great rate. If you want to check your credit score regularly and get a better idea of what affects it, Credit Karma offers a free app you can download to your phone.&nbsp;

Next, **set up automatic payments for your monthly bills.** This includes your utilities as well as your credit card payments. If you’ve had trouble paying these bills on time in the past, this will help tremendously.

Also, **don’t be afraid of exploring refinancing options.** If your credit score isn’t where you want it to be but it’s good enough to get a loan, this is a useful strategy. However, I should stress that your refinancing rate should be at least two points lower than your original rate.

Finally, **watch your credit limit.** If you have a limit of $5,000, for example, you should only use up to 30% of it, and using less than that would be even better. However, don’t use 0% of your credit limit, because that’s a red flag in creditors’ eyes. When they look at your credit score, they want to make sure you know how to manage your money, and having a 0% balance has the opposite effect.
