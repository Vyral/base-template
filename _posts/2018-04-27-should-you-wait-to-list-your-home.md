I’m coming to you today from New York City’s Time Square to answer a question I’ve been asked a lot: Should sellers wait until June or July to put their homes on the market?

**My answer to that is no—put it on the market now.** There are a lot of buyers out there and we’re in a very competitive seller’s market. Interest rates are going up, so **the longer you wait, the less buying power people will have,** and therefore, the fewer potential buyers you’ll see.

You can use photos of your home from last summer or fall that you can use in your marketing. You don’t need to worry about the grass being green; just rake up fallen leaves and branches and get your yard looking nice.

The bottom line is that the market is really hot right now, so you want to take advantage of the fact that we’re in a sellers market. **Don’t wait to list.**
