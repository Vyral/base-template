Some birds that nested in a light fixture outside my house got too big to even get out, and it got me thinking about move-up buyers who have outgrown their home. Iâ€™ve notice this being a common problem for homeowners here in the Kansas City area.

My advice for you today is not to wait so long that your house becomes so small that you can't even get out.
