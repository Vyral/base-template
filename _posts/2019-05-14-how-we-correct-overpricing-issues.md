Recently, I told you about a seller who asked me, “Isn’t it too soon to change our price?” **Today I’m here to give you my answer, which is: It’s never too late to get top dollar.**

With this particular client, we met and realized the price they set was too high. We had to have a conversation about the benefits of reducing the price and why it was so important to the success of their home sale. **We eventually reduced the price by $100,000 and as soon as we did, the phone was ringing off the hook.**

Three real estate agents showed the property and two of them ended up writing offers. They fought over the property and the final offer came in at our new asking price and I was able to negotiate it between the old price and the new price. **This led to a quick, profitable, and great sale.**

If you have any questions for me about how to properly price your home or if you need my assistance in creating this kind of demand for your home when you list it, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
