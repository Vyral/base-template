{% include youtube.html %}Mindy and I often get asked about the state of today’s market. In fact, this is probably the No. 1 question we get from buyers and sellers alike.

Thankfully, our market here in Dallas is very healthy. We’ve had a strong seller’s market for years, but from looking at recent news **we may be seeing the market begin to cool off.**

Recently we had lunch with a big, local lender who told us that applications for mortgage purchase loans are down by 10%.

This information points to a potential balancing off coming into the market.

<br>But this doesn’t mean that you should panic if you’re a seller.&nbsp;**If you have a good Realtor who will be able to do the right kind of marketing, you can still command top dollar for your listing.**

And if you’re a buyer, this shift in the market could mean you’ll have more leverage so long as you know where to look.

Homes under $300,000 still have a lot of high demand and are likely to continue seeing multiple-offer situations. However, these conditions still aren’t quite as harsh as what we've seen in the last couple of years.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
