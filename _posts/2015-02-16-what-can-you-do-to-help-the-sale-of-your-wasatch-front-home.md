Hey everyone, welcome back to our blog. Today we want to discuss a few things you can do to prepare your home for sale in the market this spring on the Wasatch Front.

The first thing you have to do is change your mindset. Don't think of your home as a home anymore, think of it as a house, a building that you need to sell. If you treat your home sale more like a business transaction, it will make everything a lot easier.


The next thing you want to do is make sure you have an accurate picture of your home's value. The first step to doing that is clicking the link below, which will give you a good estimate of your home's value. The next step is giving us a call to come out and visit your home. This way we can get the most accurate value for your home, within 1% of what it's market value is.

Now comes pricing the home. Pricing your home with the market will make sure that more buyers see it, and it will sell quicker and for more money.

Finally, we want to see how mortgage rates can affect you as a home seller. For instance, if rates were to go up by 1%, we would lose the bottom 18% of first time home buyers, who are the people actually driving the market. Without them in the market, nobody else can move up, and the market becomes stalled.

We are currently at about 50% of the historical average for interest rates. Every time rates increase by just 1%, the cost of owning a home rises by 10%.

If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call or send us an email anytime. We'd love to set up a time to meet with you and discuss your real estate goals.
