If you are planning on putting your home on the market soon, chances are that you want it to sell quickly and for top dollar. Here are eight seemingly silly things that can actually screw up your home sale if you do not get them fixed beforehand:

**1. Visibly dangling cords from a mounted TV or entertainment set.** This is a pretty easy DIY fix—just run the cords behind the wall. If you would rather not try it yourself though, you can always hire a handyman. If you need and recommendations in this regard, just let me know.

**2. An unkept yard.** Curb appeal is critical in getting buyers into your home, so make sure your yard is mowed. While you are at it, make sure the rest of your property’s landscape looks good (bushes are trimmed, flower beds have fresh mulch, etc.).

**3. An outdated front door.** The door is the first thing a buyer will see when they walk up to your home, so make sure it makes a good first impression.

**4. Cobwebs.** Whether they are inside the house or scattered around the front porch, cobwebs are a sign of an unkempt house.

**5. Evidence of pets.** If you have pets, you do not want people to be aware of that, especially in photos. Remove all of the food bowls and dog beds in your home before taking any photos. Do the same before showings. The more you can make your home look like an animal does not live there, the better off you will be.

**6. Poor furniture arrangement.** You do not want buyers to walk into your home and think that it is crowded because of the way your furniture is placed. To make your furniture arrangement more functional for showings, have your home professionally staged.

**7. An overstuffed closet.** If you have too much stuff crammed into your closets, that will make them appear smaller than they are. Take out any clothes that will not be worn in the near future and put them in storage while your home is on the market. You will need to do this to prepare for moving anyway.

**8. An overfilled countertop.** Like your furniture, you want your countertop to be staged and look neat. There should not be too much on top of it, so remove any items from it that you do not use regularly.
