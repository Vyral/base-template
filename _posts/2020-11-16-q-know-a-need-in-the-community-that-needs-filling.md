&nbsp;

I know this year has been unlike any other year before it; we’ve all faced so many new challenges, and we all had to get used to living with ongoing uncertainty. Business owners seldom (if ever) account for global pandemics and lockdowns, so our only option was to be equal parts optimistic and adaptable. That has been especially true for the charities and nonprofits in our community, whose operations were put in serious jeopardy this year.

**One of our missions is to support the community.** I know that some people are out of work right now, and others are employed but still struggling financially. Nevertheless, we believe you are our community—you are family, and that’s never going to change. All the support you’ve shown our business in years past with referrals of your friends and family isn’t just something I acknowledge from time to time—it has literally changed the trajectory of my life and our business.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I want to pay it back this holiday season. **If you or anyone you know is struggling to put food on the table for Thanksgiving or Christmas, please send me a confidential message**; I’ll do everything in my power to make sure that this need is resolved. No one is perfect, and no one does anything alone. For example, when I sell a house, that “I” is misleading—there’s an entire team behind me that’s here to support your goals.&nbsp;

I’m so grateful for everything that everyone in this community has done for me. I want to help out in any way I can. Again, thank you for your continued support, and I wish you Happy Thanksgiving\! I look forward to hearing from you soon.
