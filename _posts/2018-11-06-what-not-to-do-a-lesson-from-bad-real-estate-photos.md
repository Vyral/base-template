  Alone, carpet in the bathroom is a turn-off for buyers, but this photo really
  takes it over the top: They not only have a toilet, but also a bidet and a

To fully understand what I mean for today’s topic of bad real estate photos, follow along in the video above, or use the timestamps I’ve provided below to navigate the video at your leisure:

* **0:20—Distracting colors on the walls.** Lurid wallpaper or paint can make a room look even smaller. To counter that effect, use lighter, more neutral colors.
* **0:50—Mirrors above the bed.** This look reminds me of the first time that I went to the Tropicana Hotel; I’d recommend something more neutral and less reminiscent of Las Vegas.
* **1:20—Upside down photos.** I was initially very confused about this photo; how and why did the homeowner manage to install an elevated washing machine? Then I realize they had uploaded the photo to the MLS upside down. You only get one chance to make a first impression, so double-check your photos before making this mistake.
* **1:45—This photo looks like every horror movie I’ve ever seen** was filmed here. To make it less creepy, I’d move the sparing items on the right and showcase the floor to brighten it up.
* **2:20—Carpet in the bathroom.** Alone, carpet in the bathroom is a turn-off for buyers, but this photo really takes it over the top: They not only have a toilet, but also a bidet and a sitting chair all in the same bathroom. This photo should have focused on the countertops and less on the urinal in the middle of the room.
* **2:50—A woodsy, surf-and-turf disaster.** Instead of focusing on the mounted deer head, marlin, and monkey, the photographer should have focused on the room, instead of the just the corner in which this odd arrangement of mounts. If taken from a different angle, the photo could have shown off the room’s size or flow and helped a potential buyer appreciate the space more.

I always tell my sellers that you should always want to make sure the home speaks to as many buyers as possible. The sound of one tree falling is always going to be louder than a thousand trees growing, so eliminate those things that may turn people off and focus on things that will appeal to more people.

If you have any questions on home staging or about how to make your home appeal to a wider audience, please feel free to reach out to me.
