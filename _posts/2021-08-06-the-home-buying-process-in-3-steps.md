Today we're going over the three steps of the home-buying process. Most people want to jump straight to the house-hunting stage, but&nbsp; if you don't know what you're approved for, you’re ripe for disappointment. Here are the three steps to buying a home in order.

**1\. Financing.** If you can afford to use cash, that’s obviously best, but a lot of people need a mortgage to purchase a home. Once you have your pre-approval letter from a lender in hand, it’s time for the next step.

**2\. House Hunting.** We set up your house search based on what you’re looking for and have results come directly to your email. Once we find some good houses, we’ll view them, make offers, and get a contract accepted.

**3\. Negotiating.** Picking a good agent is really important because negotiating deals in this market is difficult.

We have a team that helps you from the beginning to the end of the process, including the appraisal and home inspection phases. If you have any questions or are looking to buy a house right now, please reach out to us via phone or email and let's have a conversation.
