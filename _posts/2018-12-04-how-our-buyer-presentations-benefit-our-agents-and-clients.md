During one of our buyer presentations, we begin by walking buyers through the steps of buying a home.&nbsp;

First, they need to qualify financially. Not everyone needs a mortgage, but most people do, so we put them in contact with a good loan officer we know and trust. We’ll also skip covering all the different mortgage possibilities, since they’ll only care about a mortgage that fits their unique situation.&nbsp;

We can also provide them a list of vendors for various other services they’ll need throughout the process, like title companies, home inspectors, decorators, workmen, window installers, and more.&nbsp;

In addition to all the things we can help them with, the Movers Team is also interested in the things we can’t help with. We won’t guide them to a certain neighborhood; rather, we want to listen to what their wants and needs are. We’ll ask them about certain things you’re looking for:

* How many stories do you need?
* What kind of schools do you want to be near?
* Where do you need the master bedroom to be?

As a homebuyer, we’ll treat them as though they’re another agent sitting on the other side of the table. We have a prepared PowerPoint to go through, customized to each agent’s style, which will cover what the buyer will need to remember and ask when it comes time to go look at houses. Once we’re sure they’re qualified, we’ll then help them set appointments to view houses.&nbsp;

All in all, the buyer presentation should take only about 15 minutes to an hour, depending on the kind of person you are. Some people are readers who like to take their time to analyze the smallest of details, and some are seers and doers who get bored with the details and want to get out and see and interact with properties.

We give every person an opportunity to sign a buyer agreement with us, and we don’t show properties without having signed one. This is not a pastime for us; we know exactly what we’re doing, how to save their time, how to find the best mortgage rates, and how to maximize their experience in general.&nbsp;

We want buyers who are serious about using our services, so we ask for a commitment in the form of a buyer agreement. We value our agents’ time as well, so we’d rather not have them out showing homes to people for six months if the buyer isn’t serious. The buyer agreement, by the way, goes two ways—we are obligated to stay on this project until it expires or we find them a house. The Movers Team doesn’t take that lightly.

Overall, buyer presentations are crucial to our business. We ask that our agents have a minimum of three buyer appointments each week and that they sign up two of those three so that they’ll have two new buyers each and every week. Once you sell that buyer a house, you hand it over to our transaction manager and go on to sell another house. You don’t have to take care of the details.

If ours sounds like the kind of team you’re looking to join, we’re looking for you, as well. Reach out to us and let’s have a conversation about making you the newest member of Movers Real Estate. Mind you, you do have to work; we’re not looking a three-hours-a-day agent. We want you to have a great income, and we can provide you the leads, guidance, and training to make that happen for you. Hope to hear from you soon!
