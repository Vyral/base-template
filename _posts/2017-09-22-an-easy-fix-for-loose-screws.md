A long time ago, my dad taught me a quick, cheap, easy fix for loose screws that never fails.

All you need to apply this fix are Elmer’s glue and a few toothpicks. Just squirt a little Elmer’s glue into the hole, jam the toothpicks in, and break them off. If you put your screw in after that, it’ll fit just like new.

**The first person who emails me and tells me they tried this tip and it worked will receive a $20 gift card to Lowe’s.**

In the meantime, if you have any questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in the Kansas City market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help!
