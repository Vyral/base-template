The first step in getting a true evaluation of your home’s value is to look online. There are several different websites that can help you find an accurate estimation, **with one notable example being**[**www.TheMylesGroup.net**](http://www.themylesgroup.net)**.** There, simply click on the “Know Your Home’s Worth” button on the home page.

After you see the ranges of the values that these various websites will provide you, I encourage you to **contact a real estate professional who can come to your home and do a free comparative market analysis** with you. A CMA can give you a pinpoint value of your home based on what’s going on in the market, the conditions of the neighborhood, and of course, the condition of your home.

For more information on how to get a free comparative market analysis, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
