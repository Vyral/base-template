We’re doing a little bit of exploring today.

Defuniak Springs is a beautiful area with tons of countryside, and it’s only an hour north of the beach.

There are a lot of great places to explore in Northwest Florida and Defuniak is definitely one of those areas. Downtown Defuniak Springs has a charming, small-town feel, and was recently rated one of the best small towns in the southeast.

I highly recommend that you get out, explore a bit, and see the beauty that Northwest Florida has to offer.

Check out the video above to see more of Defuniak Springs.

If you have any real estate questions, I would be happy to help you!
