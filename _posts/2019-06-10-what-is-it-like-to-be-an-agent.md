Often at the end of a particularly difficult deal, clients will ask me, “How do you do it?” Well, the more I think about it, this is an interesting question.&nbsp;

**And now that I’ve taken some time to consider my answer, it’s really quite simple: I do this because I love helping people.** Buying or selling a home is much more than just a simple, run-of-the-mill business transaction. There’s a lot of emotion that goes along with it. And, as an agent, I know that I need to play a much greater role than just that of a salesperson. I have to be someone who they can trust to guide them through a massive step in their life.&nbsp;

When you are a real estate agent, being communicative, patient, and open-minded is a must. Buyers and sellers give their agents a window into some very personal aspects of their lives, so having these qualities is essential. Buyers and sellers deserve to know that their agent will keep private matters private. Honesty, confidentiality, and respect are very important.&nbsp;

**With that said, though, I also find it important to be honest even when it’s uncomfortable.&nbsp;**

At the end of the day, the job of an agent is often much more than just a job. And, personally, I wouldn’t have it any other way.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like to speak in greater detail on this topic, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
