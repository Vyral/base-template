Today I’m finishing my three-part series on the realities of being a Realtor. Let’s pick up where we left off:

* **This is not an easy job**. In fact, it will probably be the most challenging job you’ve ever had. There’s a lot of emotional stress because the stakes are so large. In some industries, you can just punch in and punch out. As an agent running your own business, you’ll quickly discover there is no off button. Agents who succeed in the long term spend a massive amount of time on the front end, and there is no shortcut.<br><br>Even once a practice is up and running, a lot of work goes into keeping it working. You’ll also need to learn a wide array of skills, such as prospecting, managing client expectations, marketing, crisis management, counseling, and so much more.
* **Successful agents master fundamentals**. They rely on and execute scripts flawlessly to succeed. This requires hours of practice, role-play, and dozens of hours on the phone. It’s dull, laborious work punctuated only by the occasional insult, rude hang-up, and odd family friend who’s working with another agent instead.&nbsp;

* **You will not be your own boss**. Many choose to become Realtors because someone told them they could be their own boss. This is one of the cruelest cons in the business. As an agent, every client is your boss. The more you work with, the more bosses you have. If you’re working with a couple, you might have two bosses for a single transaction. Your clients are hiring you to perform a service, so they will have hopes, dreams, and expectations of you.
* **Your schedule will not be as flexible as you think**. Many get into real estate because they think it will give them the freedom and flexibility they could never have in a nine-to-five job. Yes, you might be able to attend pre-school graduations and other events in the middle of the day. However, you will also be on call round the clock. You will work weekends, meet clients in the evenings, and have to bolt from your home to deal with emergencies. True flexibility and freedom only come years down the road.
* **Not every brokerage is a good fit for new agents**. Some would start best on a large team, like mine, instead of fending for themselves in the office agent pool. Those who want to be solo agents should look for offices that resonate with their values and methods. Virtual brokerages may not be a good match for those who want an active, collaborative environment.&nbsp;

I’ve been a Realtor for about eight years. I’ve seen ups, downs, and plenty of bizarre things. I’ve worked through the foreclosure crisis and the pandemic and, despite it all, I’ve beaten the odds. In retrospect, it’s probably a good thing my recruiter didn’t explain the highs and lows of the business because I may never have experienced what has become a truly fantastic career.&nbsp;

Call, text, or email me if you’d like to set up a free, no-obligation consultation to review your goals and set up a one-page business plan. My team and I would love to hear from you.
