Everyone wants to renovate, and, now more than ever, they want to do it themselves. Big-ticket remodeling activity is growing at its fastest pace in four years.

All this remodeling is good for the economy and, presumably, for individuals’ home equity. Yet problems can arise when homeowners take on tasks themselves without proper preparation or training. Keeping renovations on track is simple if you know what to look out for.

**1. Think it through.** Are you overestimating your skills? Assuming projects are as easy as they appear on TV is a recipe for disaster. Chances are, you’ll either end up calling a professional to finish what you started or, worse, have to start all over. You can avoid such mistakes by taking on smaller tasks first. Test your skills and patience before trying out a larger renovation.

**2. Think about your budget.** Underestimating your budget can be another critical mistake. The last thing you want is to encounter a problem that will require you to make alternate plans or spend more than you’ve set aside. Experts recommend adding 20% on top of your anticipated budget. And it may be a good idea to add even more of a cushion if you aren’t very experienced with such projects.

**3. Think about your timeline.** Homeowners taking on their own renovations can wildly underestimate the amount of time a project will take. Just because you have two weeks to completely renovate your kitchen before your in-laws are in town doesn’t mean the project will happen within that time frame. So make sure you do your research and listen to professional opinions. Adequate preparation can save yourself a lot of headaches during any renovation project.
