Today I’m joined by Shane Hoffman of Edina Realty Mortgage to talk about a great new program they’re offering called the Edina Buyer Advantage

How does it work? First, **it allows you to go through the underwriting process ahead of time—before you even have a property under contract.** You then come out of this process with a Buyer Advantage Certificate, which is basically a commitment letter verifying that you’re qualified to buy.

With this program, you can also lock in your interest rate for 90 days and offer a guarantee of $12,500 to the seller of your prospective home if you don’t close on time.&nbsp;

As a Realtor, I can tell you that **this program is a great way to write an offer.** If you’re a seller, you also can’t do much better than an offer backed by this program.&nbsp;

If you have any more questions about this program, you can give Shane a call at (952) 484-2319.

As always, if you have any other real estate questions for me, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.&nbsp;
