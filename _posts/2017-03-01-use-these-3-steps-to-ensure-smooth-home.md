If you’re thinking about buying your first home in 2017, make sure you do these three things first.

**Want to buy a home?** <a href="http://www.valeriehunterkelly.com/search/residentialadvancedsearch.aspx" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale</a>

If you’re looking to buy your first home in 2017, there are a few steps you should take in preparation. I’ll go over those today.

First, **you need to hire the right real estate agent.** You might run into some uncomfortable situations if you work with a family member or a friend, so I recommend choosing an experienced agent who’s only objective is to represent your home purchase. Also, an experienced agent can help you find homes that might not even be listed on the market. Furthermore, the right agent is going to be able to negotiate in your favor to ensure you get the best deal on a home.

Second, **don’t be afraid to talk to multiple lenders.** Some lenders’ rates might be better than others, or they might match each other. Either way, talking to multiple lenders can only benefit you. Also, if you are going to get a VA loan, make sure the lender you choose is experienced in dealing with that specific type of loan.

Last but not least, **mind your credit.** Credit scores are incredibly important because a lender is going to base the interest rate you get for your mortgage off them. There are also going to be credit checks when you go to put insurance on your home.

There are a few other tips, so if you would like to hear about them or if you have any other real estate related questions, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I would be more than happy to help.
