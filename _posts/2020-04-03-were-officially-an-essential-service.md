<p style="text-align:center"><em>I’m giving you an update on a market that, despite existing in unprecedented circumstances, is still moving.</em></p>

Let’s take time to thank all of our nurses, doctors, scientists, first responders, and officials on the frontlines of this global pandemic who are working tirelessly. As of April 1, the governor of Arizona issued a stay-in-place order; real estate has been deemed an essential industry, so we’re continuing to function, albeit with different rules to heighten safety. We started March with about 450 sales, and in the last week of the month we saw over 300 sales. People are still buying and selling—largely because they have to.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about the health of the market, or if you’re interested in buying or selling a home soon but aren’t sure how to proceed in these times, reach out to us. We’re always here to help and look forward to hearing from you.&nbsp;
