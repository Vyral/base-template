One of the common queries we receive from property owners pertains to whether we require tenants to have renters insurance. Today, I'll clarify this requirement, and what it entails for both tenants and property owners

**The short answer is yes; we do require it upon their occupancy.** When they take possession of the property, we provide them with a comprehensive list, including their rent share and the necessity of obtaining renters insurance.

For compliance, we request a copy of the renter’s insurance policy. Primarily, renters insurance covers the tenant's actions but not the owner's. Should you need further clarification on renters insurance, we're available to elaborate on its coverage over the phone.

If you have additional inquiries, please call or email us. We look forward to speaking with you soon.
