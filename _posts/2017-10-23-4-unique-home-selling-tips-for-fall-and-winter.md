Now that the temperature has dropped a bit, we’ll start seeing the leaves change colors and pumpkin spice flavoring everywhere. With fall color and pumpkin so prominent this year, you might be tempted to load your home up with both. However, if you’re trying to sell your home, a little discretion will go a long way. Here are some things to remember:

**1.) Pay attention to your curb appeal.**A few tasteful choices here and there is all you need to get the maximum impact on buyers. Make sure that fall leaves haven’t taken a toll on your yard. If they have, clean them up.

**2.) Go easy on the Halloween gore.**Everyone loves Halloween decorations, but not everyone loves the bloody or gory kind of decorations. Even if you loved the latest Stephen King movie, decorating your home with clowns is going to distract buyers. Keep it simple and traditional as to not scare away any of them.

**3.) Let in the light.** Open those blinds and make sure your windows are sparkly when trying to sell your home. Especially with shorter days, you have to let the light in. Maximizing your natural light will make the home look larger.

**4.) Make your home warm and inviting.**Put a few plush throws around the beds and couches. If you’re an overachiever, bake some cookies and leave them on the counter with a nice note welcoming potential buyers to partake. They will stay longer and it will make a great impression.
