We are so appreciative of the support that you have shown us over the years. We love having you as clients, and we’d love to catch up with you and your family.

Join us at Stonehaus on April 27 from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. for coffee or tea. Bring the whole family along (even the furry ones)\!

You can learn more about the event [here](https://www.evite.com/event/026A77DDN56QSYUCQEPJJNUC2Z37GM/rsvp?utm_source=NA&amp;utm_medium=sharable_invite&amp;utm_campaign=send_sharable_link){: target="_blank"}, where you can also RSVP so that we make sure we have enough drinks to go around. We’ll also be collecting peanut butter and jelly supplies for the Manna Food Bank. Look for the PB&J balloons\!&nbsp;

We hope to see you there\!
