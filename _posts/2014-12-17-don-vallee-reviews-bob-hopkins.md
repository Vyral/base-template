"When we were searching for a home with Don, we still were trying to figure out whether we wanted to live in Portland or in the Tucson area. After a while we decided to live in Tucson but we were still living in Portland so when we were doing some remodeling on the home we relied on Don to take measurements and other things of that nature. He was very willing to step up and provide very accurate information for us. The whole relationship was cooperative, collegial and it was one of the easiest home buys that weâ€™ve encountered!"<br /><br /><b>-Bob Hopkins, Home Buyer</b>
