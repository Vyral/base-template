Here in Minnesota, most people signal market off-peak seasons once the weather turns cold, school starts, or the holiday season begins. **If you’re putting your home on the market during this time, there are four tips you need to follow.**

First, stage for the season. Whether it’s Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Valentine’s Day, stage your house with the appropriate decorations in mind.

Second, take photographs of your home during the summer. Even if you plan on listing during the winter, having a nice, green shot of your yard to use for supplemental purposes is a nice touch.

Third, come out of the gate competitively in terms of price, because the window of time before the new year period is limited.

Lastly, **have patience.&nbsp;**There are typically fewer buyers out and about during an off-peak market, but those who do come out tend to be more serious about buying.

If you have any questions about selling in an off-peak market, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’d be glad to help you.
