Everyone wants to know what their home is worth, but how can you find this out? This is a great question. Actually, there are a few ways to do this.

One of the best ways to do this is to hire an appraiser. My team and I know and trust a few appraisers who we would be happy to recommend to you.

There are two important things you must consider when it comes to choosing an appraiser, though. **First, appraisers don’t consider the saleability of your home. &nbsp;**

Neither Realtors nor appraisers price your home according to the market. Instead, appraisers are justifying the value for either legal purposes or for you to get an appropriate loan.

When appraisals are done for these reasons it doesn’t actually give you a real value, it just justifies a target value.

Recently the most popular way to find value is by looking online. Websites like Trulia are Zillow are commonly used for this purpose. Any of the websites out there are basically the same.

Despite the popularity of this method, these websites simply don’t work that well. I wouldn’t put any credence in what they tell you about value. Their information is neither updated or accurate. **Zillow has even claimed that their online estimates are generally 8% off.** On top of that, they’ve recently been sued for violating consumer protection laws.

But the least-accurate option out there is checking the tax assessment. Very little time is put into these, which means they are way off.

Truthfully, **the best option you have is to consult with an expert like myself.**Real estate agents who study homes and their prices every day are going to be much more reliable than other methods of finding value.

I’ve personally helped people determine the value of their property thousands of times in my career.

Finally, I’ve got a great opportunity. We have a system designed to send people monthly updates on what’s coming onto the market. If you’d like for us to give you access to this, we would be more than happy to plug you into the system.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
