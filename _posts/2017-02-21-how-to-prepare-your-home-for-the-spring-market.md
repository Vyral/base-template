How can you get your home ready to sell in the upcoming spring market?

Today I’m joined by Michelle Frazier, one of our great listing specialists, to answer that question for you. Over the last couple years, the spring market has started earlier and earlier for us. During the latter part of February, we tend to see listings really pick up. Buyers are already out there trying to find houses, so the sooner you can list your house, the sooner it should sell.

Starting with the interior, you must **neutralize and depersonalize your space as much as you can.**Buyers want to be able to walk into a house and visualize themselves there, so start decluttering now and move all items you don’t need into storage. You want people to see your home’s space, and collections of personal items can distract them from doing that. As an added bonus, pictures always look better when you have less clutter in the way.

Now would also be a good time to **touch up any areas that need a new paint job.** A fresh coat of paint goes a long way in making a buyer feel like your house is move-in ready. Stick with neutral colors (greys, tans, etc.) that buyers won’t notice in a negative way when they’re visualizing how to make your home theirs after you’re gone.

Moving on to the exterior of your home, you need to **spruce up the space around the outside and make that look clean as well.** First impressions make a huge difference in buyers’ minds, and those first eight seconds when they step out of their car and walk up to your door are crucial.

If you didn’t have time in the fall to to cut back any overgrown bushes or shrubs or store away any lawn ornaments, now’s the time to do it. It also wouldn’t hurt to power-wash the whole exterior of your home to get rid of the cobwebs and leftover leaves. I also always advise my clients to give their front door a fresh coat of paint, if need be.

Even though all of these tasks seem like no-brainers, taking care of them conveys to buyers that you care about your house and take pride in its condition.

If you’re not sure what you should do with your space or what to focus on in terms of decluttering or making repairs, **we can always come to your home and do a complimentary analysis of your space.** This will give you an idea of what your home might be worth in this market and what you should work on before listing it. If you’re going to invest money, let us help you invest that money.

If you have any more questions about how to get your home ready for the spring market, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us so we can lend you a helping hand. We look forward to speaking with you.
