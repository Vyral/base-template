How much should your down payment be when buying a home?

Let’s say you don’t have 20% to put down. While there are many benefits of having equity in the home, that doesn’t mean you’re out of the running to buy a home. There are many options out there that require little to nothing down.

**One of those options is an FHA loan.** The minimum down payment requirement for this is 3.5%. Loan amounts vary by county, so if you’d like more information on a home you’re looking at, feel free to give us a call so we can let you know if that property is within range for you to purchase through an FHA loan. We also offer a program called the Chenoa Fund where we can offer you that 3.5% as a gift.

Another popular option is a conventional mortgage with as little as 3% down. In this case, the loan amount limit is $424,100, but that limit can stretch if the property in question is a multi-family property. This is a great alternative to the high-priced FHA loan because it allows you to get rid of the private mortgage insurance once you receive 20% equity in the home. To qualify, though, you have to be in the home for at least 24 months.

**For 0% financing, there are two options.** The first is a VA loan, which is only for veterans of the armed forces. The second is the USDA loan, which is guaranteed through the US Department of Agriculture. With the USDA loan, the home has to be located within designated rural areas
