How do you make a competitive offer when you are going against cash buyers? While a lot of the market is not paying cash, there are some people who are. And, in a crazy market like we have today, you may actually be competing against a cash buyer for the home you are putting an offer in on with your loan.

You are not out of luck, though. I have a few options for you which will help you be competitive and win your dream home.

**1. Provide a level of comfort to the seller.** If you are comfortable with it, show them your bank statements and credit scores to prove that you have your finances in order. They will know you have quite a bit of cash if you are putting 20% down on a loan.

**2. Consider not doing an inspection.** You always have the right to an inspection. But, if you are comfortable with not doing an inspection because you are buying as-is anyway, it could be huge for the seller to not have to deal with that. Inspections are a source of contention which could be avoided.

**3. Have all the documentation ready for your lender.** This way, all they need is a contract from you and an appraisal. This will cut down the process tremendously.

**4. How quickly can the lender work the appraisal?** When you are supplying the documentation, ask the lender if they can order an appraisal the day they have the address. Let the seller know this so they can have a quicker closing.

**5. Cash buyers think they should get a discount since they are spending cash.** This is not necessarily true. You could finance a little more to pay the seller more and the difference could only be $15 to $20 per month. The seller will choose you because you are providing more.

**6. Provide a letter about yourself.** If you write a personal letter about your family, it touches the sellerâ€™s heart. They know they are selling the home to someone who will love it as opposed to an investor, which means a lot to a seller.

If you have any questions about any of this or about buying or selling, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
