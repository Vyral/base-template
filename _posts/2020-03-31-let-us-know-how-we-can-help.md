Are you all doing well? It’s important to all of us at The Wolek Group that we connect with our friends, family, and community to make sure you’re safe and that we’re providing you with all the resources we possibly can. **If you need anything at all, please reach out to us.** We’ve already sent you helpful resources, but we want to be doubly sure you have everything you need.&nbsp;

We have a Facebook page called **[Tulsa Looks Good on You](https://www.facebook.com/tulsalooksgoodonyou/){: target="_blank"}**, which was created to share all the wonderful things Tulsa has to offer, and during this time we’re being extremely deliberate about adding helpful things to it to assist our community. We look forward to seeing you soon and giving you a real hug or handshake—for now, it’s virtual.&nbsp;

We do want you to know we’re still doing business. People are still buying and selling homes. We’re watching the numbers every day, and believe it or not, with interest rates still low, there is plenty of activity. For those that need to buy or sell, we’re taking extra steps to be cautious during this health crisis. For example, **we’re conducting tons of virtual open houses, home tours, and appointments via Zoom** **and FaceTime.** Still seeing each other sometimes is critical during this distancing period.

If you have questions or need anything, please contact us via phone or email. We look forward to seeing and talking with you soon.
