**What most real estate agents don’t want you to know, or won't admit, is that open houses are not an effective means of selling your home.** The internet is now a 24/7 virtual open house and has replaced the necessity of opening your personal residence to uninvited strangers. Many agents will use your house to find new clients rather than focus on selling the house they are standing in for three hours.

Open houses are also a little risky. You have strangers pouring into your home, and there is no way to make sure that those people are qualified buyers that are interested in buying your home. We’re not checking IDs at the door, and we cannot be everywhere at once. People have had things stolen at open houses, and it’s just an unfortunate fact of life.

There are more effective ways of exposing your home to multitudes of prospective buyers than an open house. **We want pre-approved buyers that are looking to purchase a home within 90 days.** Most buyers you find at an open house are 6 to 12 months away from purchasing a home.

The fact of the matter is that open houses simply aren’t necessary to sell your home. Internet marketing has taken over that aspect of the real estate industry. If you’d like to know how we market your home to thousands of qualified buyers, please contact me.
