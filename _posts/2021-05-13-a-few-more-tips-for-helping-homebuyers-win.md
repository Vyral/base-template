<center><em>Here are a few additional tips to help your homebuyer clients win.</em></center>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

The last few weeks, we’ve been talking about how to win for your buyers in this environment by pulling your lenders into the picture. Today we’re going to talk about two important pieces of advice you need to win in this competitive market:

{% include pullquote.html %}

**1\. Have your buyers write a letter to the seller.** A lot of people advocate against this, but as long as you are compliant with fair housing laws, that letter is very good and super effective.

**2\. Have your buyers send a video.** You could do this in place of a letter or in addition to it. Have your client explain why they love the home so much and establish an emotional connection. A recent client of ours won a home because of this. They weren’t nearly the highest offer.

**A bonus tip:** You could also have your clients drop by after-hours with some cookies and apologize to the seller for being so over the top.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me about helping buyers in this competitive market or anything else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
