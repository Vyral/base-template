It’s Halloween time once again\! We’re so excited to announce our annual Colemere Realty Associates Pumpkins Against Hunger event. We look forward to seeing you on **October 6 from 4:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. at Sandy Lone Peak Park.** Make sure to come and join us for this fun occasion\!

We’ll have refreshments, face painting, kids’ activities, prize drawings, and the best part—pumpkin carving. We’ll clean them, so you don’t have to worry about the mess and can just focus on carving\! You can even bring it home with you.&nbsp;

Register by clicking on the link below, so we know you’re coming and can reserve you a pumpkin. Please also bring a can of food for the food bank. We love to give back at this time of the year.&nbsp;

If you need more details about the event or have any real estate questions, don’t hesitate to call or email us. We’d love to connect with you\!
