All of us at The Sokoler Team want to wish you a happy, healthy, safe, and exciting Thanksgiving\!&nbsp;

Our special thanks to our healthcare workers and first responders who are enduring tremendous obstacles as we all deal with COVID 19\!&nbsp;

Over the past years, we have met some wonderful people, and weâ€™re proud to have helped so many reach their real estate goals over the years.

Watch our video to see some of our clients who signed up for our Thanksgiving Pie giveaway yesterday. Our special thanks to our Thanksgiving partners, Swan Financial, Home Team Inspections, Limestone Title, and Home Warranty of America. We would not be number 1 in Louisville without the support of all our clients and partners.

If you need us, we are always here for you\!&nbsp;

Happy Thanksgiving.
