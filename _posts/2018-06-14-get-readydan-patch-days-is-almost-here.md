Dan Patch Days is coming up here in Savage, and we wanted to fill you in on all the details.

**The festival starts on Thursday, June 21 and runs until Sunday, June 24.** There will be plenty of food, live bands, and lots of entertainment. 

On Saturday, there will be a parade in downtown Savage at 11 a.m., and we’ll be in attendance. On Sunday, the festival will wrap things up with a pancake breakfast at the Savage Fire Station, which is one of our favorite events.
