Today’s topic is a little different. Instead of talking about real estate, we wanted to bring you a different kind of message.

A lot of what we do when it comes to education involves our personal development. A big part of that is our coach, Erik Hatch. One of the most important things he has taught us is the importance of being memorable and standing out to other people.

Maya Angelou once said, “*I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel*.” **If you’re trying to leave a legacy or leave a mark behind, this is an important thing to remember**.

Being remarkable is something that we’ve been thinking about a lot recently. We want to be more remarkable each day, and we’re putting systems in place to do that.

Every day this week, for example, Greg has been focusing on complimenting those in the gym who have made progress and letting them know he’s proud of them. **It’s important to realize that being remarkable and making an impact doesn’t need to be a big to-do**. It can simply be a small act of random kindness. Those kinds of things change the world.

Nick actually schedules his randomness and tries to do something random and nice for as many people as he can when it comes up in his calendar. In our world, we have busy schedules and full calendars, but when we put little time blocks in our calendar for “random” kindness, it puts us in the right mood to be selfless. **Making a difference in someone else’s world is the definition of being remarkable and standing out**.

Think about some ways that you can be remarkable in other peoples’ worlds. Let us know what you are doing to make a difference.

If you have any questions for us about being remarkable or about anything related to real estate in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.
