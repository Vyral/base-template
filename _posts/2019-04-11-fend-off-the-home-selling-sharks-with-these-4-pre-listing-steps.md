<p style="text-align: center;"><em>These tips are valuable information. How valuable? It could mean $21,000.</em></p>

As promised, I’m revealing how I sold a home for $21,000 over the listing price in just two hours and 20 minutes!&nbsp;

How was I able to pull this off? Well, it’s all outlined in my book, “Home Selling Sharks,” so today I’ll cite specific passages that pertain to the pre-listing process. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Before anything else, the trick is to **start earlier than you think.** Much like Noah with the ark, prepare for the inevitable moment when the figurative flood comes. I should mention, though, that it takes more than a few months—to sell a home this quickly and secure top dollar takes a year’s worth of preparation or more.&nbsp;

From there:&nbsp;

**1. Hire a marketing and negotiation expert.** This isn’t me telling you to find a Realtor; rather, find someone with an expert understanding of marketing and negotiation and who happens to have a real estate license. In my book, I liken not having an expert on your side to letting the so-called sharks take bites out of your sale price, which is to say you could lose out on thousands of dollars. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>**2. Get a pre-inspection done on the home.** A pre-inspection can actually zero out your repair costs. Acting preemptively with inspections is a surefire way to sell your home for $21,000 above the listing price in two hours and 20 minutes.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>**3. Showcase your home by doing a professional photo shoot.** A picture is worth a thousand words, and the first place buyers will turn to is the internet, so showing your home in a professional way and in its best light online is key.

**4. Do a room-by-room review.** Going from one room to the next, assess what improvements you could make so your home will jump out at a buyer. If a particular room could use new paint, get a sense of what the cost will be, but never proceed without first knowing what costs you’ll incur.&nbsp;

<br>Once you’ve checked off these four items, you can market your home online for all to see until it’s time for the next step, which I’ll cover in a future video. If you’d like to learn about this process in greater detail, give me a call at 215-576-8666. I’d be happy to give you a copy of my book, “Home Selling Sharks,” or you can also pick it up on Amazon.&nbsp;

Or if you’d like a free copy personally signed by me, you’re welcome to come to my book signing at Abington Free Library on Saturday, April 27, between 9:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. I look forward to seeing you there!&nbsp;
