What’s actually going on in the San Fernando Valley right now? We’re going to look at that in detail today.

There have been a lot of changes in the marketplace lately, so I wanted to give you an update on what’s actually going on right now. My friend Mark joined me to ask some questions about the current real estate market and what buyers and sellers can expect from the current shift that we’re seeing. **Here is an outline of what we discussed, with timestamps so you can skip ahead to the section(s) that interest you most:**

00:35- What’s actually going on in the market right now?&nbsp;<br>2:00- The current state of inventory levels in the San Fernando Valley.<br>3:35- How the market looks right now from a buyer’s point of view.<br>6:55- Why are people moving to the San Fernando Valley in huge numbers right now?<br>8:30- A few things that potential home sellers should be aware of right now.<br>9:23- The best way to find out if the time is right for you to buy and/or sell a home.

If you have any other questions for me in the meantime about the current market or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
