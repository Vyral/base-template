  I sometimes hear stories of agents taking on massive workloads all at once.
  They boast about things like knocking on 500 doors in a single day, but is
  that kind of action really good for one’s real estate career? To tell the
  truth, it really isn’t. In fact, this kind of massive action is one of the
  biggest mistakes an agent can make in their career. To learn more about why,
  and what agents should be doing instead, watch this short video.

There’s no doubt that in conversations between other agents, you’ve heard people advise one another to take massive action. However, **taking massive action may be one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your real estate career.**

When agents say they’re going to make 500 calls in a single day, build 12 landing pages, or knock on hundreds of doors, all I hear is that this agent lacks discipline. This agent is rolling from one crisis to another, failing to take action on a consistent basis, and therefore getting way behind on the activities required by their business plan.

Agents who have true success in this business do so not by piling on massive action into a single day, but by **consistently following the daily duties required by their business plan.**

This brings to mind the story of the tortoise and the hare. Remember: slow and steady wins the race. It’s true in children’s stories, and it’s true in real estate sales.
