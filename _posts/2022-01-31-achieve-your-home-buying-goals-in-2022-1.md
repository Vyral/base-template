Do you have home-buying goals? Today I want to share my advice on how you can reach these goals this year:

**1\. Work on your credit score.** 640 is the magic number. If your score is below that, your interest rate could suffer. There are plenty of ways to raise your score, so if you haven’t hit this magic number, speak with a mortgage specialist to see what you can do.&nbsp;

**2\. Start working on your down payment immediately.** You might have to sacrifice some luxuries to save for a down payment, but it’s important to put a substantial amount down to lower your monthly payment. If you’re a first-time homebuyer, you probably only have to put 3% or 7% down. For other buyers, you’ll need at least 7.5% or 13%. One of the biggest misconceptions in real estate is that you need 20% down; it’s just not true. If you meet the requirements I laid out above, you should be fine. \\

**3\. Get pre-approved.** Being pre-approved means you’ve talked to a mortgage lender, and they’ve thoroughly checked your financial situation. Not only does this put sellers’ minds at ease, but it will tell you exactly how much you qualify for. There’s no point in looking at a $400,000 home if you can’t afford it, and you won’t know if you can or not until you get pre-approved. As a heads up, your lender will ask for things like pay stubs, tax returns, and other important documents. Make sure you have everything you need so that pre-approval goes smoothly.&nbsp;

**4\. Talk to a real estate professional.** When you buy a home, you need to work with someone who gives you all the information you need to make the best decision for you. Yes, you can work with your friends or family, but when you’re buying something as large as a home, wouldn’t you rather work with someone experienced?
