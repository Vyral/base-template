The spring market is upon us, which means the nice weather is here and so are the buyers. &nbsp;

There are a lot of houses out there that are disappearing from the market within a day to a week. We’re running into multiple offer situations frequently, **so if you’re a buyer, don’t wait to act.** Get your pre-approval done and get ready to find your house.

Don’t be afraid to be obsessive about it, either. Our website, [www.northernvahomefinder.com](http://www.northernvahomefinder.com/), is accurate and up to date on all current listings. If you’d pick up the phone and give us a call, we’d love to help you find the house you want that way too. Remember that we’re not limited to what’s presented on the MLS; we also pursue expired and ‘For Sale By Owner’ listings.

Everything on the MLS is algorithmic. We’ve been expecting a slight increase in interest rates, which did happen. However, interest rates around the world are negative, so a lot of that international capital is sloshing into the U.S. market. My personal forecast is that interest rates aren’t going up very much this year. There have been other forecasts predicting them to rise as high as 5%, but I don’t think that will happen. I think we’ll see very stable interest rates which will result in a phenomenal market.

There’s an important reason I use the word ‘algorithmic’ when describing our market. It’s because everybody looks on Google these days, including buyers. **If you’re a seller, you need to get your home on the first page of Google.**

I can help you accomplish this with a method that involves creating 50 unique Youtube videos of your home. In a matter of moments, this will land your home on Google’s first page. Buyers are searching all over every search site out there, and they’re being extremely aggressive about finding a home. We want to put yours right in front of them.

We also offer a report called the ‘Seller Blueprint’ that tells you everything you need to know about selling a house. All you have to do is ask for it, and we’ll get it into your hands. If you have any other questions about our market, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to helping you.
