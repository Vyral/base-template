Recently, I had the pleasure of being a guest on Patrick Lilly’s Real Estate Success Rocks podcast. Patrick puts on phenomenal masterminds with a select group of top-producing real estate agents across North America; his podcasts are a great way to get a sneak peek into those masterminds.

When I was on his show, Patrick and I discussed the importance of consistency in your business. Here are a few things we went over:When I was on his show, Patrick and I discussed the importance of consistency in your business. Here are a few things we went over:

### My Daily Routine
* The Miracle Morning
* Tell Me Something Good call
* Dominate your day
* Daily prospecting using Mojo
* Daily follow up

### Weekly Routine
* Pipeline report
* List of opportunities
* Hopper system
* Weekly one-on-one meetings
* Weekly team meetings
* Our 70-touch system for our database
* Using quarterly lookbacks and a business grading score card.

As Patrick likes to say, there is nothing sexier than consistency. You can listen to the full episode [here](http://repodcast.rocks/096-consistency-is-sexy-with-dave-friedman/).


If you are interested in any of the resources Patrick and I discuss on the show, check out this list:

I highly recommend that you listen to all of the Real Estate Success Rocks podcast episodes. You will learn a lot from Patrick and other agents across the country.

As always, if you have any questions about how to improve your business, just give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
