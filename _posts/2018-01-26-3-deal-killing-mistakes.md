If you’re selling a home, there are many mistakes that you can make. Just be sure you don’t make any of these three.

<div class="post-cta">

<strong>Want to buy a home? <a href="" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale</a></strong>
</div>

If you’re thinking about selling your home, you need to make sure that you avoid these three major mistakes before you officially list your home for sale:

**1. Overpricing.** Often, the agent will give the homeowner a range in value of where they think the home should be priced. Many homeowners want to go above that because they think the property is worth more. However, overpricing your home will gain nothing. It will end up costing you months on the market, lead to multiple price reductions, more negotiations, and less money overall.

**2. Marketing.** Not all agents are created equally when it comes to marketing. Homes don’t sell themselves, contrary to popular belief. The best way to ensure a quick and profitable sale is by getting the property out there and in front of potential buyers. Last year, we sold more homes than any other agent or team in the state of Alaska. Our 574 total sales in 2017 is a much higher figure than the nine homes per year the average agent sells.

**3. Not making the home presentable.** If your home is on the market for sale, it needs to be in show-ready condition at all times. It should smell good, but not too good. What I mean here is that you want to get rid of any unpleasant or odd odors, but you don’t want to overdo it on the air freshener or candles because then the buyers will think you’re trying to hide something. You want to find a nice, happy, and fresh medium.

If you have any questions about selling a home or anything else about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
