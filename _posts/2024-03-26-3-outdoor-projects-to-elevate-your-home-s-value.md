Are you gearing up to sell your house and wondering where to start with improvements? Enhancing your outdoor space can significantly impact your home's curb appeal and overall value. Here are some outdoor projects that can yield a high return on investment and leave a lasting impression on potential buyers.

**1\. Lawn care.** A well-maintained lawn sets the stage for a welcoming exterior. Consider hiring a lawn care service to keep your yard looking lush and vibrant. A neatly manicured lawn instantly enhances the visual appeal of your property.

**2\. Landscaping upgrades.** Investing in professional landscaping can elevate the entire look of your outdoor space. From adding flower beds to planting trees or shrubs, landscaping upgrades can enhance the aesthetic appeal of your home and make it more inviting to buyers.
