<center><em>My new weekly series is the learning opportunity you&rsquo;ve been waiting for.</em></center>

<br>Want to ask me anything? Well now is your chance\! **I’m launching a weekly series on Fridays at 12 p.m. CST where, for 30 minutes, we’ll dive deep into a one specific topic** and dissect the tactics and strategies involved so you can implement them into your business.

I’ve found that, when given the right opportunity and the right learning environment, people always bring up the best questions. Wouldn’t it be so cool for us to learn and grow together? For many installments of this series, I’ll bring on special guests, and we’ll also be providing this live in “Your Journey With Jennie,” our closed Facebook group.

**Just head to the <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/yourjourneywithJennie/">home page</a></u> and click on the events tab to RSVP**. By doing so, you’ll receive an event reminder as well as the Zoom link so you can participate with us and be fully engaged\! You’ll also be able to see this week’s topic so you can better prepare and get the most out of the discussion\!

I look forward to talking with you soon. Of course, feel free to share any questions, ideas, or topics that are on your heart or in your mind. We’ll see you soon\!
