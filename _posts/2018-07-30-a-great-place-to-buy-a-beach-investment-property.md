*The Wild Dunes section of the Isle of Palms is a great place to buy a beach investment property.*

<div><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a great place to buy a beach investment property, look no further than Wild Dunes in the Isle of Palms.</p><p>As you can see in the video above, I&rsquo;m at the Wild Dunes Resort enjoying a lovely evening at the beach. This is a great place to buy a beach investment property because <strong>property values in this area haven&rsquo;t reached the market heights we saw in 2007 and 2008 and there&rsquo;s still a lot of room for growth.</strong></p></div>

You’ll also notice in the video some beautiful beach homes on Grand Pavilion Boulevard. Properties located off the beach here will sell for around $900,000, while the oceanfront properties will sell for over $1 million. Most of the time, these properties’ yearly gross rental income can surpass $90,000.&nbsp;

If you have any more questions about beach investment properties or all the fun you can have at the Wild Dunes Resort, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to tell you all about it.
