If you are thinking of making your first home purchase in the next six to 12 months, there are 10 crucial steps you must take in preparation.

**1. Check your credit.** Download your report from **[www.equifax.ca](https://www.consumer.equifax.ca/personal/){: target="_blank"}** to get a clear idea of where your score currently stands.

**2. Start saving money.** You will likely need between $10,000 to $30,000 for your deposit, as well as additional funds for expenses like legal fees, closing costs, and more.

**3. Work more hours or get an additional job.** This will help you save.

**4****. Consult a lender.** Getting approved for financing is a crucial step in preparing for your home search.

**5. Investigate down payment assistance programs.**

**6. Decide how much you spend.** You do not have to purchase a home for the highest amount you are approved. Take a close look at your budget and make a decision accordingly.

**7. Attend a seminar or take classes.** Becoming educated as a homebuyer is critical.

**8. Start looking at different neighborhoods.** This will give you a clear idea of what location will best suit your lifestyle.

**9. Visit open houses.** Everyone loves to attend these events and look at homes. Also, doing so can help lead you to a better understanding of what home features you gravitate towards.

**10. Interview real estate agents.** Have a conversation with at least two or three different agents before hiring one so that you can feel certain you have made the right choice.
