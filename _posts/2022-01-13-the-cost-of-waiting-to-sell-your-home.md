Recently, some clients have told me that they want to sell their homes but they’re going to wait until later in the year. In my opinion, it doesn’t make sense to wait to sell your home, and today I want to talk about why.&nbsp;

The main reason why you should sell right now is that it’s still affordable to purchase a home. You might think this doesn’t affect you as a seller, but it does. When homes are affordable, there are more buyers looking to buy. **This means you’ll have more people competing to make a great offer on your home.&nbsp;**

Meanwhile, the spring usually has a ton of sellers entering the market. This means more competition for you. In the winter, inventory is lower, so your home will stick out and attract more buyers. If you only had to compete with other sellers, that would be bad enough; however, you’ll also have to compete with new construction homes. These homes will come on the market around springtime, so sell now if you don’t want to compete with them.&nbsp;

Selling while prices are high will allow you to upgrade. You can get a fantastic deal on your home, so you can use the funds from your sale to find the home of your dreams. Even if you’re looking to downsize, you can invest the extra funds.&nbsp;

Finally, **don’t discount that this could be your moment.** I’ve seen plenty of people who want to sell their homes and change their lives, but they keep putting it off. Next thing you know, the market isn’t as favorable as it was before, and they get cold feet. That’s why my advice is to take advantage of our hot market while you can.&nbsp;
