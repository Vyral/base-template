&nbsp;

About once a day, someone will reach out to me and ask for a referral. When people ask for a referral, **there are three implied questions within that request:**

1. Can I trust this person?
2. Does this person care?
3. Can they help me?

People want to know that the person they’re thinking of working with is trustworthy, compassionate, and competent.

Many people will attempt to find referrals online through platforms like Yelp!, but working directly through a person is generally much more effective. When you get a referral directly from someone you already know, you’re getting a much more solid recommendation than you could ever find through an online review.

When people ask me to recommend a plumber, electrician, lender, or some other vendor, they can be confident in my referral because I’ve worked with the person or company I’m recommending myself—often multiple times. **They know that I care, and can, therefore, feel safe in assuming that the professional I’m referring them to will too. **

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like me to refer you to someone from my network of local vendors, I would be happy to help. Please give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
