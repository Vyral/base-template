<center><em>Here&rsquo;s what to know about APR, interest rates, and mortgage insurance.</em></center>

<br>If you’re unsure of how a monthly mortgage payment is calculated, then today’s message is for you. When it comes to mortgages, there are three important factors to know, two of which are very similar.

First, **an interest rate is the rate you pay the bank for the amount of money that you borrowed**. Think of interest rates as a monthly recurring fee on how much money you have to pay back.

APR, on the other hand, is a little bit different, and often people get these two concepts confused. **APR is the interest rate *plus* some of the costs that you may be paying to get that interest rate**, like banking fees. Think of APR as the total amount of money you’re borrowing over the life of the loan. Usually, APR is expressed as a percentage, and it’s always good practice to compare APR between lenders.

Also, let’s not forget about mortgage insurance. It can be a huge addition to your monthly payment, and it also has a rate. Make sure you **ask your lender what your mortgage insurance rate is** and how long it will remain on your loan.
