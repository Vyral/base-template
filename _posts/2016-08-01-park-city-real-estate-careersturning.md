Today I wanted to talk about turning taxes notices into an opportunity. How can you do it?

 The end of July is the time of year when tax notices go out to property owners. The purpose of the notice is to let the owner know how that municipality is going to tax that property for the upcoming tax bill due by the end of November.

 **Send all of the people in your sphere of influence an email with as compelling a subject line as you can, and let them know that tax notices have been sent out. Let them know that you want to offer your services for running comps for their property, and suggest that they call you rather than just responding to an email.**

 It’s an opportunity to talk to your client, let them know that you value the relationship, and that you want to provide value to them. Always come from a place of contribution.

 Remember, whether you were on the buy or sell side of a transaction, you’ll also want to pull the HUD settlement statements, because they’re going to need that as well. Should they want to retain the services of a professional to help them with any kind of an appeal process, contact your local municipality or county, and find out who in the assessor’s office they might recommend.

 There are usually a handful of people who do a really good job on the appeal process, and the people working in the assessor’s office will know who they want to work with on an appeal. Google it and find out who to call so you can have those resources available, should your clients ask for it.

 I hope you find this helpful. Believe it or not, you can turn taxes into opportunities. Give me a call with any questions you may have.
