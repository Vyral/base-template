Boswell Builders have been building amazing custom homes along the Emerald Coast for over 40 years and bring an incredible level of expertise to our marketplace. You’ll see it in the level of interior detail they have in the model homes shown above.

**Boswell filled an immediate need for high-quality new construction homes at an affordable price.** This is how Paradise Cove was created. The homes here are priced between $350,000 and $500,000 and you’ll certainly be proud of whichever home you choose.

The Pineview floorplan is a 4-bedroom, 3.5-bathroom with 2,441 sq ft. There are a lot of great custom features in here and it’s in a great price point for this community. It also has a great open floor plan that transitions from living room, to dining room, to kitchen.

**In addition to the great kitchen, here are a few other amenities you’ll find in these Boswell homes:**

* Self-closing drawers
* Stainless steel appliances
* Granite countertops in the kitchen and bathrooms
* Full chef’s kitchen

A lot of builders charge extra for features like these, but they’re automatically included in all of these homes. The master bedroom in this floorplan is great as well. It lets in a lot of natural light and has a spacious closet and bathroom.

As you can see, these homes in Paradise Cove have all the elements that you’d be proud of at your primary residence. **To learn more about the community and the homes within it, visit the Paradise Cove website [here.](http://myparadisecove.com/{:target="_blank"})**
