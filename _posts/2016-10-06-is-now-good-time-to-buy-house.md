I was recently asked if now is a good time to buy a house with school back in session for the kids.

Oddly enough, it's a great time to buy a house. Contrary to what many believe, typically in the summer, people are traveling and going on vacations. Now, suddenly a lot of people are back and focused on getting back into school and moving before the holidays.

Just today as I shot this video, there were 312 new listings in Placer County this month with 185 properties sold. You can definitely see how accelerated the market is right now.

If you've been thinking about buying or selling a house but weren't sure about the timing, I'd be glad to answer any questions you have. If you have any questions at all about real estate or our market, I'd be happy to answer those questions, too. Give me a call or send me an email. I'd love to hear from you!
