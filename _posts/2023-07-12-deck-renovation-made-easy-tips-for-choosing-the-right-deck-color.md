It's summer, and if you're considering staining or redoing your deck, there are some hot deck colors to keep in mind. Paint companies often announce the colors of the year, and this year, Behr Paints has revealed its first-ever Stain Color of the Year. It's an interesting choice, since brown, which used to be popular, has made a comeback. The chosen color is a rich chocolate brown, similar to espresso. Behr suggests pairing it with "blank canvas," a soft, warm white, which was their color of the year for interiors.

In the past, red-stained decks were quite popular, like the one at the Brady Bunch House. However, if you have a gray house, you might want to explore colors with a gray undertone to complement it. Of course, any change from the current state will likely be an improvement.

Sometimes, when you can't undertake a complete deck renovation, small changes can make a big difference. For example, adding a new rug, fresh outdoor pillows, and vibrant flowers can distract from any imperfections and give your deck a rustic charm.

If you're selling your home and want to spruce up your deck, this advice can help create a more appealing outdoor space for potential buyers. Even if you're not selling, a refreshed deck can make your summer evenings more enjoyable.

So, whether you decide to go with the color of the year or explore other options, take the opportunity to transform your deck into a welcoming oasis. Don't let the current state deter you from enjoying this outdoor haven during the summer months.
