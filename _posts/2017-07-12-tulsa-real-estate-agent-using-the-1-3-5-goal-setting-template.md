If you haven’t been using the 1-3-5 tool to get things accomplished in your business, I highly recommend you give it a try.

Are you using the 1-3-5 (or GPS) tool to accomplish your goals?

Just like the GPS system in your car, this system helps you determine where you’re going in your business career and gives you directions along the way. **I’ve been using this tool for the past couple of years now, and you can also use it to accomplish goals in your personal life as well.**

How does it work?

First, you start with one goal, which can be anything from completing a certain number of transactions in a year to taking on a certain type of project in your business. Then, you break that goal down into three priorities. Under each of those three priorities, there are five strategies.

We just did a mid-year review for our team so we could check in on the goals we set at the beginning of the year. By doing this, we can see if we're on track to accomplish them and if there's anything we could do to tweak them. One of our 1-3-5 goals was to help 150 families in the Tulsa area. Our three priorities for this goal were divided into buyers, sellers, and business partners. We had strategies for each priority, but we noticed during this mid-year review that we hadn’t checked many of them off and perhaps weren’t implementing the right ideas for these strategies.

That’s when I heard about a great idea from BOLD coach J. Michael Manley about **breaking down your annual 1-3-5 based on leads, listings, and leverage.** That’s exactly what we did, and now that we’re halfway through 2017, we have two questions to ask ourselves: What are our biggest sources of business? Can we still plus those?

I think the answer is always “yes.” Our biggest source of business is our referrals from our database, meaning past clients, our sphere of influence, and other Realtors. Are there still areas in each of those categories that we still need to plus and tweak? Yes, and that’s our focus for the rest of the year.

I have a great 1-3-5 template document I’d like to share with you, so if you haven’t already, head on over to my Facebook blog page “Your Journey With Jennie”  and hit “like.” I’ll add the document there so you can borrow it from my Google drive.
If you have any questions about this tool or how it can help you in your own business, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to assist you.
