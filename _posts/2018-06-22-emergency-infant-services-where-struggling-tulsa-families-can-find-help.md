Today I’m coming to you live from the downtown office of Emergency Infant Services (EIS) here in Tulsa to tell you a little bit about this great organization and what they do for our community. Joining me is EIS Executive Director Bill Andoe.&nbsp;

For the last 40 years, the mission of EIS has been **to serve families who are experiencing financial hardship and have children under the age of five.** They provide clothing, diapers, groceries, formula, and other essential needs these families have. All these families have to do is meet with an EIS interviewer to assess their needs so they can determine which services they can provide and which community services might be available to them—even if their children are over five.&nbsp;

Aside from their downtown location, they also have a location on the east side of Tulsa and two satellite locations on the north and south sides of town. Right now they’re in the middle of a capital campaign, so a year from this summer, they’ll be moving to 11th and Denver. This move will help them provide more resources for families, centralize their warehouse, and stockpile more supplies.

One thing in particular I love to share about EIS is anyone is welcome there. **They provide their services with love and without judgement—it’s one of their founding principles.** According to Bill, they average about 18,000 visits per year, and they expect that number to reach 20,000 in the near future. To help carry the loan, they have church groups, school groups, and a number of other regular volunteers who help them on a weekly basis.&nbsp;

“We’re in this because we want to help,” Bill says. “That’s what attracts employees and volunteers to EIS. We often talk about the people who come in—we talk about professionally mentioning them statistically as clients, but they’re really more than just clients. They’re members of our community. They go to our churches. We see them at public events. They’re Tulsans just like us. We’re here to help them.”

EIS relies on the generosity of donors and the Tulsa community at large, so if you’d like to help them in their mission, they always welcome financial donations. They also accept diapers, wipes, car seats, strollers, and anything else a family with a young child might need.&nbsp;

**If you’d like to get in touch with EIS or you’d like more information on how to donate, you can visit their website at www.EISTulsa.org.&nbsp;**

As always, if you have any questions for me or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
