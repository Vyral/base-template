Today, I want to briefly discuss how to use a home warranty to help sell your home.&nbsp;

Here at Shorewest, we work with a company called Home Security of America, which provides warranties on the sale of used or existing homes. Many of our clients use these to help sell their home. **They are attractive to buyers because they cover heating, air conditioning, plumbing, electrical, and appliances**. Essentially, warranties cover the guts of your home, not the structural items like roofs, basements, and windows.&nbsp;

**Home warranties cover the buyer for one year from the day of closing**. Plus, the seller gets free coverage while they are listing. Homeowners use warranties as a selling feature. For instance, if you have a home warranty on your home, but the three other homes that buyers are looking at do not have a warranty, **your home will be viewed in a much more favorable light**.

**Warranties provide buyers and sellers with peace of mind**. If something happens after closing, the buyer isn't going going to call the person who sold them the home, they're going to call the home warranty company, who will then come out and fix the problem. **The basic single-family home warranty, which covers all the entities in your home, is about $564**. Deductibles range from $75-$100, depending on the plan you go with.

If you have any questions about home warranties, or if you need real estate assistance of any kind, don't hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to hear from you!
