We at Select Retirement Plans have exciting news to share: We’ve just launched our new website!

So, in order to help you utilize this new site to its fullest potential, allow us to give you a quick walkthrough of its features. **Feel free to follow along in the video above to see an on-screen demonstration.**

Beginning with our home page, [www.selectretirementplans.com](http://www.selectretirementplans.com){: target="_blank"}, you’ll find our short introductory video message, as well as links to pages that cover our three programs: SELECT 401(k), SELECT 403(b), and SELECT MD 401(k).

After scrolling down further on our home page, you will also find an informative video explaining the concept of an MEP (Multiple Employer Plan), an organizational chart showing the structure of our program, links to six featured topics related to our program, and links to three pages that offer information on how we add value with our services.

Then, at the bottom of our home page, there is a link you can follow to request a plan demo and proposal, our retirement income calculator, and, finally, a list of charities we support.

We hope you enjoy our new site. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
