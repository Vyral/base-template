Donald Trump will be the next President of the United States. What does that mean for the real estate industry?

First of all, since the election ended a couple weeks ago, **interest rates have gone up half a point.** Historically speaking, 4% is still a low interest rate, so home prices have not been affected that much so far.

Even if rates were to increase in the future, Trump’s views on regulation in the real estate industry would counter any effect interest rates might have on price. This past August, Trump said, “There’s no industry other than the energy industry that’s regulated more than real estate.” Right now, regulation costs make up 25% of building costs; **Trump believes regulation costs should be closer to 2%.** If that happens, more renters would be able to afford houses.

That said, inventory is still a huge challenge in the real estate market. As a result, our market has remained fairly stable. If you are thinking of selling your home, now is still a good time to get top dollar.

 If you have any other questions about the real estate market, just give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
