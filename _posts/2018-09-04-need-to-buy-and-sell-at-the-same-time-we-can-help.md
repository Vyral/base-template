Did you know that 72% of buyers have equity in a home they need to sell before they can purchase their next? As this statistic shows, having to buy and sell at the same time is a very common scenario in today’s market. So what should you do if you find yourself faced with this scenario?

Our recommendation is that you list your current home first and then submit a contingent offer on your next home once someone has made an offer on your listing.

When you work with our team, we can guarantee that you’ll never wind up with two houses at once. To guarantee a smooth transition, we will help you synchronize your transactions so you close on both at the same time.
