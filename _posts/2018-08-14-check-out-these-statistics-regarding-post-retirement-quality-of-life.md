Did you know that the top determining factor of a person’s happiness after retirement has nothing to do with money? We’ll reveal what this factor is later on, but for now let’s take a look at some other findings from the study that determined this point.

Each two years, the University of Michigan conducts its Health and Retirement study, which the quality of post-retirement life using two scales: the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), and the Subjective Well-Being Scale (SWB). The study collects data from more than 26,000 Americans over the age of 50 on 11 categories of spending health variables.

By examining so many areas of spending, **the study seeks to evaluate what retirees find to be most meaningful to their satisfaction with life.**

Many younger people may hold the assumption that older individuals have a diminished quality of life. Yet the study found that retirees above the age of 76 reported a higher satisfaction with life than retirees in the age bracket at and below 65.

**To compensate for this, a younger retiree would need to increase their leisure budget by approximately 40%.** In fact, the only significant spending area related to improving the quality of life for retirees is leisure.

Beyond matters related to spending, though, the study also investigates retirees’ interpersonal relationships. According to the University of Michigan, the portion of the study dedicated to this area includes “measurements describing the marital relationships, [and] the number and degree of contract with children, family, and friends.” These measurements are particularly important, because **the strength of a retiree’s spousal relationship is the No. 1 predictor of their quality of life.**
