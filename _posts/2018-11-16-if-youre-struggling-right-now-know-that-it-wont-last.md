<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In life, things don’t last forever. So if you’re struggling right now, I’d like you to consider the message I’m sharing today.</em></p>

As you guys know, I guy’s recently ran my first 15k race. It was cold, the wind was fierce, and there were times where my legs felt like they were going to completely fall flat under me. There were also times when a runner’s high hit, but that wasn’t the case that day.&nbsp;

The point I’m trying to make by this is that whether it’s life or a race, the main competition you should have in mind is yourself. **When you feel like you’re struggling, you’ve got to realize that these feelings won’t last forever.** Life, like a race, is full of ups and downs.&nbsp;

Especially with the holidays around the corner, I know that things can be tough. This isn’t an easy time of year for some, and the added stress the holidays can bring can make it hard to remember the message I’m sharing today.

With that in mind, I’d like I’d also like to let you know that if you happen to be alone this Thanksgiving, my table has a place for you. **I can’t promise the quality of my cooking will be particularly amazing, but I can promise it will be a great time.&nbsp;**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
