  Why do agents choose to join The Stern Team? It could be because we are the
  top team in the state of Utah. It could be because we offer one-on-one
  mentorship, coaching, training, and motivation. For these three women, it was
  all the above. To see what some of our own agents have to say about working on
  our team, watch this short video.
