The Heidi Phong Team has been around for 8 years now, helping families buy and sell homes. At the HP team, we are real estate advisors, not real estate salespeople. We’d like to take a moment to introduce one of our agents, Chia Vang.

{% include pullquote.html %}

As a real estate advisor, Chia’s goal is to give you the best advice so you feel confident about your decision. He is a full-time agent who knows how to get the job done. Chia believes that a real estate transaction should be fun, exciting, and simple for his clients.

If you have any questions for Chia, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!
