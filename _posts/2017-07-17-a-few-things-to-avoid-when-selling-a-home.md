Even in a hot market like the one we’re currently seeing in San Diego, sellers can make mistakes that will ultimately end up costing them on their bottom line. Here are four things all sellers should avoid doing in this market:

1. **Overpricing your home**. Lots of buyers think they can overprice because the market is so hot. However, when you’re competing against similar properties that are not overpriced, you’re going to lose out more often than not. Buyers are going to scoop up those homes that are fairly priced and if your home sits on the market too long, buyers may start to think something is wrong with it.
2. **Remove clutter.**This allows buyers to see the openness of the home. Rent a storage locker or shift the clutter into the garage.&nbsp; {% include pullquote.html %}
3. **Make minor repairs**. If you have any knowledge of small or minor defects in the home that can be repaired relatively cheaply, do yourself a favor and complete them before you list on the market. If you wait and the buyer requests those repairs, it’s going to cost you a lot more.
4. **Keep your emotions out of the sale**. Of course you love your home, but once you decide to sell you should look at it as more of an asset than anything else. If you receive a lowball offer or the seller asks for repairs, keep a level head and know that the negotiations aren’t over yet.

If you have any questions for us or know anyone who is interested in buying or selling a home in San Diego, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
