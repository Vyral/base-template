A lot more goes into a move than just packing and dealing with paperwork. Between calming down your anxious children and trying to calm your own nerves, moving can also be very emotionally draining. Thankfully, there are a few simple steps you can take to make the process a little easier for you and your family.

**1. Keep an emergency fund.** This will provide some additional peace of mind during your transition.

**2. Remind yourself of why you’re moving in the first place.** Be confident in your decision and reflect on the reasons behind it.

**3. Envision yourself in your new home.** Just imagine all the memories waiting to be made. Try to keep your focus forward instead of dwelling in the past.

**4. Remember to have fun.** Homeowners in transition will find themselves with a staggering to-do list. But as you orchestrate these fine details, make sure you also carve out time to enjoy the little things. After all, moving is exciting—don’t let yourself forget that aspect of the process under the pressure of everything else that goes into it.
