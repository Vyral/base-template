CPA and Carlisle native Chris Farrands joins me to discuss the financial services offered by Cohick & Associates, a trusted community partner.

What makes Cohick & Associates so special? For years, they’ve been going the extra mile for local businesses. My Brand Ambassador Spotlight guest for today, Chris Farrands, shares a passion with founder Jeff Cohick for helping small businesses in Central Pennsylvania. **Together, with an exceptional support staff, they’ve been able to help business owners thrive by offering outstanding bookkeeping, payroll and tax services.&nbsp;**

In the springtime, Cohick & Associates are extremely busy helping folks prepare their taxes. In addition to helping individuals with income tax returns, the company helps businesses that are too small to hire a full-time payroll or bookkeeping staff of their own outsource the work.

Most small business owners struggle to find that taxation sweet spot—paying exactly what they’re obligated to and not overpaying; it’s the most common concern Cohick & Associates address in their line of work. Through their expertise, the company creates opportunities for prudent tax planning and tax savings.&nbsp;

Their office is fully-staffed and open year-round, so **if someone has a particular payroll or tax return concern, they’re able to reach out for a free 30-minute consultation.** On numerous occasions, getting a second opinion from Cohick & Associates has saved local businesses time and money.&nbsp;
