After spending a lot of time learning what makes high-producing teams around the country great, we really want people who come to our team to truly understand what makes a team dynamic.

Joining our team means you're immersed right away; you work with leads, appointments, buyers, and sellers immediately. We get a mix of what we consider to be the best leads and we spread them throughout the team to give all our agents an equal opportunity.&nbsp;

I also believe in specialization, so we also try to pick one for each agent after their first 60 to 90 days. For example, we had one agent recently decide he wanted to specialize in investment and commercial properties while some really like to work with listings, meet with sellers, and negotiate. Others specialize in showings and working just with buyers. We want to find your niche.&nbsp;

When a new agent joins our team, it's not about what I want, but what you want. We want happy, producing agents aiming for 15 to 25 deals a year.

I also shoot weekly training videos each week that all our team members can access, so we have hours upon hours of content we've been creating for more than a year. We also have live training on any imaginable scenario. We've built collaboration with some of the largest teams in the country to help this process and serve as role models.

Currently, we're looking for agents who like the idea of a team and all the training and resources we can provide. Our agents have doubled and we're looking to double our office space this year; we have so many leads that we need more agents looking for a full-time position and want to be part of a growing organization. We want to have agents on five to 10 appointments every month with new leads, new buyers, and new sellers.&nbsp;
