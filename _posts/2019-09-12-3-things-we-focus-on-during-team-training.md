<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The basis of our team’s success is our second-to-none training. Today, allow me to share the three key areas this training focuses on.</em></p>

Our team enjoys a lot of great benefits, but this is only possible because of the high standards we hold ourselves to. Unlike some other teams, agents with us are expected to sell 30+ homes a year. The good news? Our training is specifically geared toward helping agents achieve this goal, and it’s all because we focus on three key things:

**1\. Phone-based conversion.** Being great on the phone is imperative to converting leads.

**2\. Systems.** Salespeople like you and me aren’t always the most organized people, but by correctly following the right systems, even the most unorganized individual can run their business with machine-like precision.&nbsp;

**3\. Face-to-face conversion.** Knowing how to speak on the phone is important, but so is knowing how to convert leads in person. Our agents are expected to get 75% to 80% of the people they speak with to sign.

If you have any other questions or would like more information about what joining our team is like, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
