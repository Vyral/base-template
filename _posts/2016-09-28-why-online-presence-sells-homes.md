Studies show that 93% of current buyers start their home search online, so your home needs to look great. If you’ve ever looked at houses online, you might have seen some really dark, hard-to-see photos out there. I saw one last week that was so dark, I couldn’t tell what room it was. All I could see was a dirty towel hanging on the wall, so I assumed it was a picture of the bathroom. It’s unbelievable that someone thought it was a good idea to post that photo online.

In order to make your home show well online, you should have a home stager come in. If you’re working with a professional Realtor, they should pay for the home stager as part of the marketing expenses. The stager will come in and give you recommendations on how to best set up your home for professional photographs.

Hiring a professional photographer is absolutely crucial. At the Elliott Team, we use something called HDR or fusion technology. The camera is placed on a tripod and we take three shots with low, medium, and high exposure. Those photos are then run through a software program that analyzes the shading and coloring of every surface in those photos before pulling them all together to create a perfect photograph.

Perfect photographs draw people’s attention. If no one is interested enough to look at your house in person, no one will buy your house. How your home shows online is the most important part of getting people through the door.

We also use a Matterport camera to market homes online. The Matterport camera takes a laser scan of the whole house to create an online 3D model of your home. Thanks to Matterport, buyers can take a virtual tour of your home without leaving their sofas. This technology is absolutely incredible; click here to see examples.

As you can see, if your home stands out online, you will have a successful selling process. If you have any questions about building your home’s online presence or about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
