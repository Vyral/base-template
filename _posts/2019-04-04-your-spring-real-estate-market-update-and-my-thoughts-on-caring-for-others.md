Our spring market is looking great, but there are a few other topics I want to talk about as well.

Today we’ll be taking a quick look at our latest real estate market, but that’s not all: We’ll also be talking about Guilderland assessments and the power of caring for others.

**First off, the spring market is here!** We’re seeing great activity for homes priced under $350,000, and it’s a seller’s market in most price points. Over $350,000, however, things are a bit more challenging. [Check out this link](http://www.realmarketreports.com/reports/NY01004_Capital_Region.pdf){: target="_blank"} to find out all the latest stats and numbers you need to know; if you want a more in-depth look at your specific area, though, I’d be glad to help you out.

Interest rates are under 4%, and it’s the perfect time to lock in a rate by purchasing a home. It’s also great news for sellers—buyers can afford to make a purchase because they’ll be paying less on interest. Since it’s such a great market, plenty of investors are looking to buy homes fast. If you want to secure a quick sale for your home, reach out to me and I can put you in touch with someone.

**Next, if you’re a Guilderland resident, you should have already received your assessment.** If you have any questions about it, I’d be happy to take a look and let you know if it seems reasonable. If it doesn’t, I can pull comparable sales and give you the data you need for the assessor.

**Finally, let’s talk about caring.** There’s a saying that floats around my office: Nobody cares how much you know until they know how much you care. It’s true—nobody looks at my education or my experience, but they do look at how much I care for others.

My daughter’s a big volleyball player, and we recently stopped by a diner after a long tournament. We had a great waiter—he put so much care into how he treated us and the service he provided. Just through his actions, I can tell he’s destined for great things no matter what he does. We simply don’t see that sort of authentic care very often.

I also have a caring friend who has a great job, and he got an offer from another company this week. Instead of losing him, his current firm increased his pay and did what they could to get him to stay. Why did they do it? Because he cares about his clients as well as his employer. He’s a rarity, to say the least—no matter what position you put him in, he’ll do a great job.&nbsp;

Your quality of life is impacted by how much you care about others and how you treat them. **I care about you and want to help out in any way I can**; if you have any real estate needs, want help with your assessment, or simply want to talk, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
