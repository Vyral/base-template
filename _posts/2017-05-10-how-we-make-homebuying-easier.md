Why does working with the Vanka Group make a difference when buying a home in Silicon Valley? **There are three main reasons.**

The first thing is our needs analysis. It’s the first thing we do with our buying clients. It’s so important because every client is different. Some buyers want a certain home in a certain area no matter the price, and some have a budget they have to stick to. **Because of that, this meeting is essential in setting your expectations for the process as a whole.**

Secondly, we understand the market. In Silicon Valley, 55% of homes purchased last year were cash transactions. If you’re going to be competing with cash offers and you’re using financing, a pre-approval is essential in getting all your ducks in a row. **We have some amazing lender partners we can refer you to.**

Finally, the last step is to identify the neighborhoods that are good fits for you. We can strategize with you and help narrow down the best options, whether you want to be near good schools, the highway, or both.

 If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
