A lot of people are downsizing and moving into tiny homes. Chris Gonzalez from Tabor Mortgage is here to answer the question, **“Can you finance a tiny home?” **

The answer is yes, but it may not be the traditional mortgage that you’re thinking of.

First, you should know that there are a few different types of tiny homes out there:

1. A trailer you can move.

2. A tiny home on land you can own.

3. A tiny home on land you rent from a development.

That said, there are only two ways to finance a tiny home. One option is to apply for a personal loan from a local bank. The other is to get an actual RV loan from your local bank.

If you have any other questions about financing a tiny home, you can reach Chris at (843) 840-4821 or <a href="mailto:Chris@TaborMortgage.com" target="_blank>Chris@TaborMortgage.com</a>.
