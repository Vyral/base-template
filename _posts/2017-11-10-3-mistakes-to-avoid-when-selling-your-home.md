Today we’re going to be talking about the three major mistakes to avoid when selling your home.

There are a lot of ways to succeed when selling a house and just as many ways to fail. When it comes to the mistakes that sellers tend to make, three specific errors reign supreme. If you’re trying to sell your real estate investment this season, **make sure to avoid these three cardinal real estate sins.**

1. Asking too much. While you never want to sell your house for less than it’s worth, **setting your sticker price too high could leave your home sitting on the market for months.** If you think that you might be asking too much for your property, connect with a real estate agent and ask them to give you their expert opinion on your property’s value. If a big sticker price is the reason you haven’t been attracting buyers, the worst thing you can do is leave it alone.

2. Advertising too little. Your house isn’t going to sell itself; in this buyer’s market, you’re going to need to do more than just hire a real estate agent and take out an ad in the paper if you want to reel in an offer. **If you’re selling a house this season, then everyone should know about it—advertise it on your social networking sites and on major online classifieds** like Kijiji. We promote all of our listings to hundreds of syndicated classifieds, our thousands of our buyers-in-waiting, and to our thousands of social media followers. Any attention your real estate investment gets is good attention, and you’ll need a lot of it to nab a buyer.

3. Not making your property presentable. If you want to find a buyer for your real estate investment, you need to make sure that it looks presentable and ready to sell every time it’s shown. Vacuum the floors, paint the walls, and do everything else you can to keep your house as clean as possible. **Since buyers expect a home to be spotless when they walk through, even a little bit of clutter could cost you an offer.**

Selling a home isn’t easy in this market, but it will only get harder if you don’t take extra care to avoid these three major mistakes.

If you’re listing your real estate investment this season, always remember to ask for a fair price, advertise everywhere, and never present it to a potential buyer until it’s absolutely clean.
