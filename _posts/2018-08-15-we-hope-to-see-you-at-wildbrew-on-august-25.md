Today I’m back to talk about a fantastic event that’s coming up here in a few weeks. Angela Evans, who works in the marketing department for WildBrew, joined me recently to talk about the event and what you need to know about it.

They don’t call it the greatest party ever hatched for nothing. **WildBrew is a fundraiser for the Sutton Avian Research Center located in Bartlesville.** This is the 20th year for this festival, making it the oldest craft beer festival in Oklahoma!

**The event is on Saturday, August 25th at the Cox Business Center downtown. **

Over 50 local and non-local breweries and 50 amazing restaurants will be in attendance for this wonderful indoor festival. **Here’s what a ticket to this festival will get you:**

* All the beer tastings that you can responsibly handle
* All the food from all the restaurants.

**General admission tickets are $65.00 and get you in for three hours from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.** The patron-level tickets get you in an hour early and get you into a special area for an additional hour.

**In addition to having a heck of a time, your ticket purchase will fund some amazing research.** The Sutton Avian Research Center played a crucial role in bringing the bald eagle off of the endangered animal list. More recently, they’ve been working with the Greater Prairie Chicken and the Masked Bobwhite Quail. For the Masked Bobwhite Quail, they incubate eggs, hatch them, then take the chicks to Mexico to mate and become released into the wild.

To get tickets to this wonderful event, head on over to wildbrew.org. Experience the restaurants, the beers, and the ciders. **It’s going to be a great time and we would love to see you there.** We’re very excited to sponsor this event.

If you have any other questions about the event or about real estate in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
