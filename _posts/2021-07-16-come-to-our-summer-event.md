We are loving being outdoors and enjoying summertime, especially after being cooped up for the past year. It feels like summer just started and it will come to an end before you know it, so we’d like to invite you to one more summer event.

We are so excited for you to come to our **Summer Snow Cone Social at Josh’s Sno Shack in <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://goo.gl/maps/ySi4cg34Y8CpTQFF6">Brookside Collective Park</a></u> on Sunday, August 1 from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.** All you have to do is <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/summer-snow-cone-social-tickets-161807066291">sign up</a></u>, swing by, and enjoy a snow cone on us. We’re just getting back to in-person events so we can’t wait to see you and catch up.

We love our clients, we love Tulsa, and we love giving back, so we’ll also be accepting donations and school supplies for The Pencil Box. To learn more about how this local organization gives back to Tulsa public schools, <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pencilboxtulsa.org/what">visit their website</a></u>. If you have any other questions about real estate matters, feel free to reach out to us via phone or email.
