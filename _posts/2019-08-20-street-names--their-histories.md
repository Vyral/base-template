We’ve been doing some research lately about how streets got their names. It’s really fascinating, so today I’ll share the stories of how three streets were named.

**1\. Indian School Road.** This Phoenix street was named for the school that was located on the road. The Phoenix Indian School opened in 1891 and closed in 1990 when it was bought by a commercial development and converted into a park.

**2\. W Bell Road.** This street was named after Harvey Bell, a farmer who formed the Paradise Verde irrigation district in 1916. That district was responsible for the horse reservoir on the Verde River.

**3\. Grand Avenue.** This street got its name from developers from Fresno, California, who were inspired to make a quick and easy route to attract newcomers to the west side in 1887.
