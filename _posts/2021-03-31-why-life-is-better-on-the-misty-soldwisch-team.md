Emily Burton is originally from Indianola, Iowa, where she graduated from Simpson College. She worked as a bartender for many years before she stumbled into the real estate business. She had just received her degree in public relations and was looking for a job. She initially interviewed to be an agent’s assistant; that agent told her that she would be perfect as an agent and that she should get her license.&nbsp;

So Emily did; **she worked as an individual agent for about seven months.** It was a difficult time for her. She wanted real estate to be her career, but she was struggling. Solo agents don’t have the support that agents who work on a team do.

Eventually, in 2017, she received a call from the Misty SOLDwisch Team to schedule an interview, and she’s been with us ever since. The difference between her life as a solo agent and as a member of our team couldn’t be starker. **We have multiple departments on our team designed to help our agents succeed**, like our client services and transactions departments. Emily also doesn’t have to worry about marketing because our team has systems in place to take care of that so she can focus on working with clients.

If you have any questions about working with the Misty SOLDwisch Team or are interested in beginning your real estate career, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.
