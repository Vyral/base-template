Recently, Scott and I were joined by Aaron Morgan from Academy Mortgage.&nbsp;

On a recent trip to Africa that Scott and I took with our family members, we gathered donations for an underprivileged school. Aaron and Academy mortgage will soon be doing similar work, but on a much larger scale.

The Academy Mortgage Foundation is what Aaron describes as an opportunity to give back.&nbsp;

From the end of August until the first part of September, he and members of his team will be in Africa doing just that: giving back.

Aaron wants to spread the word about what he’s doing and how you can help. If you’d like to donate, you can click [**here**](https://academymortgagefoundation.org/)&nbsp;to do so. **Anything helps**.

As a partner to Academy Mortgage, Colemere Realty is happy for the opportunity to promote this opportunity to make a difference.&nbsp;

**We also accept drop-off donations at our office**. We accept anything from clothing to shoes to books, and a number of other necessary items.

Ultimately, we have seen how charitable our friends, clients, and colleagues have been in the past and continue to be today. We appreciate your willingness to give.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
