<p style="text-align:center">Here’s how we handle maintenance calls for our property owners.</p>

If you’re a property owner thinking of managing your property yourself, what are you going to do when you get a maintenance call?&nbsp;

We at HI Pacific Property Management average around three maintenance calls a day, seven days a week, most of which come after 4 p.m. or on the weekends. If you manage your own property, you’ll get at least three maintenance calls per lease year. Since you’re required by law to have an on-island representative, do you have someone you trust to handle this type of thing? Someone who knows plenty of insured vendors?&nbsp;

If not, let me tell you how we handle maintenance calls.

**Maintenance calls from tenants are channeled through our portal system.** An email gets sent to me and the property manager before being directed to the maintenance department, which is on-call daily from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Property managers are free to handle the problem however they want, but 99% of the time, they ask us to take care of it. Our maintenance department contacts the tenant and one of our vendors and puts them in communication. You then get a notification once the job is complete.&nbsp;

We have hundreds of rentals, so **we have a whole host of vendors who can service your home at a moment’s notice.** Because we keep our maintenance department in-house, we can oversee the process and immediately resolve any issues. If one of our vendors makes a bad diagnosis, most of them will give you a credit.&nbsp;

Property management is all we do, and maintenance is part of the job. If you have us take care of your property, I promise you that we’ll do our very best. Remember, there are only two reasons for me to be in your home: to protect it and to put money in your account.&nbsp;

As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic, or you are thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m happy to help.
