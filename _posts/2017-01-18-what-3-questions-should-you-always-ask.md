Selling your home goes a lot more smoothly with a Realtor at your side. However, make sure you hire the right one by asking these three questions.

**Want to sell your home?** <a href="http://www.clarksville-ftcampbell-homes.com/a/tlx/search?landing=1&rgu=0" target="_blank">Get a FREE home value report</a>
**Want to buy a home?** <a href="http://www.valeriehunterkelly.com/search/residentialadvancedsearch.aspx" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale</a>

Entering the real estate market without a Realtor to represent you is very risky, but you don’t want to hire just anyone. There are many questions you should ask before hiring a real estate agent, and these are the top three:

**1. How long have you been in the business?** There are so many different factors that come into play when getting your sale to closing. You want to make sure they have experience to handle every aspect of the sale and make sure the closing process goes smoothly.

**2. What is your list-to-sales price ratio?** You want to make sure they are selling homes for something close to what they listed them at initially on a consistent basis.

**3. How many houses did you sell last year?** Knowing your agent is active in the market is key. Someone who has 30 years of experience but only sold two houses last year is not going to be the right fit to sell your home.
