Today I’m going to go over some great, affordable ways to prepare your home for the spring market.

If you’re thinking about selling your home this spring, there are some great affordable ways you can prepare to ensure you get top dollar.

{% include pullquote.html %}

1. **Declutter.** Box up all of the items you don’t need and put them in a storage unit. Decluttering ensures your home feels cozy, and buyers are more likely to see the value in a decluttered home.

2. **Repaint the doors.** Adding a fresh coat of paint to the doors will make them feel and look new. Buyers will take notice and really appreciate that detail.

3. **Repaint the trim.** You don’t need to paint every bit of trim in the house, but make sure you hit the main walking areas, bathrooms, hallways, and the kitchen.

4. **Spruce up the landscaping.** Get some mulch and freshen things up. Also, make sure two days before you get pictures taken you mow the grass and clear the driveway off.
Assuming there are no major issues with your carpet or flooring, hitting the basics is going to get you the biggest return. By doing so, your home will be 75% more likely to sell than other homes. Just remember not to over improve your home by taking on huge projects like the ones on HGTV. Those projects won’t always get you the best return.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
