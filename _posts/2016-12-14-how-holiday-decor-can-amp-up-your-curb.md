Certain holiday decor can really amp us your home's curb appeal. Today, I wanted to give you a list of the top four ways to utilize it:

1. Highlight your home's architecture. Consider edging your home's roof, windows, or trim with holiday decorations to take advantage of and highlight your home's architecture.
2. Landscaping. Net lights make decorating with your landscape so easy that your kids can do it. Lay them over your hedges and take advantage of all the landscaping aspects that your home offers.
3. Spread the love. Gates, walkways, fences, and your entryway are great opportunities to extend your decor to your entire front yard.
4. Don't forget about your front door. This can be as easy as adding a wreath. Whether you go with store bought or homemade, the opportunities are endless.

These four tips will really help you boost that curb appeal, whether you're selling or not.
