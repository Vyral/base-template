I was recently asked to host an episode of Agent Power Huddle. I decided to talk about how a lot of agents run their business wrong. Some of them drift into this industry, coasting along from lead to lead without any control. Others are incredibly driven and pushed forward thoughtlessly by their ambition. You don’t want to be either. Instead, you want to lead your business by design.
