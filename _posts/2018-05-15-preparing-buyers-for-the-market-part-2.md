Today I’m here with associate broker David Dorius, a 30-year veteran of the Wasatch Back real estate market, to talk about a timely issue: How do you consult with buyers in a market where inventory is as tight as it is right now?<br><br>**David, tell us about the negotiating tactics you use when your clients find a property they’re ready to pursue.**

Before we even get there, I try to give my clients copies of the contracts that we’ll be using so they can read through them ahead of time and come to understand what terms they’re dealing with. This way, when we finally find that property, only to discover that there are multiple other people looking at the same one, I won’t have to explain the whole contract to them. All they’ll have to do is fill in the blanks to be ready to roll.

After that, I ask my clients, “How are you going to pay for it?” Will you use cash or loans? Somewhere around 50% of all of our transactions in this market are done with cash, so using cash will put you in a better position to get the property you want.

If you’re going to finance it, you’ll want to make sure you’re completely approved for a loan and can show that all of your finances are in order. In other words, you’ll need to be in a position where your lender is ready to print out the loan documents. If you are, you’ll be able to compete with cash buyers.

**If there are multiple people bidding on a property, do you have any tools to help clients win negotiations?**<br><br>We have something called an escalation clause, which is an addendum to the purchase agreement that says my client is willing to go above and beyond any competing offer up to a certain limit. Of course, I want to make sure they’re not vastly overpaying, so we’ll discuss what is an appropriate limit beforehand. It’s a great tool to have, especially if clients are busy or traveling.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
