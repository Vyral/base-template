<center><em>How much of a difference can listing videos make? A lot.</em></center>

<br>Can videos really help sell your home? The short answer is yes, and we have the statistics to back that up. In fact, 85% of clients want an agent who uses video tools as part of their marketing package. What’s more, homes presented with a video tend to receive 403% more attention.

But making a real estate video isn’t as easy as using your cellphone camera—**a high-quality video requires specialized equipment**. We’ve invested in a very expensive camera that will allow the consumer to virtually walk through the home and look around almost as though they were there in person. To make a really effective real estate video, you’ll also need drone footage. It adds a wow factor to the presentation, showing the home itself and the surrounding areas.

With the pandemic changing people’s habits so drastically, this kind of technology has really helped keep home sales moving along. It’s the next best thing to actually viewing a home in person.

Apart from high-quality technology, **you’ll also need a high-quality editing and production team** to help put the video together. This might sound expensive, but at Colemere Realty, we’ve tailored the process down to capture listings of any price range to help them sell for more money in a shorter amount of time.

However, you can’t have all this great equipment and editing technology without having the right platform to share the videos on. Not all platforms can fully capture the richness that listing videos can create; Zillow, for example, has specific requirements in terms of video resolution that don’t really work for the process. There are many options out there, so working with an experienced real estate marketer is key to helping you find the right ones so that you can get your listing in front of as many potential buyers as possible.
