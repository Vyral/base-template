You might think that 2019 is a long way off and there’s no need to start planning for next year, but you’d be wrong. If you’re thinking of selling your home next year, you need to begin your planning process now; this time of year is when our savvy clients start to prepare for the 2019 selling season. Instead of rushing into it when you only have a couple weeks to get ready, why not spend the next few months fine-tuning your strategy with our team? We would love to work with you. If you’re interested in hiring us for your transaction or have any other questions, visit our latest blog post for more information.
