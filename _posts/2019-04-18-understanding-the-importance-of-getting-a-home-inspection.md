What makes an inspection such a necessary part of the real estate transaction for homebuyers?

Once you go under contract for the purchase of a home, included in your agreement is a timetable for any due diligence you’d like to conduct. Consider this your opportunity to inspect the property to the fullest extent.

**When you hire a home inspector, they’ll come with a checklist of items, and they’ll examine those items to ensure sufficient functionality of each**.

As an aside, you may get swept up in all the excitement of going under contract on your new home, only to have an inspector identify some issues. That’s why it’s so important to have a professional inspector come in—**their preset checklist will be comprised of around 300 items, and they’ll document every problem area they uncover in a thorough fashion**. This way, you’re not surprised by the actual condition of the home.

With a checklist of this length, an inspector is bound to find flaws or areas that need servicing in the home. We’ve even seen cases where inspectors have found issues in new construction properties.

If and when issues arise out of the inspection, as the buyer, **you’ll need to identify the biggest concerns** and ask yourself: If any issues were to go unaddressed, how would it impede my ability to move forward smoothly? From there, **you’ll essentially renegotiate with the seller to either make those repairs or give you a credit toward the repairs**.

All in all, the inspection is instrumental in letting you know the exact condition of the home and about anything you weren’t aware of beforehand, so you’ll be comfortable with what you’re getting into.
