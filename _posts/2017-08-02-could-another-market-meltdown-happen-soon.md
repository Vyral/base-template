With housing prices slowing down, a lot of people are asking themselves if there is a meltdown coming in the housing market. After the crash in 2007, we had a few really bad years. **Since 2010 however, the market has been on a strong run.**

The San Antonio real estate market is pretty stable with mostly single-digit appreciation levels on an annual basis. Inventory is still pretty low, however, for both resale homes and bank-owned properties. During a slowdown, you’ll see an increase in the number of bank-owned properties. **That hasn’t happened yet.**

Will another meltdown happen soon? It’s hard to say. What we do know is that the primary factor that led to the last meltdown, bad lending, has since been corrected. Lending guidelines are much stricter now. However, the market is cyclical and there will always be ups and downs.
