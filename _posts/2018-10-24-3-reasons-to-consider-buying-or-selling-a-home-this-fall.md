Are you seeing fewer "for-sale" signs now that the summer is over? If so, that can be great news for buyers who are looking to purchase a property or sellers who want to sell their old property in order to purchase a new one. If you think you’ve missed the boat on making that move this year, we’re here to tell you that buying or selling this fall can work for you. **Here are three great reasons to consider it:**

**1. Tax breaks.** If you're a homebuyer who closes before December 31, you may get a nice write-off on your taxes. Any payments made prior to the closing of your loan are tax-deductible. There are also potential tax breaks for home sellers. Your closing costs and home improvements can be great write-offs as well.

<br>**2. &nbsp;The right price.** If you're a seller and establish a smart pricing strategy, your home could stand out from the crowd and sell quickly while other homes are languishing on the market. Buyers may also have a better time getting a home within their budget because when there’s less competition for homes, there’s less of a chance of a bidding war or a sale above asking price.

**3. Less competition.** While it’s true that there are fewer homes on the market in the fall, there are also fewer buyers out there competing for the same home. This gives buyers an important edge. For sellers, the benefit is that the buyers who are out there tend to be more serious.

If you have any questions whatsoever or if you’re considering making a home sale and/or purchase this fall, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
