Today we want to talk about how the real estate game has changed over the last 40 years. We’ve been helping people buy and sell homes for a long time, so we wanted to share some of our experiences with you.&nbsp;

One of the biggest things that have changed is that everything used to be analog as opposed to digital. We used typewriters and paper to keep track of everything; we even used to mail our listings into the MLS\! When a client wanted to list a home, they would have to wait at least two weeks for the mail to arrive.&nbsp;

One of the things we included in our mail package was a single, black-and-white picture of the home. Pictures were more expensive, so we had to make sure we got things right the first time.&nbsp;

**Buying has changed a lot too.** There were no buyer-specific brokers, so if you wanted to buy a home, you would come into my office and have a conversation. From there, we would wait for a huge book filled with all the MLS listings to arrive. It usually came on Friday, so if you walked in on a Monday morning, you were going to have to wait a long time.

The standard commission also used to be 7%. The listing agent would get 4%, and the buyer agent would get 3%. Nowadays, people think 6% is a lot, but this just goes to show how much things have changed.&nbsp;

Right now, we have historically low interest rates. **However, back around 1979, things climbed as high as 17%\!** Inflation was pretty crazy back then, and it took a long time for rates to fall back down. When interest rates finally got back into the single digits, people were lined up outside the bank and waiting to take advantage.&nbsp;

We have a lot of experience in this market, and it seems like many people today are worried that high inflation will lead to crazy interest rates like we saw back in 1979. **In our opinion, the situation is pretty different.** Rates may go up in 2022, but they certainly won’t go up like they did back then.&nbsp;

It’s still a great time to buy a home. If you want to take advantage of our 40+ years of experience, please call or email us. We are always willing to help\!
