Today I want to talk about another strategy you as a buyer can do to avoid the frustration caused by no houses being for sale.

You need to **find an agent who knows how to find properties “under the radar.”** They need to be able to network for you by networking with the other agents who are working in the neighborhoods where you want to live. They need to do things like knock on doors, send mail, and advertise on Facebook.

Most neighborhoods where we live also have neighborhood Listservs. If you can find an agent who can utilize Listserv, that would help tremendously.

For example, I’m working with a family right now who wants to live in a particular location, so I asked them for information about themselves that I could share. They told me about where they want their kids to go to school, why they want to be able to walk to certain restaurants and a certain metro stop, etc. All of the things they want I’ve included in a note, and you can do the same thing with your agent.

**Give them your story and tell them what you want. Find an agent who will knock on doors, send mail, advertise on Facebook and scour the neighborhood Listservs for you.**

Be on the lookout for my next episode of *"What’s Working Now!”* where you’ll discover other emerging trends in market. If you’re thinking of buying or selling or have any questions in the meantime, please feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help!
