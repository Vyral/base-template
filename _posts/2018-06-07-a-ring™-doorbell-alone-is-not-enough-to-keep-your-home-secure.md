We are joined by Ryan Byes of WatchPoint Surveillance to teach you the difference between a standard Ring™ doorbell and a true security system.

To start this conversation, is there a difference between the cheap Ring™ doorbell that I have and love versus a true security system?

Ryan says there is one really marked difference. While the Ring™ doorbells are great for some applications, **the video footage is not court admissible in the State of Colorado**. This means that if someone steals something from your front porch, you cannot use the footage in court.

Why?

According to Ryan, Ring™ doorbells do not meet two requirements of Colorado state law to be used in court. The first is a time and date stamp. And the second is a watermark. The watermark proves that the video has not been tampered with.

Which would you rather have? Brian thinks that the court admissible option is better.

Also, **the Ring™ system is a monthly service and therefore requires a monthly fee for storage**.

Meanwhile, Ryan tells us **that an actual security system will not require a monthly fee** and will record high-quality, HD images which can be viewed through an app.

If you are considering which security system you want, you should contact Ryan at WatchPoint Security by calling (719) 579-6540 or online at [watchpointdata.com](https://www.watchpointdata.com/).

If you have any questions or comments for us, please contact us by phone or email. We look forward to speaking with you soon.
