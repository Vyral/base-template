If you’re selling your home, it’s important that you use professional photography to market it. 

We’ve all seen bad photos of homes online that were obviously taken by an agent just walking through the interior and snapping away with their cell phones. Here’s why that doesn’t work—**90% of all homebuyers start their search online.** This means your home’s first showing is, in effect, online. Professional photography will help show your home in its best light online and excite people enough to want to visit it in person.

Our team works with a professional photographer for all of our listings who edits all of our photos exactly how we want and makes our clients’ homes look straight out of a magazine. We prefer not to use wide-angle lenses when taking photos because that makes rooms look twice as big and distorts the photo itself. 

Also, keep in mind that just because someone is a great photographer doesn’t mean they’re a great real estate photographer. Make sure the person taking your home’s photos does real estate photography for a living. **If you go the extra mile and find someone who specializes in this area, you’ll get better results.**
