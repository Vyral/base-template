It's that time of yearâ€”the time for our Valentine Love Fest for our clients (past and present), our friends, and our family! This year marks the third annual appreciation party for members of our loyalty club.

 As you might remember, we'll give you a big box of chocolates that you can keep for yourself or give to your sweetheart as an early Valentine's Day gift.

 The party is coming up on Tuesday, February 7th from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Other than your big box of chocolates, we'll also have drinks, champagne, and chocolate-covered strawberries. It'll be a great time to come by after work and unwind with some chocolate and champagne.

 All we ask is  that you fill out this form so we can be sure we have enough candy for everyone!

This year, we will have two locations to make it even more convenient for you to pick up your gift! You can either come to our Benton County pickup location at 5247 W. Metro Park Crossing, Rogers, AR 72758 or our Washington County pick up location at 3291 S. Thompson Street Suite D104 in Springdale.

 We look forward to seeing you there!
