We’re excited to announce that we’ve been able to secure extra funding for many of our sellers who also want to buy. When they need to both buy and sell, plenty of people get a little stuck on what to do. In a listing presentation, you’ll often hear how to do a contingency sale, and **although we do contingency sales all the time, they can be a bit stressful** because they may make the offer on your next home purchase less powerful.&nbsp;

However, bridge financing or bridge loans can help you; we can secure trade-ins and bridge loans from a very trusted source. Your first option is to trade in your home, meaning you’ll list it, then sell it after we’ve secured funding for the new property so your offer doesn’t have to be contingent, and we’re one of the few teams in the area that can do this. Second, you can do a bridge loan, which will give you the money to do repairs on your home before you list so that you can net more from your sale. In the end, when we look at the whole transaction, **you’ll have more money in your pocket when utilizing these funding tools.&nbsp;**

Money is a tool, and if you use it right, you can save more of it. Quite a few of our high net worth clients take advantage of these options, and you can too. Our goal is to keep more money in your pocket and have it working for you.&nbsp;

If you want us to go into more detail about these options or have any questions, please reach out via phone or email. We’d love to have a conversation with you.
