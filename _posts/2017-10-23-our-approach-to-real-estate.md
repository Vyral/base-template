What is my team’s approach to real estate? That’s what I’m going to talk about today.

As we head toward the winter months, the fall real estate market continues to be strong in Albany. Our inventory is limited, which is good news for sellers. Interest rates have remained very low as well, which is good news for buyers. Instead of giving you a more detailed look at the market, I wanted to answer a question I hear all the time. **People want to know, “How does your team do what it does?”**

My team of 13 agents may be small, but it is also mighty. We are the No. 3 ranked time in the state of New York. The biggest reason we were able to have this accomplishment is the people on our team and our culture.

There is a wealth of knowledge and then some on my team. Over a third of our team have Master’s degrees, which is practically unheard of in the real estate business. The people on our team believe in our business and believe that we will achieve more when we work together.

**I have a great story to share about how my team utilizes their wealth of knowledge to benefit our clients.** We were recently working with some buyers who hit a snag during the inspection period. A radon system needed to be installed, but the contracted company wouldn’t be able to install it for three weeks. If we waited three weeks to close, this deal would fall through.

So, our agents got on the phone. One of them ended up being on the phone until 11 p.m. the night before closing. That dedication produced results, as we got everything on track by getting a system installed that only delayed closing by 24 hours.

This story speaks volumes to how we do what we do. We’re dedicated to our clients. Most agents would have given up when they heard that closing would be delayed three weeks. **That’s what makes our team different.**

Finally, a quick announcement. Going forward, you won’t be seeing my face as much. Of course, I’ll still be bringing you two videos per month. You just won’t be seeing my old mug on our yard signs from now on. I’ve come to a realization that my face doesn’t need to be on there anymore because my team isn’t just me. I want something that will better represent us as a whole.

If you have any questions for me or anyone on my team or if you’re interested in buying or selling a home in Albany, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
