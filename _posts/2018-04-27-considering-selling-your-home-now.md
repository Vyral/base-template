*Should you sell your home? Find out in my latest video why the answer is “yes.”*

“Is this a good time to sell my home?” The answer is “Yes!” The reason why you want to sell your home now is that conditions have created the perfect opportunity for you as a seller or a buyer.

Homeowners are now at their highest point of equity in homeownership over the last 10 years. If you were thinking about selling, this is the time. You can use that equity to go purchase another home.

Also, **interest rates are still at all-time lows.** This makes it more affordable for you as a homebuyer, especially if you are upgrading. When purchasing a new home with lower interest rates, you have the perfect opportunity to transition into a new home and make it very affordable. As the interest rates rise, you can find yourself selling your house, moving out, and paying more for your next home. That’s definitely not a good idea, so you want to make sure that you to are able sell now, while the market is in your favor.

The next reason why you want to sell your home now is that **buyers are actively looking.** We have actually sort of reached the peak of sales prices so we don’t expect the market to rise much further in terms of actual sales prices in terms of what you can get for your home. You want to jump in now that we are at an all-time high so that you can get the most value and the highest possible sales price out of your home.
