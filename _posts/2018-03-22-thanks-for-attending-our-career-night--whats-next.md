Thank you for attending our career night. You may be thinking, “So, what’s the next step?”&nbsp;

If you have not taken our pre-licensing course, you’ll want to get that done. **Go to [TeamLally.com/class](http://my-referral.link/AbeLeeSeminars/69s6r) to get a 20% discount on the course.&nbsp;**

If you’ve already passed the class and all the licensing tests, just send an email to [admin@teamlally.com](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(97,100,109,105,110,64,116,101,97,109,108,97,108,108,121,46,99,111,109))) to schedule an interview with Keller Williams CEO Kevin Miyama.&nbsp;

**Thinking about joining Team Lally?** Go to [TeamLally.com](https://www.teamlally.com/)&nbsp;and remember—follow the steps! &nbsp;

Again, thank you for attending our career night. Our next career night is going to be on May 7.
