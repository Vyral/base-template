Being a homeowner comes with a lot of responsibilities. I’ll go over seven important things that new homeowners should know today.

Today I want to talk about a few important things that new homeowners may not know they need to do.

**1. Save for unexpected problems.** You can’t stop the dishwasher from breaking, but you can set some cash aside to pay for unexpected replacements.

**2. Form an inspection habit.** Detecting problems early can be the difference between a simple fix and an unfortunate disaster.

**3. Buy a bunch of furnace filters.** Changing your furnace filter regularly is one of the easiest ways to save a bunch of money. You can order these in bulk on Amazon.

**4. Get to know your appliances.** Just like cars and TVs, the appliances in your home all have different life expectancies. For example, furnaces last 15 to 20 years. Knowing the age and condition of your appliances is important.

**5. Take advantage of tax credits.** Did you know that you can receive tax credits for things like solar panels and Energy Star appliances? Do some research early on and find the different tax credits that may apply to you.

**6. Start keeping records of every improvement or repair you make.** From adding caulk around the bathtub to installing a new roof, these updates will increase the resale value of your home. Make sure that your hard work pays off by keeping track of that from the start.

**7. Beef up your insurance.** Take a look at your homeowners insurance policy and look for relevant gaps. Two important areas of coverage to consider are flood protection and fire protection. Those are not usually included in standard policies.
