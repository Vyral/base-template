**Do you have a friend or family member who is thinking about buying a home, or refinancing their current home?** I build my business by referral, so if you know of someone who could use the expert advise of a mortgage lender or finance officer, please forward this email to them, or reply back with their contact information and I'll gently reach out to them. If you have any questions about the mortgage and finance industry, please don't hesitate to give me a call. I'd be more than happy to provide a Consultation.

Today I want to quickly touch on something I hear about all the time, the Zillow Zestimate. People always check their home’s value on Zillow, but **I would be careful and highly recommend not taking it too seriously.**

**There are cases where the Zestimate is accurate, but those are few and far between.** Zillow’s estimates don’t take into account any upgrades or improvements you’ve made to the property, nor do they have the most accurate housing data.

**It’s fun to look around to get an idea of what your home may sell for, but don’t use your Zestimate to make any decisions.** If you want to know the true market value of your home, I recommend that you connect with a local Realtor. I have relationships with some of the best agents in the Portland area, **and would love to connect you with one.**

If you have any questions for me about your home value or any other topic, give us a call or send us an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
