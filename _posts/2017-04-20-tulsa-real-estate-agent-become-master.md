Deciding to start my day earlier than usual was a great decision. It has allowed me to take back my mornings and be more productive throughout the day.

Although it can be a difficult challenge, being able to master your morning will start to change your life. I know from experience. Years ago, I figured out that I needed to take control of my mornings back.

If you have children like I do, you know that they don’t move at the pace that we want them to in the morning a lot of times. They go at their own pace, and there’s nothing you can really do to change that. Yelling at my daughter to hustle up and get ready was turning me into a mean mom. I’ve found that strategy often backfires and leads to meltdowns, tears, and that it wasn’t the right solution.

**Instead, I decided to take control of myself and my mornings by getting up earlier.** By waking up early enough to be able to start my day on my own and then be able to get my daughter going on her day has made life so much better. Of course, she still moves a little slow, but getting up earlier allows me to have the time to better myself and not feel so rushed.

One of the common themes of successful people is that a lot of them get up really early in the morning. Setting my alarm for 5 a.m. every day was the key for me to getting my day started. Then once I get in the office, I can stay focused on lead generation.

As you’ve probably heard if you’re a KW agent, Gary Keller preaches prospecting and says that you must set aside time each day to generate leads. Doing this for three to four hours per day can seem overwhelming, so just start small with 30 minutes of lead generation in the morning and work your way up. **I personally time block two hours in the morning for lead generation, as well as an hour after lunch to follow up with leads and other emails.**

If you’re able to get all of that accomplished in the morning, you can free your afternoons off for generating more business or simply taking an afternoon off. Enjoy your free time while you have it, because the reality in this business is that you might be working this weekend.

I hope these tips are helpful to you. **I promise that if you implement them, you will have an awesome morning, a great day, a big business, and a wonderful life.** If you have any questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
