The market has changed. It's not horrible, but it is different. Sellers can't compare what's happening today to your neighbor’s sale a few months ago. What do the current market dynamics mean for sellers?&nbsp;

Let’s talk about the rule of 18. If it takes 18 showings to sell a home in a tight market, you might have 18 showings on the first day it's on the market, so by the weekend, you've had more than 18 showings and there may be multiple offers.

In our current market, you may still get 18 showings, but they're not going to happen in the first weekend. It might take a few weeks to a month and a half. That can be an indication that your house might not be priced right. **The reality is that things are still moving, but they just take longer.** Setting expectations is the main thing I'm talking about with sellers, but we also talk about how to make the house look its best, how to price it right, and how to get maximum exposure. Those are the things that we're going to be talking about as we create your seller strategy.

It's still a great time to sell, and there are still plenty of opportunities, but you need to bring your A-game and start preparing now with a trusted professional to come up with a strategy that works for you. If you have any questions, reach out to us by phone or email. We’d love to help you.
