  Cutting the cord to my cable subscription was one of the best decisions I’ve
  made in a while. Here’s why you should consider doing it, too.

I’m a proud cord cutter, and I’m here to tell you my story today.

Let me preface this by saying that I hate DirecTV. We cancelled our subscription last year and haven’t looked back since. In the end, it was too expensive, they were too hard to contact, etc. They make it impossible for you to do anything and it’s just a racket. **Aside from the ethical reasons of switching away from as service like this, cutting the cord offers you flexibility.**

Although you will still have to pay for internet, there are plenty of ways to get TV without paying cable bills. **We’ve tried Sling, Hulu, Fubo, and have finally settled on YouTube TV.** It allows us to get all of our local channels, all of our local sports, comes with unlimited DVR storage, and more. With YouTube TV, we’re only paying around $40 per month vs. paying over $200 per month with DirecTV. It also allows us to watch on our tablets, phones, and more.

In addition, we also have Netflix and Amazon Prime for more entertainment options. With those three services combined, we pay about $50 per month and don’t have to pay the high cable prices that we had been for years.

**I imagine that as 2019 continues, more and more people will take this route.** If these cable companies don’t change their model, there’s no doubt that they’ll be out of business soon.
