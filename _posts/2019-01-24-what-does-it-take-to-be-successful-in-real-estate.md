Here are the three keys to success in the real estate business:
{: .present-before-paste}

**1. Your business plan.** If you don’t know where you are or where you’re going, you can probably expect a pretty bumpy ride along the way. In today’s economy, that means failure for most small businesses. If you have a business plan from the start, you’re much more likely to succeed.

**2. Proper education.** You need the training and team to get you to your goals. After you develop your business plan, you need the right education to develop the needed skills to achieve your goals. That’s what we specialize in here at KW Carmel Valley. Our high-level training includes trainers such as the National Association of Realtors’ trainer of the year. We have team members who specialize in every aspect of real estate, from new home development to commercial leasing. We have the top real estate agents in the entire county here, and they’re willing to share their expertise with you.

**3. Accountability.** This is the one key component that drives the whole machine. Some people can’t stay accountable on their own, so here at KW Carmel Valley, we have an accountability program of coaches and mentors that ensure you hit the numbers you need to achieve your goals. After all, a wish is just a dream. A goal is a dream with a plan, and here at KW Carmel Valley, our job is to help you hit your goals to make a better life for you and your family.
