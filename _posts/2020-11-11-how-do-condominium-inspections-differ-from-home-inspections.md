<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s how condominium inspections differ from single-family home inspections.</em></p>

What’s the difference between a single-family home inspection and a condominium inspection?

With a condominium inspection, the main difference is that **the buyer doesn’t have ownership of the structure.** The roof, foundation, walls, etc., are owned and managed by the homeowners association (HOA). That’s why you pay your HOA fees—that money goes toward things like painting, roofing, and overall maintenance.&nbsp;

Think of it this way: Everything from the sheetrock inward is your responsibility; everything else is the HOA’s responsibility. If there’s a leak under the sink, that’s your responsibility. If there’s a leak in the wall, that’s the HOA’s responsibility. In almost all circumstances, the only structural item that falls under the responsibility of the buyer is the windows. In some condominiums, the HVAC unit is located in a mechanical room that’s exterior to the living space. In this case, that’s the buyer’s responsibility.

Additionally, **a condominium inspection won’t be as thorough as a single-family home inspection,** although I’ve seen many inspectors make comments about areas that are the HOA’s responsibility. If nothing else, the comments for these areas will give you an idea of what to check on as far as the HOA’s plans for them.&nbsp;
