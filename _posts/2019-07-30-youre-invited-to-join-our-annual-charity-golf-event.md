It’s that time of year again—**our annual Tessier Team Foundation charity golf event is coming up on September 13 at Mountain Branch Golf Club.** As you know, our foundation’s mission is to enrich and empower our local youth, and this tournament is a great way to give back to the community and have some fun doing so. Registration is at 10:30 a.m., and we’ll have a shotgun start at 12:00 p.m. Lunch and dinner will also be provided.&nbsp;

**If you’re interested in playing, Kim Georg at (410) 790-0714 to register and find out more information.** 100% of what we raise goes to the kids, so we hope we’ll see you there.&nbsp;

If you have any questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
