A big source of business can come through a demographic farm, or “demo farm.” Unfortunately, whenever I mention this to agents I’m coaching, I often get some strange looks. I then realize that I’ve brought up a concept that isn’t exactly common knowledge, so I’d like to clear it up for everyone today.

A geographic farm refers to people who live in proximity to one another—think neighborhoods. A demo farm is like this but not geographic: **It’s a connection through something else.** It could be that they all speak a certain language, drive a certain car, or own certain animals as pets. Anything that bonds people together can be referred to as a demo farm.

If you can identify a common characteristic that draws people together—having college-aged kids, for instance—and you share that characteristic as well, **then you have identified a demo farm that can produce great results for your real estate business.** You can gather these people’s contact information and emphasize your commonalities when you market to them. People do business with those they know, like, and trust. And when you share something you have in common, others can’t help but know, like, and trust you.
