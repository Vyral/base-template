Today we’ve got a quick recap of the first quarter here in the Ft. Worth market to share with you.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>In January, we had 2,785 properties on the market with 632 selling. In February, we had 2,749 properties on the market and 807 of them sold. Finally, in March, we had 3,046 properties on the market, 996 of which sold. **That’s a big month-to-month increase in sold properties for the first quarter**.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The average sales price for homes in March 2016 was $180,000 and it increased slightly to $205,515 this March. However, the number of properties on the market this March fell 1.6% from March of 2016. The number of sold properties fell by 6.5%.

<br>&nbsp;
<br>Even though the number of sold properties decreased year over year, that number increased every month in the first quarter of 2017. That’s why **now is such a great time to sell your house****.** If you hire the right real estate agent, they will price your home accurately so that only qualified buyers come to view it.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Hopefully this gives you a better perspective of what’s going on in our market. If you have any questions or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in our market, give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to hear from you!
