A question I hear a lot these days is whether we’re in a housing bubble. I can understand people misinterpreting some of the signs in our current market and fearing another 2008. I sat down with special guest Rick Scherer from OnTo Mortgage to talk about whether there is a housing bubble coming and what it means for you.
