The latest numbers are in for the northern Virginia real estate market. I’m going to share them with you and show you how these numbers have changed from this time last year.

There is a lot of data to go through, so for the sake of this post **we looked at three specific numbers (inventory, days on market, average sale price) in three specific counties (Fairfax, Loudoun, and Arlington).** Let’s start with Arlington County.

Inventory is down 10% from this time last year in Arlington County. When inventory goes down, demand tends to go up. However, the average days on market in Arlington County remained the same as last year. The average sale price, though, went up by a staggering 22% in the last year.

In Fairfax County, inventory is down by 15% from last year while the average days on market is down by 17%. Sales are up by 5.5% as well.

Finally, in Loudoun County, inventory is down by 31% from last year while the average days on market is 31% lower. The average sale price for single-family homes here is up 7.5%.

If you've been thinking about selling and wondering if now is the time, it absolutely is. The numbers are up across the board. **There is less inventory, homes are selling quicker, and they are selling for more money.** If you have a great marketing plan when it comes time to sell your home, you should be able to within a few weeks. That’s all it has been taking us to sell homes as of late.

If you have any other questions for us about the market or how you can take advantage of these historic conditions by selling high and locking in a low interest rate when you buy, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.
