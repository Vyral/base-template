I’m excited to talk to you about something near and dear to my heart. The Truckee Rotary is a community organization that I’m very passionate about. One of our biggest events of the year is coming up, and I wanted to talk to you about it today. I also wanted to tell you about just a little bit of what we do at the Truckee Rotary.<br><br>**The Truckee Rotary is actually one of the biggest community service groups here in Truckee.** It was founded back in 1978 and has over 100 active members. We have raised over $650,000 since 2001 and every dime has gone to the community. Some projects we’ve been able to sponsor so far include the Truckee Legacy Trail, local youth sports clubs, and our local food shelter.

Every year, we hold a fundraiser in order to give back even more to the local community. It’s called the Cadillac Ball. This year’s theme is Voodoo so come dressed as a witch doctor or in your regular, semi-formal attire. Either way, it’s going to be a great time. **The event will be on October 28th at 5 p.m. at The Resort at Squaw Creek.**

In addition to great food, cocktails, and auctions, we’ll also be holding a raffle for a $10,000 grand prize. Get in touch with me if you’d like to buy a raffle ticket. They are $50 a piece.
