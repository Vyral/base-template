When you hire an agent to sell your home, you should be sure that the agent has a full-time marketing specialist devoted only to that agent’s clients.

What are some of the benefits that an exclusive, full-time marketing specialist can provide? As an example, I’d like to talk about our marketing specialist, Mike Hauptman.

Mike has been our marketing specialist for the past two and a half years, and he is a marketing and internet guru. He manages our Facebook, Tumblr, Pinterest and blog accounts for our listings, and is fantastic at taking the information and the professional photography for all of our sellers and using it to provide top-notch marketing all over the world.

As a matter of fact, our team has actually sold four homes online over the last 18 months, without buyers having even seen them in-person!

Mike is also a Zillow virtuoso. This is important to us because Zillow has really become the national MLS, and Mike has managed our account beautifully. He even provides integrated marketing, like ‘coming soon’ teasers for homes that haven’t been listed yet.

Perhaps most importantly, Mike has also been great at placing sellers at the top of national search sites, ensuring premiere placement everywhere exclusively for our clients.

If you have any questions about what else a great marketing specialist can do get your home maximum exposure, or you have any other real estate-related questions, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help you!
