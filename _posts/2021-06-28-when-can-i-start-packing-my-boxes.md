When a home seller accepts an offer on their home, they typically get really excited and start packing their boxes in anticipation of their move. However, it’s very important to not pack them too early and refrain from destaging the home until all contingencies have been removed.

**If you’re packing up all your boxes and basically tearing apart the presentation that the buyer saw and their agent sees, they’re going to realize that they’re in a stronger position of power because you have been mentally moving forward with your move.&nbsp;**

Keep the property as-is until all contingencies are removed. Once the buyer has done that, then you can actually start packing up your boxes, destaging, and having work done on the property. Without proper guidance, this could put a hiccup in your transaction.

**When you hire a Realtor, you’re hiring a professional negotiator.** When a buyer’s Realtor sees that you are mentally moving forward, it gives them a better opportunity to ask for more in repairs or further price reductions and probably get them.

If you have any questions for me about selling your home or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
