It’s time to get your home in market-ready shape, but where do you start? Today I’ll list eight home improvement projects you can complete in just one hour or less:

**1\. Bathroom walk-through.** Start by examining the caulking around your tub or shower. If the caulking looks discolored or is just an eyesore in either area, remove it and replace it with new water-soluble caulking.&nbsp;

**2\. Add an accent wall.** If you feel like your house could use a little extra character when it comes to its colors, turn one of your living room or bathroom walls into an accent wall. But be careful not to get paint-happy and give every room its own accent wall. In addition, stay away from brighter colors. Buyers will want to see a more muted, neutral hue.&nbsp;

**3\. Replace and clean screens.** If you have torn window screens, make sure those come down and are replaced. If they’re intact and you plan to leave them up for showings, they’ll need to be spotless. Be sure to let the sunlight in through any view windows you might have by temporarily removing your screens. Buyers will find natural light attractive and screens get in the way of it coming through. &nbsp;

**4\. Touch up the sheetrock.** Walk through your home and keep an eye out for “nail pops” in the sheetrock and use touch-up paint where necessary. You’ll also want to be sure that the shade you’re using matches the original color. A common issue we see is door handles that have gone through the sheetrock, and fixing that should be a top concern if your home has the same issue. Sheetrock repairs can be a tricky job, so if you don’t have the proper experience, I’d suggest hiring someone to fix it for you.

**5\. Add adhesive carpet to your wood steps in place of Pledge.** Some buyers aren’t used to wood steps, so making them slippery by spraying Pledge won’t do anything but make them more anxious at the thought of having wood stairs. &nbsp;

**6\. Replace old electrical covers.** Over time, they often develop a yellow tint. If they’re the outdated round models, consider replacing them with a more modern-looking option. Additionally, think about adding dimmer switches to main areas like the dining room or kitchen.&nbsp;

**7\. Touch up your landscaping**. If you’re selling during the warmer months, trim your bushes, edge your yard, and plant some new flowers. Remember that your yard will be the first thing a buyer will see when they pull up to your home, so your curb appeal should be pleasantly eye-catching.&nbsp;

**8\. Purchase some inexpensive solar lights.** Then, you can run them down your sidewalk up to your front door.&nbsp;
