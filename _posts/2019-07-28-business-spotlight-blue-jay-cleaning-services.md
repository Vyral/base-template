Blue JayCleaning Services has been around in the Tulsa area and the Oklahoma City Metro area for about three years. They offer recurring residential services, as well as move-out cleaning and make-ready cleaning, which is done before your home goes on the market. In addition, they also do small office commercial services.

**Here at the Wolek Group, we love helping our clients get their homes ready in the pre-listing period, and cleaning is no small part of that process.** Whether you’re preparing to sell your home and move or you just want to simplify, Blue Jay’s owner Britt Greenwood says that decluttering is the way to go. This is especially important if you’re planning to sell your home. Look at your countertops in the kitchen—a good rule of thumb is to have no more than two or three appliances on them.

**In the bathroom, try not to have more than a handful of items on your surfaces,** including your shower. When you sell your home, you need to live in it differently than you would if you weren’t planning to move.

As you’re decluttering the home, pack things in moving boxes to help speed up the moving process. When filled, these boxes can be stored in the garage or in an out-of-the-way storage area.

**It’s also a good idea to make a list of things that need to be done in your home regarding renovations, repairs, and touch-ups.** Be sure to have all those things done before you have a professional house cleaner visit your home, since trade workers can sometimes leave a mess.

If you’d like to contact Britt for an estimate, reach out to her by phone at (918) 277-3378, visit her website at **[www.BlueJayCleaning.com](https://bluejaycleaning.com/){: target="_blank"}**, or visit her Facebook page. One-time cleanings can be discussed over the phone, but if you have need of a recurring service, she or one of her staff members can come visit your home to see what needs to be done.

For any questions you have for me or the Wolek Group at large, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you\!<br>&nbsp;
