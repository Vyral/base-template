What does a typical day in the life of a real estate agent look like?

It really depends on whether the agent is a part-time agent or a full-time agent who is always busy. Today, I’ll give you a snapshot of the life of a full-time agent.

The first thing most agents do is wake up and go to the office. Agents can go to the office as early as 7 a.m., or they may get to the office at 9 a.m.

One of the first things they do when they get there is return any urgent emails or things that have come in from the night before.

As soon as they get through those, they will start generating more leads. Like any small business owner, **the most important thing a real estate agent can do is keep their client base growing.** Otherwise, they’ll run out of business. A typical agent spends about an hour and a half or two hours prospecting for new business.

Prospecting can take 10 or 12 different forms, from calling past clients to check in or asking for referrals all the way down to handwritten notes or marketing activities, like social media posts and website inquiry follow-up.

Once that’s done, the agent will get back to returning emails, phone calls, and text messages from clients, title companies, lenders, home inspectors, etc.

If they have time, the agent will take a lunch break. It can be hard to take a lunch as a full-time agent because our days tend to be a little chaotic.

After lunch, the agent will return remaining phone calls and emails before going on appointments. **Appointments and showings are usually reserved for afternoons and evenings.** If there aren’t any appointments until the evening, we might do some research. We might figure out the market value of a home or do analytical offer research, where we figure out what the house is worth before we help a buyer structure an offer.

Then, we go and do what everyone thinks agents do all day: We show homes or go on listing appointments. We don’t have showings or listing appointments every day, but we do have a few throughout the week.

Sometimes, agents are able to get home at a reasonable hour for dinner with the family. However, we often have to meet clients in the evening or on weekends for showings and listing appointments.

As a full-time agent, you have to be super flexible with your schedule. It’s important to have conversations with your spouse to make sure that you are both on the same page and can handle that flexible schedule.
