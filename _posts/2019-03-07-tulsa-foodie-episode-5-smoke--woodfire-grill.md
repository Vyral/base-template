We love Tulsa. We love food. And we really love featuring local restaurants. 

For today’s “Tulsa Foodie” feature, we’re shining the spotlight on “<u><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://smokewoodfiregrill.com/">SMOKE. Woodfire Grill</a></strong></u>” here on Cherry Street. With the help of Chef Tim, the restaurant’s culinary craftsman, we’ll get to know more about SMOKE. and go on a little tour as well. I’m so excited to acquaint you with this wonderful restaurant! 

Tim joined the SMOKE. team a year and a half ago, and the restaurant itself has existed on Cherry Street for close to eight years, where it has built up its reputation as a preeminent restaurant in Tulsa. **They boast a full-service experience with a bar and cigar lounge to complement their outstanding food.** 

And no matter what time or day of the week you’d like to stop in, SMOKE. can oblige: They serve lunch and dinner seven days a week and are open a little earlier on weekends to serve brunch options. **In Tim’s own words, they “have a little bit of everything to offer everybody.”**

Some of Tim’s personal menu favorites come from their steak selections, but he was excited to share some other novel choices that give SMOKE. its signature feel. Many people don’t realize that, as Tim points out, beyond the meat and potatoes cookery, they offer some great vegan dishes including their vegan cauliflower steak. 

From the moment you walk into SMOKE., you’ll notice a delightfully smoky smell. **This permeates from their Aztec grill from which their chefs cook over an open fire.** This really draws out an unmatchable amount of flavor in the food they serve, Tim says. 

Now, we’re going to take a look around and get to know SMOKE. inside and out as well as check out their recent remodel. You can begin viewing our brief tour at 3:53 in the video.
