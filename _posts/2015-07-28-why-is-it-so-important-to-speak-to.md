We're continually getting great questions from our friends and clients, and we love to answer them. Today, the question is, "Why should I talk to a lender before buying a house?"

First, you need to talk to a lender so you know your buying ability. The last thing you want to do is waste a bunch of time looking for homes in the wrong price range.

Secondly, you want to be sure that you're able to place an offer on the home you find. Don't wait until you're ready to buy to get pre-approved. Have your finances in order, and be ready to submit a letter of pre-approval when making an offer so the seller knows you're serious.

Lastly, see a lender to make sure you are a strong buyer in a multiple offer situation. If you don't want to miss out on the home of your dreams, you need to work with a lender to ensure that doesn't happen!

If you have any questions about real estate in our area, or if you need real estate assistance of any kind, don't hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to hear from you!
