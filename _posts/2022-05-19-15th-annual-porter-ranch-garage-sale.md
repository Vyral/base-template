Last month was our 15th annual Porter Ranch Garage Sale Extravaganza in which 38 families participated in our neighborhood yard sale. This is one of our favorite community events as it allows so many neighbors to get out, interact, and meet with other neighbors. Plus, you never know what treasures you might find. We took care of all of the advertising including the LA Daily News, several portals online, provided directional maps, and of course over 200 directional signs.
