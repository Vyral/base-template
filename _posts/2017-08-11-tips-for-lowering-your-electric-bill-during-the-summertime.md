The first thing that usually comes to mind in the summertime is going to the beach, vacations, and relaxing by the pool. I used to think the same thing. That is, until I became a homeowner and got my first summer electric bill.

In Florida, they charge you more during the summer for your electric bill than they do in the wintertime. I’ve got a list of tips that will help reduce the sticker shock on your bill during the summer.

**1. Try running your pool pump for only six hours a day.**

**2. Set your A/C to 78 degrees or higher.** The best temperature during the day is at 82 degrees, and 75 to 77 degrees at night.

**3. Turn the thermostat down on your hot water heater from 140 to 120 degrees.**

**4. Clean and replace your A/C filter every other month.**

**5. Turn off the fans whenever you leave a room.**

**6. Replace the old showerheads in the shower to new, water-saving showerheads.**

**7. Adjust the amount of load water your washing machine uses.**

**8. Clean your dryer lint filter before each use.**

**9. Replace your old light bulbs with newer, more efficient bulbs.** If you are unable to do any of the other items on the list, at least do this one. It will help immensely.

I hope these tips can help you with lowering your electric bill. If you have any other questions or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I’d be happy to help!
