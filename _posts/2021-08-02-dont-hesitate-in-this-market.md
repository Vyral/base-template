Has hesitation ever cost you money? I'll tell you how you can avoid what I call WCS or “Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda Syndrome."

Last year, I could have bought an air conditioning unit for my home for $3,800. This year, when I went to purchase the same unit, it cost $1,000 more. The same thing happens in the housing market.

I've worked with clients in the past year who have hesitated and held back on purchasing a home, and then, when they were ready to engage, they found that the prices had increased. In this area, home prices have appreciated about 16% over the last year.

How do you avoid WCS Syndrome? When I first bought a home, it wasn't my dream home, but I was happy to be able to get into the market, hold on to it, and watch the value appreciate. **Don’t hesitate if you’re thinking about getting into the market**.

If you'd like to find out what you can qualify to purchase or if you have any other questions, please contact me at (775) 790-0574 or [<u>visit my website</u>](http://northernnevadahousehunters.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. I'll be happy to help you and guide you through that situation.
