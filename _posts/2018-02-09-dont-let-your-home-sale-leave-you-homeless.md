When it comes time to make a move, many people have concerns. One concern they have is that if they purchase a new home, they may be stuck with two properties in the event they’re unable to sell their current home. Another thing people worry about is that they’ll end up homeless if they sell their current home and fail to find another.

This brings me to a question I’ve been hearing a lot lately, which is, **“How can I avoid ending up stuck with two homes or homeless when it’s time to make a move?”**

Thankfully, my team and I have ways to alleviate these fears. If you’re worried about ending up with two homes, don’t be. When you work with us, **we will make the new purchase contingent upon the closing of your current home.**

Now, let’s address the second common fear. Low inventory conditions have certainly made it difficult for some to find a new home after selling their previous residence, but my team and I have a solution. We can set up a reverse contingency for you. What this means is that **when we get an offer on your home, we’ll make the sale contingent upon you finding a new home.**

This will give you time to find a new home before your sale goes through. And if for whatever reason you do end up being unable to find a new home, the sale does not have to proceed. My team and I want to ensure that you are never stuck in an unfavorable situation.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
