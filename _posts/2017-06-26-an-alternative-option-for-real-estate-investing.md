We offer a service in our business called **The 1+ Program** designed for clients interested in investing in real estate and accumulating wealth over time with it. It's straightforward and low-risk compared to other types of investments and it doesn't require tens of thousands of dollars.

The 1+ Program is named very literally; the aim is for you to own one property in addition to your primary residence. Over the last 17 years, we've really seen how significant it can be for homeowners. **Many use the money to pay for college tuition or to retire** faster, or better, than their current savings and investments would allow.

We're very passionate about this topic, so we'd love to tell you more about the steps to take going forward with it. It's much easier and simpler than you think.

If you have a smaller amount of additional discretionary income that youâ€™d like to use as an investment, we'd love to hear from you. If you already own a home you live in, you could potentially qualify. Even first-time homebuyers can utilize The 1+ Program by taking some basic steps on the front end. By doing this, you can put yourself in an incredible position within just a year or two of buying your first home.

If you'd like to learn more, give us call or send me an email. I look forward to working with you!
