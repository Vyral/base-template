What’s the worst thing you can hear from a Realtor&reg; that you hire? Maybe you think it’s something about how they have never sold a house before or how they promised you a price that wasn’t real.&nbsp;

However, I think the worst possible thing you can hear from the professional agent you hire is, **“I really need this deal to happen.”**&nbsp;

{% include pullquote.html %}

If the real estate professional that you’ve hired says this to you, this tells you that the agent is putting their own interests above yours. That’s not good.

Our team has been in business since 2004. We’ve sold over 230 homes in the last 12 months. Whenever somebody new joins our team, **we emphasize that we are always to look at the business from a long-term perspective, put ourselves in the shoes of our clients, and make decisions based on their self interests and what they need.**

If you have any questions for us about what it means to be a true real estate professional, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
