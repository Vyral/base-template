Around this time of year, people often ask me: “When is the best time to sell?”

I think the reason this question becomes so common in the fall and winter is that people who have been thinking of listing are uncertain about their potential for success.&nbsp;

Most people believe that fall and winter are poor times to sell. Kids are in school, the days are shorter, and the weather is cold. However, this way of thinking simply stems from assumptions.&nbsp;

Personally, **I believe that the reason these assumptions exist is that real estate agents perpetuate them**. But, why would they do that? Well, most real estate agents are part time. Many agents work hard in the summer and slow down in the winter.&nbsp;

This is the reason I think agents like to tell people that homes sell best in the summer.&nbsp;

To find out if that was truly the case, I did some research. I looked at market sales from the last two years in North Texas, and I found that **the numbers don’t change all that much between seasons**.

Also, there are some other important aspects to keep in mind. While the days may be shorter during winter, buyers are typically much more serious during these months.&nbsp;

People move for many reasons. **This means that there’s really no good or bad time to sell**. Marriages, career changes, and other life events that might spark a move can happen at any time of year.&nbsp;

While market statistics may dip slightly during the winter months, you shouldn’t let this discourage you. If you want to list successfully, you should work with an agent who does their job all year long.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
