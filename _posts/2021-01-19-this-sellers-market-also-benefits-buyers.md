Here’s how our current seller’s market definitely benefits buyers too.

We’re in a classic seller’s market, but the current market can also be beneficial to buyers.

**Sellers can usually sell their homes in under 30 days** if they’re priced right and in good condition. Sellers are also benefiting from fewer showings, multiple offers, and homes selling close to list price. Inventory is very low, and buyer demand is extremely high. If you’re considering selling, now is the best time I’ve seen to do so in the last decade.

Buyers don’t always have many advantages in a seller’s market. However, **our present market has low interest rates, which means buyers can buy more house for the money.** I bought my first home at a 7% interest rate, and that’s more than double what people are paying these days. It’s a great time to buy.&nbsp;
