<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s how our current seller’s market benefits buyers too.</em></p>

This is an absolutely excellent time to list your home for sale. I have never seen such a reduced inventory in Greater Charleston. Right now, we have just over 2,100 homes for sale. In a good, healthy market, we have around 5,000. 

**Sellers can usually sell their homes in under 30 days** if they’re priced right and in good condition. Sellers are also benefiting from fewer showings, multiple offers, and homes selling close to list price. Inventory is very low, and buyer demand is extremely high.

If you’re considering selling, now is the best time I’ve seen to do so in the last decade. By listing your home now, you're likely to get top dollar, likely not have to make repairs, and likely will see multiple offers on your home.

Buyers don’t always have many advantages in a seller’s market. It can be challenging to find the right home with such few options. However, **our present market has low interest rates, which means buyers can buy more house for the money.** I bought my first home at a 7% interest rate, and that’s more than double what people are paying these days. I just had a client lock in a 2.65% interest rate. As you can see, it’s a great time to buy. 

If you have questions about buying, selling, or anything else, reach out to us via phone or email. We would love to connect with you and be your real estate resource.
