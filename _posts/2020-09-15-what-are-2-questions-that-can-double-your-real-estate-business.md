<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Ask these two questions of people you speak with double your business!</em></p>

I’m sharing two questions to ask that can double your real estate business. If you ask these two questions of multiple people per day for about a year, I guarantee you’ll see a huge increase in your business:

**1\. What are your biggest fears about the process?** By asking that question of anyone you’re speaking to about real estate, you will learn more about their mindset and hidden emotions than almost any other question. I find this extremely valuable to help me relate to them, earn their trust, and understand their needs.

**2\. Is there anything I can do for you that’s not real estate related?** We ask this of our database and potential clients who aren’t even considering buying or selling right now. Can I help you find a contractor or financial advisor? Tell them you don’t need to be compensated for this, you just want to help with what they need right now.&nbsp;

We train our agents to ask these two questions, and I encourage you to ask them as much as we do.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or want to collaborate on how to grow your real estate business, I’d love to do a free strategy session with you. Just reach out via phone or email. I hope we connect soon.
