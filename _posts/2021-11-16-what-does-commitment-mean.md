Today we want to talk about a word that will send shivers down some of your spines: commitment. You’ve probably heard someone say they’re committed to something only to not live up to the expectations. We see this all the time across the real estate world in classrooms and even in relationships.&nbsp;

According to the dictionary, **commitment is defined as “the state or quality of being dedicated to a cause or activity.”** That differs from a goal, which is the object of someone’s ambition. Commitments are more than a goal; they are non-negotiable and mean you will do everything to achieve that goal.&nbsp;

Where in your life are you falling short on your goals? Where do you lack abundance, and where do you desire more? **Commitment is measured by one thing and one thing only: the result.** If you’re not getting the results you want, ask yourself if you’re truly committed or if you’re simply interested in the desired outcome.&nbsp;

I hope this made you think a bit. If you have any questions, feel free to call me.
