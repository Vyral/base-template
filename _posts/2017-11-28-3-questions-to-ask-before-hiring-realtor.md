What questions should you be asking a Realtor before you hire them? Start with these three.

When hiring a Realtor to list your home, you shouldn’t make an impulse decision. In fact, you should interview a few different Realtors for the job and ask them specific questions about their business. Here are three examples of smart questions to ask any Realtor before you hire them:

**1. What’s your track record?** Ask them how long they’ve been in the business, how many homes they’ve sold, how big their team is, and more. You don’t want to hire somebody that doesn’t have any experience. You want a Realtor with the experience and knowledge necessary to get your home sold for top dollar.

**2. What are you going to do to market my home?** The days of putting a sign in the yard and waiting for a buyer are long over. Your Realtor needs an aggressive marketing plan and an aggressive marketing budget in order to have a successful sale. It takes a strategy to sell a home for the price you want.

**3. What are your reviews like?** You don’t even have to necessarily ask this question. You can find the answer for yourself online. If the Realtor doesn’t have very many online reviews or has poor reviews, you should avoid them.

Choosing a Realtor is about more than just picking a friend or a face on a sign. **It's about knowing who has the track record and the motivation to get your home sold for the most money possible.**
