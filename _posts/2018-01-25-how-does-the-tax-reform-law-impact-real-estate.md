The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law at the end of 2017. Today, I want to dispel some rumors about how the tax reform law impacts the real estate market.<br><br>First of all, there’s the property tax deduction. If you are not taking the standard deduction and doing itemized deductions, **those will be capped at $10,000 a year.&nbsp;**That won’t impact the Hays County market so much, but if you plan on buying in higher cost, higher tax areas, that is something to keep in mind.

**The mortgage interest deduction was also capped.&nbsp;**For loans taken out after December 14, 2017, the mortgage interest deduction will be capped at $750,000. If you had a $1 million loan before December 14, you have been grandfathered in and can still write off the interest. Again, that will not affect the Hays County market very much. If you plan on moving up into the luxury market, though, that is something to consider.

Finally, there is some good news—the home sale exclusion did not change. Earlier versions of the bill made significant changes to the capital gains exclusion, but the final bill kept everything the same. If you have lived in your home for two out of the last five years, you do not have to pay capital gains tax on a certain amount of profit. **If you are single, the cap is $250,000; if you are married, the cap is $500,000.**

That is a huge win for real estate.

Again, these are the tax changes for 2018 that will impact real estate.
