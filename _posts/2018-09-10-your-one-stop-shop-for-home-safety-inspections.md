Today I’m joined by Alina from Metro Retrofitting to discuss what what services she and her team offer clients.

When you purchase a new home, it’s important to be sure that your house has updated and functional safety features, like smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. **Metro Retrofitting will come out to your home for an inspection and take a look at your home’s detectors and other safety features to make sure that you’re up to code.**

Mind you, each city has different requirements about what features need to be inspected, not just your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. Some additional features that may need to be looked at include:

* Gas shutoffs
* Sliding glass doors
* Low-flow toilets
* Low-flow aerators on the sink

**Metro Retrofitting will note any features that aren’t working to code, fix them, and then return after the necessary work has been done to ensure that you’re properly protected** per the standards of the city, county and the state. They’re a one-stop shop for home safety inspections.

I appreciate Alina stopping by to tell us about this topic.
