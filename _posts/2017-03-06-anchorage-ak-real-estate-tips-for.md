How can you keep your home safer while you’re away? Here are our best tips.

 One question I’ve been getting a lot is, “What can I do to keep my home safe while I’m away?” Crime is on the rise in the Anchorage Valley area and keeping your house safe is important, especially if you’re traveling or on vacation. Here are a few things you can do to keep your home safer.

 **The first thing I would suggest is installing a camera in your doorbell.** I’ve got one, and it tells me every time somebody rings the doorbell. I can even talk to the person before I open the door.

 Another good idea is adding some exterior lighting with motion sensors. A lot of times, these will scare people off if they are snooping around.

 It’s also a good idea to let your neighbors know you are leaving. I have neighbors on both sides of me that we inform every time we leave. Remember to put your mail on hold as well.

 Finally, double check those windows and doors before you leave. **One-third of all break-ins are unforced entries.**

 I hope these tips are helpful and keep you safe and sound in your home. If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
