If you’re thinking about getting into the real estate investment market in 2020, you have a few different options.

You could purchase a single-family or townhome that’s a fix and flip, you could buy one to use as a short-term rental service like Airbnb, a new construction rental property, or invest in a real estate group who has the teams in place to invest in these kinds of properties.

**We’ve worked with many investors in the past and have had great success.** Our investors can benefit from the predictable outcome of an above-market return. We typically find assets below the market basis that gives investors a few opportunities to move on, whether it’s through refinancing, renting and holding, or selling.

**Another benefit of being an investor is the tax advantages and the leverage return on your assets.** There’s also the opportunity to participate in the upside of having an equity position in a passive investment.

These are just a few of the benefits of investing in real estate in 2020. If you'd like to learn more, feel free to give us a call or send an email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
