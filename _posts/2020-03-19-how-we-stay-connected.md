Here are the three ways we at the Wolek Group stay connected:

**1\. We have a Google Hangout call every morning at 8:15 a.m.** This allows us to state our gratitude and share our intentions for the day.&nbsp;

**2\. We have a team meeting every Monday at 11 a.m.** This is an official meeting with an agenda. It also acts as a training session in case there are topics we need to cover. It’s a great way to keep open an open dialogue about everything that’s happening.&nbsp;

**3\. We use a communication tool called Slack.** This allows us to consolidate all of our communication into one place. We’ve found that information can get lost through text and emails. With Slack, every channel is a different category, and it’s a great place to store our team’s communication.&nbsp;

Communication can separate the great companies from the not-so-great ones. We’re always striving for success and making sure we deliver an amazing client experience, and communication is key. Communicating as a team is very important. It’s also important that our clients see this.&nbsp;

Communication with our people is just as important, and we ensure this by creating a GPS for each year. Our goals, priorities, and strategies are outlined inside our marketing plan. Our goals are also placed inside our calendar so we can review them and send our 411s to each other every Monday morning.&nbsp;

There’s lots to do and lots to stay on top of, but when you think big and break everything down, you see what the life of a very productive real estate professional looks like. Just take care of your most important items each day if you want to achieve greatness.&nbsp;

If you’d like to talk about how you can improve your team’s communication or have any questions about this topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help.
