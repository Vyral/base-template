Hi everyone, it's Sarita with the Ask Sarita Team. Thanks for joining me today. I have some exciting news for you!

I will be sharing my real estate expertise with you through a new video blog.

I am extremely excited about this and I want to include all of you! Each month I will be sending out two emails addressing trends in our local real estate market. I'll also be touching on changes to the lending and title world (which affect all of us in one way or another), and tips for navigating the world of real estate. All of these industries are intertwined, and to take full advantage of the real estate market, you need to know about all of them.

Rather than simply guess what's on your mind, I want to reach out and ask you what questions you have about real estate.

Are there any concepts that confuse you? Are you curious about the market in your particular area or neighborhood?

I would love to answer your specific questions in my videos so other people with similar questions can benefit from them too!

I look forward to speaking with you!
