As you know, we love giving back to the community and supporting local nonprofits. Since it’s almost back-to-school time, we want to take a break from real estate and share a quick video of all the amazing things The Pencil Box is doing for our local schools. We have testimonials from volunteers, public school teachers in Tulsa County, and Executive Director Nancy Bolzle as part of our spotlight. As Nancy says, “There is no greater investment than our youth.”&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this organization or any real estate needs we can take care of, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to speak with you.
