Lakefront properties are a passion of ours. Here are a few that we just listed on the market.

We have a passion for helping people buy and sell waterfront property here in Central Texas. We’ve got four amazing properties on the shores of Lake Travis and Lake Austin that we’d like to talk to you about today. We also want to talk about where home values are going, what trends we are seeing in the real estate market, and what’s changed in the last few years.

The first property is located at 17216 Northlake Hills Dr. in Jonestown. It’s located within the gated community of Northlake Hills and is just a quick 20-minute drive to the new Whole Foods in Cedar Park. This home is just over 10,000 square feet with eight bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, multiple pools, a detached guest house, and an income-producing 22-slip marina.

The second one is also located in Jonestown in The Hollows, one of the top communities in Lake Travis and one of the best marinas on the lake. This home is located at 17607 Breakwater Drive. If you want an 11,000 sq. ft. home with one of the best views of the lake, this is it.

The third property we have is at 21902 Briarcliff Drive in Spicewood, where some of the best water on Lake Travis is. There is a main house with three bedrooms and a guest quarters with one bedroom and a full kitchen and bath. **This is great for short-term rentals or guests.** Right now, the owner is leasing this property out for $16,000 in the month of July.

Last but not least is 13240 Shore Vista. It sits just under three acres and just over 7,000 square feet. It’s located in an area with some of the most private water and private estates on Lake Austin.

Values can vary immensely, depending on the lake and the area within the lake that we are talking about. When the drought came in 2011, the levels of Lake Travis dropped significantly. People started shifting their purchases more towards Lake Austin. We saw a low point for values in 2014, but they have since recovered. **There has been a slight dip in values in both lakes in 2017, so we’re keeping a close eye on that.**

If you have any questions for us about any of these properties or want to know anything else about this kind of real estate, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
