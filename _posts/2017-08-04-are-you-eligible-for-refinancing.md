A recent study found that **4.5 million homeowners are still eligible to refinance their mortgage.**

With that amount of homeowners, they’ve estimated that about $1 billion in total savings have been left on the table that homeowners aren’t taking advantage of.
<br>
<br>Many homeowners are saying the reason they haven’t is because they’re not sure if the value of their home would support a refinance.

This is certainly something to look into. Though, **the average homeowner does save about $260 a month when they refinance.**

In other words, seeing if you are eligible for refinancing is well worth thinking about.

Mortgage rates are currently hovering around 4% or slightly less, and homes have been appreciating significantly in the past year or two in the market. So, what better time to find out whether you could be missing out on savings?
