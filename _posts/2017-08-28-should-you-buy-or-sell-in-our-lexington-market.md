There is a bit of a shift happening in our Lexington market right now.

**It’s been a seller’s market for the past year and a half or so, but—depending on the price range and location—that’s not the case anymore.**

There is a lot of inventory in our market. If you’re a buyer or seller in the $500,000-and-above price range, those homes aren’t moving very quickly. Homes in the $350,000-and-below price range, however, are still moving quickly.

Interest rates are hovering around the 4% range, and they may even be less than that, depending on how you structure your loan. In a historical sense, that’s still phenomenal.

If you’re a seller, these conditions mean now may be the time to make a move. If you’re a buyer, you can still find the right home and negotiate the right deal—especially if you work with us.

If you’re interested in buying or selling or you have any other questions about our market, just let us know. Give us a call or send us an email and we’d be happy to help.
