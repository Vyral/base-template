Buyers searching for a home in the middle of a seller’s market may feel discouraged by the competitive conditions they find themselves up against. When the market is stacked against them, is there anything buyers can do to make their offer stand out from the crowd? Actually, yes. Let’s take a look at a few simple techniques homebuyers can use to set themselves apart:&nbsp;

{% include pullquote.html %}

1. **Submit a larger earnest money deposit.** Deals don’t always go through to closing, so sellers in a competitive market may be wary of offers that come without any guarantee of the buyer’s intentions. A larger earnest money deposit shows the seller you’re serious.&nbsp;
2. **Show sellers that you’re qualified.** Many of the buyers you’ll compete against will be pre-qualified, but a significantly smaller percentage will be pre-approved. A pre-approval letter verifies that a lender has reviewed your status and believes you to be a capable and qualified buyer.&nbsp;
3. **Give the seller some time to move.** Buyer possession is often a sticking point in a transaction. If you’re buying and selling simultaneously, you already know what a difficult a position this is to be in. And this scenario only becomes more complex when you realize the seller you’re appealing to may be in the same boat as you. So, cut them some slack and allow them ample time to settle their own moving process. Sellers are much more likely to accept offers from buyers who are willing to make such concessions without asking for compensation
4. **Write your best offer.** Don’t hope for the chance to negotiate later on. Have your agent conduct a comparative market analysis so that you can strategize your offer accordingly. Submitting a high offer with great terms will go a long way in helping you stand out against the crowd.&nbsp;
