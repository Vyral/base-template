<p style="text-align:center">The pandemic has changed nearly everything in our lives, however, people are still buying and selling homes.</p>

We’re well into this pandemic, so first I want to thank all our doctors, nurses, scientists, and everyone who is working relentlessly to minimize this health crisis. With that said, today’s message is an update about our real estate market here in Tucson. Real estate has been deemed an essential business, so we’re continuing to function, albeit much safer. We’re heeding safe distances and only meeting with a small number of people. In our market, the first week of March had about 450 sales, and the last week of the month saw over 300 sales, so people are still buying and selling homes. To learn more about our current market, watch the short video above.
