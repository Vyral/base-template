<center><em>Here&rsquo;s a handy checklist for home maintenance to ensure its health.</em></center>

&nbsp;

Have you been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately? As a homeowner, it can sometimes be a struggle to keep up with home maintenance tasks. Today we’re sharing a simple guide to consider a resource when giving your home a maintenance check-up.

**1\. Visual check-up.** Visible deterioration of a house’s exterior is a sign that something needs to be repaired. Give the outside of your home a visual check-up for noticeable indicators of structural damage, including the driveway and sidewalks. Check the roof for any shingles that need to be replaced and the gutters for blockages. Give your house a thorough cleaning by hiring a power washer. This will help protect it from built-up residue over time.

**2\. Assess the health of major appliances.** These include the refrigerator, dishwasher, washing machine, stove, and more. Also, don’t forget the HVAC and plumbing systems.&nbsp;

**3\. Clean.** We suggest hiring professional cleaners at least once a year to keep carpets and hardwood floors looking brand new. Check for any stains indicating leaks within your home, and call a professional if you see anything abnormal.&nbsp;

**4\. Check the alarm systems.** This includes smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and fire extinguishers.&nbsp;

Your home is one of the largest investments you’ll make in your lifetime, so take the steps to care for it. We recommend continued monitoring of your house for any signs of damage.&nbsp;
