Heather Tyler has been with me for over 17 years, helping my clients with their home purchases from beginning to end, and sheâ€™s here today to talk all about escrow. Escrow is a neutral third party that facilitates the transfer of property from a seller to a buyer. The process starts with an accepted contract and an initial deposit from the buyer and ends with a grant deed and dispersing of funds. Heather is there to cover everything from start to finish. This handy document covers pretty much everything you need to know about escrow.
