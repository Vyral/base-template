How can you be sure that you’ve picked the best agent for you? In my opinion, I think I’m the right person no matter your real estate needs. However, don’t just take my word for it. Today I want to share a client success story that illustrates what I can do for you.&nbsp;

I first started working with this couple 642 days ago. They were living in Costa Mesa and either wanted to stay in their town or move to Huntington Beach. A short distance from the beach was important to them because they wanted to bike there.&nbsp;

**I believe that success in real estate happens when timing meets opportunity.** When we first started working together, they were still saving up. We were monitoring the market for an opportunity, but most homes that fit their needs were selling for $100,000 or $200,000 over the asking price. On top of that, most winning offers had no inspection, appraisal, or loan contingencies. We didn’t want to make such a risky offer, and my clients hadn’t saved enough yet to afford the new normal, so we bided our time and kept an eye on things.&nbsp;

Eventually, we found a property that fit all my clients’ needs. It even had the bonus of being right next door to the husband’s favorite restaurant. We put in a very strong offer, but we lost to a bid that offered $1.25 million with 50% down.&nbsp;

My clients were understandably upset, but I kept my eye on this property. **You never know what’s going to happen, especially in such a crazy market.** I’m glad I followed up because I learned that 10 days into the transaction, the buyers had to back out. Interest rates had increased, and they no longer qualified for their loan.&nbsp;

We came in as soon as we could and made an offer at $1.15 million—$10 million below the original buyers. I pushed the sellers, pulled out every negotiating tactic in the book, and got my clients’ offer accepted.&nbsp;

That sounds like a great deal, but it isn’t even the best part. The home ended up appraising for $1.65 million, so my clients had equity as soon as they were handed the keys. I knew there were some issues with the home, and the sellers really wanted us to take it off their hands, so I even negotiated a $60,000 credit for the closing costs.&nbsp;

Not every transaction I work on is like this, but I want you to know that I love helping my clients win. **No matter what your situation is, I’ll go the extra mile to get you the best deal possible.** If you’d like to hear my clients’ reaction in their own words, check out 3:28 in the video for their Google review of my services.&nbsp;
