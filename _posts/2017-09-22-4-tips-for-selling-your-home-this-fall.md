Fall is here, which means—among other things—pumpkins are everywhere! As a homeowner, it can be enticing to get into the spirit of things and do something like let your home overflow with pumpkins, but if you’re selling your home this fall, there are certain points you need to remember.

First, **consider your curb appeal.** Make sure your yard is free of leaves. When prospective buyers view your home, they want to see it in the best shape possible. Keep your fall decor to a minimum and don’t overdo anything because everyone has different tastes and styles.

Second, **avoid any gory decorations.** Not everyone celebrates Halloween with ghosts, goblins, blood, and gore. While you may think it’s fun to have zombies hanging from tree limbs, you don’t want to upset or scare any buyers when they’re looking at your house.

Third, **let in a lot of natural light.** Our days are getting shorter, so clean your windows, pull back the shades, and do everything you can to let natural light in.

Lastly, **make your space inviting.** Consider placing a few plush, fall-time pillows on the couch or a few throws on the bed. You might even consider making some homemade cookies and leaving them on the counter for buyers to see when they walk through the home.

If you follow these tips, we guarantee your home will be a top contender to sell this fall. If you have any questions or you’d be interested in letting us help you list your home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help.
