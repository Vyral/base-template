Today I will be discussing something a little different than what I usually cover. Today I'll be discussing the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index Report. This report covers the entire US, so we can compare our Portland market to the rest of the country. This report is made up of 2 composites, a 20-city composite and a 10-city composite. Portland was part of the 20-city composite, which makes it pretty fascinating to me.

Some of the highlights of the report were:

• On average, the cities in the study appreciated by an average of 4.5%
• The report also shows how the housing recovery is slowing down, but this should not be alarming because the recovery has been swift as of late
• In the last twelve months, the Portland market has appreciated by 6.8%
• In 2015 I think we could expect appreciation right around 5% in the Portland area, which is a healthy amount of appreciation

Hopefully you have found this information helpful, and if you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.
