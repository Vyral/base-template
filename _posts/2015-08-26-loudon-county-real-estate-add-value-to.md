Today, I want to encourage you to make certain easy improvements in your home if you are financially able to. Updating your paint and carpeting, removing wallpaper, changing light fixtures, and putting in a deck or patio are all examples of things that will add value to your home.

You would be surprised by the number of homeowners that I meet on a routine basis who have let these things go for years. They don't realize that they need to make certain upgrades in order to get their home sold for top dollar. Years ago, I had a client who said they were so bummed that they had to spend a bunch of money right before moving rather than getting their home fixed up over the years in order to enjoy those improvements!

So, if you can afford to make upgrades and improvements today, do it! That way, when it comes time to sell the property, you won't have to spend a ton of time and money getting it ready. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I would love to hear from you!
