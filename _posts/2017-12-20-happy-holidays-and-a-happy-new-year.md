Today, I just want to take a moment to wish you a happy holiday season. Thank you for the tremendous success we’ve had in 2017. It was a record-breaking year here at The Scott Irvin Team, and we couldn’t have done it without you. We look forward to seeing you in 2018, and wish you a safe, healthy, and happy New Year.
