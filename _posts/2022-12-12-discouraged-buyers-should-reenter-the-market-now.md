During the first part of the year, many buyers took off because they often faced multiple offers. They were discouraged and waited by the sidelines. However, as interest rates change, our market has shifted as well. Those **buyers who are on the sidelines now have many opportunities.**

There are properties that you can make offers on and actually buy. We went from having 1,800 properties in our MLS in January to about 2,400 properties now. Properties are staying on the market slightly longer, and we see an uptick in price adjustments. In fact, we had 490 price adjustments just this week.&nbsp;

If youâ€™re a buyer, give us a call or send an email. We can give you some advice on how to navigate your way and buy your dream home in this shifting market.
