Should I Put My Home Up For Sale?
A lot of clients here in Northeast Ohio have been asking me lately if it's a good idea to put their homes on the market. I actually have 4 reasons why it is a fantastic time to sell your home.

1. **Low Inventory**: This is the lowest inventory that we've seen in years. With such a high demand for homes, you will be able to dictate what you want for your home, and you will likely receive multiple offers that will drive up the sales price of your home.

2. **Home Prices will Rise**: Home values have increased by 10% in the last few years, and are expected to keep climbing. In Cleveland, some homes appreciated by 3-5% last year.

3. **Interest Rates Remain Low**: Interest rates are at historical lows right now. You can get a rate below 5% right now, and this could save you hundreds of thousands of dollars over the life of a mortgage. If you're a seller this will help you too because buyers will be spurred to action by the predictions of rising interest at the beginning of next year.

4. **Spring Rush**: If you list now, you will be swarmed by buyers because this is the time of year that people look to buy homes. Plus the low inventory will funnel buyers right to your property, and you should be able to sell for top dollar.
These are my four reasons why you should sell, and I hope you've found them helpful. The thing to remember is that time is beginning to run out, so if you want to sell, do it soon to make sure that you beat the spring rush.

Be sure to contact me if you ever need help with real estate in Northeast Ohio.
Have a great day!
