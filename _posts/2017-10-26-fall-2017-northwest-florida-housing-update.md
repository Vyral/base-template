Fall is upon us, and with it the end of the high season for real estate.<br><br>However, if you're thinking you've missed your chance to sell your home, let me reassure you.<br><br>**This autumn actually presents a fantastic moment to sell.**&nbsp;Here's why.<br><br>First off, housing inventory is still pretty low along the Emerald Coast.<br><br>In fact, according to data from the Census Bureau and the National Association of Realtors, inventory remains well below historic averages, and is 50% less than the peak in 2006.<br><br>Second, while mortgage rates also remain very low, recent announcements by the Federal Reserve might cause them to finally start rising.<br><br>This would make mortgages less affordable and might turn away a significant number of potential buyers.<br><br>This is even more of a concern when you consider the continuing growth of home prices—6.9% in the last year alone.<br><br>Third, contrary to conventional wisdom, fall is generally a great time to list your home.<br><br>**Buyers in the fall are likely to be more serious**&nbsp;because they have probably been searching for months without success.<br><br>Also, because fewer homes are listed in the fall, this means&nbsp;**there's even less competition**&nbsp;than we’ve seen due to the general low inventory.<br><br>So what do you get when you put all those things together?<br><br>Well, if you were to list your home right now, chances are good that you would be able to sell it and for a solid price.<br><br>On the other hand, if you decide to wait, the situation might not be as favorable because mortgage rates might rise or because new construction might pick up.<br><br>**That means the time to list your home is now.**<br><br>You can get started with this home value calculator on my website, which takes into account recent Northwest Florida sales:<br><br>Enter your home address to find out what your home is currently worth.<br><br>**[This calculator will give you a good idea of what your home is worth.](http://search.nathanabbottteam.com/idx/homevaluation)**<br><br>And if you would like a more precise estimate of what your home could sell for this fall, or if you have any other questions about the current Destin real estate situation, give me a call at 850.632.0136.
