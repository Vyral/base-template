In this business, I hear a lot of questions about the topic of property management. How do you find property managers? What questions do you ask them? What if you’re in a tertiary market? These are all really important questions.

To start, you’ll want to find a property manager who lives close to and knows the area that you’re investing in. If a tenant has a problem with a broken fixture or their power, you’ll need to have that property manager in close proximity so that the issue can be fixed in good time. Anything farther away than 30 minutes is going to be difficult to work with.

When you find a prospective property manager, be sure to ask some screening questions. Some examples include:

* “How many properties are you managing right now?” If you’re buying a single-family property or a duplex, you’ll want a manager with a portfolio that allows them to dedicate the proper amount of time to the property. Someone who is managing a 40-unit complex will likely have a different ability to manage a separate property as well.
* “Do you manage in this area?”
* “What type of tenant class do you manage?” Whether it be students, young professionals, or a mixture of all manner of people, it’s important to be able to connect with those people.
* “How do you handle evictions?” In the case of problem tenants, will they be able to help you get them out?
* “What’s your monthly fee, or do you charge on a lease-up?”
* “Do you have a maintenance staff?” Who will be available to answer calls 24/7 if someone’s water heater goes out in the middle of the night?

It’s also a good idea to make sure that they have a professional management software like AppFolio or Buildium. These programs allow you to view and manage fees, rent collections, late fees, and more.

One of the most important things that you need from a property manager is proper marketing and added value. Are they using cutting-edge methods like video tours? Do they advertise on the mainstream websites like Zillow, Trulia, HotPads, Craigslist, etc.? It should be on 20 to 30 different sites.<br><br>Additionally, ask them about an available unit and then go online and find where it’s advertised. Does it have a good presence? Is it photographed well? Does it have a property description, including the layout and the benefits of that community? How do they screen potential tenants?

My final note would be to inquire about construction management. If a tenant completely trashes a unit, how much will it cost to do a unit turnover?

All of these questions can really help you qualify your property manager. We know and work with several different ones, so if you have any questions about this, feel free to reach out to us. We’d love to recommend a couple to you, and if we can’t find one that fits your needs, we’ll do some research to help you out.
