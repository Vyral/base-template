**Do you have a friend or family member who is thinking about buying a home, or refinancing their current home?** I build my business by referral, so if you know of someone who could use the expert advise of a mortgage lender or finance officer, please forward this email to them, or reply back with their contact information and I'll gently reach out to them. If you have any questions about the mortgage and finance industry, please don't hesitate to give me a call. I'd be more than happy to provide a Consultation.

Hey guys, welcome back to the Moshofsky Mortgage Minute. **Buying a home is supposed to be an amazing, fun experience, and that's what I want all my clients to believe.**

When you aren't clued in to exactly what's going on in the purchasing process, you can end up feeling like the couple in the clip above, from the show "Portlandia" on IFC. **We don't want you sitting at the phone, staring blankly into space and asking, "What is escrow?"**

When you get under contract, we don't want you to feel this way and don't want you to have to ask these kinds of questions. **Work with someone who is going to help you throughout the process, where you are comfortable, informed, and have a great experience.** I can help you do all of this.

If you have any questions for me about how I can make the home buying process easy, simple, and stress-free, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you!
