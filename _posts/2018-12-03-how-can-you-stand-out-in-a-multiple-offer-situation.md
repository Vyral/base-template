As a homebuyer, you want to be able to position yourself as strongly as possible to make sure that your offer is the one that’s accepted. **There are a few different things you should consider when doing this:**

**1. Make sure you’re fully approved for a loan.** This will make sure that your offer is as good as a cash buyer’s offer.

**2. Offer the seller more option or earnest money.** This says to the seller that you’re aggressive and you want to make sure your offer is looked at and accepted above other offers.

**3. Write a letter to the seller.** This will tell the seller why you want their home so much. Adding a picture to the bottom of the letter adds a nice touch. You’d be surprised at how many sellers accept offers because someone has taken the time to write a letter and send a picture to them.

These are just a few ways to help you be more aggressive in your home buying journey. If you have any questions or want more information about how to win against multiple offers, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
