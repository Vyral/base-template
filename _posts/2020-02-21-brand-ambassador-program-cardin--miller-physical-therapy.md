<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I recently sat down with Steve Miller, of Cardin & Miller Physical Therapy, to share why the business got started and who it serves.</em></p>

We’re back with another Brand Ambassador video, sitting down with Steve Miller of Cardin & Miller Physical Therapy—an incredible business leader in our community.&nbsp;

**Cardin & Miller started with the goal of helping people return to normal life after pain and injury interrupt, and that remains a driving force in their business.** I actually experienced some issues with my shoulder a while back, not knowing at the time that Cardin & Miller help with situations just like that. I eventually made it in there and those guys fixed me up within a few sessions.&nbsp;

Everybody sells a certain product on the marketplace; they truly sell hope and reassurance that you’ll get back to business as usual and no longer have to be limited when enjoying friends and family. Beyond that, they sell custom foot orthotics, a device that goes in your shoe and helps to support your arch and combat heel, arch, and foot pain.&nbsp;

Arguably nothing is more valuable than the knowledge of the human body (and how to best use it) that Cardin & Miller offer. After speaking with them about my own problem area, I immediately got the peace of mind that there was indeed a solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The bulk of their clients fall in the age group of 35 to 64, and they help each one restore and maintain their mobility and balance. Steve says there are two questions that clients ask him most often: “How did I get this pain/injury?” and “How do I get back to doing the things that I love?” Cardin & Miller has the answers they need most.

The best way to get in touch with the professionals at Cardin & Miller Physical Therapy is to call them at 717-245-0400 or email [steve@cardinmillerpt.com](mailto:steve@cardinmillerpt.com).&nbsp;

For vlog visitors, they’re offering some amazing specials. For example, if you call in and **tell them that you heard about them via our interview, they’ll give you a free screen**—a one-on-one meeting with one of their expert physical therapists. This consultation (offered in-person or over the phone for those folks who are more timid about these things) is critical for correctly identifying the issue and moving forward with a fix.&nbsp;

**Cardin & Miller will also offer $5 off custom foot orthotics\!** Don’t miss this chance to get in touch with a great staff in multiple locations and get your body right.&nbsp;

As always, reach out to me if you have questions about or suggestions for our Brand Ambassador series, or want to discuss other real estate topics. I’m glad to help you in any way I can.
