Today I’m joined by a special guest: our lead buyer specialist, Tyler Walker.&nbsp;

As a lead buyer specialist, Tyler’s job is to negotiate the best price for you. Having been born and raised in West Fargo, he has a wealth of local knowledge.

**It is using this local knowledge combined with his real estate expertise that Tyler helps buyers** get into the right house for the best terms.

Tyler says his job is to make buyers happy, and that exactly what he intends to do. He wants to make sure no buyer overpays for a property, and that the deal goes as smoothly as possible from every angle.&nbsp;

Tyler has been in this role on our team for over a year now, and he’s doing a great job.&nbsp;
