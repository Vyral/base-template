We see a wide range of buyers, from those who want homes of a very specific size, style and architectural design, to buyers who simply want four walls, a roof, and electricity for their next home.

 Most clients are somewhere in the middle - they’re looking for a home that looks good and has most of the features they want.

 You've probably looked at houses and checked off a few boxes, making sure it has the number of bedrooms and bathrooms you want, but have you ever looked at a home and really thought, "Is this house right for me?"

 Not many do. That's why I wanted to share a Consumer Reports video with you that I recently found. It's a nice checklist to go through in order to make sure the home you're considering actually fits you and your lifestyle. Here are my favorite items:

1. Communicate with people at the local coffee shop or any place where locals hang out. Simply ask their thoughts on the area.
2. You can tell a lot about the sense of community in a neighborhood based on the sidewalks and porches. Seriously!
3. Proximity to places and amenities you frequent shouldn't be overlooked. Do you want to be close to restaurants and shops, the airport, or parks and trails?
4. Mortgage cost shouldn't be the only factor when considering affordability. Look at transportation and utility costs too, for example.

 Remember, the average McLean homeowner will stay in their home for about nine years. Don't ignore the important checklist items when considering the place you’ll call home for nearly a decade.

 Now, this example is pretty broad. Each family has its own unique situation and its own unique checklist. I'd love to sit down with you and use my experience to help you come up with that all-important checklist of your own to help find the right home for you. Give me a call or send me an email and let’s talk soon.
