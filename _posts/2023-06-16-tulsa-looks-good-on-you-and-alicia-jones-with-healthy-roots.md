Tulsa Looks Good on You and Alicia Jones with Healthy Roots.

Jennie connected with Alicia Jones, owner of Healthy Roots to hear all about her yummy elixir and how a tablespoon a day just might help to keep the doctor away!

Alicia started her business during the heart of Covid after being laid off from her job.

Fed up with taking 7 medications daily, Alicia decided to play with recipes and research the benefits of elderberry elixir to try to make the healthiest version for her and her family to consume.

After a year of working on her recipe, she finally landed on the perfect version and started &nbsp;consuming it daily. Three months later, Alicia found herself not needing those 7 medications anymore and now, 3 years later she is still going strong supporting her health with her elderberry elixir.

Motivated by the stories from her clients, Alicia doesnâ€™t plan on slowing down anytime soon.

You can pick up a bottle at one of the following stores:

ðŸ‘‰ Rock Creek Herb & Vitamin in Sapulpa

&nbsp;ðŸ‘‰Joe's Farm in Bixby

ðŸ‘‰ Market on Main in Jenks

ðŸ‘‰ Sandos Rockin Deli in downtown Tulsa

ðŸ‘‰ Hotworx in Owasso

???? Owasso Farmers Market every Saturday
