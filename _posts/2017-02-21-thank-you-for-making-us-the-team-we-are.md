Our team just won a very important award, and I have some people to thank for it. It all starts with you.

Want to buy a home? [**Search all homes for sale**](http://www.radkeagency.com/homes-for-sale)

Today I just want to let you know how grateful I am for our team receiving the number one listing award for 2016. Our team in 2016 also received the following awards:

* 1st Place Listing Team
* 2nd Place Selling Team
* 2nd Place Total Volume Team

With close to 400 agents in our office we feel honored and grateful to have received these awards. Of course, none of this would be possible without the support of our amazing team and clients! It really means a lot to us and we couldn’t have done it without you. **Thank you from the bottom of my heart**—not only to my team but also to you for your support. We look forward to working with your friends and family in 2017.

If you have any questions or are thinking of buying or selling a home, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you!
