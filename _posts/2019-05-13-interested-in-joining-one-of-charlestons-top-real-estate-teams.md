The Dave Friedman Team has continued to grow, and because of that, we’re looking to make a few more key hires to help us maintain that growth.

**I’m also excited to announce that I’m personally going to be training these new hires to make sure that they are rockstars in the industry and have the right skills, knowledge, habits, and attitude in order to be successful.**

The reason that so many of our clients have been so satisfied with our level of service is that that’s a big focus of ours. We’re looking for folks who align with that customer-first mindset.

**Right now, we’re looking to hire a lead listing specialist and two buyer’s agents.** There is an opportunity right now for a new hire to serve 126 new clients.
