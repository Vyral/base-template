Today, I’m here with a real estate market update for the Charleston area. I’m reviewing some data from this year’s first quarter! Additionally, I’ll talk about some great events happening locally in the next few weeks.

April is here and the azaleas are in full bloom! Our city looks beautiful this time of year. Summerville just had a great Flowertown Festival weekend. The weather was great for such a gorgeous event! It’s an opportune time to take a relaxing stroll through the Middleton or Magnolia Gardens. They’re definitely a must-see this season.

We recently had 35,000 visitors in town for the Cooper River Bridge Run. Despite the rain, the event went on with flying colors. Isn’t that incredible? We also had the WTA Tennis Tournament on Daniel Island from April 2nd to the 10th.

There’s still time to take advantage of other fun events happening this April in our area. Enjoy the 69th annual Garden Tours festival until the 25th. The Farmer’s Market has also already started with live performances. The Spoleto Festival is coming up in May, so it’s time to start planning for that, too!

And now it’s time for a market update. Our housing market is booming here in Charleston. Market activity has increased while inventory levels have stayed incredibly low.  Prices increased to 6.6% compared to last year, but they’re doing so at a reasonable pace consumers can keep up with. In January and February, buyer activity increased 10% compared to 2015. The median sales price right now rests at around $235,000. Will buyer activity exceed 2005’s and 2006’s records?

Charleston is at the top of the charts. Our city was voted number one by Conde Naste and other major publications. U.S. News & World Reports ranked our area as the 19th place to live in the entire country.

If you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in Charleston, reach out via phone or email. I’d be happy to help answer any questions you might have!
