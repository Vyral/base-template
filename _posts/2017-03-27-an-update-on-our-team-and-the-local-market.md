My wife Jennifer joined our real estate team about six months ago. She was a teacher at Hillcrest Elementary for 11 years and since she made the switch, she has been a huge part of our growth and success.

**Jen helps out behind the scenes** with a lot of contract-to-close issues, client functions, and community involvement. In fact, we are excited to announce that we are partnering with the Cool Kids Campaign.

With every real estate transaction this year, we will make a $50 donation to the Cool Kids Campaign. As a former teacher and parent of two young kids, Jen wanted to find a strong, local charity that helped kids. The Cool Kids Campaign improves the lives of children with cancer and lends support to their families. We hope to contribute over $10,000 to the Cool Kids Campaigns this year. It is a really good feeling to know that our clients’ real estate success will carry over to support this foundation and our community.

We plan on selling a lot of houses this year. After all, **the more homes we sell, the more money we can give to the Cool Kids Campaign.**

We also want to give a quick shout out to Kristen and Dan, who just bought their first house. We were able to save them about $3,000 in moving expenses thanks to our moving truck! We are offering some great services this year and the moving truck is one of them, so spread the word.

Although the weather has been a little crazy lately, the real estate market is on fire. We sold 13 homes last week and almost every one of those had multiple offers and sold at list price. Inventory is also incredibly low. If the market wasn’t crazy enough already, the Federal Reserve just raised their interest rate by 0.25%. Luckily, the market already anticipated that rise, and mortgage interest rates actually went down a bit.

**Finally, we want to invite you to our happy hour**, organized by Jen, on April 27th at Union Jack's in Columbia. We hope to see you all there.

In the meantime, if you have any questions about real estate or if you would like to learn more about our current market, give us a call. We look forward to speaking with you!
