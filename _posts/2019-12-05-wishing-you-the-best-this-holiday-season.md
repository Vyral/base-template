While we’re getting our annual team pictures taken here at Eaglebrooke Country Club in Geneva, we wanted to introduce you to our team and thank you for all of your support this year. Whether we’ve been able to help you buy or sell a home, you’ve referred someone to us, or you just like watching our videos, thank you so much. We are all wishing you a very happy holiday season.
