<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Where do we rank among Pennsylvania’s best counties? Let’s just say we definitely don’t rank low.</em></p>

The Movoto Real Estate blog has researched and compiled a ranked [list of the best counties throughout Pennsylvania.](https://www.movoto.com/guide/pa/best-counties-in-pennsylvania/){: target="_blank"} Which one came out on top? Let’s find out.

**Each county was scored through a number of criteria, including:**

* Cultural access
* Historic landmarks
* Colleges
* Poverty rates
* Income
* Cost of living
* Unemployment rates

These ratings combined would show us the most desirable place to live in Pennsylvania. **And their findings show the No. 1 county is: our very own Cumberland County!**

There are many reasons why [Movoto.com](https://www.movoto.com/){: target="_blank"} chose us as the winners. Cumberland County is full of not only culture and history, but tons of colleges, historic landmarks, and festivals. The county has the fourth-lowest poverty rate in the state, sixth-lowest unemployment rate, fifth-highest income, and 10th-highest high school graduation rate. We also have the 11th-lowest commute time at 21 minutes.

With a median home price at an average of $183,000, the area is desirable but not impossible to afford. Nature lovers even have nearby access to both Pine Grove Furnace and Colonel Denning State Parks. **There’s a lot going for us here.**
