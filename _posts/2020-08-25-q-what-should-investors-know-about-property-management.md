If you’re thinking about becoming an investor, here’s where to put your money.

If you’re thinking about investing in a rental property, there’s a really big issue you need to be aware of.&nbsp;

For long-term investors, a single-family home is the ideal investment. A condo or townhome isn’t a bad choice, but they also come with extra HOA and maintenance fees that cut into your profit line.

With a single-family home, there is almost 100 years of data that show the positive growth rate on the equity of a home over 20 years. **It’s by far the safest investment, but it’s not for everyone in every situation.**
