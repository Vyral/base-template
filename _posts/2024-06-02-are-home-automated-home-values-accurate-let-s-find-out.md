Our world today offers instant information with the click of a button. This extends to all aspects of our lives, even the real estate market. Whenever homeowners are curious about their home values, home valuation tools like Zillow’s Zestimate, Redfin, and other sites can give you an instant estimate in a matter of seconds.

**In reality, real estate is high-tech, but it is also high-touch.** While convenient, technology like home automation tools should be seen as a starting point and not a definitive answer when it comes to knowing your home’s worth. Yes, computers can generate data with algorithms, but there is no replacing humans when it comes to identifying intangibles and unique factors of your home.

That is why, today, **I am very excited to launch a**[**<u>new automated home tool</u>**](https://asksarita.hifello.com/lp/65e5d80e1b8e68002b391c5c) ** ** to help you get an idea of how much your home is worth. This tool looks at several data sources to come up with the most accurate value possible. This is just the first step, and moving forward, I’d like to have a conversation with you to understand your specific situation and ensure the accuracy of the valuation.

If you think that the valuation is spot on, **I still encourage you to reach out to refine the initial estimate based on your home’s unique features and neighborhood trends.** Understanding your home’s value can also help determine how much equity you have. Lastly, we can create a plan to maximize the value of your home based on your goals.

I do understand that people crave instant automated information, but I’d like to warn you to take that information with a grain of salt and **make sure that you get advice from a real estate professional** such as myself. We know what’s going on on the ground and can pinpoint why your home’s value may or may not be accurate.

Again, here’s the[<u>link to my new automated home tool</u>](https://asksarita.hifello.com/lp/65e5d80e1b8e68002b391c5c). If you are ready to take the first step or have any questions, let’s talk. You can call me, send me an email, or visit my website,[<u>asksarita.com</u>](http://asksarita.com/). I’d be happy to help.
