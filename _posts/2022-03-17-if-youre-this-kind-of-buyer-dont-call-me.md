Don’t call me if you’re the type of buyer who wants me to pull up and show me a house before you’re pre-qualified. Why? If you want to win in this market, you need to be pre-qualified and fully underwritten.&nbsp;

Sellers are looking for buyers who will close, so don’t waste your time or my time if you’re not. If you are fully underwritten, please call me. To learn more, watch this short video.
