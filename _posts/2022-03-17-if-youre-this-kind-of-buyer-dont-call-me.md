Don’t call me if you’re the type of buyer who wants me to show you a house before you’re pre-qualified. Why? If you want to win in this market, you need to be pre-qualified and fully underwritten.&nbsp;

Sellers are looking for buyers who will close, so don’t waste your time or mine if you’re not. If you are fully underwritten, please call me. I'd love to help you find the perfect home.
