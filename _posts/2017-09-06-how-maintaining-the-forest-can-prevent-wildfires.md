Wildfire season is upon us and there is no rain in the forecast.

It’s especially crucial right now to be aware of some key safety points. First of all, take care of the forest.

The denseness of a forest can greatly change how it will respond to wildfire. A thinner stand of trees will be at a much lower risk, while an unthinned stand will be at the greatest risk.

A good spacing between trees is a minimum of 15 feet between smaller trees and a minimum of 30 feet between larger ones.

A home was saved last week in Missoula simply because someone took proper care of the surrounding land.

When trees are too tightly packed, they should absolutely be thinned out.

A fire spreading through a thickly populated area forest will spread much more quickly than one moving through a thinner stand.
