Today we are going to talk about some market statistics for Clarksville real estate. We look at these statistics every week and want to make sure that you are updated on the very latest news and numbers.

One thing we have been keeping an eye on for the last month or so is inventory. **Although our inventory levels are still lower than what we had at this time last year, but I have noticed that this inventory is starting to come back up.** Now, onto the numbers.

{% include pullquote.html %}

We currently have 959 active properties on the market. We have been hanging around 800 to 850 active properties for most of the year, so this is a considerable jump. In 2017, we saw a total of 2,011 homes come on the market, which is about a 6% change. However, we have closed 2,200 properties this year, up about 12% from the 1,900 we had last year.

**As for the average list price, this year is about $191,200, which is up from $178,000 last year.** Thatâ€™s about a 7.3% increase, which is a great sign. The list-to-sale ratio has also gone up from 98.89% last year to 99.17% this year. A lot of homes are selling for full price or even over their list price, and the statistics prove that.

Finally, if you are thinking about selling your home, the hottest price ranges are between $140,000 and $240,000. **Every price range is seeing homes sell, but this is the fastest one.**

If you have any other questions about the market or want more clarification on any of these numbers, feel free to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
