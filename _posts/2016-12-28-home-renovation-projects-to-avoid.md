If you’re getting ready to sell your home on the market, we’ve got some tips for you. **These are seven things that home buyers do not want to see in a potential home**:

1. Too much wallpaper. It’s hard for buyers to get excited about wallpaper because they will most likely tear it down anyway.

2. **Stay away from lavish lighting fixtures**. If you have an elaborate chandelier made of glass or deer antlers, replace it with something neutral while you’re in the process of selling.

3. Textured surfaces. Whether it’s your walls, ceilings, or other surfaces, buyers don’t tend to care much for them.

4. Using the wrong flooring. Just replacing your flooring with the cheapest option might actually hurt your value more than it will help it.

5. **Too much carpet**. Carpeted bedrooms and living areas are normal, carpeted bathrooms and kitchens are not. Most buyers want hardwood or tile floors in those areas.

6. Bold wall colors may turn buyers off. When in doubt, go neutral with your wall colors.

7. Pools and hot tubs don’t add much value. While they may add value to you while you are living there, most buyers don’t necessarily want to take on the cost of owning and maintaining these items and continuing to pay for them.
