<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s why a winter home sale makes so much sense this year.</em></p>

Despite COVID, the winter months are a perfect time for you to sell your home. **As we begin the holiday season, it makes even more sense for you to sell your home now rather than waiting until spring.&nbsp;**

Throughout 2020, COVID has created a sense of urgency with buyers to purchase homes while interest rates are low. With inventory also low, home prices are up because supply can’t keep up with demand.&nbsp;

The numbers over the last 35 to 40 days suggest that buyer demand remains very strong. ShowingTime’s data demonstrates that showings are up 62% from December 2019 to December 2020. We’ve been seeing a similar trend here, particularly in the Thanksgiving numbers. **Our market is still really strong for home sellers even during this time of year.**

At the time of writing, there is less than a one-month supply of homes in the San Fernando Valley, just 28 homes for sale in Porter Ranch, and 37 in Granada Hills. Even though we’re in the holiday months, focused buyers want to get into a new place now and you can take advantage of that demand by listing.&nbsp;

**Waiting until spring means waiting for more competition.** When you take a look at what’s transpiring right now, the activity suggests that we might not see a market like this in the future.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me about the market or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
