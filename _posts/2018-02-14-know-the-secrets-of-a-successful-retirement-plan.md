Imagine that you’re getting ready to go on a great vacation, you’re standing at the gate at Logan Airport, and you’re ready to board. Then, all of a sudden, the gate agent announces over the PA, “Ladies and gentlemen, the captain would like me to make the following announcement: He’d like me to share with you that there’s an 85% chance that this flight will not make it to your destination safely and on time. Have a nice flight.”

Would you be getting on that plane? Of course not. Why? Because there’s an 85% chance the plane won’t get to its destination on time safely.

I ask this same question to employers sponsoring a 401(k) or 403(b) plan. Why are they boarding their employees on their company-sponsored retirement plan when there’s a possibility they won’t arrive safely at their destination?

I call it the probability question: Are you giving your employees the opportunity to make it to retirement with a high probability of success? Will they have enough money saved to replace their current paycheck and create retirement income for life?

That’s what my video series is about. Over the course of the next year, **I’ll send you a series of videos talking about everything you need to know as a plan sponsor and how you can help your employees create retirement income for life.**
