As a homebuyer, the first step you need to take in the home buying process is to talk to a lender so you can get pre-qualified. During this step, you’ll determine which type of mortgage loan you’re going to get, and there are four loans you can potentially qualify for.&nbsp;

The first and most popular is the **FHA loan.** This loan requires you to put 3.5% down. Along with your down payment, it also requires you to be prepared to pay the closing costs.&nbsp;

The second loan type is the **conventional loan.** Most people who choose this loan put down 20%, but it allows you to put down as little as 3%. If you put down 20%, though, you won’t have to pay mortgage insurance.&nbsp;

The third loan type is the **USDA loan.** This loan is typically used for properties located in rural areas.

The fourth and final loan type is the **VA loan**, which you can use only if you’re a veteran or an active duty member of the U.S. armed forces.
