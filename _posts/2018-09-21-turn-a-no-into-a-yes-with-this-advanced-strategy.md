If you have a big team with designated lead follow-up, here’s a strategy to help you turn a “No” into a “Yes.”

Every day, our outbound callers are hard at work prospecting, typically making between 450 to 750 calls. On average, depending on the campaign, we get about 5% of those people on the phone. Most of them will say they’re not interested, but another 5% or so will say that they are interested. Those are the people we pre-qualify and send to you to follow up with, set appointments, and make sales.

What about the other 20, 30, or 40 people we talk to on a daily basis who say they aren’t interested, though? **We can send you these recorded calls so someone on your team can listen to them and see if any of them might be on the fence or if there was anything the VA missed.** VAs are great outbound prospectors, but they don’t know the real estate market like you and your team do. It’s possible that one or two of these people was a prospect but the VA simply didn’t know the additional advanced questions to ask.&nbsp;

This is an advanced strategy and it’s not for everyone, but it just might work for you.&nbsp;
