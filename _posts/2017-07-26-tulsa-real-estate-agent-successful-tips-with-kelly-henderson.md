According to fellow agent Kelly Henderson, time-blocking and lead-generation are two great tips to achieving success in our industry.

I have some invaluable tips about how to achieve success in our industry from someone who’s been there, done that—fellow KW agent Kelly Henderson.

Kelly is the team leader for her market center, a MAPS coach, and a brand-new mom. Needless to say, days are kept pretty busy. In the morning, she spends her time coaching. From about 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., she’s got her team leader hat on. During her lunch break, she does one-on-one meetings with all of her team members. At the end of each day, she reviews what her team is doing.

How does she do it all?

**Time-blocking.** She knows exactly what points of the day she’ll be doing certain activities. From her experience of being a new mom, her favorite tip to share is that sometimes money can cover everything. Leveraging your time with money through systems and people is actually one of the points I discuss in my class, too—along with learning how to say “no” more often.

Looking back on her own career, **Kelly’s advice for younger agents is to simply show up and work.** That doesn’t just apply to younger agents—that applies to anyone getting their real estate license. It takes time and energy to make money in real estate, specifically through lead generation. Whatever time and energy you can carve out each day is your stepping stone to achieving success.

For example, if you’ve never lead-generated, talk to five people a day. If you’re already lead generating, you should be talking to 15 to 20 people a day. Set a manageable goal every day, and hit that goal. The compound effect of that will add up over time.

If you have any questions for Kelly or referrals for her team, you can email her at KellyHenderson@KW.com.

If you have any questions for me, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be glad to help you.
