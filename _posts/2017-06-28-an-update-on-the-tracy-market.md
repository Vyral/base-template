Inventory is still very low here in the Tracy market, which is great news if you've been planning on selling your house. As a market, we're averaging about 81 sales a month, and there are about 119 homes on the market. These numbers indicate a tight market that's good for sellers. Even though conditions favor sellers, you still have to price your house right.

**It's absolutely a seller's market, indicated by the fact that we have just 1.46 months of supply**. That means if no new homes came on the market, we would sell out of the currently available homes in about a month and a half. When inventory is anywhere under four months, it's considered a seller's market, and as you get closer to zero, it becomes an even stronger seller's market. Between four and eight months of inventory signifies a normal market, and eight months and higher would indicate a buyer's market.

**You have to consider these stats when writing an offer on a home**. Due to current conditions in the Tracy market, selling your home now would likely mean you would receive multiple offers for your home and even some over list priceâ€”if you hire the right real estate team and price it correctly.
