**“The Wheel of Life” is a three-page exercise that I like to do at least twice a year with my entire team.** It really helps us stay focused on where we are in all the areas of our lives and where we need to be to achieve a better balance. I’ve attached the document to the email I sent you. If you didn’t get it, reach out to me and I’ll make sure you do.

**On page one of the document, you’ll see that your life can be broken down into seven key areas**: work, money, love life, family, spirituality, friends, and self. Each of these areas will have significant struggles within them, so there is space for you to write down a few things you are struggling with in each of the areas. Rate them from one to 10 based on how you think you’re handling those areas of your life, with 10 being the best. At the bottom of the first page, complete the section that asks you what your biggest struggle is overall.

On the second page, you’ll see a wheel with seven spokes. Each of those spokes are for the areas of life that we mentioned above. Plot each one based on the numbers from the first page. You should end up with a perfect circle, but you probably won’t the first time you do this. My first wheel looked more like a flat tire. The idea is that **over time, your wheel will straighten out and become a perfect circle**. At the bottom of this page, write down the biggest “a-ha” moment you had.

On the third and final page, write down a few of your goals in each area. Then write down some specific, actionable steps you can take to reach them. Finally, at the bottom of the page write down your biggest goal. **Keep that goal in mind each and every day.**

Once you’ve filled this out, you’ll have a much better idea of where you are, where you want to be, and how you can get there. Repeat this exercise every six months. You’ll be surprised at how your wheel changes. It’s important to visualize these changes because if you don’t, you won’t make any intentional efforts to make them yourself.

I hope you found this exercise helpful. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
