Our real estate market is as hot as our temperatures, which is to say *it’s practically on fire*. So if you own a home right now, you’re essentially swimming in a pile of money.&nbsp;

Sellers are making ridiculous profits by jumping into the market. Agents are keeping their hands full with new clients who are flooding in and trying to buy and sell homes. **We just served our 110th client this year, closing over $50 million for area Buyers and Sellers in 2021\!** So we are *acutely* aware of just how much demand is out there.&nbsp;

**“But show us the money - we want examples\!”**

No problem\! To give you an idea of what sellers can get today, I’d like to show off a few homes that are what I call “stoopid money properties” (the two oo’s are for emphasis).

**Stoopid Money Scenario \#1 - Downtown St. George:** We listed a home in Downtown St. George for $499,000, which is already pretty high based on historical values in the area. Just a bit larger than 1,900 sf\! Get this: **It sold for $550,000 within 24 hours**. We literally had half a dozen buyers fighting for it.

**Stoopid Money Scenario \#2 - Red Cliffs**\: Another home in the Red Cliffs area sold for $240,000 in 2016, but it just sold again for $405,000 last month. A “stucco box” built in the 1990s...the epitome of average\! And they struck $165k worth of “gold”: in just four years.&nbsp;

**Stoopid Money Scenario \#3 - Arcadia Resort:** Finally, a home in Arcadia sold for $660,000 in 2019—guess how much it went for this year? Would you believe it sold for $1.1 million?&nbsp;

If that’s not *stoopid money*, I don’t know what is.

**Needless to say, it’s an incredible time to be a (selling) homeowner right now.** So if you’ve had even the slightest thought of selling your home, now is the moment to strike—*especially* if it’s an investment property or second home.

If you’d like to get a “quick and dirty” estimate of what your home might be worth, you can do so in about 60 seconds right here: [www.DixieHomeValue.com](http://www.dixiehomevalue.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.&nbsp;

That’s an automated valuation system. It’s generally accurate but far from having us look at your home and provide a full-blown, on-the-ground opinion of value.&nbsp;

If you’d like us to do so, just say the word\! Reply to this email or call the Larkin Group team and me at **435-375-3462**.&nbsp;

We’ll give you a custom, written report that will show precisely how much you can expect to pocket if you sell now - no obligation whatsoever.&nbsp;

If you have any other St. George real estate questions, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to helping you soon\!
