Not buying a home is the biggest mistake millennials are making. Here’s why.

Do you know a millennial that should be buying a home? Perhaps you yourself are a millennial who is hesitant to make the transition from renter to first-time home buyer.

Last week, CNBC ran an article quoting self-made millionaire David Bach explaining that **not purchasing a home is “the single biggest mistake millennials are making”** because buying real estate is “an escalator to wealth.”

Bach went on to explain:

**“If millennials don’t buy a home, their chances of actually having any wealth in this country are little to none.** The average homeowner to this day is 38 times wealthier than a renter.”

In his bestselling book, The Automatic Millionaire, Bach does the math:

“As a renter, you can easily spend $500,000 or more on rent over the years ($1,500 a month for 30 years comes to $540,000), and in the end wind up just where you started — owning nothing. Or you can buy a house and spend the same amount paying down a mortgage, and in the end wind up owning your own home free and clear!”
