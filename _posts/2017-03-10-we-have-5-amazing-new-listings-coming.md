As you all know, housing inventory is incredibly low right now. Today, I want to share five amazing new listings that you won’t be able to find anywhere on the web or on the MLS. **These listings aren’t even on the market yet; I just wanted to share them with you and give you a head start. **

First, if you are interested in the Lawrence Township, then check out this three-bedroom, one-bath midcentury ranch home with its original hardwood floors. This is a very cute property and it will hit the market listed at $100,000.

We have two new listings coming up in Center Grove, and both will be listed at $185,000. The first is a three-bed, 2 ½ bath home with 1 ½ stories. The kitchen has been completely gutted and the home features a gorgeous screened-in porch and fantastic laminate, hardwood floors. This property sits on a corner lot in the Pebble Run subdivision.

The other property is a stone ranch with a walkout basement in the El Dorado subdivision. This home is right on the golf course, and it’s also on a nice cul-de-sac.

In Greenwood, there is a beautiful property available in the Clark-Pleasant School District. This ranch home is getting fresh paint and all new carpeting. The listing price is $135,000.

Finally, our fifth listing is in Center Grove. This home sits on four acres with a huge, 50-by-50 pole barn and has an attached three-car garage. It is a beautiful, historic home and will be listed at $400,000.

**No one else knows about these homes yet**, which is why I have not included their addresses today. If you are interested in any of these listings and would like more details, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
