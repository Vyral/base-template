Buyers and sellers hire me for my negotiation skills—not for driving them around or standing for hours at home inspections. **They want me to get them what they want.**

Though I’m currently in Bonaire, thousands of miles away from DC, I have no worries about my clients back home—not even the two buyers and the seller I’m currently counseling. Why? **Because I have a team back home to help me out.** After all, nobody can be in two places at once.

This is why it’s so important that your agent has a team: **You need to be able to get the advice you need at any time.**

If you have any questions or need more information, reach out to me. My team and I would love to help you out.
