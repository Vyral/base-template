If you can no longer afford your mortgage payments, what are your options?

First, you can try to refinance and see if you can get a lower mortgage payment. Usually by refinancing, you get a month or two off your mortgage. This also helps.

**The second option is to see if your lender is willing to recast your mortgage.** Let’s say you’re 10 years into a 30-year mortgage. You can ask your lender to extend the remaining 20 years back out to 30, which will hopefully make your payments more affordable.

**But if you’ve exhausted these two options, let your lender know.**Tell them you’ve tried your best to go another route, and see if they’re willing to modify your mortgage.

Usually if you have proof you’ve exhausted your other options and have documented proof of hardship, like a pay cut at work or an illness, you will have a strong case for a loan modification.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
