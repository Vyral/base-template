Are you getting ready to buy a home? There are a few things you need to be aware of before you get started with the process.&nbsp;

**First, do not deposit large sums of cash without consulting your loan officer.** Large cash deposits can be challenging to trace and raise concerns for lenders. Avoid making significant purchases, such as appliances or furniture, and steer clear of co-signing loans for others since these actions may impact your debt-to-income ratio.&nbsp;

Additionally, don’t change bank accounts unless absolutely necessary for your lender to track your assets. Consistency in your financial transactions is key.

**Next, avoid applying for new credit and closing any existing accounts.** Both actions can influence your credit score and potentially affect your mortgage rate and loan approval.&nbsp;

Finally, consult with your lender before making significant financial decisions. Remember to rely on your team of professionals for expert advice and useful tips throughout the home-buying process.
