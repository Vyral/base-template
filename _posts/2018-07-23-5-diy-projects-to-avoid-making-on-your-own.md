Today we are going to be talking about the worst mistake you can make before selling your home. **If you have ever gotten ready to sell a home, you know that in order to fetch top dollar, you need to get your home in good shape.**

Instead of hiring contractors, painters, and other professionals, you might be thinking you can save some cash by doing them yourself. That is fine and good if you know what you are doing. **Unless your DIY skills are advanced, experts agree that this is one of the biggest mistakes a home seller can make.** If you mess up, you could make things worse and end up shelling out even more money out down the road. To help you separate these tasks you can tackle on your own from the ones best left to professionals, here are some DIY projects to avoid when selling your home:

**1. Drywall repai****r.** If your rooms only need a fresh coat of paint, I say go for it. However, if you have cracks in your drywall from a shifting foundation or a depression in the wall from years of doorknob slams, it is worth it to hire a pro. **You do not want your fix to look worse than the original problem,** so contract out the drywall repair and finish the paint job on your own after.

**2. HVAC repairs.** Heating and cooling systems are complex and often connected to both electrical and gas systems. Making a mistake could mean blowing out the entire system, setting you up for a much more expensive repair in the end. Even something as relatively simple as installing a smart thermostat can fry your wiring if done incorrectly When it comes to your heating and A/C systems, approach with caution.

**3. Tree removal.** Even if it is a smaller tree, digging up the roots can be difficult. Meanwhile, if you do not have the proper tools to remove the upper part of the tree, if can also be potentially dangerous. **You do not want to be the person who puts a tree through your own roof, so hire a tree removal professional.**

**4. Advanced electrical.** While replacing a light fixture or ceiling fan could be fine to do on your own, experts draw the line at any electrical work involving the breaker box. Not only could you hurt yourself, but you also could create a fire hazard, especially if your home is not brand-new.

**5. Plumbing.** Some plumbing tasks, such as snaking a slow drain or fixing a running toilet, are easy enough to do on your own. However, pipes are complex and tricky to reassemble, particularly when they are in close proximity to other plumbing components and machinery, such as dishwashers or garbage disposals. Leave those to the professionals.
