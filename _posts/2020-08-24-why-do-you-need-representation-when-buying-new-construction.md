<center><em>If you&rsquo;re thinking of buying new construction, you need to hire an agent.</em></center>

<br>When buying a new construction home, you absolutely need an agent on your side representing your interests. There are a few key reasons why.

First, while the builder’s agent may be friendly and helpful, **they still represent the builder**. They have a fiduciary responsibility to represent their interests, and if you enter into the transaction and give them more information about yourself, they can use it against you. Their incentive is to get you to pay more for the property so they make more money.

This leads us to our next point: Without representation, the builder’s agent will be the one helping you pick out all of your upgrades, and **they’ll inevitably suggest making every upgrade possible**. Having an agent working for you provides a voice of temperament when it comes to choosing upgrades. They’ll help you be smarter about where to spend your hard-earned money and avoid expensive, unnecessary upgrades.

Also, having representation means **having a second set of eyes to look over the builder’s purchase agreement**. Most builders have their own purchase agreement, and these are usually lengthy documents. Your agent can identify any mistakes, keep the builder honest, and make sure all contractual items are in order.

Lastly, having representation when building a new home doesn’t cost you anything. Contrary to what some may think, in this market, builders usually won’t give you a discount if you don’t have your own representative.
