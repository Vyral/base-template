When it comes to decluttering, Marie Kondo is all the rage right now. She’s the Japanese lifestyle celebrity who has the miraculous ability to help people declutter their homes for good. What’s her trick? Only keep the things that spark joy or keep you happy.&nbsp;

**Here are three tips based on that principle that you should follow when decluttering:**

First, collect all of the same things around the house (e.g. all the books), touch each object once, and ask yourself whether it sparks joy. If it doesn’t, it needs to go.&nbsp;

Next, remember to follow the right order when tidying up. Start with clothing, move on to books, papers, and other miscellaneous items, and then focus on mementos. By the time you get to mementos, you’ll understand the method. Don’t keep things because you think they might come in handy. The likelihood that they will come in handy is low, and you can always buy a newer version of an item that does spark joy in the off-chance that you’ll need it.&nbsp;

Lastly, **get rid of the clutter before buying storage containers** or other oversized products to organize your space. Take it slow and don’t stress over the process too much. You want to make sure you do it right and on your own time. At the end of the day, you’ll find that you only keep things that make you happy.
