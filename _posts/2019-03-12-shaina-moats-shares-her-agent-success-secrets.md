On my latest edition of “Agent Success Secrets”, I had the pleasure of being joined by Shaina Moats. Shaina is not only a wonderful wife and mother, but she is also a successful real estate agent. We talked about her career, how she balances it with having a family, and why she and Kristen Williams decided to create a new MAPS training class.&nbsp;

**Here's an outline of our discussion, with timestamps so that you can skip ahead to the section (s) that interest you the most:**

0:30- Shaina shares some insight into her business, her family, and her life in general.<br>1:15- How and why Shaina wanted to get into the real estate business and how she gained momentum after a rocky start.<br>6:15- How Shaina keeps her work-life balance in check.<br>8:45- The importance of being intentional when Shaina is time-blocking her week.<br>11:05- The reason that Shaina and Kristen decided to create their KW Family MAPS class for all parents.<br>13:15- Shaina shares a story about her and her husband attending KW Family Reunion.<br>16:10- Action items that you can be working on when it comes to Command.<br>17:40- Defining Opportunities.<br>19:43- Bobby’s job description on Shaina’s team.<br>21:30- A few final thoughts from Shaina about keeping calm and carrying on.

Thanks again to Shaina for joining me. I was so happy to be able to get her insight on so many different things. If you have any questions for me about anything we talked about in the video above, or anything else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
