Imagine you’re a buyer and inventory is tight in the area you want to live in. There may only be one house in a certain neighborhood, but seven other people want that home too.&nbsp;

What do you do? You have two choices: You can either keep making offers on these homes and hope you get lucky, or **you can hire an agent who knows how to find off-market properties that suit your needs.**&nbsp;

One of my buyers recently lost out on a home in a multiple-offer situation, and this is exactly what I’m doing for them. In fact, I found a street where the homes look like they haven’t turned over for 10 or 15 years, so I plan on calling every home on that street, knocking on a few doors, and asking those homeowners if they’re thinking of selling anytime soon.&nbsp;

In total, I’ll choose around 150 homes that are close to my buyer’s price range and I know they would like if they were on the market. All the while, I have their written permission to reach out to these homeowners on their behalf.&nbsp;

The point is, **you never know who might be thinking of selling and just needs a little extra incentive,** so make sure you have an agent who can work “under the radar” for you if necessary and find you the perfect off-market property that you won’t have to compete for. If you don’t have such an agent, give me a call and I’d love to help you.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any other questions about our market, feel free to reach out to me as well. I look forward to hearing from you.
