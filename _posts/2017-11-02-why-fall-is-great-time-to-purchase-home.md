There are more than a couple reasons why fall is a great time to buy a home in our market.

<div class="post-cta">

<strong>Want to buy a home? <a href="" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale</a></strong>
</div>

There are seven reasons what fall is a great time to purchase a home.

**1. There is less competition.** If you’re a buyer out there looking in the fall, chances are you face less competition from other buyers and steer clear of any multiple offer situations like you’d see in the spring.

**2. Sellers are tired of marketing.** They want to be done with things. They’ve probably been on the market since summer, and that tends to wear them down. This makes them a little more motivated.

**3. Sellers are more serious.** Oftentimes, they’re trying to move before winter hits, so that works in your favor.

**4. You can also take advantage of the tax breaks you’ll get during this time of year.**

**5. Pricing tends to be more reasonable.** Again, sellers have been on the market for a while and they’re tired of marketing their property. As we all know, the longer a seller’s home is on the market, the less they’ll typically take for their property.

**6. There are fewer buyers out there.** This is somewhat related to the first point, but fewer buyers means sellers are happy when they get active showings.

**7. Interest rates are still great!**
