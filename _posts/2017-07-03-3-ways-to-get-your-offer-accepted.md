Getting an offer accepted in this market isn’t easy. Here are three ways you can help your offer stand out.

**Looking to buy a home?** <a href="http://www.natemartinezteam.com/" target="_blank">Search All Homes</a>
**Looking to sell a home?** <a href="http://www.natemartinezteam.com/home-valuation/" target="_blank">Get a FREE Home Value Report</a>

In today’s market we are finding that sellers are consistently receiving multiple offers. When this happens, the sellers are going to have the luxury of choosing the offer that meets their needs. That’s an important thing to remember when making an offer yourself. **Here are three ways to make sure your next offer meets the seller’s needs:**

**1. Get pre-approved.** This shows the sellers that you are serious about buying. It also allows you to quickly make an offer once you find a home because you are already approved.

**2. Write a good offer.** Expect to pay full price or better to win in this market. Limit that inspection time, increase your earnest money deposit, and be confident that it’s the strongest offer possible.

**3. Write a letter to the seller.** If you write a compelling letter to the seller that tells them why you love the house so much, it can create an emotional connection. If you’re neck and neck against another buyer, this could be enough to put you over the edge. Recently, one of our buyers won out in a multiple offer situation with the help of a custom video.

If you have any other questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
