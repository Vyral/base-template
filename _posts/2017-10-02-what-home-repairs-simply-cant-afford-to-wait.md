Today I want to go over the nine home repairs you should never put off. These repairs can make a big difference in your home whether you’re selling or staying put.

1. **Caulking.** No one likes mildew in their showers, tubs, or elsewhere in their home. Caulking is easy to do and prevents water from getting into spaces it shouldn’t, where it might cause a bigger problem.&nbsp;
2. **Cleaning your dryer vent.** Lint that builds up in your dryer is combustible. With all the hot air that goes into the dryer line and dryer vent, excess lint could lead to fires. Both of these areas should be clean and clear to prevent any danger.
3. **Roof repairs.** Whether your roof is missing some shingles, there’s an issue with flashing around the chimney, or the gutters aren’t quite right, repairs to your roof are going to be much cheaper if you take care of them when they arise. Waiting until things get too out of hand is always a bad idea.
4. **Chimney sweeping.** This is something I recommend you do once a year. It prevents critters from creating nests. Also, doing an annual sweep will serve as a preemptive effort against any future issues.&nbsp;
5. **Changing the HVAC filter.** This is one of the easiest and most inexpensive repairs, but is also something people tend to let slip their mind. Dirty filters make your HVAC work a lot harder. This could cause damage to your system and drive up your utility bills. For the best results, I recommend changing the filter seasonally.&nbsp;
6. **Addressing pest problems.** If you see any issues with termites, ants, or other pests, it’s much better to get the problem taken care of right away. If you don’t, things could be much more costly down the line.&nbsp;
7. **Fixing plumbing leaks.** Leaks can cause mold, ruin paint, or cause other damage in your home. It’s important to take care of any plumbing leaks immediately.
8. **Fixing peeling paint.** This is an aesthetic problem that is more easily taken care of before the issue becomes too widespread.&nbsp;
9. **Fixing drainage problems.** Drainage problems are some of the more common issues we see. The Earth can settle around a home and create a negative grade, which keeps rainwater and melting snow up along the edge of the house. I would recommend going around the perimeter of your house once a year or so and adding dirt where it’s needed. Also, make sure downspouts are always directing water away from your house.
