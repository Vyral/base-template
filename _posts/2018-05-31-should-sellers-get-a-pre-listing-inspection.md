Is it advisable to get a pre-listing inspection before putting your property on the market?

It’s easy to grow attached to your home and overlook some of the wear and tear, but buyers may not see these flaws the same way you do. **A home purchase is a large investment, so most buyers want to ensure they’re making a good choice before they proceed.** 

Getting a pre-listing inspection can save you money and time as a seller. This process can allow you to find out exactly the condition of your home, and gives you the opportunity to make any necessary repairs or updates before listing.

When issues are discovered during the buyer’s home inspection, the buyer and seller will enter into a negotiation period. This will determine who covers the cost of repairs, but buyers tend to significantly overestimate the price of repairs. Having a pre-listing inspection can prevent this situation from arising. 

But is there a downside? Well, it’s important to realize that **if you don’t take on the repairs outlined in the inspection report, you may be legally required to disclose all issues you found.** Whether disclosure laws put you at a disadvantage really depends on your circumstances.
