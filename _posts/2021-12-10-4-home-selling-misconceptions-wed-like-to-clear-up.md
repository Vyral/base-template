Here are four things that people are saying about selling a home these days that just aren’t true:

**1\. You don’t need to renovate your house to sell it.** First of all, a home that has a fresh coat of paint and is going to stand out in any market and sell for more money.

**2\. You can price your home for a high price and sell it.** You can’t expect to get the top of the market price even in a market like this. The fundamentals of the market are still there. Unless you have an extremely rare piece of real estate, you should follow the same pricing principles that you would in any other market.

**3\. Sellers don’t need to market their home.** That’s just not the case. Homes that are marketed professionally with high-quality photos, staging, and a great online presence are going to make a big splash and attract more buyers.

**4\. You should always choose the highest offer in a bidding war.** That’s not always the case. There are so many other terms in a real estate purchase contract that you need to look at and evaluate with your agent to determine what is best for you and your situation.&nbsp;

Hopefully this gives you some idea of where our real estate market is right now. If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
