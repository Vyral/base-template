Political scandals may be affecting mortgage rates in our area. But how is this possible?
<br>
<br>Recently, President Trump’s involvement in a few FBI scandals had some unintended fiscal policy consequences. It cast doubt on the administration’s ability to quickly enact legislation that would benefit the investors that pushed the stock market higher.
<br>
<br>**When people experience that kind of uncertainty, the stock market goes down and therefore the interest rates go down.** Investors start buying treasury bonds instead of mortgage-backed securities and bond prices go up.

What do bond prices have to do with mortgage rates? **When there is uncertainty in the market, people do what is called a “flight to safety.”** People will buy lower risk bonds instead of stocks or mortgage-backed securities. When bond prices go up, mortgage rates go down.
<br>
<br>When mortgage rates go down, we see a shift in buying patterns where more people will jump back into the market. So while rates are this low, it’s a great time to jump off the fence and buy or sell your home.
