**I have some of the most exciting news I’ve ever delivered to you today.** We’re super excited to roll out our first no loan contingent pre-approval.

We’ve been working on developing this for quite some time and we’ve had a lot of tough issues to overcome in order to be able to do it. However, our company and our underwriters decided that we want to make us different and want to make you and your clients different.

In a competitive market like this, what can help you get more offers accepted? An offer with no loan contingencies. **We’re underwriting the file, satisfying the conditions, and writing you an approval letter that says “No loan contingencies whatsoever.”**

In a competitive situation, if you have this kind of pre-approval, I believe you will get more deals and I think you’ll get your offer accepted at a much higher rate than those who do have contingencies.

<br>**Everybody does 30-day closings, but does anybody do no loan contingent closings?**Not to our knowledge. If you have any questions for me or want to take advantage of this new offer we have, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
