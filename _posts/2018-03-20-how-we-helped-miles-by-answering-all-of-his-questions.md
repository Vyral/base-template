*“We met John through an open house. He was very knowledgeable about the area, really down to earth, and really understood what we were looking for. He helped my brother purchase a house, helped us buy two, and helped us sell two. They’re quick to answer any questions we have. I can text him or his wife and they both will get back to us right away.*

*We were thinking of renting our house about a year or two ago. We talked to John during the early planning phases. He sat down and went over what we needed to do, what kind of expectations we should have, and his experiences with renting and being a landlord himself. As soon as we called him he jumped right up, was willing to help us, and had answers to all of our questions.”*<br><br>**- Miles McClain, Home Buyer / Home Seller**
