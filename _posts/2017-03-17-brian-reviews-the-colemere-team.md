*“Bryan was a referral from a friend of mine. I was a little apprehensive because I’ve worked with realtors in the past but, I liked the way that he thought. It wasn’t all just go big or go home. He actually tried to find the best fit for us. I called him several times in the evenings and on weekends and he always took my calls. If he didn’t answer he made sure to call me right back, even on a weekend. He was always able to answer any questions I had and help me think through the whole process.”*
