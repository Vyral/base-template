Today I want to let you in on how to maximize what you earn for your home sale while minimizing your expenses in doing so. There are three key ways to sell your home quickly and for top dollar.

**Use online marketing.**With the power of the internet, your first showing is actually what buyers see online. Times have changed a little bit in this regard. My team and I can help you navigate through this marketing process. We feature your home across over a thousand  websites to gain the maximum exposure for your home.

**Look at comparable homes.** Examining home listings that are similar to yours can help you determine your own sale price. However, be careful with the figures you look at. Home values have been rapidly increasing lately. A $300,000 home is worth around $10,000 to $20,000 more now than it was a year ago. When you look at comparable homes that sold in the past six to 12 months, you’ve got to factor in the 5% or 6% appreciation rate we’ve seen since over that time. My team can help you with this. Not only can we look at what’s sold in the past, we can also predict how quickly inventory will move in various neighborhoods.

**Make key home improvements.** There are a few very simple, relatively inexpensive home improvements you can make to help maximize your sale. Did you know that, during showings, 80% of buyers make up their mind about whether they want to go into a home before they even exit their vehicle? This decision comes from the quality of your curb appeal, but also from the opinion they formed based on your online listing. A little bit of money will go a long way in improving your home. Make sure your home is clean and free of clutter both inside and out.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
