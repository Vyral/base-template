A move from one home to the next often represents an important step forward for the adults in a family, whether the transition is spurred by a job change, a change in lifestyle, or something else entirely.&nbsp;

Whatever the case, moving can be a difficult and stressful experience. And children are not exempt from these feelings.&nbsp;

People tend to stay in a given home for between five and seven years, which is a less significant amount of time for adults than it is for children. After all, **what seems like a relatively short time to an adult may be half a life’s worth of experiences for a child.&nbsp;**

Moving away from the only home they have ever known can be especially troubling for children. Thankfully, there are a few key steps parents may follow to make the moving process more tolerable for their kids. I would be happy to provide you with a great article I wrote on the subject if you’re interested in learning more. Simply reach out.&nbsp;

First, **give your children a sense of control by allowing them to assist in certain decisions.** For example, while decluttering is an important part of any move, children are often very attached to their belongings. Consider letting your children have a say in what they keep and give away. Also, allowing your child to pick out paint colors for their new room is another great way to help rouse their excitement about the move. Letting your kids play a more active role in the process may help to ease their sense of powerlessness during the move.&nbsp;

That said, **do not try to erase your children’s feelings altogether.** Allow them to work through their grief in healthy ways, like writing goodbye letters or reminiscing together over memories you made in your old home.&nbsp;

As their parent, it’s important for you to strike a balance between respecting your children’s feelings and taking proactive steps to frame your new home in a positive light. Start creating positive experiences from the start. The sooner they become familiar with the area, the sooner they will adjust to the idea of their new life there. **If your child has a particular hobby, consider researching outlets for it in your new neighborhood.**

Getting your child involved in an extracurricular activity, therefore allowing them to bond with other kids their age, can really help them warm up to their new home.&nbsp;

Ultimately, being mindful of your child’s needs and feelings during the move can make the transition much easier on the whole family.
