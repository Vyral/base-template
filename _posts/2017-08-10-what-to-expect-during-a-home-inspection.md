Lately, I’ve gotten a lot of questions about home inspections, so I decided to start a video series to cover everything you need to know. Today, I’ll go over a few key points for homebuyers.

**1.  When?** As soon as we get a contract on your house, one of the very first things we’ll do is order a home inspection. The contract generally has a short period to get your inspection done and request repairs from the seller.

**2.  Who?** There are a lot of home inspectors out there. You can do a search on the Internet or we can recommend a few inspectors who have helped our clients in the past. That said, you need to make sure that the home inspector has an active license. Check out this **[website](http://www.mrec.state.ms.us/)** to make sure your home inspector’s license is active.

**3.  How** **much does it cost?** Home inspections tend to start around $250. The majority of home inspections cost about $300 to $350, and very large homes will cost $400 or more.

**4.  What** **do you get for your money?** You will receive a lengthy report detailing any issues with the home, including major concerns, minor concerns, safety hazards, and maintenance items.

You should also determine what will happen if the inspector misses a major problem in the home. Is the inspector insured, what is the procedure, and how is the inspector covered?
