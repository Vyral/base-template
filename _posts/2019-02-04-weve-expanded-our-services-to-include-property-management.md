Penev Realty has an exciting announcement: We’re expanding! **We’re now adding property management to our services,** meaning that we will soon help investor clients handle their single-family, multi-family, and vacation rental properties. 

As many of you may already know, we already have a lot of experience with property management through our work managing and selling corporate-owned properties. We’ve handled hundreds of these kinds of properties, including those with countless issues—legal and otherwise.

In addition to this, Penev Realty has also managed its own portfolio of investment properties over the years. And this portfolio is now set to bring between 40% and 60% ROI each year. In short, our experience in both investing and property management gives us a unique qualification to help our clients build their own investment portfolios, as well. 

So **if you or someone you know is looking for help with investing or is in need of a property manager, please feel free to give us a call or send us an email.** We look forward to hearing from you soon.
