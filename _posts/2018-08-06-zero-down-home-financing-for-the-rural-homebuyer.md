Today we're going to take a closer look at USDA home loans and the benefits they bring to homebuyers.

**A USDA home loan is a loan guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.** It doesn’t work everywhere, however—the purpose the of the program is to help with financing homes in rural areas. You will not get approved for this loan inside a city with a population of more than 25,000.

As a type of conventional loan, the USDA loan uses a conventional appraisal. Similar to the VA loan, **it doesn’t require a down payment at all.** The borrower must have a 620 credit score (at least with my company), and there will be a small private mortgage insurance amount that you will be expected to pay.

For all USDA home loans, there is a maximum family income. This varies based on the location of the home, which is why you need to make sure to check with your loan officer. For example, **in the San Antonio area, the maximum income for a family of four cannot exceed $82,700 in order to be eligible for the USDA loan.** Of course, larger families have higher maximum incomes.

The USDA home loan program is a great product if used properly, and it has helped many families in less populous areas in the nation.
