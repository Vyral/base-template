<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I couldn’t be more excited to introduce you to Sam Dubs of Bluetek IT Solutions for today’s business highlight video. Let’s check out what they have to offer!</em></p>

I’ve worked with Sam Dubs for about 15 years, since around the time my company was just starting, and I’m so excited to introduce you to him and highlight what his company, Bluetek IT Solutions, is all about.

Bluetek provides IT services to small businesses, and their goal is to eliminate your technology headaches and increase your business’ profitability.&nbsp;

As a business leader, there are things that keep me up at night if I’m feeling vulnerable. It’s lonely sometimes, especially if you don’t have anyone to turn to for some of your business problems. I asked Sam about some of the challenges that he loses sleep over, as a business owner himself.

When Sam started consulting for local businesses, he was just an IT geek with a business. As his company grew, he found he couldn’t do it all anymore, and he had to hire technicians to replace him. The problem was that his clients hired him and wanted him to help, so **his toughest challenge was finding technicians who could fill his shoes and earn the trust of his clients.**

As a real estate agent, I can relate to Sam’s challenges there. I then asked him what he’s most excited for in the years to come.

Sam is really excited about Bluetek’s all-inclusive IT package. **With this package, they’ll come to your business and provide all of your IT support, including security and everything you need to keep your business running smoothly for one monthly price that’s easy to budget.**

We also spoke with a couple of Sam’s employees, Craig and Jake, who do a little bit of everything from taking inbound calls to going on-site to help people solve their IT problems, which Craig and Jake say are their favorite parts of the job.

As I said, I’ve been working with Bluetek for around 15 years, and our business wouldn’t be what it is now without the help of Sam and his team. If you’re a business owner or you know a business owner, **reach out to Sam and his team at (717) 502-2144 for a free business technology assessment—and tell them Dave Hooke sent you\!** They’ll look at all of your tech needs, including data, storage, software, and more to give you a comprehensive evaluation and show you where you can develop efficiency in your business that will go straight to your bottom line and allow you to concentrate on doing what you do best: serving your clients.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out to the Dave Hook Team. We’d be glad to take care of you.
