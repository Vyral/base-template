Today I am going to answer the question about whether or not you can discriminate against somebody that holds a miracle medical marijuana card and tests positive for cannabis in their system.

Federally, it is not protected to have a medical marijuana card because there is not a federal law.

There are some states across the country, however, which have passed marijuana laws within their states. This means that if you are in a state where marijuana is legalized, from a medicinal perspective, **you cannot discriminate against them if they test positive on their drug test prior to employment.** You cannot not hire them for those reasons.

**This does not mean that you canâ€™t do anything, or have any actions that you can take.** If they are impaired on the job or bring any type of paraphernalia on company property, you are allowed to do something. If the job is a position in which there may be a safety issue or, as an organization, you could lose federal benefits, you can also act.

If you have any further questions, please contact me. If I am unable to answer your specific question, one of our attorneys that specializes in the area may be able to help. I look forward to speaking with you.
