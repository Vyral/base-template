You might’ve heard ads or people saying we’re in a “buyer’s market.” That couldn’t be further from the truth. **We’re 100% in a seller’s market.** If you’ve been sitting on the fence about buying or selling, it’s time to pay attention.

But what does a seller’s market mean for you? Let’s get real: **a seller’s market means homes fly off the market faster than ever.** The National Association of Realtors defines a seller’s market as a market with fewer than five months of inventory. In our area, we currently have **less than one month** of homes available. That’s a big deal.

If you’re a seller, this is your moment. However, with higher interest rates, some buyers are cautious. What does that mean for you as a buyer? It means you’re not alone in this. The market is active, and buyers are still making moves.

Why are homes still selling fast? Life happens. We call it the “5 Ds”: death, divorce, degrees, diapers, and diplomas. These life changes don’t wait for perfect interest rates. Families grow. People downsize. Jobs relocate. That’s why sellers still list, even if they hold onto those low 3% mortgage rates.

If you’re thinking about selling, you’re probably wondering, “Should I wait?” Here’s the truth—buyers are already waiting for new inventory. That’s why December 2024 was one of the busiest Decembers we’ve seen in years. **The market is hot, and it’s not slowing down.**

For many buyers, these interest rates (6%–8%) are the only ones they’ve ever known. If you’re a first-time buyer, this feels normal, and you’re not wrong. We’re almost three years into this higher-rate environment, and the market has adjusted.

If you’re waiting for rates to drop, you could miss out. The reality is, homes are still in demand. Buyers are making moves, and sellers are ready to list for the right reasons.
