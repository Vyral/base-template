I often get asked why I started a real estate team. What is the benefit of hiring a real estate team instead of working with a solo agent?

I started out as an individual agent, like most people do. I tried to do everything. As you know, our business covers a lot of territory; there are legal aspects, documents, negotiation, finding and searching for homes, marketing, and more.

While we always try to get better and improve, there are some areas of the business that you will be naturally good at and other areas that you will struggle in. I decided to assemble a team of real estate agents to counterbalance my strengths and offset my weaknesses. **In other words, we are specialists instead of generalists.**

Basically, what I do is focus on negotiations. It’s an area that I love and that I’m very good at. I also focus on marketing because that’s what I studied in school.

In terms of finding homes or overseeing the documents that are part of a deal, I’m still a part of it to make sure that things are done correctly and comprehensively. However, we have specialists who oversee those aspects so that you are served at the highest level.

**The other huge benefit is that hiring a real estate team costs the same.**Instead of paying for an individual agent who will do a great job at some parts of the transactions, you can pay eight specialists to handle your transaction for the price of one.
