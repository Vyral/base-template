<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I couldn’t be more excited to introduce you to Sam Dubs of Bluetek IT Solutions for today’s business highlight video. Let’s check out what they have to offer!</em></p>

I’ve worked with Sam Dubs for about 15 years, since around the time my company was just starting, and I’m so excited to introduce you to him and highlight what his company, Bluetek IT Solutions, provides.

So many of us are working from home and need to do our jobs virtually as we commit to working from home & prioritize social responsibility above all else. Sam Dubbs with Bluetek IT is someone who is on the front lines of responding to organizations who need their virtual technology optimized during this uncharted time.

As a business leader, there are things that keep me up at night if I’m feeling vulnerable. It’s lonely sometimes, especially if you don’t have anyone to turn to for some of your business problems. I asked Sam about some of the challenges that he loses sleep over, as a business owner himself.

When Sam started consulting for local businesses, he was just an IT geek with a business. As his company grew, he found he couldn’t do it all anymore, and he had to hire technicians to replace him. The problem was that his clients hired *him* and wanted *him* to help, so **his toughest challenge was finding technicians who could fill his shoes and earn the trust of his clients.**

As a real estate agent, I can relate to Sam’s challenges there. I then asked him what he’s most excited about in the years to come.

Sam is really excited about Bluetek’s all-inclusive IT package. **With this package, they’ll come to your business and provide all of your IT support, including security and everything you need to keep your business running smoothly for one monthly price that’s easy to budget.**

The No. 1 question that Sam is asked by customers is about security: “Are we secure right now?” Bluetek is here to help with their layered security approach to make sure you have the necessary protection, backups, and plans in place to make sure your business is operational. Don’t take the risk and find out that you’re not secure only when it’s too late. Their services include disaster simulation and planning; if disaster stuck, Bluetek would have you covered.

As I said, I’ve been working with Bluetek for around 15 years, and our business wouldn’t be what it is now without the help of Sam and his team. If you’re a business owner or you know a business owner, reach out to Sam and his team at (717) 502-2144 for a free business technology assessment—and tell them Dave Hooke sent you\! They’ll look at all of your tech needs, including data, storage, software, and more to give you a comprehensive evaluation and show you where you can develop efficiency in your business that will go straight to your bottom line and allow you to concentrate on doing what you do best: serving your clients.

**They also offer business-class phone systems. Right now, they’re offering a no-obligation $50 Amazon gift card if you let them compare your current phone service with one of their simple-to-use voice-over IP phone systems.** If your phones are outdated or if you’re paying too much for your service, Bluetek can help\! Their phone systems offer the best quality, the most features, guaranteed reliability, and are easy to use.&nbsp;
