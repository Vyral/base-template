The Langan Team is excited to announce that we are joining forces with Brandon Tracy and BTG real estate.

With this merger, **we’re going to be able to deliver an even higher level of service to our clients** even as the industry is constantly changing around us.

**We have a desire to serve everyone we work with at the highest level possible.** With the way things are changing in real estate, some of our personal goals got pushed by the wayside. Now that we have decided to join forces, it will allow us to accomplish all of our goals, both personally and professionally. We are very excited about what the future has to hold for ourselves and our clients.

In addition to fantastic service, Brandon and BTG Real Estate bring a high level of marketing knowledge and leverage to what we already have. Simply put, these are two very talented organizations coming together and taking what each of them is best at to combine them into one package.

If you have any questions for us about the merger and what it means for you, we’re always here to answer your call or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
