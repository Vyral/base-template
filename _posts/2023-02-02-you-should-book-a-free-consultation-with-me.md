I wanted to let you know I'm here to answer any of your 2023 home selling or buying questions on the phone regarding our Chattanooga/Cleveland housing market.

Free. No charge. **Just book 30 minutes with me on my calendar.**

There's a record amount of uncertainty with interest rates, growing mortgage payments, loan qualifications, fluctuating home prices, and ways to get your home ready to sell.

I get paid only if your home sells (or you buy one) - my advice is free. Not everyone knows that.&nbsp;

**Book a free 30-minute home buying or selling call with me.**

I'm happy to visit with you for 30 minutes. I'll give you personalized insight when it comes to buying or selling a home given the dramatic change in our market.

The most popular questions are:

* What's my home worth?
* When's the best time to sell?
* What do I look for in an offer?
* How do I get a lower mortgage rate?
* How do I see all homes for sale?
* Where are the best places to buy?

But, you can ask me anything. I also know a lot about buying investment properties if you're into that, given the state of our stock market (and crypto).&nbsp;

No pressure to hire me either. You're welcome to hire any competing agent to represent you, even if you take a call with me. I do second opinions all the time.

I just want you to know I'm here and I have deep insights into our &lt;&lt;area&gt;&gt; real estate market that can either make you (or save you) a lot of money.

Please talk to me first before you buy or sell in 2023 - I promise the call will be worth it.

**Grab 30 minutes here when it works for you.**

Again, no charge or obligation to buy or sell.

I hope to talk to you soon.
