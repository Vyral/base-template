I wanted to take just a moment today to talk to you a little bit about my site, geralddurhamgroup.com. My goal for this site was to provide a place where buyers and sellers alike could look at updated home listings as soon as they come on the market. In a fast-paced market like this one, it’s essential because many websites don’t update often or accurately.

Homes are being sold within days, if not hours, in this market. Our site allows you to set up searches and search alerts that can be as broad or as detailed as you want it to be. You can search via a specific location, size of home, acreage, or plenty of other amenities. You can then have updates sent to you with new homes that match your criteria daily, weekly, or monthly. **You can even have them sent to you the instant that a home matching your criteria hits the market**.

The site has several tabs on it that provide you with additional information and resources. If you’re curious about what your home is worth, you can get a free, instant home valuation. If you want to get pre-approved, there is a tab that will get you in contact with one of our preferred lenders.

If you’ve been searching for a home online but you haven’t visited my site yet, **I encourage you to visit it and see for yourself how helpful it can be. It’s all free—there’s no catch.** Even if we call you. If you have any additional questions for us or you want to get together for a cup of coffee, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
