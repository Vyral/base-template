In previous videos, I talked about the criteria that make the best types of investment properties, but which type of investment property brings the best return on investment? As it turns out, homes priced between $175,000 and $225,000 appreciate the most per year—between 7% and 8%. Additionally, smaller homes (e.g., those under 1,000 square feet) have appreciated by an average of 6.4% per year over the last 19 years, whereas larger homes (e.g., those over 3,000 square feet) have only appreciated by 1.6%.

Keep these facts in mind if you’re thinking of buying a rental property anytime soon. If you have any more questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
