*I’m having my HVAC system filter changed out today by the pros at AccuTemp Heating and Cooling. Here’s what they recommend for all homeowners.*

Before we delve into the topic of HVAC maintenance, let’s address the elephant in the room: **U.S. mortgage rates have dropped in response to coronavirus fears.** There’s speculation that rates could drop even lower than their already historic levels after the Fed issued an emergency cut.&nbsp;

No doubt about it, coronavirus is impacting travel, as restrictions have been imposed and vacations rescheduled. The stock market has been rocked, and there's a growing theory that a fair amount of people will take their money and invest it in a house—a place that they can feel safe in.&nbsp;

**For those who already own a home, now may be the time to refinance your mortgage.** According to Randy Raque, of Swan Financial Corporation, rates are in the low 3s and high 2s; unless you’re planning on moving next week, you are likely one of the many homeowners who could greatly benefit from a refinance. Rates are so low that, even if you plan on moving in one year, a refinance may still be sensible.&nbsp;

Now that we’ve touched on the health of the market, let’s talk about the health of your HVAC system. Doug Dorsey, the owner of AccuTemp Heating and Cooling, recommends that homeowners schedule at least one general maintenance appointment a year. He offers a checklist for homeowners that can help keep your system running at top performance.&nbsp;

**For starters, swapping out the filters is the easiest and most important thing for a homeowner to do.** A dirty filter can create backpressure and reduce your system’s heating and cooling efficiencies.&nbsp;

What filters should you buy, the more expensive ones or the cheaper ones? There are millions of particles in the air; a cheaper filter won’t be able to clean out as many particles. Doug recommends a higher MERV-rated filter. In case you’ve never heard of it, MERV stands for Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value.&nbsp;

At 3:30 in the video above, you can see a chart that details what particles are captured and filtered at each MERV rating. For example, a MERV 6 filter only catches lint, pollen, and dust, whereas a MERV 13 catches a lot more (e.g., pet dander, lead dust, virus carriers, etc.).
