If you have your home listed on the market and the listing expires, what do you do?

You really have three options; re-list right away, re-list in a few months, or give up and decide not to sell. Some people will hire the same agent they've used in the past when their listing expired, and some will find a new agent. Regardless of your situation, it's important to know that your home will fall into one of those three categories.

We always recommend that home sellers interview two or three different agents before making another decision. This will help them realize what went wrong in the first place. If you give an agent six months to sell your property and they can't sell it, you're probably going to get the same results if you hire them again.

Then again, it could indicate that you either aren't priced right or your house needs some updates to make it more marketable. You want to choose an agent based on their strategy, marketing plan, and confidence level.

If you're thinking of buying or selling a home, or you've tried to sell and your listing expired, feel free to give us a call for a free consultation. We'd be happy to help you.
