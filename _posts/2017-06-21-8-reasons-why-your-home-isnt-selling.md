As you know, we are in a really busy seller’s market, but would it surprise you to know that 15%-20% of homes that are listed don’t sell? Why does that happen? I’ve broken down eight reasons that homes don’t sell.
<br>
<br>**8. The condition and cleanliness of the home** can have a huge impact on how the buyers view the home. From the curb appeal to the inside, if your home doesn’t outshine the competition, it won’t sell.
<br>
<br>**7. Timing.** You must be prepared to move at the speed of the market. If you wait until your home is perfectly ready, you may miss the best time to sell.
<br>
<br>**6. Photography.** You only get one chance to make a first impression. These days your first showing is on the Internet, and if you don’t use professional, high-quality photos, you may not get another showing from potential buyers.

**5. Marketing.** Some houses don’t sell because the agent doesn’t have a marketing plan or budget. Your agent should have a strategy designed for your property.
<br>
<br>**4. Commissions.** There are some companies that have reduced commissions for the agents they employ. If you use one of these agents, you may run the risk of losing out on potential buyers who see that reduced commission as a red flag.
<br>
<br>**3. Availability.** Many times serious buyers skip homes that aren’t easy to see. You should be flexible with your showings so the most people can see your house.
<br>
<br>**2. The agent you’re using** could be a huge factor in why your home isn’t selling. Many times it’s because a homeowner used a discount company or an inexperienced agent that their home didn’t sell.
<br>
<br>**1. The price.** Your home should be accurately priced. Overpriced homes get passed by and they sit on the market for too long.
