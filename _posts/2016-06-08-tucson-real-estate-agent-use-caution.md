The crooks on the Internet are getting creative. They’ve figured out a way to intercept the wiring of funds to and from escrow companies. In fact, they know how to scan for keywords in emails about wiring situations within real estate transactions.

Maybe you’re a buyer that needs to wire a down payment or other money in a transaction. You could also be a seller and might receive wired money back from the title company soon. Either way, you need to be careful. The wiring instructions you’re receiving should come from the proper entity. Crooks sometimes pose as the title or escrow company to trick you and steal from you. 

Consider this an alert! In my next video, I’ll talk about this topic further with an expert from a title company. If you’re a buyer or seller in this situation, please use caution!

If you’re thinking about buying or selling a Tucson home, contact me by phone or email. I’d be happy to help you and answer any questions you might have!
