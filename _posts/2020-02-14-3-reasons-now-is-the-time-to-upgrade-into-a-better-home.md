<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Now is the time for homeowners to upgrade in our market. I'm sharing the three reasons why.</em></p>

Here are the three reasons now is the time to upgrade into a newer, better home:&nbsp;

**1\. The difference in prices.** If you’re selling a lower-priced property ($200,000 to $300,000), you can take advantage of high demand and sell for top dollar. Then, when buying at a higher price range ($500,000 to $600,000), you can take advantage of less demand and negotiate a better price.&nbsp;

**2\. The market is good.** Mortgage companies are offering low interest rates and many loan programs.

**3\. Quality of life.** If you’re trying to time the market and waiting for better interest rates and lower prices, you’ll never move up. There are more important things in life such as providing for your family and living your life the way you should.&nbsp;

We have a special homebuyer program designed specifically for move-up buyers where, if you agree to buy and sell with us, we waive your commission fee. If you’d like to take advantage of this offer or have any questions about today’s topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help.
