  Should new agents work with buyers or sellers? In my opinion, they should have

I wanted to take a moment today to answer a question that I’m asked frequently by new agents: “Should I become a buyer’s agent or a listing agent?”

I don’t think there’s a specific, correct answer to that question. As a new agent, I think it’s important that you learn the buying and the listing side of the business so you can become more of a well-rounded professional.** The psychology behind a seller is much different than the psychology behind a buyer.** I also think that the easiest way to see scale and see early success in your business is through focusing on both sides of the transaction.

I know that when you get into the industry, everybody’s always talking about listings. Listings, listings, listings. You’ve got to list to last, etc. While I don’t disagree with that, I will say that focusing on buyers and sellers allows you to learn both sides of the business. **That’s really important as a new agent.**

After you’ve learned both sides, you can decide for yourself what you want your business to be about. **I actually find that the top agents on our team end up working a 50/50 split between buyer and seller transactions each year.**

If you are thinking about making a change in your career or want to advance your real estate career further, I would love to sit down and have coffee sometime and discuss your career and where you want it to be. Just give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you soon.
