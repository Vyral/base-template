If you’ve been thinking of buying a new construction home, there are a few pros and cons to consider.

One of the best things about purchasing a new construction property is all of the amenities that come with it. **Because new construction homes are highly customizable, you don’t have to worry about what any previous owner might have liked or wanted in their home.**

It’s all up to you to choose the things you want included. This includes everything from the faucets to the flooring. Everything is new and it’s all yours.

Also, new constructions have another key benefit: being new. This factor will save you a lot of money on things like home maintenance. Additionally, you will have warranties on all of the major systems. You won’t need to worry about any systems going down in the first few years you’re living there.

However, there is a downside. **You must consider the amount of time a home will take to be built.** This can be a few months. But, if all of the things fall into place properly, you should be done. Still, it can be very frustrating to plan a move when delays come up.

If you want a new construction home without the wait, there’s always the option of buying a spec (or speculative) home. These homes are usually already built and ready to go.
