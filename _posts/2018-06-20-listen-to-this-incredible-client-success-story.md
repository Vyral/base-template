Bill Kosche gives his testimonial today about Carbutti Real Estate. As a repeat customer, he chose our company to sell his home of 35 years, and also to purchase his new home.

“When I first got ready to put the house on the market, I had somebody come look at it and he offered me much less than my asking price. After I redid the floors and did the painting, not only did I get my money back, I made some.”

There were about 30 showings on his home in the first day and there were five offers. Bill's home ended up selling for $15,000 over his asking price. He says it was a good feeling to have a reward for the work that he put into preparing the home for sale.

His advice for a first-time home seller is to go with a team that can get the job done. And, since houses sell quick in the area, make sure that you have someone that can handle the local area and help you prepare so you can get a better result.

If you are interested in speaking with me to help you have a success story like Bill's, please feel free to call or email me any time. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
