Today we'll discuss the tenant protection act. The tenant protection act was lifted on September 30th in California. During COVID, landlords could not give notices to tenants to move out except in extenuating circumstances. Now, if the lease is up, a tenant hasn't paid rent, or whatever the circumstances may be, **we’re back to normal landlord practices.**

If you're a landlord and you were thinking about selling to take advantage of today’s values, you have the opportunity to do so. If you're a buyer, you can expect that there will be more properties coming on the market. If you're a tenant, understand that there is the possibility that if you're on a month-to-month lease, that the landlord can now give you a 60-day notice.

Before you make any decisions, give us a call because what we're saying today could change within two weeks. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you.
