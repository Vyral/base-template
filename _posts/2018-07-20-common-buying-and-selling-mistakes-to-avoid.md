Homebuyers and home sellers continue to make the same silly mistakes. Here’s a quick rundown of what they are and how you can avoid them.

Today I want to talk about some common mistakes that I see homebuyers and sellers continue to make.&nbsp;

We often see buyers walking into homes and getting turned off by smells, dirty carpet, and other cosmetic items. The fact of the matter is that these things are easy to change. I have two commercial grade ionizing machines and can get rid of just about any smell in a week.&nbsp;

**What I don’t want buyers doing is buying a house that’s in a bad school district, or has too much traffic, or it backs up to a power plant.** Those are things we can’t change. But anything cosmetic can be changed. Redoing floors, kitchens, or bathrooms are things you can do over time and they will add tremendous value to the home.&nbsp;

So, look for the homes with old kitchens, old bathrooms, chipped paint, old carpeting or bad smells. **That bad smell is the smell of money** because it will help you get a better deal on the purchase of the property and get rid of that smell before you move in.

One seller we recently worked with thought they got a great deal on some new countertops, but the truth is that those countertops haven’t been installed in the last 30 years. If they would have just given us a call beforehand, we could have helped pick out the right countertops and the right kitchen upgrade to maximize the home’s value.

As a home seller, it’s never too early to call us. We’re happy to come in at no charge and would be happy to give you advice on what to do to spend a dollar and get two dollars back. We have vendors that do everything from flooring to plumbing to construction and more. They’ll do these repairs cost-effectively, as we’re sending them tons of referral business. **The bottom line is that you should call us before you do that work because we want to save you money and want to give you a great return on your investment.**

You wouldn’t sell a dirty car, right? You’d wash it, wax it, and try to get top dollar. The same goes for your home. If you can write a check for a few thousand and I can bring you ten thousand in value, I will do that all day long.

Whether you’re looking to buy a home, sell a home, or both, don’t hesitate to reach out to me with any questions that you have. I would love to hear from you.
