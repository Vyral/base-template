Keller Williams’ new consumer app is here\!&nbsp;

Some people in the real estate industry call this app the “Zillow killer.” As more and more of our clients and friends download this app, they're finding that they like it *better* than Zillow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Why? **It provides real-time information.** As you may know, Zillow doesn’t have a direct feed into the MLS anymore, which means it has potentially faulty data. The app also includes a social media feed, buying and selling guides, and the ability to save home searches anywhere in the country.&nbsp;

I would love any and all feedback regarding this app—what you like about it, what could be improved, etc. We can then relay that information to Keller Williams and make sure it helps you fulfill any and your real estate goals.&nbsp;
