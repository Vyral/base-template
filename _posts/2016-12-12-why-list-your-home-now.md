A lot of sellers are assuming they should wait until spring to list their homes. As you will see, this is a mistake.

Thinking about a career in San Diego real estate sales?
<a href="mailto:JTaylor@kw.com">Email me today for a private San Diego real estate career consultation.</a>

A lot of our agents are hearing their clients say, “I’ll just wait until after the holidays are over and catch the spring market next year.”

**Here is the concern for those clients: year over year, when we look at our real estate market here in Southern California, we’ve got almost 20% less inventory across the board than we had this time last year. Generally, homes are selling over 20% faster than they were last year.** Based on that, you’d expect prices to be going on a straight vertical climb. The reality, though, is that they’re only up 2%.

When we look at this trend and factor in interest rates being almost a full 0.75% lower, that means buyers have about 7.5% more purchasing power today than they did a year ago, and they’re only choosing to use 2.9% of that. This tells us that we may be right at the top of a market shift.

**If I’m a seller holding on to a property that I want to get top dollar for, I’m listing that property now.** Not tomorrow — right now. In fact, with our own personal portfolio of property, anything we don’t want to hold through another market cycle is either going on the market or has already been on the market.

If you have any questions about buying or selling, please feel free to get in touch with us. Just give me a call or send me an email, and I’d be happy to help you.
