How quickly can we close your home?

There are some federal regulations that require waiting periods from the date of the application to the first eligible closing date. There is also a waiting period for the appraisal, as well as for when you receive the initial closing disclosure. We’ve closed loans in eight days, but most between 20 and 25 days.

<br>Ultimately, it’s up to you. If you have further questions about this or anything else real estate related, please give me a call. I would be happy to speak with you.
