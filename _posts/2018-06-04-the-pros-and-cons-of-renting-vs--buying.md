I recently read an article that said millennials spend about 45% of their income on rental payments. Over their lifetime, they will spend about $93,000 in rent. So, it gave me the idea to talk about the pros and cons of renting versus owning.<br> <br>Renting does have some obvious benefits. **If something in the property breaks and needs to be repaired, for example, it is most likely going to fall on the landlord.** Also, when the market depreciates, renters do not own the asset which is decreasing in value. Although we are in a market which is appreciating currently, it goes in cycles. Finally, if you do not have a lot of money saved up, or liquidity is an issue for you, renting can help you save more in your savings account. You can keep that money in savings instead of pulling it out to use it on a mortgage.<br> <br>The cons of renting, meanwhile, are also obvious. **You do not own anything.** Your rent payment is going to the landlord’s mortgage. Also, we are currently in an appreciating market which has been appreciating at a double-digit clip recently. **You won’t see any of that if you’re still renting.** Finally, you won’t be getting any deductions on your taxes.

{% include pullquote.html %}<br> <br>The pros of owning mirror image the cons of renting. Every payment that you are making now builds equity. Every single time you make a monthly payment, you are lowering your mortgage and recapturing your equity. Plus, with the current market’s appreciation, you now have an asset that appreciates in value over time. Taxes, as previously mentioned, change when you own because you get deductions for interest payments and more.<br> <br>Finally, **you can personalize your own house.** You can improve the home and make it look the way that you want.<br> <br>If you have any questions about real estate or you are interested in buying or selling a home, please feel free to reach out to me.
