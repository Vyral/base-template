**This industry is hard, and I want everyone to know that.** I think with the internet, buyers have access to everything and sort of devalue what we do a little bit. I also think it’s hard because a lot of them have unrealistic expectations. If you aren’t able to show them a house at the drop of a hat, you could get dropped yourself.&nbsp;

Another frustration I have has to do with the uncertain income we see in real estate. Some months you might not make a dollar. Do you know how much money you’ll have in June? I don’t. That’s what’s so difficult about this industry.

**Now don’t get me wrong, there are some things that I love about this industry.** Working on a team, for one. Making relationships and connections with clients is a huge plus too.

I want to put this conversation out there in the world. Let me know if you’re having frustrations like this. I’d love to talk about them with you.

If you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
