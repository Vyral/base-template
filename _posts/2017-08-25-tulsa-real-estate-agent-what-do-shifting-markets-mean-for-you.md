Our market is shifting, but if you’re a home seller, it’s still an ideal time to put your home on the market as long as you price it correctly.

Our market is starting to shift, so what does that mean for you?  

We’re at the end of the summer rush and the kids are back in school. Typically during this time of year, our market experiences a slight downturn before encountering another uptick in early fall. This is a seasonal trend that happens every year—the real estate market always works in cycles, after all.

We don’t know what’s going to happen beyond this cycle, but I do know there are buyers and sellers in the market all the time looking to make a move. I also know from years of experience that it’s always about price.

**This means if you’re a seller, it’s still an ideal time to sell—you just have to price your home correctly.** This will give you your best chance at attracting a buyer early on, getting the most money in your pocket, and moving onto where you want to go. Pricing right from the start is everything, and we call this “pricing ahead of the market.” When we get together and examine the numbers, we analyze what’s happened with sales in the recent past and what’s happening currently with your competition.

Real estate is a contest—are you going to win? Are you going to be the No. 1 or No. 2 house buyers have to choose from in your area? Buyers buy homes that offer the most value. Do you have all the nice amenities, updates, and features that the other homes you’re competing with have? If not, you need to offset that by offering a better price.

**You have only one opportunity, and that’s early on in the listing period.** That’s where you’ll see the most amount of activity, and that’s when you need to capture a buyer.

Whether you’re thinking about selling or buying a house in our market, we’d love to help you out. Just give me a call or send me an email and I’d be happy to speak with you.
