PWhat’s going on in Flathead Lake’s real estate market? The first quarter numbers are in for 2024, and they paint a pretty clear picture of our market. Today, I’ll go over what’s happening in our market and what it means for buyers and sellers in our area:

**1\. Flathead Lake homes.** There are 32 homes listed for sale in Flathead Lake, 27 of which are priced over $2 million. Despite the high sales threshold, two homes have been sold so far in the first quarter of 2024 alone, which shows a slight uptick in market demand.

<br>**2\. Flathead Lake condominiums.** With 17 active listings, ranging from $299,000 at Marina Cay Estates Luxury Condo to $2.1 million at Sunset Point, you might find your next home in these lakefront condos. In 2024, two lakefront condo units were sold, one in Marina Cay Estates Luxury Condo and another in Lake Place Condo in Polson.

**3\. Flathead Lake land.** If you’re planning on building your dream home or investment property, you may want to consider land areas for sale in Flathead Lake. In the first quarter of 2024, there was one sale in Rollins Bay for $1.6 million. There are currently 13 active listings in our area, so you have options despite the slower market.

Overally, demand remains high in our area and inventory remains low. We’re still in a strong seller’s market with a lot of upward pressure on home prices, so reach out to me if you are interested in selling.

Finally, I want to ask everyone to visit [**http://www.fillthelake.com**](http://www.fillthelake.com). Flathead Lake is facing a tough situation: last summer, the lake was shut down for most of the season. This greatly affected businesses around the lake that rely on recreational summer visitors to sustain their livelihoods. If you visit this website, you can help us try and bring the lake back to the way it operated for the last 80 years. Just call or email me if you’d like to learn more; I’d love to talk to you more about this topic.

In the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out with any real estate related questions. I’d love to help you achieve your real estate goals.<br><br>
