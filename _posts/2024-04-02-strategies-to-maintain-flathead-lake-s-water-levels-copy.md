Picture yourself in your summer home, sipping tea or drinking coffee, looking at the beautiful view of the lake outside your house. Imagine having easy access to all the fun summer recreational activities for your family. If that image lingers in your mind, you may want to give Flathead Lake listings a try. To keep you informed of the current housing demand and supply in Flathead Lake, here’s what’s going on in each major area:

**1\. Flathead Lake homes.** There are 32 homes listed for sale in Flathead Lake, 27 of which are priced over $2 million. Despite the high sales threshold, two homes have been sold so far in the first quarter of 2024 alone, which shows a slight uptick in market demand.

**2\. Flathead Lake condominiums.** With 17 active listings ranging from $299,000 at Marina Cay Estates Luxury Condo to $2.1 million at Sunset Point, you might find your next home in these lakefront condos. In 2024, two lakefront condo units were sold, one in Marina Cay Estates Luxury Condo and Lake Place Condo.

**3\. Flathead Lake land.** If you’re planning on building your dream home or investment property, you may want to consider land areas for sale in Flathead Lake. At present, there are 620 active listings for lot areas. In the first quarter of 2024 alone, 115 land properties were sold.

Following the water level crisis in 2023, there’s been a moderate uptick in demand in the real estate market in Flathead Lake. However there has been a low supply mainly due to lack of inventory. But don’t worry—positive changes in market supply and demand are seen to increase during the spring season. Collective efforts are also underway to protect, conserve, and maintain lake water levels particularly in the summer.
