Thus far in my webinar series, I’ve discussed how mastering just one of the fundamentals in a given area isn’t enough—you need to master many of them so that your basic skills can fuel and support each other. Fundamentals are all just pieces of one big puzzle without which you cannot see the full picture. To see in detail all of what we’ve discussed so far, visit **[www.savvyagent.biz/fundamentals](http://savvyagent.biz/fundamentals/){: target="_blank"}**.

Today’s installment begins our journey into week five of my seminar. To those who have been following along, **have you taken specific action in relation to every one of these fundamentals that we’ve covered to turn them into habits?** For example, have you take action to better time block your calendar? Are you better utilizing your lead generation time? Are you now making an effort to utilize your CRM and systematically follow up with your people? I hope that you are.<br><br>Today I want to focus on capitalizing on your pipeline, which is a representation of how much business you can expect to close in a given timeframe. **We have a pipeline tool that is sure to help you visually organize your appointments and transactions,** as well as a means of setting and tracking the goals you set for yourself in terms of appointments set and met.
