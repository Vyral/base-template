{% include youtube.html %}Happy October! We just wanted to give a quick market update today for all of the buyers out there and let them know what’s going on in the market at this moment.

We are still seeing a very strong market, and the great news for buyers is that the market has cooled off a bit from the summer. You won’t have to deal with as many multiple offer situations and bidding wars like you did a couple months ago. A lot of buyers who experienced this in the summer have come back to the market and have been able to get the home they want.

In addition to the number of options out there, interest rates remain historically low. Buying now will save you money in the long run, as a lower interest rate means you can pay off your mortgage faster.

If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you!
