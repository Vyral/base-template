JJ Mazzo from Summit Funding is back to discuss the elephant in the room: student debt.&nbsp;

Can you qualify for a home loan if you have a lot of student debt?&nbsp;

**Student debt is no different than other debt.** JJ says that next to your credit score, your debt-to-income ratio is the most important thing your lender looks at. Your debt-to-income ratio is how much you spend each month, including your new housing payment, versus how much you make.&nbsp;

It’s very important that you know what your debt load is.&nbsp;

If you don’t have full amortized payments for your student loan debt, then you need to get it. Your fully amortized payment could be different from the amount that comes back on the credit report. JJ says if you can’t find that, then most loan programs will use 1% of the balance of the loan, which can make it a bit more difficult to qualify.&nbsp;

**Ultimately, getting that amortized payment is as important to your lender as it is to you.** As your lender, JJ says, we want you to be in a position where we can ensure that you will be able to pay that money back and buy your new home with confidence.&nbsp;

It’s even more important to make sure that you’re keeping as much of your tax dollars as possible in your pocket. That way, if you do have other debts, you can pay them off faster.&nbsp;

If you do have a lot of student debt, how can you increase your credit score and minimize your interest rate?&nbsp;

JJ recommends that you tackle your debts from smallest to highest. Pay off the smaller debts first. It’s really a win-win situation. It feels great to start knocking out some of those small debts and go from five debts to three to one.&nbsp;

**You should also make sure that you make your payments on time.** Don’t over-utilize your other credit cards and debts, either. For example, if you have a credit card with a $3,000 limit, try not to use more than $1,000 of your limit. In other words, try not to use more than 30% of your credit limit.&nbsp;

We hope these tips help.&nbsp;
