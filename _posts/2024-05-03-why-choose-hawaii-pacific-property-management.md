Here at Hawaii Pacific Property Management, we understand and give importance in building strong relationships with both homeowners and tenants. We pride ourselves to go beyond just simply managing properties; we strive to create a smooth and stress-free experience for all stakeholders.

Here are three things that keep our homeowners and tenants happy:

**Reliable vendor network.** We have a trusted list of vendors with a proven track record of providing excellent service.

**Open to homeowner preferences.** While we have a reliable network, we understand that homeowners have their own preferences. We are open to working with vendors that you trust.

**Dedicated maintenance coordinator.** Unlike some property management companies, where one person handles everything, we have a dedicated maintenance coordinator. This ensures that maintenance requests are processed promptly, even if the property manager is in the middle of a walkthrough or inspection.

If you are a homeowner in Hawaii looking for a reliable property management company, contact us today. You can call, text, or send us an email. Weâ€™ll be happy to discuss how we can help you keep your property well-maintained.
