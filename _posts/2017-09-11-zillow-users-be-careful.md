Today I want to talk about one of my least favorite words in real estate: “Zillow.”

One of the questions we get asked a lot is whether Zillow is an accurate predictor of home value. Interestingly enough, **Zillow recently proved in a court of law that, no, it is not.**

Zillow is what is called an AVM, or automated valuation model.Essentially, it is a computer program that tries to guesstimate the value of your house. Recently they were sued in a class-action lawsuit by a number of homeowners who claimed that Zillow vastly undervalued their properties and that ultimately, that affected the value of their homes.

The judge dismissed it out of hand, saying that **Zillow has what is called a Zestimate, which shouldn’t be considered a legitimate appraisal or an official value of the home.** He also said that buyers should know the difference.

However, Zillow can be used to watch market trends—you can figure out whether home values are going up or down in general, and by about how much.

But in terms of predicting a concrete value on your house, Zillow can’t see inside your house; it can’t see your interior or alter any estimates based on the condition of your home. The only way to get an accurate valuation of your home is to have a professional come out and give you a value.

**Zillow only comes within five percent of what a home will eventually sell for, and only 50% of the time.**It’s not actually much better than a coin toss. In fact, Spencer Rascoff, the CEO of Zillow, recently sold his house for a little over a million dollars, but the Zestimate at the time showed his house was worth $1.75 million, 40% more than what it was sold for.

If you want to know what your house is worth, go ahead and get on Zillow to see whether your house value is going up or down, and by how much, but if you want an exact figure, give us a call at our Portland number (503) 828-9551, or our Vancouver number (360) 356-1941. We look forward to hearing from you.
