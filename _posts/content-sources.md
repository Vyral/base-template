**Water leaks are probably the most menacing opponent we face in the home rental business.** If you’re a homeowner/investor, I highly suggest getting additional rent loss coverage on your home for this specific purpose.

If you end up having a big leak, you’ll have to bear the full brunt of it most of the time. If we have a flooded unit, we have a tenant who can’t reside there. We will then have to immediately dry the unit out. However, that process takes three to five days to complete. During that time, you won’t be collecting any rent.

**About half of our leaks result in insurance claims.** The sooner we can get to them, the better. If you end up having to lose rent for a month or two, it will be offset by the money you saved by having that extra insurance.

If you have any questions for us or you’re thinking about investing in real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

You can choose whether you want to allow pets in your rental property. Here’s what we recommend.

One of the most common questions we get from homeowners is if they have to allow pets in their rental home. The answer is no. It’s totally up to you what kind of pets, if any, you will allow in your home. 

However, keep in mind that **eight out of 10 people in today’s market have pets.** Especially when rent is up a little higher and families are out there looking. Most families have one or two children and one or two pets. It just comes with the territory.

If you do choose to allow pets in your home, our addendum helps protect you. We’ll go inspect the property every four months and look for pet damage, as well as any other damage. **We’ll send you pictures of any damage, as well as a picture of the pet in the home.**

{% include pullquote.html %}

We don’t take our pet policy lightly. We’re here to protect your home and put money in your account. If you don't want to allow pets, that’s fine, but just know that you'll be missing out on a huge part of the market and it might take us longer to find a tenant than normal.

If you have any other questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out. We would love to hear from you soon.

Landlord or Tenant. Who Pays for Pest Control?

THE OWNER IS NOT THE ONE WHO ATTRACTED THE PESTS, SO THE OWNER DOES NOT INCUR THE COSTS OF PEST CONTROL.

If a tenant leaves food out in the house and a rodent problem develops, who is responsible for pest control: the owner or the tenant?

Pests can be a formidable adversary. Their job is to come into your house and find whatever food and water they can.

That’s why pest control is an incredibly important subject for tenants and owners. 

**As an owner, it is totally optional to carry pest control** through the lease period of the tenants. That said, our addendum states that pest control is covered by the tenant. 

Pest control includes rodent control. The owner has no control if tenants leave out food, which attracts pests—so they should not be held responsible. If rodent control is an ongoing problem mentioned in the owner’s interview, I would recommend that you continue to carry rodent control in your house. 

{% include pullquote.html %}

Rodents are brought in by food not being stored properly in the home. So, as I mentioned, since the tenant is the one who attracts the rodents, they are the ones responsible for the costs of rodent control. 

Although pest control is important, I would say that **90% of my homes do not have a rodent problem.**

If you have any other questions about pest control or would like to learn more about how we take care of your investment properties, just give me a call or send me an email.

The Hawaii Landlord-Tenant Code is a 29-page document that spells out all the expectations for owners and renters. Here at Hawaii Pacific Property Management, we add an additional 14-page addendum to our rental contract called a “move-out addendum” that we wanted to talk to you about today.

**This addendum states that the tenant will get professional services to clean the home and leave it in the same condition it was when they moved in.** To ensure this, we require tenants to sign the agreement up front before they move in. We also require them to provide receipts for any carpet cleaning or maid services they use. This way, there are never any questions about the condition of the property. It will look the same each time a tenant moves out.

**We do two things very well:** We protect your home and put money in your account. If you need help with either of those things or have any questions about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

RENT IS ALWAYS COLLECTED ON THE FIRST OF EACH MONTH.

As the owner of an investment property, how do you get paid? I’ll explain the process today.

<a href="http://www.hipacificpm.com/faqs" target="_blank">Learn More About Guaranteed Rent</a>

One of the most common questions we get is, “How do I get paid?” 

It’s pretty simple. **We collect rents on the first of every month.** Hawaii has a “no grace period” law for tenants, which means that rent is definitely due on the first. 

It takes a couple of days to process the payment but thanks to ACH and the magic of online banking, our owners will get paid on the fifth of the month.

We do all of the behind-the-scenes work to manage your property. However, the only thing you need to know is that **we make the rent appear at no hassle to you.**

{% include pullquote.html %}

When you work with me, you don’t have to pay any money up front. If your property needs repairs, the cost will be taken out of the rent. Don’t worry—we don’t do anything without your permission, and you will be communicated with about everything via text, email, or a phone call.

If you have any other questions about your payment or would like to learn more about how we can help you, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!

How We Discern Between Wear & Tear and Tenant Damage

GETTING A PROPERLY FILLED OUT CONDITION FORM IS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST PARTS OF PROPERTY MANAGEMENT.
https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/Duke+Kimhan/videoplayback.mp4

Discerning the difference between normal wear and tear versus actual damage is a difficult but important part of property management. Here's how we handle it.

<a href="http://www.hipacificpm.com/Guaranteedrent" target="_blank">Find Out How Much Your Home Will Rent For in Today's Market </a>
<a href="http://www.hipacificpm.com/faqs" target="_blank">Learn More About Guaranteed Rent</a>

How do you discern wear and tear versus damage in a rental property? Getting a property condition form filled out correctly is one of the biggest problems I face in my business.

The standard property condition form is four pages and it's very extensive. We require tenants to fill out this form on their way in within the first 10 days of living in a unit. We then go back in on a 10-day walkthrough to remove your lock box and collect the property condition form. During that time, we walkthrough each item on the form that's listed as damaged or not working properly. 

{% include pullquote.html %}

If we commit to the repairs during the 10-day walkthrough, they'll be repaired at the owner's cost. 

**Wear and tear means things like scratches and scuff marks on the stairs, walls, and bathtub, dirty mirrors, and yellowing on the toilet.** We have to determine whether it's wear and tear from living in the unit or damage from negligence by the tenant. Our job is to make that determination for our owners upon move out.

We also do a six-month walkthrough to make sure the home is cared for, four months if the unit allows pets. We provide pictures of the walkthrough, guaranteed. 

If you have any questions about assessing wear and tear or damage in a unit or you're interested in our property management services, don't hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We'd be glad to speak with you further.
