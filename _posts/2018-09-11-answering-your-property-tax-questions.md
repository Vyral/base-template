It’s that time of year again—time to start thinking about property taxes.

Especially for new homeowners, property tax bills can be difficult to interpret. So, if you’ve recently received this document in your mailbox, there are a few things to keep in mind before making your payment.

First, **if you aren’t sure about when these taxes need to be paid, check your escrow account.** Different counties and municipalities will have different due dates, so it’s important to determine what is relevant for your area. In Shelby County, for example, taxes are due in February.

Another important thing to consider is how rising property values and tax rates could impact your bill. **You can learn more about these changes as they apply to your area [here.](https://www.assessor.shelby.tn.us/Calculate.aspx){: target="_blank"}**

Finally, if you believe that your property’s re-assessed value is off-base, I would be happy to help you investigate whether it would be appropriate to make an appeal.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
