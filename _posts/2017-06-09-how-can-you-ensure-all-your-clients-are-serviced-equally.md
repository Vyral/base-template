How do you ensure all of your clients are treated with the same level or service, whether it’s you providing that service or someone else?

This is a loaded question because the more people doing business on your team means the more variation there will be within the service provided, **but we use a system called Top Producer.**

**With Top Producer, we break down every action step in the sales process** to a specific action item and then to a specific person so all of our processes are repeatable and orchestrated properly. So, whether I’m providing the service or someone else is, the client will receive the exact same level of service.

For example, in the video above, we have listing plans that have specific action items for specific people. If you were to click on that action item, you’d also see specific notes we’ve typed up explaining how that person is supposed to complete that action item. We also set a timer so every action item listed is completed at the exact same time in the transaction right up until the property goes under contract.

If one of our buyers or sellers goes under contract, we also have a closing plan for them. This breaks down the entire closing process so each client gets the exact same treatment, whether they’re working with me directly or someone else on our team.

**You can do all sorts of action items—both for business and personal use.** Again, they’re there to make sure the process is repeatable. Just like a chef at a 5-star restaurant has a recipe that breaks down every part of the meal they’re going to cook, it’s helpful to us real estate practitioners to do the same thing.

If you have any questions about this topic, please feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to brainstorm with you.
