Today, I’m back with the fourth part in my buyer agency and exclusivity series. For this installment, I’ll be talking about what happens when you work without an agency.

**The good news is that you aren’t obligated to work with any particular agent, but the bad news is that this means no one is obligated to work with you.**

Most likely, there are around a dozen other buyers looking for the same kind of home you are. When no one is working for you exclusively, it will take you longer to find out about listings that meet your needs. This means other buyers who are working with agents will have an advantage.

So, I highly encourage you to work with an agent as you move forward with any transaction. As you move forward with interviewing agents to find the best fit, there are three main things that I recommend you look for.

First of all, **the agent should be full-time.** Dedicated, full-time agents often know about listings before they’re even on the MLS. Part-time agents simply won’t be able to provide the service you deserve.

Second, make sure you **find an agent who has a lot of experience** and knows what’s going on in the market.

Finally, **find an agent you get along with.** You’re going to be spending the next 30, 45, or 60 days in close contact with this person, so it’s important that you feel comfortable working with them.

When you find an agent who fulfills each of these standards, I highly recommend that you fill out a buyer agency agreement with them.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
