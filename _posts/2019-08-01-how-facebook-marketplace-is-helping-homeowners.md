<p style="text-align:center;"><em>I’ve got a few exciting stories to share with you today. Keep reading to learn more.</em></p>

Selling your home is a great thing, but the daunting task of getting rid of a lot of stuff inside of it isn’t. My client Melba had a situation like this recently. She had a beautiful home with a lot of stuff inside that she needed to get rid of.

**Melba was moving to another state and wanted to get rid of absolutely everything in her house.** It was a daunting task, but not one that’s uncommon. What Melba did might be something that could help you. More about that in a moment, but let’s take a quick look at Louisville real estate.

**We’re still selling a lot of homes, thanks in part to lower interest rates.** These rates are lower than we’ve seen in two to three years. The Chief Economist of Realtor.com, Danielle Hale, said that “Lower mortgage rates, higher wages, and more homes for sale have helped counteract rising home prices, and ultimately, made it so that buyers are able to afford more than last year.”

**Year over year, home prices are up 4.39% in Kentucky.** Just about everyone says that they’ll continue to appreciate this year and beyond. This is the perfect time to get off the fence and buy a home, especially if you’re a move-up buyer.

Now, back to Melba. She actually listed all of the things in her home on Facebook Marketplace and sold everything through that. Melba had a lot, including tons of scrapbooks and stamps. This is where she sold all of her stuff. It’s a pretty easy site to use. You can buy, sell, and customize and promote your posts. She sold four cabinets full of Precious Moments figurines, she sold all her furniture within a week, and made about $20,000 selling all of her things.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me in the meantime about the market or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
