I believe 2018 is going to be a great year for real estate. However, **if you’re thinking of trying to buy or sell a home without the assistance of a real estate agent, you might want to think again.**

For homebuyers, purchasing a home without an agent is not advisable. Especially for new construction homes. We had two folks last year who bought new construction homes without an agent in the past and it ended up biting them when it came time to sell. One couple thought they were getting a deal at $350,000, but it turns out they shouldn’t have paid a cent over $315,000. They ended up selling the home for less than they bought it for because the builder pulled one over on then.

**If you’re planning on buying a new construction property or you’re even entertaining the idea, let us know and we’d be glad to provide you with the knowledge and experience necessary to get a fair price on your new home.**

Some people think selling their home on their own is a good idea. However, the numbers don’t back this up. Depending on where you’re priced, selling your home FSBO will result in you selling for 10% to 15% less than normal. Is it really worth it to try and save 3% on an agent’s commission when you’re going to end up selling for at least 10% less anyway? The answer is no. Hiring an agent is the right decision here.
