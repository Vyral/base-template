Now that you’ve decided listed your home with me, here’s what you can expect and what we will do to make the process as easy as possible. **Here’s a step by step list of what we’ll do:**

**1. Get your home ready.** There are a few county ordinances and homeowners association requirements that are going to be mandatory in order to close escrow. One is the sewer clearance, and the other is the HOA requirements. We will go through those to make sure they get done right away.

**2. Stage your home.** The next item we need to focus on is making your property shine. Selling real estate is a price war and a beauty contest, so we need to make sure your house looks as good as possible so we can get the best price possible. Schedule a consultation with our stager so she can come out and help you make the best use of the space you have.

**3. Get your home on the market.** This includes having a professional photographer come over to photograph your home. We’ll also have a listing coordinator come over to make sure the house looks great when we take the pictures. These pictures are critical because we are going to be using them for all of our website marketing and it’s the first thing that buyers will see.

**4. Put together a feature list.** If you have the ability, let us know the unique features of your home, including any electronic highlights, security benefits, and other features that make your home stand out from the competition.

**5. Put the home on the Multiple Listing Service.** We’ll include those features of your home so that all the agents in the area can see. Right before we go on the market, we’ll email you a draft, which you will look over carefully to make sure it looks right.

**6. Schedule a broker tour.** If you’re in Truckee, broker tours happen every other Thursday from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. Agents can come at any time, so we need the house to be vacant and looking its best.

After this process is complete, we should be having regular showings. Each time an agent shows your property, we’ll do our best to get feedback from the agent on what they think about the home, its price, and its condition.

Take note here: You’ll get some very random comments about why a buyer didn’t buy your home. Some of these comments are completely off the wall, but the bottom line is that if buyers are coming through and looking at it, they are comparison shopping with other homes on the market. They will pick the best one for the value.

After 21 days on the market, we will be meticulously following our plan of action. You’ll get an activity report once per week, which will show you everything we’re doing for your home. You’ll hear from me once per week as well.

After the 21-day mark, we’ll start taking a closer look at what buyers are saying about the home and what exactly the next plan of action can be. If we’ve had a lot of showings by this time but no offers, you’re probably overpriced by about 5%. We can decide together what we need to do to get your home sold.

**If you have any questions at any time during this process, don’t hesitate to reach out to myself or my listing coordinator, Brittney.**

We really appreciate your business and are thrilled to get started. If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
