Have you met our expert stager/designer Rose Bennett?

**Rose has been with us almost six months and is a big part of our listing process.**She decided to work here because it gave her the unique opportunity to combine her background in interior design with real estate. She works on the listing side of the team helping sellers stage and design their homes for the market and staying with them all the way through settlement.

Her duties consist of coming out to the home and writing up a full staging report so the homeowner knows everything they need to do to prepare the home for the market. **With Rose on the team, staged homes have been selling 43% faster than vacant homes** and at an average of 97% of the listing price once we’ve gone through the process of getting them ready. Our average days on market is also down to just 16 days.

Rose’s design background was the perfect match for what we were looking for in her position. She designed model homes for quite some time and has a great sense of style and what’s popular now within the new construction community. She also does design work on her own.

We’re working to bring all of our resources in-house and develop a better process and value for you, and Rose has been a big part of this endeavor. In addition to staging, we also have a licensed contractor who works in conjunction with Rose so she can allocate time management. If you’re thinking about making renovations to your property, I highly recommend reaching out to her. She even helped me design the improvements I made to my home.

If you’d like to reach out to Rose directly, you can email her at Rose@WesPetersGroup.com. If you have any questions or are considering buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give us a call or shoot us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
