I’ve been in real estate for almost 15 years, and every year I hear the same thing from homeowners: “I’m going to wait to sell my home during the spring.”

**Let me tell you why that may not be a great idea.** For starters, we see a lot of people get transferred here to Northwest Arkansas for employment reasons all the time. A lot of those people make their transfers toward the end of the year and the beginning of the year. If your house isn’t on the market during this time, they can’t buy it.

{% include pullquote.html %}<br>&nbsp;<br>Another great reason to have your home on the market during this time of year is that there are other buyers out there who need to purchase a home before the end of the year for tax purposes. In the wintertime, when someone comes to see your house, it means they’re a serious buyers.You want serious buyers to see your home.

Finally, **holiday decorations make homes feel warmer and cozier**, which is always appealing to buyers.

These are just a few reasons why you shouldn’t wait until spring to get your home sold. If you have any questions or want to know more about why listing your home at this time of year is such an advantage, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
