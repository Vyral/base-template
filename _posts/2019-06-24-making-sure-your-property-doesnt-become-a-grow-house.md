&nbsp;

More and more tenants are moving into properties here in California with the intent of turning them into grow houses. For those who aren’t aware, a grow house is a property someone uses specifically to farm Cannabis.

As a landlord, how can you get ahead of this problem? **You must have a property manager working for you who knows what signs to look for when screening tenants**.

We’ve dealt with the police and several attorneys regarding this matter, and we’ve found that a lot of these tenants are targeting private investors because they know they won’t perform any of the background checks or six-months checkups that a professional property manager would.

The cost to repair a grow house can be tens of thousands of dollars, so if you want to save time, money, and a lot of headaches, leave property management to the professionals. We want to help you protect your investment, and we know several property management companies we’d be glad to put you in touch with.
