Once you’re under contract for a home and you’ve hired a home inspector to do an inspection, what can you expect from them? What does a home inspector do, exactly?

During their inspection, inspectors aren’t looking for cosmetic concerns like whether or not to repaint the bathroom or whether the wallpaper should come off. **Instead, they’re looking for things of importance like heating, electrical, cooking, and other systems vital to the integrity of the house.**

After they’re done inspecting those items, they’ll give you a report on the house. As the buyer, this report goes to you only. It doesn’t go to the seller unless their agent requests it. After you receive this report, it’s up to you to look through it, see what’s important to you, and negotiate with the seller going forward.

If you have any questions about this topic or are looking to buy or sell a home in our market, please feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to speak with you!
