I'm Abby Gilson, and alongside my best friend Shelby Allgood, we are proud agents on Misty's real estate team. Our friendship started long before we dove into real estate. I met Shelby when she hired me as her intern while she was the director of merchandise for the Iowa Cubs. It took some persistence on my part to get the job, but once I did, we quickly became inseparable. After college, I jumped into real estate, and after selling a couple of houses to Shelby, I convinced her to join me in this exciting industry. And here we are today, having a blast every single day.

One of my favorite aspects of real estate is the human connection. I recently worked with a wonderful family who had their home listed for quite a while. We finally received an offer, and both the family and I were in tears over the phone â€“ they deserved this so much. Moments like these make all the late nights and early mornings worth it. **Knowing that I can help people move into the next chapter of their lives is incredibly fulfilling.**

Shelby feels the same way about the relationships we build. She loves helping people realize that homeownership is within their reach, especially here in Iowa where it's so achievable. She believes in empowering people to become wealth builders, turning homeownership into a foundation for their future.<br>

Being part of Misty's team has its perks beyond just the work. We have so much fun with team events, office gatherings, and knowing we can rely on each other. I appreciate that I can take a vacation and trust my clients will be well taken care of. Shelby, who is about to go on maternity leave, is especially grateful for the support system we have here. It's all about balance and having each other's backs.

For those of you curious about real estate, we have regular meet and greets to help you understand what it's like to be a real estate agent and how our team operates. Shelby attended one of these events a year before she joined, which made her transition smooth and comfortable. **She often says her biggest regret is not joining sooner.**
