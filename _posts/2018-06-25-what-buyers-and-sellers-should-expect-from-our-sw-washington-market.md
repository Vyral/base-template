<p style="text-align: center;"><em>What’s been going on in our Southwest Washington market lately? Today let’s review how the past few months have fared.</em></p>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

How has our Southwest Washington market fared so far this year? Let’s take a look at the last few months.

In April, closed sales rose 11% &nbsp;in Portland and 12% in Southwest Washington as a whole. And in May, Portland saw an 8% drop in closed sales and Southwest Washington overall saw a dip of 7%.&nbsp;

But what about June? Well, much like we saw last month, **June has seen closed sales drop 9% in Portland and 3% across Southwest Washington in general.**

What do these figures tell us about our market?&nbsp;

One major thing we can take away from these trends is that there’s a sense of apathy among buyers in our market lately. First-time buyers are struggling to secure a home, as listings in lower price points often see six or more offers. Even so, buyer traffic hasn’t been as hot as it should be at this time of year.&nbsp;

So **my hope for the months to come is that we start seeing more listings come onto our market.** And with the Fed having just raised interest rates, it’s likely that market activity will begin to pick up. Economic growth is strong and unemployment is low, so I am very optimistic that all of the factors we’ve discussed today will ultimately result in a stable summer market.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
