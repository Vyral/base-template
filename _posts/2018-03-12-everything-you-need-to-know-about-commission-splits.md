A lot of sellers have been asking how commission splits work in the real estate business. It’s actually pretty simple.

On a 50% commission, for example, half goes to the buyer’s agent and half goes to the listing agent. Listing agents can use this money to attract buyers’ agents to your home.

A listing agent’s commision is used is in the marketing of the property. **93% of buyers last year found their homes on the internet and through other advertising, opposed to through the recommendation of a buyer’s agent.**This goes to show the importance of allocating funds into these marketing resources.

A big portion of funds on the listing side also go to the brokerage and to the government. Whatever is leftover becomes income for the listing agent.

**If you list with my team and I bring you a buyer, myself, we will only charge you half of the commission fee since there was no buyer’s agent involved.**

As always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
