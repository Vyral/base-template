What can you expect from our market in 2018? To answer that, we must look at three key factors.<br><br>The first is **inventory.** For the past several years, we’ve seen an all-time low level of inventory. It’s a seller’s market across most of the Gulf Coast. There are a lot of buyers out there looking for housing and a lot of sellers that have been sitting on the sidelines waiting for spring to list their homes.

Second, **mortgage interest rates remain low.** We’re still in the low 4% range, and we expect that to continue through at least the first part of 2018. A lot of buyers are entering the market to take advantage of this. This means that we’ll have a lot of both sellers and buyers entering the market this spring, which makes now a great time to list your house before everyone else does.

Finally, **homeownership is still a quality investment.** The next tax reform bill kept many things unchanged in our market, so if you’re considering becoming a homeowner, 2018 is a great year to do it.

If you or anyone you know are looking to buy, sell, or invest in real estate, give us a call or send us an email. We’d be glad to help.
