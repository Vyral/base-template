{% include youtube.html %}Sometimes homebuyers wonder if it’s even worth trying to compete in a seller’s market. Tampa Bay has had low inventory for quite some time, and it’s not unusual for sellers to receive up to 20 hours on their house.

It is almost always a good idea to write an offer anyway. Here are a few tips to help you make your purchase offer outshine the rest:

**1. Submit a large escrow money deposit.** Pending home sales can fall through. Once a seller commits to an offer, they may worry that their buyer will default on the contract after the other buyers have disappeared. Escrow money is essentially your down payment. By offering more than the normal amount, you show that you are serious about closing. You are only offering the seller more money a little sooner rather than later, but it will show the seller that you are serious.

**2. Show the seller that you are qualified.** In today’s market, it is standard to make sure that your purchase offer is accompanied by a lender letter. However, a pre-approval is much stronger than a pre-qualification. Make sure that you get a pre-approval letter and you will be a stronger buyer in the seller’s eyes.

**3. Give the seller some time to move.** It’s already difficult to juggle multiple closings if you are buying and selling a home at the same time. If the seller is doing the same, it’s even more difficult. Offering the seller two or three days to move out after closing (without asking for any compensation in return) would be a good idea.

<br>**4. Shorten or waive contingencies.**Per the contract, you have 15 days to do a home inspection. You should always do a home inspection, but you can shorten the time frame. If your loan meets the pre-approval contingency, ask your agent about comparable sales, as you may be able to remove the appraisal contingency.

**5. Write your best offer.** Don’t hope for negotiations; offer your highest price. You may even want to go over asking price. Ask your agent for a comparable market analysis to see what the market value of the property is. Sometimes, sellers price their home slightly below market value in order to drive multiple offers. In other words, paying over asking price does not necessarily mean paying more than market value. Your agent will be able to guide you on that decision.

If you follow these five tips, your offer will stand out among the rest. If you have any other questions about buying a home in a seller’s market, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
