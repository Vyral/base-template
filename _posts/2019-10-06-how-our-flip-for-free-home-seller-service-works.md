How would you like to make more money when you sell your home without having to spend a dime of your own?

Our team has been working with a particular program that will help you do just that, though we haven’t really been actively marketing it. **Here’s how it works:**

Oftentimes when you sell a home, there are things that should be done to improve its condition so as to earn you top dollar for its sale. However, many sellers lack the liquid cash needed to be able to invest in those projects.

When you work with Gorman Residential Real Estate Services, we’ll come to your home and do an analysis to figure out which projects need to be done so that the home will be in top-dollar condition.

For instance, let’s say you have a home that is worth $200,000 in its current condition. We’ll come to your property to do our analysis, and we may decide, for example, that by adding new granite countertops, bathroom vanities, flooring, and paint, you could make an additional $20,000 profit from the sale. Let’s also say that the necessary renovations would cost $15,000.

In most cases, it’s on you, the seller, to shell out that $15,000 to do the work before putting your home on the market. **Under our program, we’ll do the analysis, get quotes from contractors, and do all the home renovation work up front so you won’t have to spend a dime.**

When we sell your home for more money, the contractor will be paid at the closing table. This allows you to take advantage of the additional profits without spending your own money because we’re building the cost of the renovation into the sale of the home.

We’ve done this for our clients several times. **It’s truly a win-win for sellers: You don’t have to spend your own money to do the renovations, you don’t have to manage the contractors, you don’t have to do the work yourself, and you’ll still get more money from your sale.** Now is a great time to take advantage, because homes that are in top-dollar condition are quickly scooped off the market, sometimes with multiple offers.

If you’re interested in learning more about this program or about how it might apply to your specific situation, please reach out to me. We'll do an analysis on your home and show you what the process might look like. Hope to hear from you soon\!
