<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Nobody wants to feel like they’re living in a construction zone. Here are a few ways to reduce the noise that makes its way inside your home.</em></p>

One of the questions that I hear occasionally is about noise. Usually, it’s a property near a highway or busy street and buyers are concerned about how that noise will affect their life there. **If this is a concern of yours, today I have some tips to share about how you can soundproof your home from this kind of stuff.**

Adding insulation to your walls is a good idea, especially if you’re buying new construction. **Foam insulation will take a lot of sound away and you can even upgrade the existing insulation that you have.**

A solid-core door is another way to reduce the noise that comes into your home. You can even get solid-core bedroom doors.

There is some amazing technology out there as far as windows are concerned. Glass is like a drum and if you have thermopane windows with two different thicknesses of glass, the sound resonates at different rates and not nearly as much sound travels through. **You can also add window inserts, window treatments, and storm windows to further reduce noise.** Even some contemporary blinds have sound reduction built into them.

If you have rooms with hard floors, adding rugs, carpet, and plush furniture can make a difference. **They absorb more sound and can reduce both interior and exterior sound.**

Finally, vegetation and plants can make a difference. In the spring and summer, when the trees are full of leaves, which reduces noise as well. **It’s an easy way to create some privacy and sound reduction.**

If you have any other questions for me about how to reduce noise in your home, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
