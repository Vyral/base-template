It's a lot to keep track of—everything going on in the housing market right now. If you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, you probably already feel like your hands are full. That’s where I can help. I keep my finger on the latest trends in the industry, and I can explain what they mean to you. Here are a few of the top questions that I'm regularly answering right now:

**1\. What's happening with mortgage rates?** Rates have risen dramatically in response to higher inflation. Many people say that they'll come down to about 4.5% next year.

**2\. Where are home prices headed?** Prices are moderating as the market cools, but that doesn't mean they're crashing; they just won’t grow as much. In some areas, there are certain cases where prices are decreasing.

**3\. Should I buy or sell a home right now?** While that always depends on your situation, I can help you explore your options to decide what is best for you.

If you’re thinking of making a move or have any questions, let's connect, so you feel confident in your decision. Reach me anytime at (502) 376-5483. I look forward to hearing from you.
