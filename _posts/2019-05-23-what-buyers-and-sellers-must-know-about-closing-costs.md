What are closing costs and what role do they play in the real estate process? I touched on all of this and more in my most recent interview.

I recently sat down for an interview with my friend Elizabeth, who wanted me to answer a few of her questions about a very important subject: closing costs. This is something I think many homebuyers are unclear on, so I’m excited to shed some light on the topic for all of you today.&nbsp;
