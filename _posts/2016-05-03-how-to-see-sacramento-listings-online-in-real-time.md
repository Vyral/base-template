{% include youtube.html %}What’s the best way to find your dream home online in Sacramento? You’ve probably visited at least one of the three real estate giants online in Zillow, Trulia or Redfin, which make up almost 80% of online real estate market. The problem is, the listings are often outdated.

Have you or anyone you know found a home you really loved online, only to find that it sold weeks or even months ago?

For this very reason, we have a website called www.HeidiPhongHomes.com where you find not only the most relevant info for your house, you’ll do it for free.

{% include pullquote.html %}

Us Realtors have access to what’s called the MLS, which is where all new business goes. Agents use it to find houses for their clients - and while you won’t have access to the MLS, our website pulls data from the MLS nearly in real time. Everything is fresh and current, which means no outdated listings like you run into with Zillow, Trulia and Redfin.

If you’re looking for homes in the near future or even just shopping around, you want to visit this website. And as always, if you or anyone you know is looking to buy or sell, think of us. We’d love to work with you!
