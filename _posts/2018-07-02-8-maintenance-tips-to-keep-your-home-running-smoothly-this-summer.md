Here are eight tips that will help you keep your home well-maintained over the course of the summer:&nbsp;

**1. Double-check that all your carbon monoxide and smoke detectors work.** You can never be too safe, so instead of assuming your carbon monoxide and smoke detectors are working, double-check just to make sure. The summer is a great time to do this.&nbsp;

**2. Change the filter in your air conditioner every 30 days.** Changing them every 30 days will increase your air conditioner’s efficiency and lengthen its lifespan.&nbsp;

**3. Keep your ceiling fans dust-free.** Otherwise, they’re just swirling dust around inside your house.&nbsp;

**4. Use a clothesline instead of your dryer.** This will not only help you save energy, but it will also keep your clothes smelling summer-fresh all week long.&nbsp;

**5. Get your grill on.** Clean your grill at the beginning of summer so you can grill all summer long.&nbsp;

**6. Let the sunlight in.** Longer summer days mean longer sunlight, so clean your windows and enjoy the warm, ambient light for as long as you can.&nbsp;

**7. Check for leaky faucets.** We’re not in a drought anymore, but it’s still a good idea to check that you’re not wasting any water. Leaks can also cause damage to your home that you won’t even notice until later on when it’s much more costly.&nbsp;

**8. Stop dirt at the door.** Keep dirt out of your house by using a coarse doormat on the outside of your entryway and a soft doormat on the inside.

If you have any other questions about how to keep your home well-maintained over the summer or you have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you.&nbsp;
