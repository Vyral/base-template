At this time of year, many are giving thanks for the blessings in their lives. Today, I’d like to give you something else to be thankful for: two important market secrets.

The first is that right now, St. Charles has a low supply of homes. **Few sellers are coming on the market, and many sellers are coming off of it.**

Secondly, the only buyers in the market right now are ones who are very serious. The buyers on the market currently are qualified buyers, relocation buyers, and buyers who need to find a home in the next few weeks.

**In the last 30 days, approximately 171 homes have gone under contract in St. Charles alone.** This proves that the market is still very strong at this time of year.

The best secret of all is that right now truly is a great time of year to come on the market.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
