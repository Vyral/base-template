With so many people moving to San Diego for its beautiful weather and scenery, I thought I would share my list of the top 10 places you should visit in San Diego.

1. **Sunset Cliffs**. This is a great introduction to San Diego’s beauty. Located in Point Loma, you’ll find a great view of San Diego’s coastline. This is one of my favorite places to picnic with my husband and watch the gorgeous sunset. You can also hike through the caves and the hidden cliffs.<br>&nbsp;
2. **Coronado.** Head over to Coronado, which is just a short drive over the most beautiful bridge in San Diego—that alone is worth the trip. Once in Coronado, you’ll have access to the beach, which is adjacent to the historical landmark, the Hotel del Coronado. There, you’ll be able to enjoy the lovely beach resort, and you can even go ice skating during the holidays.<br>&nbsp;
3. **La Jolla.** La Jolla is a completely separate area in San Diego to be explored and shopped. There are beaches where you can kayak, snorkel, swim, and even hang out with the seals. Additionally, the shopping and dining are like nowhere else in San Diego, and the scenery will take your breath away.<br>&nbsp;
4. **The Gaslamp Quarter.** If you’re looking for a good time and fine dining, the Gaslamp Quarter is the place to be. With the array of nightclubs, bars, hotels, and restaurants, this is definitely a fun place to be every day of the week.<br>&nbsp;
5. **Petco Park.** We are so fortunate to have our stadium right downtown—you can’t come to San Diego without attending a Padre game! But whether you’re a baseball fan or not, Padre games provide a variety of fun for of all ages. You can watch the game at your seat or at the stadium park with your family, and there are activities for kids at every home game.<br>&nbsp;
6. **The San Diego Waterfront and Seaport Village.** Take a walk along the Waterfront and enjoy the views of the bay, Coronado, the U.S.S. Midway, and the statue known as the Unconditional Surrender which commemorates the end of World War II. You can even stay at the Bayfront Hilton, Marriott, or Hyatt hotels, which sit along the boardwalk. There are also a variety of restaurants, boutiques, and wineries to visit—and if you don’t feel like walking, why not try a pedicab?<br>&nbsp;
7. **Old Town.** This is the oldest neighborhood in San Diego, which was settled by the Spanish in 1769. It’s a beautiful town with lots of authentic Mexican restaurants, shops, and live entertainment. Old Town is also home to the Whaley House, said to be one of the most haunted houses in America.<br>&nbsp;
8. **The San Diego Zoo.** The world-famous San Diego Zoo is home to more than 4,000 animals and sits at the center of Balboa Park.<br>&nbsp;
9. **Balboa Park.** The zoo has a special place in my heart, since it’s where my husband and I got married. But this park is also known for its theaters, museums, and gardens. The architecture is just jaw-dropping.<br>&nbsp;
10. **Tijuana.** Don’t forget your passport—Tijuana lies just across the San Diego-Mexico border and is just 20 minutes from downtown. Known for its Baja Med fusion cuisines, craft breweries, and culinary chefs, Tijuana is now one of the most visited border towns in the world. You simply have to dine at the famous restaurant Caesar’s, home of the famous caesar salad. Your Tijuana experience will definitely be a memorable one.
