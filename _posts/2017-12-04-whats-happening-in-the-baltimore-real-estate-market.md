Before we get to the latest news and information on the Baltimore Metro real estate market, I want to say thanks. Our recent Thanksgiving pie party was a huge success. We were so happy that so many of you made it out to say hi, support Toys for Tots, and take home some delicious pies. **Thanks to all of you and all of your referrals, we have been able to raise over $10,000 for Cool Kids this year.**

Next year, we’re stepping up our referral game and giving away a $5,000 Apple vacation gift card. Anybody who gives us a referral in the next year will be eligible.

If you’re on the fence about getting into the market next year, let’s take a look at the most recent numbers to see how things are shaping up.

Nationally, the market is up 6.3% in 2017, with Fannie Mae predicting about 5% appreciation growth next year. **Here’s what we’re seeing in a few different areas of the Baltimore metro:**

* Baltimore County: The market is up about 4% year to date, and the average sale price is up to $260,000.
* Howard County: The market is up 2.8% year to date, and the average price is at $410,000.
* Carroll County: This market has seen the best growth in the metro. The average sale price is up to $310,000.
* Anne Arundel County: The market is up 2.1% year to date, and the average sale price is $325,000.
* Hartford County: The market is up 2.1% year to date, and the average sale price is up to $245,000.
* Baltimore City: The market is up 3.9% year to date, and the average sale price is $135,000.

As you can see, **most homeowners in the Baltimore metro are continuing to build steady equity on a year-by-year basis.**&nbsp;Look for this trend to continue, and also look for homeowners to start cashing in on this equity.\*\*

There are a lot of factors that will drive supply and demand over the next year. One is the fact that we’re expecting 2.3 new million residents in the U.S. this next year. However, the biggest factor in the market next year will be the new households being formed.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
