<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Three main factors are impacting our market, and I’m explaining them today.</em></p>

In my opinion as a local real estate agent, three main factors are changing our market these days:

**1\. Historically low inventory.** For the first time in my 13-year career, our local MLS shows just under 4,000 homes for sale. In a typical, steady market we usually have about 5,000 houses for sale. This low inventory has had a large impact on our real estate market.

**2\. Historically low interest rates.** Buyers currently have a wonderful opportunity to buy more house for their money, and homeowners can get a great rate when refinancing.&nbsp;

**3\. Buyers are looking for larger homes.** Now, buyers are searching for homes that are larger, offer more private backyards, and home office space. Some are even looking for space for two people to work from home or a schoolroom.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about what’s impacting our local market or buying or selling a house, please contact us via phone or email. We would love to help you.
