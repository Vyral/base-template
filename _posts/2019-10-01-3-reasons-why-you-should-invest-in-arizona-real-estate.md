*There are three things that make Arizona the perfect place for your next real estate investment.*

If you’ve been thinking about investing in real estate, Arizona should be at the top of your list. There are three big reasons why our state makes for such a good choice:

**1\. The economy and population growth:** Our economy has been doing very well, and the governor recently announced that we have a $1 billion rainy-day fund. If a recession happens, this fund will help us manage its impact. On top of this, Arizona ranks sixth in terms of U.S. population growth rates. We’re sitting at around 1.4% growth per year, which equates to 200 people moving to Arizona each day. The combination of a good economy and a high population growth means that there’s plenty of demand for places to live — perfect for investment\!

**2\. We have good tenants:** On average, Arizona tenants have a credit score of around 669. This is only slightly lower than the nationwide average of 675. In addition, the average income of Arizona tenants is $40,000 per year while the average Arizona income overall is $56,000. Because tenants have good credit scores and great income, it’s easy to find suitable renters or buyers for your property.

**3\. Eviction rates are very low:** In 2018, Arizona had a total of 66,000 filed evictions. Of these, 43,000 ended up with judgments and 20,000 ended with writs. This means that only 2% of all Arizona renters were affected by eviction last year. This is a very low rate for our market.
