Welcome to episode three of my series where I go over 10 steps every agent should take to build their business. This series is meant for newer agents, but they’re still great tips that every agent should be following.&nbsp;

Today, I’m going to start with tip number five: **Join a networking group.** Groups like Business Networking International are a great way to share your knowledge among peers. As you do this, you’ll naturally gain contacts where you mutually benefit each other. If you aren’t in a networking group, I recommend you join one as soon as possible. They offer too much opportunity to skip out on.

**My next step is to attend conferences.** As we thaw out of Covid, in-person conferences are starting up again, but zoom conferences get the job done too. Either way, you should attend these so you can sharpen your skills and network with people from all across the country. This helps you build a referral network outside of your specific geographic location. This is a huge advantage for an agent to have.&nbsp;

Next week, I’ll get back to you with steps seven and eight. Until then, if you have any questions about today’s topics, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I am always here to help.
