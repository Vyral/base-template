Many sellers have recently asked me how we have such great turnout at our open houses, so I wanted to share some quick advice.

**We have a 15-page marketing plan that explains our whole open house process** that I'd be happy to send to you, but for now, I wanted to give you the main points.

Start by keeping the home clean and maximizing the curb appeal. The home should be completely decluttered and the curb appeal should be 10/10 because it means everything. People will drive up to the house, take a look, and keep on driving if the curb appeal isn't up to par. If it needs to be painted, get it painted. If it needs pine straw or mulch, get some. To get people inside the home, the outside has to be beautiful.

**It takes about 90 minutes to prepare for our open houses because we put up more than 100 signs.** We'll put one sign per turn in the neighborhood, and once we get to the major arteries outside the neighborhood, we'll put 10 directional signs pointing to your neighborhood from one direction and 10 more from the other direction. That way, traffic on both sides of the street can see the signage.

Additionally, we generate a lot of interest with our digital marketing. We have a database of more 800 active buyers looking to buy a home, so we'll not only market to them, but target people on social media who are likely to make a move. We run marketing campaigns for about a week in advance to drum up interest.

Publications also work great, so I publish a 15-page real estate-related newspaper that goes to 28,000 homes with an open house section where we feature homes. Finally, we try to get everyone to register once they come in so we can follow up with them and ask questions.

Again, if you'd like our full 15-page document, I'd be happy to share it with you. If you have any questions about open houses or anything in your real estate career, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I hope to hear from you soon!
