<center>Should you list your home during the holidays? Let&rsquo;s discuss.</center>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

Many people assume that the holiday season isn’t a good time of year to list their home on the market, but doing so can actually be a very smart move. First of all, there tend to be fewer properties for sale at this time of year, giving those who do choose to list the opportunity to stand out from the crowd. This low-competition environment only lasts until about January, though. There are always buyers out and looking in the market, and capturing the attention of those who are looking when they have fewer options to choose from is a surefire way to earn top dollar. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
