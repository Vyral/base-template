We have absolutely no inventory in the Pacific Northwest right now. I’m sure you’ve heard about it, but today I want to offer up some advice.

**The No. 1 reason we don’t have any inventory right now is simply because sellers aren’t selling.** They aren’t selling because there are no homes to buy at a good price. It has become a huge problem. Right now, there are only 25,000 homes on the market for sale, compared to over 40,000 at the same time just a few years ago.

My team has partnered with Guild Mortgage to bring more homes to the market. We have a team to assist you with your home search with a proven strategy, and we are proactively calling homeowners that will potentially sell right now. We also offer down payment assistance programs to get you into the home you want. We also provide a fast and seamless closing.

**I’ve been a top broker for years at Century 21 Northwest and last year I sold more homes than anyone in this company.** Stop waiting for homes to come on the market nad hire my team of professionals. The best part is that it doesn’t cost you a cent to hire us. We offer this service to you and your family for no charge. If you want us to get to work for you know or you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.
