<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you still need to sell your house during the pandemic, what do you need to do?</em></p>


For those who still need to sell their house during COVID-19, here are the steps that you’ll need to take in order to keep your transaction on schedule:

1. **Set up a virtual walk-through of the property.** We can do that via Zoom, FaceTime, or similar apps to give your buyers a better sense of the space, layout, and condition of your property.
2. **Schedule a follow-up appointment.** This can also be done over Zoom, which would allow us to share our screen and market data with you so we can come to a decision about pricing, strategy, and marketing that we need to use, as well as any updates or tweaks that need to be done to the property.
3. **Put together a plan regarding your timing.** We know that the market will eventually bounce back, but we don’t know exactly when shelter-in-place orders will be lifted. My advice is to keep your plan on schedule; we can adjust the timeframe a lot easier than we can get your home ready to go if we haven’t already been planning. As we learn more about the status of the situation, we’ll be able to adjust our timing as necessary.
