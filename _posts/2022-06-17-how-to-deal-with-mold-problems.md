If you live in southern Indiana or Kentucky, you know that we have a lot of issues with allergies and other things that cause coughing, wheezing, and runny eyes. Here’s the question, though: Are those allergens coming from pollen in the great outdoors, or are they coming from mold growing in the basement? The topic of mold came up on my radio show recently, and we had an interesting discussion about how much of a problem it can be and how to get rid of it.

Join me, Greg Sokoler, and Brad Lawler from Home Team Inspection Service as we discuss the best ways to tackle house mold.
