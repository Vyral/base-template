Have you been to Alyssa’s Cakery yet? If not, you’ll be pleasantly surprised to hear that this isn’t just another gourmet cupcake shop, it’s a full-blown bakery.&nbsp;**Alyssa is with us today to talk about what they have to offer your sweet tooth.&nbsp;**

Of course, they have a wide variety of delicious baked goods, from mini cupcakes to scones, muffins, and iced coffee. They’ve also got mugs, candles, cards, and other items from local businesses for sale as well.

They design custom wedding, anniversary, and birthday cakes for all different kinds of people. The more creative, the better, says Alyssa.

Their delicious food is just one of the things they offer. Every Tuesday through Friday, there’s a Ladies Night Out, where a group comes in with a bottle of wine to decorate their own cake! They do the same kind of thing for kids birthday parties as well (without the wine of course).&nbsp;**The kids’ parties even have a pinata at the end.**

Alyssa was born and raised in Wallingford, so she loves the fact that her shop is located right on Center St in the heart of the community. She takes pride in being part of the community and brings that attitude to her business each day.&nbsp;**If you haven’t been to Alyssa’s Cakery yet, you need to go soon.**
