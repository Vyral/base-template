<p style="text-align: center;"><em>As 2020 finally draws to a close, we wish you a happy holiday season.</em></p>

We wanted to take a moment today to extend a happy holiday greeting. As 2020 winds down (which we’re willing to bet a lot of people are excited about), we hope your year has gone well. We’ve seen first hand how the pandemic has affected people’s lives, especially as it relates to housing. From our family to yours, we hope you have a great rest of the holiday season and an even better 2021. To see our full holiday greeting, watch the short video above.
