What is it like to sell your home in January?<br><br>A lot of our clients tell us that they don’t think January is a great time to sell. While it’s true that there aren’t as many buyers out in the market in January, **the buyers that are looking tend to be more serious and motivated.**

If you are thinking of selling and moving up to a more expensive property, then January is a great time to sell. You will have serious buyers and less competition for the house that you are going to buy.

The same is true if you plan on downsizing. There will be much less competition for the home you plan on buying if you sell your home in January.

If you have any other questions or if you would like to know when it would be best for you to sell, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
