Helping relocation clients is one of our specialties. Here’s an example of how we were recently able to help one such client.

The topic we’re exploring today is one that we don’t usually talk about: relocation. Essentially, **relocation in real estate refers to homeowners who are displaced because of their job and need to sell their home but don’t have the time and energy to make sure it sells for top dollar.** In this situation, you really need to trust that the agent you hire is working in your best interests to get the house prepared, on the market, and sold.&nbsp;

We recently helped a relocation buyer achieve their goals and we wanted to tell you about that today. The client had a home on Jonathan Court and had to leave before the home was ready to sell. He was really stressed out and nervous because he couldn’t get everything done before he had to start his new job. He had to put his trust in us that we would get the repair work completed and get the home sold for top dollar. The work included flooring, light fixtures, and front and back landscaping. This man interviewed five different agents, but not one of them offered to finish the projects for him. Our team did.

After he left, we were able to get the house ready in a week and a half and ended up getting three offers on it. We were able to do all the negotiating over the phone and over email with the homeowner, and that home is actually closing tomorrow.

We didn’t charge an extra cent for doing that work for him. **All we asked for was for a few referrals and to let others know how satisfied he was.** He actually saved money on repairs by working with our trusted vendors, who give discounts to our team.

At the end of the day, we wanted to make this the smoothest transaction possible and to relieve stress for the homeowner.&nbsp;

**If you or someone you know is relocating in the near future, this is an area of specialty for our team.** If you need any help, we would be more than happy to help you just like we’ve helped our clients in the past. We will take over the stress and pressure of getting your home ready and sold so you can focus on your move.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
