When transitioning between two homes, should you buy and then sell, or sell and then buy? Today, I’ve got three steps to help you decide which route is best for you.

**1. Know the market.**Before you make your final decision, be sure that you fully understand the market in your area and in the area you’re moving to. Inventory and average prices will give you an idea of how much you can sell your home for, and also how much you should expect to pay when you buy.

**2. Know your options.** If you happen to receive an offer before you’ve found your next home, what do you do? There are a couple of things you can do. Your first option is to negotiate a rent-back agreement, where the buyer would allow you to stay in your home after closing for a designated period of time in exchange for giving them a reduced price or rental payments. Your second option is to ask for a longer escrow time. Instead of closing on the sale in 30 days, you can ask for a 60-day closing. This will give you more time to find your home while you complete the sale of your current property.

**3. Don’t let fear rush you.** If your home has sold and you haven’t found a new place to live, don’t let anxiety push you into a bad decision. I recommend that you preemptively plan on temporarily living in a short-term rental during your transition. This way, you have adequate time to sell your home and find your next one.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
