Today I’m excited to share the story of Chris Martindale and how he came to join Keller Williams.

**Chris owned a brokerage but was drawn to the training, culture, and environment of Keller Williams.** His brokerage only had about 70 agents, so he felt he really needed more support. According to Chris, Keller Williams provided that support while still allowing his agents to brand themselves.

The structure that Keller Willams provides is one key feature Chris believes has had a huge impact. Before working with Keller Williams, he felt his brokerage lacked accountability. Keller Williams’ tracking, mentoring, and training is something Chris says a small brokerage cannot achieve on its own.

According to Chris, **Marcus Green has been incredibly helpful in assisting him in his adjustment to Keller Williams.** Having someone like Marcus to guide him through this transition has been essential.

So, what’s unique about Chris’ practice? He believes his team and business are separated by the level of coaching and leadership he provides them, as well as the online marketing they employ. Rather than just handing out leads and leaving things be, Chris believes in helping to guide his agents through the process.

As an example of this, Chris recalls a story of a young agent who he helped to grow in the industry. This agent had a large network from the beginning but wasn’t sure how to leverage it. This is where Chris came in. Now, this agent has closed eleven deals so far this year. **Helping agents grow their business is just one way Chris sets himself apart in the industry.**
