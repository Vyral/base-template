Did you know that 14,904 homes sold yesterday in this country? If your house is on the market and wasn’t one of those sales you need to be asking, “Why not?”

This data comes straight from the National Association of Realtors. **With 14,904 home sales on average each day, there are plenty of opportunities out there.**

Over my 31 years of experience, I’ve realized that whether your home sells or not isn’t because of a bad location or in poor condition. It’s the price. It always comes down to the price. Marketing will help a home sell faster, but the best marketing in the world won’t sell an overpriced listing.

**Last year in Maricopa County, there were 88,000 home sales.** With over 35,000 Realtors in the Valley, that means each of them only sold two on average. Our team doesn’t settle for average. Our agents average 24 home sales per year, ranking us #1 in Arizona and in the top 50 nationwide.

We have many great ideas about how to sell your home but if your home isn’t selling, the first thing you should look at and the first thing we will look at is its price.

If you have any questions for us or need help properly pricing your home, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.
