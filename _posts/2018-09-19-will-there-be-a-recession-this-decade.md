  Many people are worried that our market is heading toward another recession.
  In my opinion, that’s not something you should be worried about.

A lot of people are asking me whether or not another recession is coming in the next few years. I don’t believe we’ll see a recession this decade, and today I’ll discuss my reasoning behind this claim. **Here’s an outline of what I discussed, with timestamps so you can skip ahead to the part(s) that interest you most:**

0:55- My background in the real estate business and the types of markets I’ve seen in my career.

1:25- A brief overview of the recession we saw last decade.

3:00- How buyers’ loans today are much different than what we saw with the last recession.

5:20- How unemployment played a factor in the previous recession and why it’s not a factor these days.

6:15- The role that rent prices are playing in market conditions today.

8:30- Why homeowners who lose their jobs these days have a leg up on buyers who lost their jobs during the previous recession.

**While home prices have continued to go up, I expect to see some stabilization there in the near future and I do not expect us to see a recession in the next three or four years.** If you have any questions for me in the meantime about the market or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
