If you plan on putting your home on the market this coming spring, what can you do to make it look as presentable as possible?

One important tip is to **have a real estate professional do a quick walkthrough of your house.** This will give you an idea of what your competition is doing and what buyers like to see in today’s market. Additionally, this will ensure that if you are making improvements specifically to sell the house, you’re spending your money in areas that will both benefit you and showcase what buyers really care about.

For all your home improvement and repair needs, **we have an excellent list of vendors we could provide you.** They do a great job, their workmanship is outstanding, and the end result will be exactly what you’re looking for at a reasonable price.  

Starting January 2nd, inventory will start picking up right away, so if there’s anything we can do to help you with your home improvements or you’re thinking about making a move next spring, please feel free to give us a call. We’d be happy to help!
