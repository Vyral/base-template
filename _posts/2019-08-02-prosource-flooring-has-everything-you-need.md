Today I’m in the Columbia area for another community spotlight. **This time, we’re at ProSource Flooring.** Andy and his wife Sonia are the owners and are also past clients of ours. We’re past clients of theirs, too. We moved into our new building recently, and they did our floors.

We’re here in their showroom today to learn a little bit more about them and what they do. Andy and his wife moved here in 2017 and had an opportunity to purchase a showroom and start from scratch. They like to think that they brought their South Florida flair here to the Baltimore area.&nbsp;

ProSource Flooring is a franchise with over 150 locations, but there’s only one here in Maryland. **They have some great products, amazing samples, and just about everything you could want for a floor.** They also do custom kitchen, custom bathroom vanities, custom area rugs, and more.&nbsp;

They’re located at 8220 Staten Drive in Maryland, where they offer 12-month same-as-cash financing.

If you have any questions for them in the meantime, visit their website [here](https://www.prosourcewholesale.com/showrooms/md-prosource-of-columbia){: target="_blank"}.

If you have any other questions for me regarding real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
