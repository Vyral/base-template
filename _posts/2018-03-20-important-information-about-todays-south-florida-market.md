As real estate professionals, one of the most common questions people ask us is, “How’s the market?” Today, we’ll be bringing you the answer.&nbsp;

**In our local real estate market, we’ve currently got more buyers than available homes.** This has created a high level of demand, especially among first-time homebuyers.&nbsp;

The housing supply continues to be increasingly tight, with 10% fewer homes than what we saw this time last year. This means we’re currently in a seller's market, where multiple offer situations are common.

So, if you are looking to sell, now is the perfect time. The median sales price of single-family homes remains on the rise in Florida, with a year-over-year improvement of 6.5% as of January 2018.

With regards to interest rates, the 30-year average mortgage rate is now over 4.25%, and we may see interest rates rise in 2018. However, they are still currently very low. **This increase is unlikely to diminish the number of buyers in the market, but it could cause inventory to drop even lower.&nbsp;**

But, don’t worry. As a whole, our South Florida real estate market is still very healthy overall. Our team is currently working with some amazing sellers who are about to list their homes.

&nbsp;If you have plans to list this year, you might be surprised to learn what your property is worth. **You can find an estimate of your home’s value [here](http://realtygirlsreveal.com/homevalue/).**&nbsp;

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like help achieving your real estate goals for 2018, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
