Have you heard about leasebacks? **A leaseback can benefit the buyer and seller alike during a real estate transaction**, so today I’d like to explain what this term means and what is involved in such an arrangement.

A leaseback is an agreement where the seller continues living in their home after closing by paying a weekly or monthly rate to the buyer. This allows the seller to finish up the final details of their move and provides some additional income for the buyer.

So many fine details are involved in finding and closing on the perfect home. Therefore, **this arrangement can be a huge relief to sellers who haven’t yet found the right property or finalized their purchase.**

Also, a leaseback agreement can be especially helpful for sellers who need the money from their home sale to fund their home purchase.

**Sometimes, though, closing on their next home has nothing to do with a seller’s finances, but rather with the property itself.** Sometimes, higher-end properties might fail to appraise, or will require multiple appraisals. Of course, this will take more time than an average appraisal process.

Whatever the reason a seller may need one, leaseback agreements make fantastic safety nets for those undergoing simultaneous transactions.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
