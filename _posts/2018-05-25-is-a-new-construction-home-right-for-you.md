The Misty SOLDwisch home selling team is so thrilled to have amazing relationships with different local builders, as this gives us a unique perspective and unique advantages in assisting our clients with their new construction purchases.

There are a number of advantages to building a new home over purchasing a resale property. Today I’d like to list three of these advantages to give you a better idea of whether this may be something that’s right for you.

1. **You get to choose exactly what you want.** When you build a new home, you can pick out every detail. This means you won’t have to worry about making compromises on carpet, back-splashes, or any other features. Our team works with builders who have streamlined their process in order to make buying new construction as easy as possible. These builders provide buyers with options so that they can design a home that is truly customized to their needs and tastes.<br>&nbsp;
2. **You don’t have to wait for the right home to come on the market.** Instead, you get to create the right home. This is very important in a tight inventory market, especially if you’re searching in a price point where multiple offer situations are common and competition is fierce.<br>&nbsp;
3. **You get great incentives when you buy new construction.** Many builders offer amazing financing options through preferred lenders. Also, many communities around Central Iowa offer tax abatement incentives for buyers purchasing new construction. This can equate to thousands in savings and help increase your buying power.

So, if you’re curious about your options in terms of buying new construction, please get in touch. My team has a high level of expertise on this subject and would be happy to lead you through the process. With the right help, it’s a lot easier than you might think.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
