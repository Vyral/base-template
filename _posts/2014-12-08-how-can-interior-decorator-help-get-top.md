Are you thinking about selling in the Tucson market? If so, there are a few things we would like to share with you.

When you list with the Vallee Gold Team, we contract an interior decorator to help us make your home look stunning. If your home is occupied, they will repurpose your furniture and make a better use of space. If the home is vacant, they will come in with furniture and set your home up to look irresistible.  

If you're in the Tucson area and are interested in using advanced marketing techniques to get more money for your home, check out our vacant new construction property in the heart of Oro Valley on Copper Springs Trail. It's held open just about every weekend, so we invite you to stop by. If you would like a schedule of when the house is open, give us a call or shoot us an email. We would love to help you get the most for your home sale!
