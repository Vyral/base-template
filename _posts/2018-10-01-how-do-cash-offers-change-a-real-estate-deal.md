Believe it or not, there are quite a few cash buyers in our market.

Cash offers can be very attractive for sellers, but **there are certain things buyers must be able to provide before proceeding with an all-cash deal.** Proof of funds is one key example of this.

Also, sellers often expect higher offers from buyers willing to make a cash purchase, but buyers have a different perspective. Cash buyers believe that because they are eliminating a lot of hassle and headaches for the seller, they should be offered a discounted price.

However, **while cash offers eliminate the need for an appraisal, many buyers may still elect to order one to ensure that they’re paying a fair price. &nbsp;**

In summary, cash offers can make a transaction more convenient for the buyer and seller alike, so long as each party is willing to negotiate a fair and reasonable deal.&nbsp;
