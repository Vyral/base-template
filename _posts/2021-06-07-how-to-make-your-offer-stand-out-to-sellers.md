Today I’m talking about how to make your offer as a buyer stand out in a multiple-offer situation. It's no secret; the market is competitive. It’s not for everybody, but life happens. People get married, divorced, have babies, and change jobs. **If you're looking for a home, you need to work with a professional** who knows what it takes to win in multiple-offer situations.

Just in this last month alone, every weekend we've submitted offers, and there have always been at least seven others. One had 23, and while my team and I don't win in every situation, I do love that we try very hard to win with the data and information we have at hand. That involves understanding and building a relationship with the listing agent to see what makes a win for the seller besides price, as well as strategies to set our offers apart.

We've done things like limit the repair requests, bridge the gap between the appraisal and the purchase price, and put together a letter explaining and introducing our buyers and their love for the house and how they'll take care of it. **In many situations, we've won where we haven't been the highest offer in price**, but we’ve listened and put together a package that meets the seller’s needs.

If you are looking to buy and want to partner with an agent or have been working with an agent and are not happy with your results, give me a call. I would love to build a relationship and become your trusted Realtor. I look forward to hearing from you. Have a great day.
