By now, you’ve probably all heard that the government has entered a temporary shutdown, prompted by President Trump’s concerns about building a wall for border security, among a few other factors. It’s a politically charged moment generally, but how will the shutdown impact the real estate market? Today I’ll explain a few things that buyers, sellers, and investors should keep in mind. Some agencies that process the paperwork for closings have been shutting down, as well—if you have to have tax returns filed for 2018 in order to get proof for your mortgage, that process will be delayed. Further still, if your home is in a flood plain or requires flood insurance, you can count on that being delayed, too.
