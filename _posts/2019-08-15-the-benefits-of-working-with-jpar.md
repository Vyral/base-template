Now that we’re part of the JP and Associates REALTORS Association, how does this benefit you if you’re thinking of selling your home? What if you’re an agent looking to further your career?

JPAR is the fastest-growing franchise in the country, which means we have an awesome business model from top to bottom.&nbsp;

If you’re selling your home, you always want to sell at a price and deadline that aligns with your goals. **Having this national network to work with and being the only brand in Northeast Florida gives us access to more buyers to market to.** In addition, we have access to homes that aren’t even listed on the MLS yet.&nbsp;

Furthermore, if you’ve heard of the recent iBuyer phenomenon and you’re wondering what a quick cash offer would look like in your situation, we have our own iBuyer program and access to multiple iBuyer networks that will help you sell quickly and for cash. To help you figure out which option works best, we can show you what we’d do to sell your home locally on the open market and how many iBuyer offers you can get.&nbsp;

**If you’re an agent looking to grow your business, working with a team that’s part of a national network means more opportunity for growth-minded activities.** Once you see our business model, you won’t be able to unsee it.&nbsp;

If you know someone who’s thinking about getting their broker’s license or starting an office, we have multiple opportunities at our office. Only a handful of people have joined us in addition to our core team since we made the switch a couple months ago, so whoever joins us next will be able to plug into our national network and accelerate their growth. If you’d like to open an office outside of the Jacksonville area, we can make that connection as well.&nbsp;

The next couple months are about to get pretty exciting around here, so if you’d like to talk more about the opportunities you can find here or you want to know more about how we can help with all your real estate goals, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to hear from you.
