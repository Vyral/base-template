Hey everyone, welcome back! I'm here to give you a mid-year market report for the Tuscon real estate market today, and I think you'll like what we've been seeing lately.

Our average sales price right now is $210,000, up 7% from 2014. Our active listings are sitting at a 4-month supply right now, which puts us in a pretty balanced market. 

The average days on market in Tuscon is trending downward, which is a good sign. We started the year at 70 days and are into the mid-60's now.

If you're a seller, you can plan on selling your home within 60 days of being on the market if you list with us. With a good property that is priced correctly, it should be no problem!

If you are a buyer, you can expect to buy at a bit of a discount, as the average list-to-sale ratio in Tuscon is down to 95%.

The Tuscon market is returning to more normal levels. Whether you are a buyer or a seller, we have a team of folks that can help. If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to speaking with you!
