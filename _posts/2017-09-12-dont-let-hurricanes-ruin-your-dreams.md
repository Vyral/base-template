Every place on Earth has weather risks; living in a tropical paradise means dealing with hurricanes. Despite this, the good news is that we always have plenty of warning, and plenty of time to get prepared.

Our newer homes are built at higher elevations to combat flood risks, and have very sophisticated storm standards. Most of them would have withstood whatever wind that came our way.

In the event of another hurricane, here’s what you need to know if you’re interested in living in the southwest-Florida area:

First, no matter what, there will always be a vibrant real estate market. Market dynamics may have changed in the short term, but most homeowners would have been made whole, and many would have made improvements to their homes—their house would have been better in the long run.&nbsp;

I was here back in 2005 when Hurricane Charlie struck. It hit Punta Gorda very hard, but the town recovered very quickly—it is now more beautiful and better than ever, and also more in-demand than ever.

Secondly, your Realtor will help you through the disaster. A day after the storm, Wendy was out mapping where all of our clients’ homes were, driving by to check on homes for those out of town. My team had a response plan in place—we really hit the ground running, determining the day after what the new market conditions were, and being ready to help clients move forward through the problem.

Don’t let the threat of hurricanes or their portrayal on the media take away your dream of living on the coast. If a hurricane hits, expect to recover very quickly—we’ll come back better than ever.
