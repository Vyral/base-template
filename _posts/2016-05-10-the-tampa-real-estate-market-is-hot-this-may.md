Thank you so much to our clients that helped us in January through April. We had a fantastic start to the new year here in Tampa. **So far, we’ve already helped more than 51 people buy or sell their dream home in the surrounding community.** We couldn’t have done it without you!

It’s May and spring is upon us. Do you know what that means? The busiest season in the industry is here. **The next 60 days will be a phenomenal time in real estate.** Families, both local and those relocating for their jobs, are looking to buy a new home with their kids wrapping up the school year. These buyers want to be under contract before the next school year starts, and they’re already out in full force.

If you’re a buyer, expect to see new listings coming to the market daily. If you’re a seller, **this is the time to list your property!** You have the opportunity to sell for top dollar in a short amount of time.

If you’re thinking about buying or selling a Greater Tampa Bay area home, please reach out by phone or email. We’d be happy to serve your local real estate needs and answer any questions you might have!
