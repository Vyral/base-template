A lot of you know me as a Realtor, but I’m also a real estate investor. I started my investment journey by buying a two-bedroom condo in Wild Dunes. Starting your investment journey on the beach is great because it allows you the opportunity to do short-term vacation rentals. They certainly have their benefits but have some drawbacks too.&nbsp;

Let’s start with the positives. **These short-term rentals bring much more income on a per-night basis.** You also have the opportunity to enjoy the property with your family when you want as well. That was really important to me in my decision to invest.

At the same time, there are some disadvantages. It does take considerably more time in terms of cleaning and maintaining the property on a nightly basis and you do have to attend to issues when they arise. **One way to avoid this is by hiring a great property management company.** They charge anywhere from 18% to 40% but take care of everything that comes with maintaining the property and its value.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me about investing in real estate on a short-term or long-term basis, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
