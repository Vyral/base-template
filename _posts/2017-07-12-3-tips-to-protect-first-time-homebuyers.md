If you or someone you know is considering buying a home for the first time, there are a few things you need to be aware of. Here are our top three tips to protect first-time homebuyers:

1. **Know what you can afford.** This doesn’t just include your mortgage payment. You need to make sure you can afford that in addition to property taxes, utilities, and various other maintenance fees.

2. **Choose your lender wisely.** Online lenders aren’t always the best option, even if they advertise the lowest rate. You should really get a recommendation from a Realtor or some other person you trust. Local lenders tend to work best in terms of being able to close on time.

3. **Don’t overlook the details.** Purchase contracts have a lot of them. Take your time to read through it carefully and don’t hesitate to ask your Realtor any questions you have.

These are just three tips for successfully buying a home for the first time. If you would like some more tips or just have a question, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
