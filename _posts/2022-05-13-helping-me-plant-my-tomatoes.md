Today is one of my favorite days of the year: the day I get to plant my tomatoes. We realized over the winter when buying store-bought tomatoes that the heirloom tomatoes were incredibly good. My thought was, “What if I grew the heirloom tomatoes in my garden? How good could they get?” That’s what I’m going to find out this year.

**According to Ed Ott, owner of Starview Greenhouse in La Grange, the draw of heirloom tomatoes is that they have the best flavor of all tomatoes.** If you’ve never been there before, I highly recommend taking a trip. You’ll find tomatoes, potatoes, hanging plants, and everything in between. As for the heirloom tomatoes? They have a wide variety of species you can plant. Ed recommends the Brandywine, German Johnson, and Delicious varieties.

Ed says that if a tomato isn’t labeled heirloom, don’t trust that it is. Pink and yellow tomatoes have lower acid levels than red ones, and if you can grow a regular tomato, you can grow pink and yellow ones. Treat them the same way.

**At 3:12 in the video above, I finally made it back home with all of my heirloom and non-heirloom tomatoes.** I tilled the beds with an electric tiller, laid out a weed blocker, and spaced my tomato cages apart. Then I dug the plants in with a spade and a drill. A few hours later, they’re ready to be watered.

The bottom line is that it will take about two to three months before I see any tomatoes harvested. I’m looking forward to it; it should be well worth it\!

If you have any questions for me about gardening or anything related to real estate, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
