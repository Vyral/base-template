With Thanksgiving just around the corner, I want to take a moment to let all of my clients know how much my team and I appreciate you. Thanks to your support, referrals, and loyalty, we’ve been able to help hundreds of families with their real estate dreams.

Now, it’s our time to give back. This Thanksgiving, the pie is on us. That right: we’re giving away free pies.

**All you need to do is order your choice of either apple, pumpkin, or pecan pie, and show up to our future office at the NW corner of 122nd St and Council Rd just West of Sonic between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. on Wednesday, November 26 to pick it up.**

You can place your order [<u><strong>here</strong></u>](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeBjuws4qmwtK2_LIOyWex5I3GsGfNIqbj3Uen4qROocoXPJQ/viewform){: target="_blank"}. And be sure to make sure you do so before Thanksgiving\!**&nbsp;Please reserve your pie of choice no later than 5 p.m. on November 18th.**

Now, my husband Jim graciously offered to bake each and every pie himself. But, to do that, he would’ve needed to start a long time ago. That’s why we’re using a bakery.

If you want to see his attempt, however, you can check out the video above.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
