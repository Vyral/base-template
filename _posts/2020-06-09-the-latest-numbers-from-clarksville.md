What should buyers and sellers know about our Clarksville market as we enter summer?

**Inventory is still low, and I’ve spoken with several colleagues around the country who say they’re facing a similar situation.** As of the recording of this video, there are 690 houses available in Clarksville—the lowest total I’ve ever seen. Last year during this time, there were 868 available homes.&nbsp;

Are these homes closing? In 2019, from January to the beginning of June, there were about 2,000 closings. Year to date, there have been about 2,200 closings— a 6% increase year over year.&nbsp;

The average list price also keeps rising. Compared to this time last year, it’s risen 8% from $205,000 to $222,000. It’s still hard for me to believe the average list price is over $200,000. I remember when I first moved here about 20 years ago, I sold a house for $165,000 and *that* was considered expensive.&nbsp;

The average sale price, meanwhile, has been following a similar trajectory, rising from $203,000 to $221,000 during the same period. This average holds up very well compared to the rest of the country, and it explains why we have so much activity coming from Nashville. It’s much harder to find a nice house for that price in Nashville than it is here in Clarksville.&nbsp;

The average days on market for homes is 43 days, but we put three homes on the market recently that didn’t last more than a couple of days without snagging an offer. So in reality, **if you list your home with us and do exactly what we say, it shouldn’t last more than a week on the market.&nbsp;**

The hottest price range is still between $100,000 and $250,000. These houses are usually gone within 24 to 48 hours after being listed, although condition still plays a big role in achieving a quick sale.&nbsp;

The bottom line is this: We’re still in a fantastic market, and it’s a great time to sell or buy (more on that in a future video).&nbsp;

If you have questions about our Clarksville market or are thinking of buying or selling soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help.
