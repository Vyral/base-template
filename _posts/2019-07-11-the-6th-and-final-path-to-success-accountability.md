You must recognize the unavoidable connection between accountability and success. At some point, you’ll have to realize that what binds you to victimhood is the fact that you don’t want to change—the unwillingness to change automatically makes you a victim.

An accountable person, by definition, wants to change. An accountable person wants to be better for themselves and those around them. To be such a person, you need to get real and understand that every time you point a finger, there are three pointing back at you.

Accountable people ask themselves, “What can I do differently?” **Denial doesn’t change anything, so acknowledge reality—you can only change that which you acknowledge and own.**

Everyone knows by now the folk definition of ‘insanity,’ which is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result each time. You don’t need to be perfect at everything, just the things that matter the most. When reality shows up, own it, because accountable people hold no one responsible except for themselves; they’re the first to find a solution to their problem by looking at what they’ve done already and what they need to do in order to get better.

**One of the great aspects of a real estate career is that there is a direct connection between what you put in and what you get out.** The greatest factor that dictates the success of an individual’s real estate career is their ability to be consistent and persistent with their daily lead generation activities, their willingness to hold themselves accountable, and their ability to adapt to (and stay ahead of) the shifting real estate market.

Besides yourself or perhaps your spouse, who helps to hold you accountable to your goals? Do you have a coach, team leader, or peer who will hold you to your aspirations? As the adage goes, “To get to the next level in your life will require a different perspective and a higher level of thinking than the perspective and level of thinking that got you to where you are.”
