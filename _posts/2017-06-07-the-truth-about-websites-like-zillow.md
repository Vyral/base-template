Sites like Zillow, Realtor.com, and Trulia can be a challenge for buyers and sellers. Why?

 Let’s say that you are buying a home and looking for your dream home on these sites. If you call the listing agent, **you will probably hear that the property has already sold.** That’s because there is a delay between what you see on those websites and what professional agents see. As real estate agents, we actually get a head start of up to seven days on the best properties.

 So, how can you find a listing online that hasn’t already gone under contract?

 You can do one of two things. First, you can search on a site like ours, which pulls information directly from the MLS. That way, when a home hits the market, you will know right away. The other option is to allow us to do all of the hard work for you.

The last few buyers we’ve worked with only viewed four homes until they found their dream home. That might not seem very impressive, but one of those buyers had been searching with another agent and on their own for two long years.

 If you are selling your home, are those websites your friends? Not really. It’s important to understand how Zillow impacts your pool of buyers. If Zillow has a wrong Zestimate or other incorrect information, it can cost you thousands of dollars. **It may even cost you the home sale.**

 It’s important to understand how these sites work and competitively list your home in the right place.

 At Treu Group real estate, we understand how to help you buy, sell, and, most importantly, how to help you win. If you have any questions, we are here to help you. Just give us a call!
