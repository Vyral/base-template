<center>There are four core lead generation sources in real estate. These will build the foundation of a successful business.</center>

&nbsp;

If you’re a real estate agent, you know there are possibly thousands of ways to generate leads and grow your sales business. If you’re a new agent looking to get started or you’re a seasoned Realtor looking to redirect your lead generation, then you’ll be interested in the four core sources of lead source business. I believe these are the four sources that every real estate agent should focus on until they reach the level of income that fully funds their aspirations. After that, you can experiment with other sources. Here are the core four:

1. **Geographic Farming.** If you own your home, I recommend a geographic farm, meaning you farm your own neighborhood. If you don’t own a home, then develop a demographic farm, meaning you find people who share something in common with you. Perhaps a hobby, you attend the same church, you’re from the same high school, etc.&nbsp;
2. **Open houses.** They generate leads regardless of the season and where you are in your career. These are an ongoing, wonderful source of business.&nbsp;
3. **Online leads.** These are still the least expensive way to generate new real estate business.&nbsp;
4. **Sphere of influence.** These are the people who already know, like, and trust you. Family, friends, neighbors, former coworkers, etc.&nbsp;

So just remember the acronym “G.O.O.S.E.” The “E” at the end stands for “everything else.” If you’ve focused on the core four and built up your business, then you’re free to explore other avenues of lead sources.&nbsp;

If you have questions about the core four or if I can help you in any way, please contact me by phone or email. I would love to hear from you.&nbsp;
