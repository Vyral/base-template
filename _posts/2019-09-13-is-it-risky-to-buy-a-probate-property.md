Probate sales are often touted as a good deal, but is it risky to buy this kind of property? Before we get into this, let’s first define what probate is.&nbsp;

**In short, probate is the process by which the court determines how to appropriately distribute your assets after death.** But, when buying this type of property, it’s important to understand the difference between the two types of probate sale: full-authority probate sales and limited-authority probate sales.&nbsp;

**In a full-authority probate sale, the administrator has complete power to sell the property**—and, unless court confirmation is required, this type of transaction is generally very straightforward. However, while full-authority probate sales are very similar to standard real estate transactions, a probate purchase agreement does carry some distinct terms and conditions. Per these conditions, the details of your offer will be relayed to the decedent’s beneficiaries via a notice of proposed action. Then, so long as none of the beneficiaries objects, the sale will proceed as normal.&nbsp;

**In a limited-authority probate sale, the property’s administrator is required to follow a series of court-mandated steps.** The court will also provide guidance on marketing, pricing, negotiation, and other aspects of the process.&nbsp;

The bottom line is that probate properties can be a great opportunity for today’s homebuyers, so long as you understand the process that comes along with such a transaction. And since so many people assume a probate sale is overly complicated, buyers who take advantage of this niche will likely face less competition.&nbsp;
