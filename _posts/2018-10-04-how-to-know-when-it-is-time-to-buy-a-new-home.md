Is it time for you to move to a new home? Today I will give you four signs that it may be time to start packing those bags.

**1. You've outgrown your home.** Maybe years ago you bought a 1,200 square foot home or a 3-bedroom 2-bath home and it was plenty of room for you at the time. Now, though, you have kids or parents living with you and you just don't have enough space for everyone anymore.

**2. Thinking about an addition that doesn't make sense.** We had a house once that we loved, but it was getting a little small. We thought that adding an addition to the home was a good idea, but it would have out priced the home for the neighborhood. For this reason, we had to move because it didn't make sense to invest money and over-improve the home for the neighborhood.

**3. Lifestyle change.** Maybe you want to downsize because your kids are gone and you don't want that big of a house anymore. Or, maybe you got a new job and the commute is longer, so you want to move closer to your job.

**4. You have a flexible time frame.** Maybe the previous market wasn't the best for you to sell your home and net the amount of money you needed, but now, with the increasing market, it is. Last year's average price was $183,000 and now it is up to $193,400. This means that you can get more money out of your home if you sell now.
