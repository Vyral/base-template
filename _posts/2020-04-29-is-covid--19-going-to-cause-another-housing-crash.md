We hope you and your loved ones continue to stay safe and healthy. &nbsp;COVID-19 continues to be the topic of conversation and the dominating force in our lives.&nbsp;

With all the volatility in the stock market and uncertainty about the length of time this may last, a lot of folks are rightfully concerned about another market crash like we had in 2008-2011, otherwise known as the Great Recession. Ali Wold, Director of Economic Research for the real estate consulting firm Meyers Research, addressed this point in a recent interview:

**There are quite a few reasons indicating this real estate market is nothing like 2008. &nbsp;Here are 5 dramatic differences:**

1\. In the last 30 days, more homes have offers accepted on them than are coming available for purchase in our UT market and most major metropolitan areas.&nbsp;

<br>2\. Mortgage standards are nothing like they were back then. &nbsp;Have you seen the movie “The Big Short”? &nbsp;Well, you can’t fog a mirror and get a loan anymore. &nbsp;Standards for underwriting are tough. &nbsp;Getting a loan isn’t hard to do, but you actually have to qualify for that loan. &nbsp;No more stated income loans, or the proverbial 80/20 combo loans.&nbsp;

<br>3\. We don’t have a surplus of homes on the market. As mentioned we have a surplus of buyers. We actually have a shortage of homes available.

* 3983 new homes came on the market
* 4708 homes went into under contract status
* 4711 closed

4\. Houses became too expensive in the lead up to the Great Recession. &nbsp;Affordability was a real issue, though didn’t factor into getting a loan. &nbsp;The affordability index, which is the percentage of an average person's income it takes to buy an averaged priced home is FAR lower than it was from 2005-2007. &nbsp;The major player in affordability has been historically low-interest rates.

<br>5\. People are equity rich, not tapped out. &nbsp;From 2005-2008 people were using their homes like piggy banks and banks were more than happy to give out nearly free home equity loans for more than their homes real value. &nbsp;The result of this was people using equity from their homes to finance their lives wants, weddings, vacations, cards, credit card consolidation, etc…That put their homes are a risk in the event they were unable to afford them as they had no equity to sell. &nbsp;Well, banking institutions have put a lot of restrictions in place to prevent people from over-encumbering their homes. &nbsp;

<br>We will continue to keep the real estate industry operating during these trying times. &nbsp;Please don’t hesitate to call us and ask us about our safe seller and virtual buyer programs our clients are utilizing to stay safe during these uncertain times.
