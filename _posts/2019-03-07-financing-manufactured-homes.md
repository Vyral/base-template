While property values and purchase prices continue to rise, many people are turning to a more affordable option: manufactured homes.

**Manufactured homes can be financed through conventional, VA, and FHA loan programs**. For the most part, any loan program will be approved. However, though the USDA has a pilot program in some states that allows for the financing of existing manufactured homes, Florida is not currently part of this program.

**For a lender to finance a manufactured home purchase, there are some basic requirements that must be met:**

1. The home must be a double-wide.
2. It must be at least 400 square feet
3. It must have been built after June 15, 1976

Manufactured homes tend to depreciate in value, and if you’re taking on a 30-year mortgage, lenders want to be sure of the remaining economic life of the home. **Because of this, more weight is placed on the buyer’s qualifications**. This can mean you need a higher credit score, bigger down payment, or more expensive private mortgage insurance. Beyond this, there aren’t many restrictions.

To get a loan on a manufactured home, lenders require a structural engineer’s report. The engineer looks under the home to ensure it’s been tied down, the wheels and axles have been removed, it’s structurally sound, and it meets various municipality/county requirements.

**Otherwise, everything else is similar to getting a normal mortgage loan.** If you or anyone you know is looking to purchase a manufactured home, have any questions, or need further information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
