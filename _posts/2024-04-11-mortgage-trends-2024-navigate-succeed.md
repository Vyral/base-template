As we delve into the complexities of the current real estate market, one question consistently surfaces: "What's happening with mortgage rates?" Today, we'll shed some light on this pivotal topic that influences the decisions of buyers and sellers alike.

A look at the graph displaying the trajectory of 30-year conventional mortgage rates over the past year reveals a journey of fluctuations. In late 2023, rates neared the 8% mark, but as we progressed into 2024, a downward trend emerged, briefly rebounding before stabilizing just below 7%. It's crucial to remember, though, that these rates are just snapshots of the mid-March 2024 market and are subject to change. Variables, such as your credit score and financial standing, can impact the rates available to you.

**Key Observations:**

* **Current State:** Unlike the pandemic era's 2% to 3% rates, the past year has seen figures oscillating mainly between the high sixes and high sevens.
* **Affordability Impact:** A 1% fluctuation in mortgage rates can significantly alter your buying power by approximately 10%. For instance, a decrease in rates by 1% could enable you to afford up to 10% more on a home purchase.
* **Market Dynamics:** A potential drop in rates could invigorate the buyer market, leading to increased competition and higher prices. Currently, buyers have the upper hand, enjoying concessions, repairs, and more favorable deal terms.
