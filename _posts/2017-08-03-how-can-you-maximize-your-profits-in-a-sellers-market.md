{% include youtube.html %}We’ve all heard that it’s a seller’s market out there, meaning there is more demand than supply. When a home goes on the market that’s priced reasonably well, it will likely receive multiple offers.

If you’re a home seller, here are a few tips on how to make your home sale even more successful under these market conditions. You might be surprised to know it’s not only about price. After all, what does it accomplish if your home sells but you don’t really receive top dollar for it or it doesn’t close on time?

The first tip is to **make sure you have a winning agent.** The right agent will strategize with you and create a position within the market that gives you the best exposure and the best offer. This includes professional photography, strategic marketing, and open houses. After all, you want to have maximum exposure.

<br>Secondly, **make sure the terms are right for you.** You should have short contingency periods, short inspection periods, and a short closing period. Another thing you can do is be prepared so that when an offer comes in from the right buyer, they can close even faster. That means you can have your home inspected in advance and you can do any repairs in advance that might need to be done so there are fewer things the buyer can ask for.

Furthermore, you want to **know that the buyer can close.** If they say they’re a cash buyer, do they really have the money to close? Is the money readily available in an account and could they close tomorrow? If the buyer has to get a loan, make sure they’re fully approved and they’re ready to close quickly by a credible and reliable lender.

When you have a winning agent on your side who knows how to close deals, you can maximize your price and position in the market. You’ll not only have a home that looks good and is priced well, but you’ll be able to get more than you ever expected in a seller’s market.
