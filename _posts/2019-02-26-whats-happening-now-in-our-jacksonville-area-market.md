2019 is well underway, which means it’s time for another update on our Jacksonville and Beaches area market.&nbsp;

**First, homes priced at and below the median price point ($275,000) are selling quickly and for top dollar,** so long as they’re in good shape and are marketed well. Listings above this price point, however, are selling much more slowly. The luxury market has been largely stagnant.&nbsp;

Of course, this doesn’t mean you can’t still succeed with your selling goals. Our team would be happy to have a conversation about your circumstances and develop a plan to get your home sold.&nbsp;

We’re also happy to help those looking to buy. **Through our Buyer’s Advantage Program, which is free to all of our clients, we can easily help you succeed in today’s market.**

It truly does take expert guidance to navigate successfully navigate your real estate goals, regardless of what they may be. Our team not only understands what it takes to buy and sell in general, but also how each of these things can be achieved in light of recent events (like the government shutdown and the rise of interest rates).

Overall, **our market has been fairly balanced.** It’s still possible to earn a great deal, and we look forward to helping you do so.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
