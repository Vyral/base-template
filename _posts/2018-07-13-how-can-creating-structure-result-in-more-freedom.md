Recently, I gave a webinar about the importance of time blocking. Although it may not be the most stimulating topic, **this fundamental task can lead to systematic success for you and your real estate career.** I have time blocked the different topics that I discussed below so that you can jump to the parts that most interest you:

2:40 – How structure feels and why we want to resist it.

4:25 – Creating our own structure creates more freedom.

6:00 – Does your calendar reflect your four conversation goals we learned about in my last video?

7:20 – Building a calendar that matches your goals to give you freedom and results.

8:05 – Deconstruct and structure your calendar to make your goals show up.

9:05 – Add what is most important and non-negotiable to your calendar.

11:30 – How to schedule in planning time.

15:20 – Why actual appointments need to be scheduled so you can hit your goals.

17:25 – Don't miss an appointment or you will get behind.

19:20 – What is time blocking?

20:30 – Why is time blocking important and where do I find it?

22:25 – How do I set up a calendar and systematically use it?

23:00 – Tips to protect your time block.

25:35 – Our office's one-touch commitment and what it means.

27:55 – Prioritize your tasks and how long they should take each day.

My challenge for you now is to create your own ideal time block for yourself. **Then ask yourself how you will protect your time and create more freedom.**

If you have any additional questions about time blocking and how this type of structure can create you more freedom, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
