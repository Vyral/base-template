Today I’m here to tell you that the world don’t owe you jack. Regardless of your performance, the world doesn’t owe you anything. Your family doesn’t owe you; your boss doesn’t owe you. No one owes you\!

**When we get into this mindset of entitlement, we’re taking a big step back.** We’re losing ground on everything we’ve made, which keeps us from reaching our desired outcome. Only when we move forward with purpose and accountability can we accomplish everything we want.

When you hit that intersection of victimhood and entitlement, remember what we talked about today. If you have any questions or want some additional coaching, please call, text, or email me. Make it a great day\!
