I have had the honor of being selected as an American Dream TV host for Central Iowa!&nbsp; I’m excited to send you a clip of my first presentation on this lifestyle show.

I’m exploring 800 acres of paradise in Madison County, Iowa, just 25 minutes from Des Moines.&nbsp;**Howell Farm, a family-run operation, offers a variety of activities, including a pumpkin patch, greenhouse, and more.**

Fred Howell, a fifth-generation farmer at Howell Farm, began the operation during the egg crisis, experimenting with alternative crops and starting with a quarter acre of flowers. Over time, the farm expanded to include a greenhouse, pumpkins, strawberries, corn maze, and more.

Fred explains the process of drying florals, involving picking them fresh, hanging them, and using a solar dryer. Some materials are preserved using glycerin, water, and dye, maintaining suppleness for years. This marked the beginning of the farm’s retail venture, which evolved from a greenhouse to a garden center. Dried florals became a fall tradition, leading to the addition of pumpkins. The farm’s growth continued, necessitating a greenhouse for planting thousands of plants.

Also, I stopped by my newest listing, located at 5519 Glen Oaks Pointe West, Des Moines. Glen Oaks, a 552-acre development since 1991, features an 18-hole Tom Fazio-designed golf course, a golf club, resort-style aquatic center, and a patio bar. The home, part of a 19-home community within The Point, includes its own amenities like tennis courts, pickleball courts, swimming pool, and gazebo.

**Built in 1999 but extensively updated, the 4250-square-foot home offers elegance and comfort.**&nbsp;Highlights include a primary bath with a soaking tub, Italian marble tile, and a hydrotherapy shower. With four bedrooms on three levels, this home embodies a luxurious lifestyle.
