Today we are excited to be joined by our preferred lender, Jim Evans of Potomac Trust Mortgage. He is here to give you some valuable information on current mortgage interest rates and what you can expect if you are thinking of either buying or refinancing today.

Right now in Northern Virginia, we are at an 18-month low for mortgage rates. This is excellent, and means we haven't seen mortgage rates this low since early 2013.

Here is an article about these extremely low rates, which are being seen on a national scale.

If you want to save thousands over the life of your home loan, Jim suggests locking in a rate now. When rates are this low, they will get worse before they get better and chances are they will rise instead of falling.

If you have any questions at all for Jim, you can reach him at (703)-282-9692.

One thing we love about Jim is his honesty. If you want the facts and someone who will be a straight shooter with you, Jim is your guy.

Thanks again for joining us today. For all your real estate needs, whether you are buying or selling, give us a call. We'd be glad to go over your situation with you and figure out how we can make your next home transaction a breeze.
