Today, I want to speak briefly about the things you should research and take into consideration when moving to another organization.

First, ask yourself: “What is the company’s primary service or product?” Once you’ve answered this, **ask yourself if it is something you have the ability to stand behind and get excited about.&nbsp;**If it’s not, it could be a challenge for you to work with this service or product on a daily basis.

Additionally, you should think about the company’s target market. Who are they trying to serve and impact? This factor will impact the things you’ll do on a daily basis.

On top of who the company is trying to reach, another thing to think about is what the company wants to be known for. Along with considering who the company wants to impact, it’s also important to know how they want to make that impact.

The age of the company will also matter. If a company just started, you may have the opportunity to come in and give some real input on how to improve or change certain aspects of the operation. &nbsp;

Well-established companies also have benefits. When a company has been around for a while, you can feel certain about their track record of success.

However long a company has been in business, leadership matters. **Before moving to an organization, determine who is on the leadership team and what experience they have.&nbsp;**When you figure this out, you may even find common ground.

Another question you should be asking is, how much revenue have they generated? Also, who is their biggest competitor? Having this information from the beginning will be greatly beneficial to you as a potential member of any organization.

You should also know what strengths and weaknesses the organization may have. This information can be found through press releases and even social media.

With all of this information in mind, the final question to ask yourself is this: **Why could you see yourself working for this organization?**

This question will undoubtedly be asked of you in the interview process, so it may be a good idea to have your answer prepared ahead of time.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
