**In real estate, it’s very important to keep yourself top of mind in your farm areas and areas of expertise.** Your job is to keep your name out there and top of mind.&nbsp;

In my farm areas, my position is that if someone is thinking about buying or selling a home, I want them to at least think “Becky Ivins.” Then I might get an opportunity to show them exactly how we do business.

**You need your name to be synonymous with what you do: taking care of people in the real estate field.**

If you have any questions for me about the real estate business or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
