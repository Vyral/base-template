Today we’re going to bring you a healthy thinking hack. Usually we think about diet, nutrition, and working out, but we never really think about how we can work out our minds. The mind is one of the most important things, if not the most important thing, that we need to exercise in order to live a healthy life.

Today we are going to talk about the difference between being poor and being broke. Oftentimes we think these two terms are synonymous, **when in reality they are not.** We also think about them in terms of finances, when today we want to focus on these terms in regards to health.

Being broke is a matter of circumstances. Being poor is a matter of mindset. Being broke in health usually means that you may be suffering from different conditions or ailments. These are temporary setbacks that can be overcome.

An example of being poor in health is being aware of a condition that runs in the family, and choosing to sit around and let it happen to you. Another example is seeing exercise as too painful and therefore choosing not to do it because you don’t want to be sore. **Anytime you’re making excuses for yourself, you have a poor mindset.**

A way to have an abundant mindset in regards to your health is be proactive with it. Don’t let certain conditions or ailments dictate your life. **You dictate your life.** If you have a poor mindset in health, you’ll always be broken in health. If you have an abundant mindset, that brokenness is only temporary; it’s not permanent.
