<center>To help maintain your home&rsquo;s value, be sure to keep up with these five repairs.</center>

&nbsp;

Here are five home repairs you shouldn’t put off if you want to help maintain the value of your home:

**1\. Caulking.** Look around your windows and other areas in your house where cold air may be seeping in or warm air may be escaping and give caulk them.&nbsp;

**2\. Checking for any plumbing leaks.** Specifically, inspect the areas around your furnace, water heater, kitchen, and bathrooms.&nbsp;

**3\. Changing your furnace filter.** Not changing this regularly can increase your utility costs.

**4\. Sweeping your chimney (if you have one).** I recommend doing this at least once a year.&nbsp;

**5\. Cleaning out your dryer vent.** A clogged dryer vent can cause a variety of issues.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.&nbsp;
