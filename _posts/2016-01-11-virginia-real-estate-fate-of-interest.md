The Fed has a lot of meetings planned in the upcoming months, and everyone wants to know one thing: when are rates going to rise? It's not a matter of if, but when.

We're already starting to see changes in the Virginia marketplace. Many sellers are listing their homes to get ahead of the curve, and buyers out there are trying to find that perfect home in order to take advantage of these historically low interest rates!

So, if you're thinking about buying a home or refinancing your current one, we highly recommend trying to take advantage of our current historically low interest rates while they're still here.

Give us a call or shoot us an email if you would like our help taking advantage of this historic opportunity. We would love to help you!
