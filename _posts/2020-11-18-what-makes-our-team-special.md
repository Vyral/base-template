Here’s how our team is set up and how we provide exceptional service.

Today I’m talking about how our real estate team is set up.&nbsp;

I got the idea when I was sitting in the waiting room at my dentist’s office. It occurred to me that the person sitting behind the desk in the front of the office is different from the person who does teeth cleanings, who is different from the person who handles the insurance, and so on. It made me realize that solo real estate agents do everything; they work with buyers and sellers, do paperwork, marketing, etc. **Most of us don’t have the skill set to do everything extremely well. **

One of the ways our team is unlike any other in the area is that we each have our specialties. My buyer specialists are inventory specialists; they meet with buyers, build a relationship, show homes, and know the Portland real estate market as well or better than any agent in town. Their focus is knowing about each house on the market, which properties went off the market, and what’s about to come on it. Then they hand the buyers to me, I’m the lead negotiator for the team; I write every offer and negotiate each deal for buyers and sellers.&nbsp;

By having a team where **everyone stays in their lane and strong suit,** we provide the strongest degree of customer service to our clients.
