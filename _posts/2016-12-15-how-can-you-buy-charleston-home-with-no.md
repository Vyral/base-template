Many times we see buyers who are ready to own a home but just don't have the money for a down payment. **Did you know you can buy a home with very little or even zero money down?** Today I wanted to share the top four ways you can do this in the Charleston market.

Since interest rates are low, it's still a fantastic time to buy a house. These are the ways you can take advantage with little or no money down:

1. **VA (veterans) loan:** You can buy a home if you're a veteran for 100% financing.

2. **State Housing:** This is a grant for your down payment. Depending on your income and the county you're buying in, it could be repaid or it could be completely forgivable.

3. **USDA:** This lets you buy a home in what's considered a rural area. Many areas around Monk's Quarter, Goose Creek, and Summerville are still considered rural because of lines that were drawn many, many years ago. This loan also lets you finance 100% of the price.

4. **A gift fund from a relative or family member:** This lets you buy a home with a conventional down payment, but you utilize it as a gift from a family member or relative that's applied directly to the home purchase.
At the end of the day, if you have about $1,200, we can get the seller of the home you want to buy to pay the majority of the closing costs. The $1,200 will allow you to get the property inspected and put down your earnest money so you can buy the home.

With a 620 or better credit score and gainful employment, we may be able to help you get into a home with little or no money down. If you have any questions about qualifying or you're interested in buying a home in the Charleston area, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I'd love to help you out!
