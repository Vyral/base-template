Over the years, I've been asked several variations of the same question. That question is: "Aren't all agents the same?" You put a sign in the yard, post the property on the MLS, and wait for someone to sell the property, right?

Not exactly.

Not all real estate agents are created equal. We have different marketing techniques, offer different services, and even have different fees. Some agents charge more while others charge less. You get what you pay for most of the time.

This is why I am part of a full-service brokerage. **I sit down with you and we talk about the marketing plan that I will use to sell your home.** I have access to thousands of buyers that are coming to my company's website every month.

**I also will show you what I charge.** Is it the same for every house? No. Every house has its own unique characteristics and may require more or less marketing than another house in the same neighborhood.

When you call a real estate agent, should you expect them all to do the same thing? No. Should you expect them to charge the same thing? No. Should you be wary if an agent says their commission without ever looking at your home? Yes. If they never looked at your home, they do not know what they are marketing.

So if you are serious about selling your home, give me a call. I will not rake you over the coals, but I will instead provide you with quality service at a reasonable price. I look forward to speaking with you soon about how I can help you net the most money for your property.
