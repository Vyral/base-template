How was the 2017 market and what can we expect for the new year that’s ahead? Let’s take a look at the latest numbers.

First of all, the median price for homes increased by 10% in 2017. **So for the Central Florida/Orlando Area, the median price was $220,000.**

The annual median price for single-family homes also increased, going up by 8.2%. When it comes to condos, the median price increased in 2017 by 17.7%, at $111,000. Duplexes, townhomes, and villas also increased by 10.8%.

Overall, we saw very healthy gains from 2016 to 2017.

Another area of growth we saw was in average sales price, which increased 3.8%. The average sales price of single-family homes increased by 2.1%, with 37,198 homes sold in 2017. Year over year, the number of homes sold increased by 10.7% in 2017.

Also in 2017, normal sales for the overall market were up by 11.9%. And as another piece of good news, foreclosures went down by 49%. **This means that the market has recovered and is on its way up.**

In total, 44,343 homes were sold in 2017, compared to the 43,062 that sold in 2016. This is an overall increase of 3%.

Sales increased by 7.2% in Lake County, 2.8% in Orange County, 3.8% in Seminole County, and by 7.9% in Osceola County.

The market is doing really well, so **if you’ve given any thought to selling your property this year I definitely recommend you do so.** Builders aren’t able to match the demand and inventory is still low. On top of that, the average interest rate is 4.125%. Compared to what we saw a couple of years ago, this is very low.
