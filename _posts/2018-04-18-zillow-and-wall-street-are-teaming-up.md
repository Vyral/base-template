<center>Zillow has officially entered the home buying and flipping industry. Here&rsquo;s what to expect.</center>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

Zillow is now buying and flipping homes. This is very interesting because it confirms that Wall Street is now dipping their hand into the real estate cookie jar.

I think we all know that Wall Street isn’t known for being transparent. **That’s what makes the difference between Zillow’s instant offer and our program, “My Rocket Listing”, so stark.**

After selling thousands of homes, I’ve realized that there are still people that don’t want to go through the hassle and stress of buying or selling a home. They value convenience over the top list price.

When Zillow comes out and gives you an offer on your home, but they are off by an average of 7%, that’s $28,000 on a $400,000 house. With our My Rocket Listing program, we will not only give you an offer, but we will also give you a suggested list price. Even in a hot market like the one we have in Portland, people want a guarantee and convenience. I believe it’s the most transparent way to sell your home. **On average, about two out of ten people chose the My Rocket Listing program, while the other eight will want us to sell the home traditionally for max value.**

If you have any questions for me about this topic or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
