With Thanksgiving just around the corner, I want to take a moment to let all of my clients know how much my team and I appreciate you. Thanks to your support, referrals, and loyalty, we’ve been able to sell hundreds of homes over the past three years.

Now, it’s our time to give back. This Thanksgiving, the pie is on us. That right: we’re giving away free pies.

{% include pullquote.html %}

**All you need to do is fill out the form below to order your choice of either apple, pumpkin, or pecan pie&nbsp;**by Sunday November 19th&nbsp;**and show up at our office **to pick it up&nbsp;**between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. on Tuesday, November 21st.&nbsp;**

You can place your order here.

Now, my husband Jim graciously offered to bake each and every pie himself. But, to do that, he would’ve needed to start a long time ago. That’s why we’re using a bakery.

If you want to see his attempt, however, you can check out the video above.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
