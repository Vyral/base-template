With Thanksgiving just around the corner, I want to take a moment to let all of my clients know how much my team and I appreciate you. Thanks to your support, referrals, and loyalty, we’ve been able to sell thousands of homes over the past three years.

Now, it’s our time to give back. This Thanksgiving, the pie is on us. That right: we’re giving away free pies.

All you need to do is fill out the form linked below to order your choice of either apple, pumpkin, or pecan pie **by Sunday, November 19th** and show up at our office to pick it up between 2pm and 6pm on Tuesday, November 21st. Our office is located at 6905 NW 122nd Street Oklahoma City, OK 73142.

Now, my husband Jim graciously offered to bake each and every pie himself. But, to do that, he would’ve needed to start a long time ago. That’s why we’re using a bakery.

If you want to see his attempt, however, you can check out the video above.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
