Today I’ll talk about whether you should buy a home or rent it. The answer depends on your specific situation. However, if you're trying to decide whether or not to leap into homeownership, here are a few things you should consider:

**1\. How long do you plan on living in this house?** If you don’t plan on staying there for at least five years, then it makes more sense for you to rent a home than to buy one.

**2\. Are you financially prepared to purchase a home?** Do you have a down payment set aside? What is your credit score? How will a monthly mortgage payment impact your budget? If you are seriously considering buying a home, talk to a local lender and get pre-approved to see what exactly you can afford.

While buying a home may seem expensive, there are many financial benefits to homeownership. By paying your monthly mortgage payment, you're building up long-term wealth instead of just paying off your landlord's mortgage. You also get several tax benefits when you own your own home. For example, your mortgage interest and property taxes are deductible. Your net worth would also go up once you make the change from renter to homeowner.

Now is a great time to buy a home thanks to historically low interest rates. Your fixed mortgage rate won't change, but rent increases with inflation. You'll also have more flexibility and freedom. You may have to fix a leaky sink on your own, but you won't have to worry about a landlord selling the property or raising the rent. You will be in charge of your home.

If you're curious about becoming a homeowner, give me a call or send me an email. I'll be happy to answer any questions you have about your specific situation.
