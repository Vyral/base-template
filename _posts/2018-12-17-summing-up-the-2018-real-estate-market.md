  idea to recap what happened in the market in 2018.

In 2018, **we saw the number of homes that actually sold in the Greater Milwaukee area drop about 2.5%** compared to 2017. Interestingly enough, the number of listings that came on the market was also down almost 5%, meaning there were fewer homes available for buyers to choose from. Overall, in **most marketplaces, we saw prices go up anywhere from 5% to 6%.**

With interest rates expected to rise again this year, we expect a lot more homes to come on the market, especially in the spring—**there could be 20% to 30% more homes available.** With all the buyers trying to lock in a home before the interest rates go up again, we should expect to see a rush of activity in the spring.

<br>The Roth Team had one of its best years in 2018—we closed on 245 homes, and our overall sales were up close to 15%. For that success, **we thank you**, our past and current clients, for all your referrals and your business.
