As you can tell, we’re still in a great seller’s market, so **if you’re thinking about selling your home or you have a challenging home to sell, this is the market to do so.** We’re selling houses as fast as we can list them, and many houses are getting multiple offers. In fact, we listed a house last week that garnered 10 showings and five offers in its very first day on the market.

If you’re a buyer, there’s still time to find a great house at a great price in this market. First, though, you need a great agent who can help you compete for the house you want.
