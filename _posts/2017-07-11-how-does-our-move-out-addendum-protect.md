Our move-out addendum ensures that your property is always in good condition. Here’s how it works.

The Hawaii Landlord-Tenant Code is a 29-page document that spells out all the expectations for owners and renters. Here at Hawaii Pacific Property Management, we add an additional 14-page addendum to our rental contract called a “move-out addendum” that we wanted to talk to you about today.

**This addendum states that the tenant will get professional services to clean the home and leave it in the same condition it was when they moved in.** To ensure this, we require tenants to sign the agreement up front before they move in. We also require them to provide receipts for any carpet cleaning or maid services they use. This way, there are never any questions about the condition of the property. It will look the same each time a tenant moves out.

**We do two things very well:** We protect your home and put money in your account. If you need help with either of those things or have any questions about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
