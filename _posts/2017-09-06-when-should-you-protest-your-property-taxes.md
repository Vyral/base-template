We’re nearing the end of summer, which means you've probably received a notice in the mail recently from your county indicating the proposed value for your home in 2017. Keep in mind that **it’s not a tax bill so you don’t have to pay it, but you should take a close look at it to see what it says.**

The county has the ability to raise your taxes by 2% each year due to Proposition 13. In most cases, they do. If you look at the form and feel your value is unfairly high or there is a missing exemption, you have the right to protest the assessment. However, the window of opportunity to do that is closing. The deadline for protesting your property taxes is September 15th for Ventura County. **[Here’s a handy graphic](http://vyralmarketing.s3.amazonaws.com/Breanne%20Steen/Tax_Info.pdf){: target="_blank"}** with a little information about how this all works.

**In most cases, this assessed value is not really a reflection of what your home will sell for in today’s market.** If you want to know more about what your home is worth, I can help. In fact, if you have any questions about protesting your home’s assessed value, the forms you need to fill out, or anything else about Ventura County real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
