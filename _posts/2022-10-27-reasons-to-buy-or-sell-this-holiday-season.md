Should you buy or sell during the holidays? People have been asking us this question often, and we understand why. Conventional wisdom says that the housing market slows down during the holidays, so it will be tough for you to find a good deal. However, is that true? Today we want to share a few reasons why it actually makes perfect sense to make a move during the holidays:

**1\. There’s less competition.** Whether you’re looking to buy or sell, many people will take a step back from the market to spend time with their families.&nbsp;

**2\. Holiday decorations make your home cozier.** Buyers will feel like they can really make your house a home if they can see that holiday touch.

**3\. Your agent can schedule around your plans.** If you have a big family dinner scheduled, don’t worry. We can block showings on that day, so you don’t have to worry about buyers crashing your party.&nbsp;

**4\. Waiting until the spring doesn’t make sense for buyers.** Everyone knows interest rates are trending up, so the longer you wait to purchase a home, the more expensive it will be.&nbsp;

**5\. December is one of our best months for closings.** Many people are surprised by this, but it’s true. There may be fewer buyers or sellers out there, but the ones who are still around are very serious about making a move. Many of them have to close before the new year for personal or financial reasons, so they may be willing to offer you an amazing deal.
