{% include youtube.html %}Today I’m driving to a listing appointment, and I just ran into a friend I’ve known since high school who is also in the real estate business as a house-flipper. She was talking about the challenge she’s been facing in the pursuit of great homes to buy, fix up, and resell. Another friend and client of ours who is in real estate as well as having the same issues.

Given that, I thought today’s blog post would be a great opportunity to share this message:
