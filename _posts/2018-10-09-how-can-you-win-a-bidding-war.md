Because we are in a seller’s market, homebuyers may find themselves scrambling for properties and looking for ways to one-up their competition. While many are willing and able to go well above asking price to get the home they want, there are plenty of other creative strategies that we use to help our buyers get their foot in the door and win the bidding war. **Here are some of our top tips:**

**1. Putting your heart and soul into it.** What if you find out you have access to something that is typically hard to get to and the seller really enjoys that thing? You should use that to your advantage. If you can find some way that you can add value to your offer, such as a gift, that would be a great idea to submit with your offer.

**2. Making a moving gesture.** Moving is a very difficult task and most people don’t look forward to it. If you’re a buyer, rather than upping your offer, it might be a wise idea to look at how much moving would cost for the seller and offer to pay for it. We have found this to be a cheaper and more effective route for our buyers than just upping their offer.

**3. Working with a professional who understands the market.** Our buyer specialists are skilled in this category. When we know supply and demand is tight in a neighborhood, we like to have a quick conversation with the seller’s agent. We get to know what’s important to the seller so we can write a contract that pertains most to the seller’s needs and speaks to them easily.

Doing these small tweaks can really help you save a lot of money and not overbid when you’re competing against other buyers. If you have any questions for us or want any more tips, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
