My family and I were recently at a Chinese restaurant and, as we were waiting for our dinner, we looked at our placemats. These placements had the Chinese zodiac chart on them. I was born in the year of the rooster, while my husband was born in the year of the dragon. This got me thinking of what next year is going to bring.

2017 is going to be the year of the video for the Ask Sarita Team. We are super excited about delivering better content to you, and delivering more of it. Of course, we can always come up with topics on our own, but that’s not what the spirit of the blog is all about.

So, we wanted to ask for your help. Put on your thinking caps and let us know what you’d like to hear about. Comment below, give us a call, or send us an email with your questions. As an added incentive, if we use a topic that you suggest to us, we will send you a gift card in the mail as a thank you. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
