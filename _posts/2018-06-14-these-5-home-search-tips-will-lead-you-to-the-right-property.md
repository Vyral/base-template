When you’re in the market for a new home, there are five important things you must do during your search.

**1. Ask to see the home’s utility report.** This will show you how energy efficient a property is and give you an idea as to what you can expect to pay in monthly utilities.

**2. Review the seller’s disclosure statement.** This is something sellers must provide to you, as they are required by law to disclose any known problems with the property.

**3. Check out the neighborhood’s crime statistics.** If you aren’t familiar with the neighborhood you’re moving into, it’s a good idea to look up this local data online. This will give you an understanding of how safe an area it is.

**4. Determine which school district the home is in.** Buyers with children may find this to be an especially critical factor in their decision.

**5. Ask about neighborhood home values.** Your agent will help make sure that you avoid paying more than you should on a home. If a property you like does happen to be overpriced, this is something your Realtor will make you aware of.
