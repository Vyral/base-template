When potential tenants apply for a property, their income plays a vital role in the screening process. To ensure their ability to comfortably pay the rent, we look for applicants whose income is at least two-and-a-half times the rental amount. This acts as a reliable indicator of their financial stability, reducing the risk of payment issues down the line.

Alongside income verification, we also conduct thorough credit checks on applicants. By doing so, **we gain insight into their financial responsibility and history of managing debts.** This further helps us assess their likelihood of making timely rent payments and maintaining a good tenant-landlord relationship.

As part of our stringent screening process, we also verify the sources of applicants' income. This step ensures that the claimed income is legitimate and steady, reducing the chances of potential income disruptions.

**The importance of conducting these checks cannot be overstated.** A reliable property manager must pay attention to these aspects to safeguard the interests of property owners. By overlooking income and credit verification, one risks facing financial troubles if a tenant encounters difficulties in paying rent.

We take pride in being a property management-only company. Unlike others who may dabble in real estate sales, **our sole focus is on managing properties effectively.** This commitment enables us to allocate our undivided attention to ensuring the best possible outcomes for property owners.
