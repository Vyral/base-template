<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are three signs that you might need to hire an assistant.</em></p>

At some point in your career, you may realize that your business isn’t progressing any further. That might signal to you that it’s time to hire an assistant so you can advance your career. Here are three signs that you’re ready to make this hire:

**1. Your transaction count is hitting a ceiling.** If your transaction count paces between 25 and 40 transactions, you’ve likely hit a ceiling. One of two things will happen at this point: You’re going to lose work/life balance and burn out, or your customer service is going to suffer. If you’re pacing that range, you might want to think about taking the necessary steps to hire an assistant.

**2. Your annual sales volume is between $4 million and $6.5 million**, or your GCI (gross commission income) is $130,000 or more. That will give you the solvency and the margin to be able to afford an assistant.&nbsp;

**3. You’ve put away three to six months of funds for an assistant’s salary.** If you’ve buffered yourself with an emergency account of that much money to pay the person, then you’re definitely ready to hire an assistant. If you don’t have any more transactions or you hit a slow spell for a month or two, it won’t matter as much—you’ll have plenty of margin to pay that person and help them help *you* take your business to the next level.
