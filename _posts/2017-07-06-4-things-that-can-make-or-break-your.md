When you list your home, there are four things that can make or break your sale.

**1. Pricing it right from the beginning**: In a hot market like ours here in the Milford area, many sellers think they can test the market by pricing too high. As things start to cool down in the summer and fall months, though, inventory will rise and you'll want to avoid that mindset and price your home right at market value. The closer the price is to the real value, the more activity you'll get, and you can even get your house into a bidding warâ€”which is ultimately what you want.

**2. Amp up your marketing**: The days of agents or homeowners taking their own marketing photos are long gone. Hire a professional photographer to shoot the home whether it costs $100,000 or $1 million. This is a must because of their ability to get the most out of the lighting, the angles, and the skyline. Many people make real estate decisions based on the photos they see online. Focus on social media as well; Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter should all give your property exposure. It will generate more activity on the home.

**3. Staging**: I don't necessarily mean hiring a stager to advise you, but to instead use what you have and take a decluttering approach. Make sure you remove all the extra stuff and make sure you utilize what's available in each room. You want to stage the property by opening up floor space to showcase square footage. It will not only improve the home's photography, it will help buyers gets a better feel for the space.

**4. Be prepared to receive multiple offers**: Our market has very tight inventory so we're seeing many more multiple offer situations than in the past, so it's important to have a gameplan for it. If it's not handled carefully and professionally, you could squander an amazing opportunity and even lose the offers. This will help you maximize the value of your home.
