I've been getting asked the same questions lately from prospective sellers who had previously listed their home, but failed to sell. **One question is "Will relisting my home affect its overall value?"**

<br>I don't think it does, and here's why. When we relist your home, the "days on market" that shows how long your home has been listed, is reset to 0. So if you had listed your home previously for 100 days and it didn't sell, when we relist it's going to show up like a new listing. Therefore, **most buyers will have no idea that your home previously failed to sell.&nbsp;**

<br>Another question I've been getting a lot is, "**Would my previous list price affect my home's value today**?" It depends. Many sellers improve the condition of their home and that could affect the value positively. The other thing that affects your value is marketing, and if your agent isn't taking the right approach, you won't get as many eyes on the property as you should.

<br>So just because you've listed your home before, **it doesn't mean you are doomed to suffer the consequences**. Your value will not be affected by anything other than what homes are selling for in your area. If you have any questions for us, feel free to reach out to us via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you!
