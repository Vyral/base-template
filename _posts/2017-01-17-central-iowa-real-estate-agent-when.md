There is no “right” time to sell your home; however, there are certain factors you can look at to determine what’s best in your specific situation.

When is the best time to sell your home?

Unfortunately, there’s no straightforward answer to that question. Truthfully (and against a lot of conventional wisdom that suggests a seasonal market), we see homes sell every month of the year in central Iowa.

**In cold weather months, there might not be as many active buyers looking at homes, but the buyers that are out there are far more serious.** This is because they’re usually driven by life events like a job relocation or the birth of a new baby. Hence, as a home seller during these months, you may not get a higher volume of buyers, but you will get a higher quality of buyers.

 Another factor to consider in deciding when to sell your home is your **level of competition.** If you’re deciding between spring, summer, fall, and winter, what will you be up against during those different seasons?

If your house is in a newer neighborhood (e.g., the majority of the homes in the neighborhood were built in the last five to 10 years), one thing you need to be specifically mindful of is **how much construction is happening in that area.** There are some real advantages for a seller in a newer neighborhood when the builders have slowed down because of weather.

When it comes to helping you make the best decision regarding your home sale, we don’t deal in speculation—we strategize based on many different concrete factors. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us. We’re here to help!
