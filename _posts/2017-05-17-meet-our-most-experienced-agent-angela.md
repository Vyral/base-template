Angela Stevens has served the Hatch Homes Group for 10 years and, after Melody and I, is our most experienced team member. She also happens to be our daughter.

 Angela started off as a transaction coordinator before handling the marketing for our listings. She then did a lot of short sale negotiations as the market bottomed out, which educated her about distressed properties. A few years after that, she decided to get her real estate license and become a buyer specialist. This transition helped her focus on working with both buyers and sellers and she feels this is the reason she can net sellers more money on their home sale.

**Angela chose real estate because it allowed her to combine her passion for art and creativity and her passion for entrepreneurship.** She loves the architecture of houses and the design aspect of the real estate business, and this industry fulfills her desire to be a businessperson.

 We’re very proud of Angela and the contributions she’s made to our team. Last year, we made her a partner of Hatch Homes, and now **she’s being appointed team leader.** In this new position, she feels that her experience will enable her to carry on her knowledge and educate the people she interacts with. She looks forward to strengthening her relationship with her team so they can do better and, in turn, help her do better and lead by example.

 If you have any questions or are looking to buy or sell a home in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help.
