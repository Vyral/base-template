Today I’m excited to announce that I’m partnering up with my client Adrienne to host an event.

At this event, we’ll be featuring items from Adrienne’s online eco-fashion store, Faerie’s Dance.

There will also be a doTERRA essential oils representative and a doctor specializing in whole life wellness plans. Many other female entrepreneurs are expected to attend, as well.

There will also be coffee and cakes provided for your enjoyment.

Additionally, there will be a raffle drawing for various prizes every half hour throughout the day.

One prize we’ll be raffling off early in the day will be two tickets to the <a href="http://www.streetofdreamspdx.com/">Street of Dreams.</a>

You won’t want to miss this warehouse sale event, **which will take place Saturday, August 26th from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m..**

The sale will actually be located at an urban farm I sold about five years ago at **12400 SE Crest Drive, Happy Valley, Oregon.**

We hope you see you there.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
