<center>Home listings must look nearly perfect these days in order to sell, so today we&rsquo;ll discuss what sellers can do to list successfully in light of this trend.</center>

&nbsp;

Even in a perfectly ordinary market, buyers tend to expect perfection from the homes they see in person and online. And now that our market has slowed, this trend (which I like to call the “Instagram Effect”) has become even more prevalent. **Unless a property is presented in its best light, then buyers will be quick to assume there is something wrong with it. Alternatively, they might just think it’s overpriced.&nbsp;**

The bottom line is that if you’re thinking of putting your home on the market in the near future, you should start planning upgrades or repairs right now. Even something as simple as decluttering can make a big difference. Beyond that, you’ll also want to work with your agent to put together a competitive pricing strategy.&nbsp;

Only “unicorn” homes (the most sought-after, well-maintained listings available in a given market) can afford to hit the market for an asking price that’s above fair value. In all other cases, you’ll need to price your home at or slightly below fair market value to successfully attract a buyer.&nbsp;

All in all, **don’t hesitate to reach out and ask our team for help on developing a strategy for your specific home selling experience.** We’d be happy to work with you, and also to connect you with other local professionals (like stagers) to make the process go as smoothly as possible.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, please give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
