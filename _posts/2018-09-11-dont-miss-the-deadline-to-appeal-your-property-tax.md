Today I want to share an important reminder about the deadline to appeal your property tax. Salt Lake, Davis, and Weber counties all sent their assessed property value statements out at the end of July, and the deadline to appeal them is September 17. If you haven’t looked at yours yet, we’re seeing more people than ever whose property taxes are inaccurate. I’ve been helping people appeal their taxes for 13 years, and this year I’ve done more appeals than ever. If you’d like to appeal your property tax, I can assist you with that, as well as provide a complimentary tax evaluation. To hear my full message, watch my latest video.
