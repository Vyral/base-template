<p style="text-align:center;"><em>The Caul Group has its very own “Wizard of Oz,” and we’re sitting down for a quick interview with her today.</em></p>

For today’s message, I’m happy to be joined by the one and only Pam Saxman—better known as “The Wizard of Oz” here at The Caul Group.&nbsp;

Pam is our team’s operations manager, and in a somewhat literal sense, she is the “woman behind the curtain.” &nbsp;

Pam has also been described by members on our team as “the fixer” because she has a highly active role in ensuring all of our systems are in place and that we’re delivering first-rate customer service to all of our clients.&nbsp;

We’re on pace to do 300 transactions by the end of the year, and Pam is integral to keeping the process moving at every turn without any interruption to the customer’s positive experience. Despite the hiccups that inevitably occur with some transactions, Pam is there to help our clients reach the finish line when it comes to their buying or selling needs. &nbsp;

One fun fact about Pam is that, at one time, she served as a pharmaceutical sales rep and manager, and her family would joke that she was a professional “drug dealer.” After doing that for 17 years, she made the switch to real estate and the rest is history. She’s also quite a musician—she played the violin for 14 years\! &nbsp;

I thank Pam for taking time out of her day to sit down with me and giving some insight into her role on our team. If you have any questions for either of us about your real estate needs, please don’t hesitate to reach out. We’d love to help you\!
