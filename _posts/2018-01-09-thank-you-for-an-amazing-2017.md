In 2017, we helped 110 families buy a home, sell a home, or invest in real estate, and today we want to thank you for helping us do that.

Our goal for 2018 is to help 250 families, and we look forward to your continued support and trust. As a thank you to our clients, we recently threw a wonderful Christmas party, and due to the overwhelming support for that event, we’ve decided to throw more special events throughout the year. These will be free events for our community as a way for us to continually say thank you, so keep an eye on your email inbox.

We also want to remind you that we host training classes for agents every month, and our community is invited to those training classes as well. We have two classes coming up in January, and one of those classes we think you’ll find very beneficial. It’s about real estate investment, and it will be held here at our office on January 21 at 1:30 p.m.

**To RSVP, just reply to this email or give us a phone call.**

If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help you.
