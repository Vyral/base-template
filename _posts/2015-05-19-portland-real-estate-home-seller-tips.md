Now is the time to list your home for sale in Portland, so I wanted to speak about some common mistakes that people make when staging their homes. I'll discuss four mistakes in this video, and then there will be another follow-up video where I will discuss four more mistakes being made.


1. Being too personal. You don't want people to walk into a room and be able to identify the type of person living in it.

2. Pack away your personal items. You don't want your potential buyers distracted by photos and other belongings of yours. Your home should stand out to them, not your collection of sports memorabilia.

3. Don't paint with dark colors. Darker colors make rooms feel smaller, and we always suggest colors that are light and bright. Earth tones seem to be popular right now, and they tend to be more inviting colors for buyers.

4. Not taking advantage of natural light. You want every window of your house open and light shining in. Buyers like to see homes that are well-lit, and opening up your windows and letting the light come inside is a very simple and easy way to improve the look and feel of your home. A lot of buyers want nice natural lighting in their home.

Hopefully, these tips have been helpful if you plan on buying or selling this summer. We'll be coming back in a few weeks with tips 5-8.

Thanks for watching, and stay tuned!
