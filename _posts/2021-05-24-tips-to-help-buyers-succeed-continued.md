In previous videos, I’ve shared buyer tips on how to interact with lenders, but today I’ll share two more tidbits specifically about financing with the goal of helping your homebuyers find success in this crazy market.

First, if you want to give your buyers the best chance of winning, **get a fully digitally underwritten pre-approval letter**, not a pre-qualification. In sellers’ eyes, that is as good as cash.

Next, if your buyers need to ask for closing costs from the sellers (which might seem unfathomable in this market), **talk with their lender to see if they can do premium pricing**. That’s where they take the closing costs the buyer would have paid and roll them into the loan. Not asking the seller for additional items makes writing a winning offer much more feasible.

If you’d like more tips to help buyers win in today’s market or you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.
