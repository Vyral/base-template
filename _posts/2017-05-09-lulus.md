I’m here today to talk to you about one of my favorite places in the area that you may not know about. We're visiting today, and I’m excited to show you around.

This is [Lulu’s,](http://www.lulubuffett.com/destin/) a restaurant in Destin right by the Mid-Bay Bridge. They have a big outdoor beach, lots of great seating, and all kinds of activities and events for kids. It has beautiful views of the ocean with both outdoor and indoor seating.

If you have any questions for me about Lulu's or about real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
