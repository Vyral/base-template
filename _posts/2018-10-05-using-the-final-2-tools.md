I recently held a webinar for part seven of Real Estate: The Fundamentals that I would like to share with you. These recent weeks have been a lot of fun for me, personally, because it has given me the opportunity to reanalyze how the fundamentals are being run on my own team.

**I have timestamped the conversation to make it easier for you to jump to the sections most interesting to you.**

1:20 – A quick recap of the career growth initiative tools.

2:50 – An overview of the last two tools: The Agent Language of Real Estate (LORE) and the Local Expert.

4:55 – What should you compare your business against?

6:20 – How the LORE and Local Expert tools work together.

7:50 – Where you find the LORE report on kwconnect.com.

8:50 – What the LORE spreadsheet looks like and how we use it.

10:20 – Where the numbers are coming from and how they get compared.

11:40 – Where the story starts showing up.

12:45 – Why does the data tell this particular story?

13:15 – Comparing your business to your board, market center, region, and KWRI.

13:50 – Developing your value statements and choosing the right ones.

17:00 – What you do with your value statements after you have them.

17:30 – How we compare each category and why.

18:55 – Tell the story with the Local Expert tool.

20:05 – Why this tool is cool and where you can use it.

21:20 – The benefits of adding a video to your flier.

23:20 – Why you need to do this for yourself.

25:35 – What is coming up.

If you have any additional questions about this, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
