<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In today’s market update, I have some interesting facts to share with you regarding the first half of this market year.</em></p>

With half of 2019 gone, let’s take a moment in today’s market update to look back on the numbers we saw from the first half, sorted by area.

The overall number of sales for both residential and vacant land in Flathead and Lake County combined totaled a little over 4,600. This is a 7% decrease from last year when there were 4,900 sales. This doesn’t appear to indicate a market turnaround since the sales prices we’re seeing are a little bit higher.

**To see the numbers for specific areas and to find out what might be impacting them, refer to the video above. You can use the timestamps I’ve provided below to help you navigate the conversation at your leisure:**

1:23—Flathead Lake home sales

2:33—Flathead Lake vacant land sales

3:16—Flathead Lake condo sales

4:19—Swan Lake home and vacant land sales

4:57—Echo Lake, Lake of the Woods, and Lake Blaine home/land sales

6:24—The “West Lakes” home and land sales: Ashley Lake, Bitterroot Lake, and McGregor Lake
