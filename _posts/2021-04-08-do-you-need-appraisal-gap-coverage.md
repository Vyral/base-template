I took a look at our MLS recently, and we had just 485 single-family homes and 220 condos available for purchase. In this competitive market, a lot of times there are multiple-offer situations where you’re competing against multiple buyers.&nbsp;

Appraisal gap coverage is important in this kind of market. Let’s say a property is listed for $100,000 and you make an offer of $115,000. According to the standard contract, there is a clause that the property has to appraise for the contract price. **In appraisal gap coverage, you agree to pay above and beyond the appraisal price if the home doesn’t appraise.**

Now let’s say the appraisal comes in at $102,000. You’re now on the hook for the additional $13,000 up to the contract price. Often these are the types of offers that are winning.&nbsp;

If you have questions for me about buying a home, appraisal gap coverage, or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
