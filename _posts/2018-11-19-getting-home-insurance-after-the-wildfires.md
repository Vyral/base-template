<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Can you renew or get home insurance on your property after all these fires? Robert Feldman from Allstate is here to explain your options.</em></p>

Today, Robert Feldman from Allstate is here to talk about insurance. A lot of our clients have not been able to renew insurance due to all the fires.&nbsp;

“Due to the fires of last year, it’s the worse I’ve seen it in 20 years,” says Robert. “Multiple insurance carriers are not renewing clients due to the fires, so it’s a bad scene right now. The key thing is to **know your fire scores.**”&nbsp;

If your property is on a hillside or you can see wild brush from your property, it’s especially important to know your fire score.&nbsp;

There are opportunities out there. One of the biggest myths out there is that insurers will nominate clients with the California Fair Plan as a last resort. However, Robert represents Allstate and says there are a lot of carriers who will write in the fire zone areas.

We’ve had a few cases where we’re getting ready to close escrow only to discover that the buyer cannot get insurance because of the fire scores. It’s important to get that information early in the process, as **there are a few insurances companies who are not insuring based on the fire score.**

If you are interested in a fire score, you can email Robert at [RobertFeldman@Allstate.com](mailto:RobertFeldman@Allstate.com){: target="_blank"} or call 888-983-6400 (Robert recommends sending an email). I would like to thank Robert for joining me today. If you have any other real estate questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would be happy to help you.
