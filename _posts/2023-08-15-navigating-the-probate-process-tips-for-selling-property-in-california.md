Dealing with probate properties can be a complex task, especially in California. We have assisted numerous homeowners and family members in navigating the probate property sale process. If you're wondering about the ins and outs of selling a probate property, you've come to the right place. Let's delve into the key aspects you need to know.

**The intricacies of probate sales often catch individuals off guard.** Some families mistakenly believe that their property is protected by a trust, only to discover that it's not. A property may have been inadvertently removed from a trust during a refinancing process. Even possessing a will doesn't guarantee avoiding the probate process. If a property isn't part of a trust, it's likely to undergo probate proceedings.

When a property enters probate, certain steps come into play. First, a petition is submitted to the court to appoint an estate administrator. This individual gains the authority to make decisions on behalf of the estate, ensuring they act prudently and in the estate's best interests. This fiduciary role involves making business decisions, rather than emotional ones, to protect beneficiaries' interests.

When a probate property is put on the market, there are distinct variations compared to a regular sale. Notably, the administrator is not required to provide traditional homeowner disclosures. Additionally, once an offer is accepted and contingencies are removed, a "notice of proposed action" is triggered. This step involves informing beneficiaries about the terms of the offer. If no objections arise, the sale progresses toward closing.

The "notice of proposed action" is a pivotal stage in a probate property sale. Once the buyer completes inspections and lifts contingencies, an attorney sends out this notice to beneficiaries. It outlines the offer's terms and conditions. If no beneficiaries object within a specified time frame, the sale continues its course. However, objections could lead to court involvement.

**A probate property sale might require a bit more time than a conventional sale due to certain procedural steps.** After the "notice of proposed action" period, the sale , typically proceeds smoothly if all beneficiaries are aligned. However, the additional procedural steps can elongate the process in comparison to a standard sale.
