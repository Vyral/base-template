Are you a homebuyer who got rejected for a mortgage in the recent past because the mortgage stress test was too high? I have good news to share with you.

BMO and other banks have recently introduced an ultra-low, variable-rate mortgage product of 2.45% while increasing rates on fixed products. The current mortgage stress test requires you to qualify for a mortgage with a contract rate plus 2%, so **I suggest you reapply for a mortgage with a variable mortgage rate in mind.**

This will make your qualification rate 4.4% or 4.5% versus a five-year benchmark rate of 5.34%. In real terms, this is a mortgage approval difference of between $35,000 and $50,000, depending on your expenses and income.

**If you can’t qualify for a mortgage with just income, keep shopping and do not give up.** Banks want your business, and they will bend over backward to get something done for you. I have spoken to a few mortgage brokers, and they have mentioned that some mortgage products are available for certain banks, while other are not.

For example, Scotiabank is really good for qualifying non-resident and new immigrant programs, while National Bank is good if you already own a home and are thinking about upgrading.
