The Tucson real estate market is back on track after a strange spring.

We just had our sixth consecutive week of record sales in Tucson. **For four of the last six weeks, we’ve seen more business than we did before the pandemic.**

Our market is recovering quickly as shelter-in-place orders have expired. Typically, the spring is the strongest market of the year, but **our numbers indicate that the summer market of 2020 is the new spring market.&nbsp;**

Inventory and interest rates are low, so be ready for some competitions if you’re a buyer. If you’re a seller, you can take advantage of this fact and get top dollar for your home.

If you have any questions for me about buying or selling a home or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
