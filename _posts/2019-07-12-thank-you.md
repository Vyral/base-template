Today we’d like to extend a huge thank you to all of our past clients who brought family and friends to our recent client appreciation event. A few weeks ago, 180 of you shared the experience of enjoying Toy Story 4, and the smell of popcorn and time with friends brought back special memories for us. We hope you enjoyed being there as much as we did. Our next family event is going to be this fall, so keep an eye out for a “save-the-date” reminder in your inbox\!
