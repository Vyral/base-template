If you’re interested in making some extra money through real estate investing, or simply how to have your mother-in-law (legally) live with you, then having an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) on your property may be the perfect solution.

**ADUs, which can be attached or detached, allow one additional family to reside on your lot**. This can be a wonderful option for those with elderly parents moving in or if you have adult children coming back to live with you temporarily.

If you so choose, you can charge rent for those living in your ADU, as we mentioned earlier. So, in the light of recent legislation pertaining to this subject, our team would be happy to assist if you are curious about how to pursue this option.
