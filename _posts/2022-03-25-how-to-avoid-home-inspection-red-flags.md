When a buyer has a home inspection done, sometimes red flags pop up in their minds when an issue is found. Before you put your home on the market, **take a look around and make any repairs or improvements to things the buyer may see as red flags.&nbsp;**

I highly encourage you to check your windows. Are the seals solid, are the panes cloudy? Those are two things you should fix before your home goes on the market; buyers will see those as red flags. Another problem may be the furnace. If you have an older furnace, you should have it serviced by a local HVAC professional, and have them put a sticker on your furnace that says it’s in good working order and they didn’t find any issues.

The next thing to look for is moisture in your house, especially in the corners of the basement. Take a look at your gutters to make sure they aren’t the cause of moisture collecting in the basement. Make sure there’s no moisture on the bedroom ceilings; moisture stains can mean a potential water leak. If you find moisture in your home or a black substance anywhere, it could be mold. **Any moisture will make buyers uneasy.**

My last tip today is to examine your home for peeling paint—another red flag to many buyers. Double-checking for these things in your house will save you a lot of headaches, time, and effort. Any of these problems may prevent the transaction from moving forward.

These are just some of the issues to check for in your house. If you have any questions or concerns about possible home inspection issues on your property, reach out to me via phone or email. I would love to help you.
