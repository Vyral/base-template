Are you, or is someone you know, thinking about selling a home soon? Here are a few things that you’ll need to know.

On the September edition of my podcast with Van and Bonnie, we talked about some of the finer points of home selling including supply and demand, communication, and the three most important things you need to know as a seller.

**Here’s an outline of our discussion, with timestamps, so that you can skip around to the section(s) that interest you the most:**
