The weather and real estate market are both heating up right now in Clarksville. The question I’m hearing the most often is, “Is it a good time to sell?” My answer is pretty simple:&nbsp;**If you could choose the perfect time to sell your home, this is that market.&nbsp;**

Houses are selling quickly, sometimes with multiple offers. As long as a home is in good condition and priced appropriately, it’s selling fast and for top dollar. I’m an expert at both of those things. I can help you come up with a perfect plan. Interest rates are below 3% right now, which is keeping buyer demand high.&nbsp;

We can have a consultation to discuss your goals and what we can do to help you reach them. If you’d like one or if you have any other real estate questions for us, please reach out via phone or email today. We would love to hear from you.
