When our team notices a pest problem in a property under our care, this immediately indicates two things:

The unit wasn’t properly cleaned

It’s time to call a professional pest controller

No tenant wants to pay rent on a property that has a pest problem, so any such issues must be resolved immediately.

{% include pullquote.html %}

When we identify a pest problem within the first 10 days following our initial walkthrough, we ask that the owner handles the initial treatment. If a problem arises at any point after this window, though, the tenant is responsible.

We recommend contacting a local pest professional if you have any additional questions about pest control.

As always, if you have any questions for us or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
