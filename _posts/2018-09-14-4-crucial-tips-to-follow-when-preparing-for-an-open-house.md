Open houses are a great way to gain exposure for your listing, but knowing how to prepare for one may feel daunting for some. This is why, today, we’ll be sharing a few simple tips on getting ready for an open house.

**The first step is to declutter and depersonalize the prop****erty**. Buyers want to see a clean slate, as this will help them visualize themselves living in the home.

Once you’ve cleaned things up, the second thing you must do is make sure to **remove your pets (and any signs of them) during the open house**. Those of us with pets may love them dearly, but buyers with allergies may not be so fond.

And it isn’t only your pets who should be out of the property during an open house—you and your family should do the same. Buyers may feel hesitant about speaking their minds if they know the property’s owners are listening in as they tour the home. The last thing you want to do is distract potential buyers.

Finally, make sure your landscaping is in order. **Working on curb appeal is a surefire way to attract more buyers into your home.** After all, first impressions are key.
