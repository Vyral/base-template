We all know agents who have made a terrific living in this business, but paid a terrible price to get there. Whether that price was declining physical health, strained personal relationships, or something else, this story is all too familiar.&nbsp;

But it doesn’t have to be this way. **Today I’d like to share a few tips on how to build a healthy business without sacrificing the other important things in your life.&nbsp;**

At Abby Realty, we understand that our clients have needs seven days a week—and we want to be there to meet those needs whenever they arise. We want to answer every phone call, respond to every email, and reply to every text message as soon as we receive them, but the truth is that this isn’t always feasible. Being available 24/7 isn’t something a person can realistically maintain over the course of their career.&nbsp;

**If you are starting, or restarting, your real estate career, the first step to your future success is to set boundaries within your own mind.** Identify the things that matter most in your life, and then promise yourself that you will not sacrifice or jeopardize these things for the sake of your business.&nbsp;

**Once you’ve done this, you need to set expectations for your clients.** Be honest with them about your schedule and priorities. If Tuesday night is the evening you go out with your spouse, tell them that. Don’t completely overturn your personal life for the sake of pleasing your client. Instead, be forthcoming about your availability. If you are going to be unavailable for a few hours, or for an entire evening, let them know that in advance. Tell them you’ll be away and why, and let them know when they can expect to hear from you next. Transparency is essential.&nbsp;

Your clients know you are a human being. In fact, in my experience, I’ve found that clients will generally respect you more if they recognize that you’re capable of setting boundaries.&nbsp;

But what if you need more time away than just a few hours? What if you plan to take a weekend, or, can you imagine, a whole week off? If this is the case, **the best thing to do is to find someone within your team who you can trust to cover for you.** Also, be sure to offer to reciprocate by covering for them in the future.&nbsp;

The bottom line is this: While your career may play a massive role in your life, it shouldn’t overshadow everything else that matters to you. Striking a balance is key.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
