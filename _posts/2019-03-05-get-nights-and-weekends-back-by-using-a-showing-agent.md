You can welcome back your nights and weekends with the help of a showing agent. Here’s how.

In the early days of my real estate career, I had to do everything: show houses, list houses, take photos, and much more. It was hard work, but I learned that bringing others onto my team was a great way to ease the burden. By implementing this kind of collaboration into your own career, you can ease your workload, too. **One of the roles that helps my team immensely is that of the showing agent.**

There are a few key elements in any sales process. **In real estate and most industries, there is:**

* Client prospecting—this reveals how customers hear about and get in contact with us
* Conversion—this solidifies trust with customers
* Service—this includes finding and showing potential homes.&nbsp;
* Negotiation—this solidifies the contract
* Contract to close—this continues all the way to settlement

We need to spend a lot of time on the search and service portions, and **while we do enjoy showing homes, it’s one of the most time-consuming parts of our job.** Showing someone through a home should require a real estate license, but it doesn’t always need to be done by the client’s primary agent.&nbsp;

Since we always explain our process up front, we haven’t encountered any problems with our buyers. We simply let them know that we work as a group in order to make our services available to clients but also allow ourselves some nights and weekends off. **We introduce them to the showing agent and let them know that we’re still always there to help.**

If you have any questions about utilizing a showing agent position, would like any guidance about the role, or would like further information, feel free to reach out to us. We also host a business mastermind meeting each month, and you’re always more than welcome to come. In the meantime, we look forward to hearing from you soon.
