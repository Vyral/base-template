Your buying power changes from time to time due to changing factors within our market. Sometimes you can afford more, and other times you cannot. **But what determines these things?**

<br>1. &nbsp;**Credit Score:** This one is obvious. Your FICO or credit score maxes out at 850 points, but if you have a score in the 650-850 range, you can still get a good interest rate.<br>2. &nbsp;**Down Payment:** Some loan programs don’t require any down payment (VA, USDA), and some programs require up to 20% (most conventional loans). The more you can put down, the better you look in the eyes of a seller.<br>3. &nbsp;**Your Debt-to-Income Ratio:**This is calculated by your outgoing expenses versus your monthly gross income. Student loans, car loans, credit card payments, car payments, rent, and other payments will be added up to make sure they do not exceed 28% to 36% of your total income. Lenders will be hesitant to give you a mortgage loan if these payments are making up a more significant portion of your expenses.<br>4. &nbsp;**Your Assets:** These could include bank accounts, stocks and bonds, properties, and more. The lender wants to make sure that you have a minimum of six months reserve money for making payments.
