<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Many people are concerned about decreasing home values. Today I’m sharing what you need to know about that.</em></p>

Are St. George and Southern Utah home prices falling due to the pandemic?&nbsp;

Clearly, I’m working from home (as many others are), so I’m dressed comfortably for this video. We’re essentially running our entire business virtually right now. **People are concerned that home prices are decreasing,** and it makes sense; cities are shut down, people are losing jobs, 300 thousand people are out of work in Las Vegas alone.&nbsp;

However, a recession does not equal a housing crisis. Home prices have actually appreciated during three out of the last five recessions, in 2001 values increased by 6.6%\! The difference is that we had a housing collapse in the United States in 2008; home values decreased by 19.7%.&nbsp;

Home prices are not currently falling in Washington County, primarily because we have an amazingly low supply of housing. In Washington County, during the crash of 2008 there were a colossal 8.5 months of inventory, and today we only have 3.5 months’ worth. Your home value may decrease eventually; generally, it takes eight to 12 months after a recession for home prices to be affected.

**We’re not in a housing or economic collapse,** the economy has been damaged because we’re undergoing lockdown. Hopefully, as soon as the pandemic is over, our economy will begin to recover.&nbsp;
