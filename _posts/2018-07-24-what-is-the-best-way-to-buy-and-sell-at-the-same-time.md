Should you buy or sell first? This is a common question asked by sellers when they have to sell their home and also purchase a new one.

The first thing you will want to do is look at your finances and get pre-qualified. You need to talk to a lender who can tell you whether you qualify for one of the following three options: You can buy first and then sell, sell first and then buy, or simultaneously buy and sell. Each one has its advantages and disadvantages.

If you qualify to buy a new home before you sell your current home, you should know that after you purchase your new home, **you will have to carry two mortgages.** You need to make sure that you feel comfortable doing this. Also, you will now know exactly how much equity you are going to get out of your current home.

Meanwhile, **an advantage of selling first is that you do not have to worry about a home sale contingency.** This puts you in much stronger negotiating position as a buyer because it is one less contingency the seller has to worry about.

If you decide to sell first and then buy, this obviously puts you in a great position because **you know exactly how much equity you are getting from your home.** This can give you stronger negotiating power when buying because you are already going to have the cash in your pocket. However, you will have to make arrangements for short-term living. This may mean that you will have to stay with friends or relatives, or even get a short-term rental in the meantime.

The most common route that sellers take is to buy and sell simultaneously. Once you find a home and it goes under contract, you then have what is called a home settlement contingency. This means that the home you are buying is contingent upon the settlement of your current home.

In this case, **you will know exactly how much equity you will get out of your current home as well as the closing costs and what money they are carrying forward.** However, it can be a very stressful day when you are trying to settle your current home in the morning and then settle on your new property in the afternoon. A recommendation I make for that is that you wait a day in between selling and buying and stay in a hotel or a friend's house overnight and keep everything in a moving truck overnight.

If you have any additional questions about this or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
