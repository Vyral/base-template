Preparing your home for sale is a process, but it doesn’t have to be a complicated one. Here’s what we recommend for home sellers.

People ask me all the time about what they need to do to prepare their home for sale on the market. **Here are four things I would focus on if I was getting ready to list my home:**

**1. Decluttering.** I walk into homes all the time that are cluttered. When you have lived in a place for a while (or you have kids), this happens. When you get ready to sell, however, you should do all you can to declutter your rooms and get all the little items and knick knacks out. If you can stack things neatly in a spare unfinished room or a garage, that’s great. You could also invest in a storage pod or storage locker while you show it.

**2. Flooring.** This is another area to really focus in on. It’s one of the first things potential buyers will take note of. If your flooring is outdated or damaged, it makes the rest of the house look bad. You don’t have to have brand-new flooring or high-end carpet, but giving everything a deep, professional cleaning will pay dividends in the end.

**3. Paint.** Fresh paint goes a long way. Not only does it make the house smell fresh and clean, it makes it look that way too. Scuffed white trim looks awful. A fresh coat of paint will have a big impact, especially on those high-traffic areas. Get rid of those fingerprints on the walls, too. Fresh paint has a big impact on showability and value.

**4. A deep cleaning.** This isn’t just a tidying up of the house we are talking about. You may even want to hire a cleaning company to come in and do an extensive, deep cleaning. There are many areas of your home that are often neglected that will really stand out if they are sparkling clean, like your windows, walls, appliances, cabinets, and baseboards..
