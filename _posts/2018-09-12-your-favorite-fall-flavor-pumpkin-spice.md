Labor Day has come and gone and you know what that meansâ€”Pumpkin spice everything! It's the favorite fall flavor and has found its way into lots of delicious foods. But, do you know where to get your pumpkin fix in the Baltimore area?

Baltimore has many plenty of great options when it comes to adding this fall favorite to your diet. You can find everything from beer to baked goods. Here are four of my favorite pumpkin-flavored products:

**1. Heavy Seas Beer.** Located just southwest of the city in Halethorpe, Heavy Seas Beer produces seasonal beer every few months. Harvest time's flavor is, of course, the pumpkin. This amazing beer also has notes of cinnamon, bourbon, allspice, ginger, cloves, and vanilla to consume your taste buds.

**2. Michele's Granola.** Michele's, which is located in Timonium, bakes delicious granola items with a broad variety of flavors and mixtures. This time of year, though, you need the flavor of fall found in their pumpkin spice granola that eats like trail mix straight from the bag.

**3. Flavor Cupcakery & Bake Shop**. They use local ingredients to bake their confections from scratch at this Bel Air bake shop. They are a true and delicious act of love which helped them win season 4 of Cupcake Wars. You should try the pumpkin, pumpkin cr&egrave;me br&ucirc;l&eacute;e, pumpkin pie, pumpkin smores, and pumpkin spice latte flavors that all have the light, smooth frosting you hope for as well as the autumn flavor you love.

**4. Walther Gardens**. The snowball shack, which has a delicious pumpkin spice snowball, uses a French line of specialty syrups that features fall flavors such as cinnamon spice, candy apple, and of course, pumpkin spice. Don't forget Baltimore's trademark marshmallow when you sample one of the seasonal snowballs while picking out your perfect pumpkin. Christmas trees will also go on sale later this fall.
