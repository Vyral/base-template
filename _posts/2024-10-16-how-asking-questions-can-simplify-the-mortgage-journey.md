Are you feeling unsure about diving into the mortgage process because you think your questions might sound silly? Let me explain why no question is too small and how asking the right ones can set you up for success. Here are three reasons why asking questions could be the most important thing you do when applying for a mortgage:

**No question is a dumb question.** As someone who’s been in the mortgage industry since 2001, I’ve heard it all. One of the most common things I hear from clients is, “I have a stupid question.” Let me stop you right there. There’s no such thing as a stupid question when it comes to making a major financial decision like buying a home. Whether you’re confused about interest rates, down payments, or loan terms, every question you have is valid. After all, this isn’t something most people do every day, and it’s my job to make sure you understand every part of the process.

**The mortgage industry has changed.** Since COVID-19, the mortgage industry has gone digital. Virtual meetings, apps, and online forms have replaced the traditional face-to-face interactions. While this can seem more convenient, it has created a distance between lenders and borrowers. At Envoy Mortgage, we believe in keeping that personal touch alive. You deserve a lender who takes the time to sit down with you, answer your questions, and make sure you’re comfortable before diving into the paperwork. The process shouldn’t start with filling out forms—it should start with a conversation.

**Vulnerability is part of the process.** Let’s face it—applying for a mortgage means sharing a lot of personal information. You’re handing over your Social Security number, financial details, and more. It can feel intimidating, and that’s why it’s important to work with someone who values your trust and respects your vulnerability. At Envoy Mortgage, we focus on making the process as comfortable as possible. Whether you’re buying your first home, relocating to a new state, or investing in a second property, we’ve got you covered. We’re local, based right here in Pleasant Hill, Iowa, but licensed in multiple states, so wherever life takes you, we can help.
