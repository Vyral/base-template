What exactly is a short sale?

A short sale occurs when someone owes more on their mortgage than the sale of the property would net. As long as a lender approves the short sale, in lieu of foreclosure, the seller can list the property short of the amount it would take to pay off the loan.

**The two kinds of short sales are those with recourse and those without.** If there is recourse, the lender will agree to the short sale, but will collect the difference over a period of time. This is not the ideal option.

The best kind of short sale is one wherein the lender has agreed to accept a certain amount of money up front. Let’s say you owe $180,000 on your home but the sale of your property is only going to net $155,000. In a short sale without recourse, the lender will accept the $155,000 under the condition that the seller receives nothing.&nbsp;

**From the buyer’s perspective, short sale properties can sometimes be a very good deal.** However, the process of purchasing a short sale can take a long time. It can take between six to 12 months, or even longer.&nbsp;

Short sales are particularly good if you are buying the property as an investment.&nbsp;

But whether you are purchasing a short sale property or listing one, make sure you are working with an agent who has experience with this kind of transaction.
