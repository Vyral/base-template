Today I want to tell you a little bit about myself, which is never an easy thing to do. However, I can tell you that I sell real estate, and I’ve done so here in Carlisle, Pennsylvania since the early 2000s.

Even after all that time, **I still absolutely love this job.** Being born and raised here in Central PA, I’ve chosen to live my life and raise my family right here in Carlisle. Fully knowing my area and living in it helps me to be a **dedicated and successful real estate agent.**

{% include pullquote.html %}

Why is that? It’s because I truly love my job and and **helping people succeed with all their real estate dreams.**

I’m Heather Neidlinger, and my team and I would love to work with you.

If you have any questions or want to hear more about what my team and I can do for you, please feel free to give us a call or send an email. We would be happy to help you!
