Where have all the leads gone in this shifting market? A lot of people in the industry are disillusioned right now, especially if they didn’t experience the market in 2007 and 2008. The market can make agents feel isolated, uncertain, and anxious, especially if they don’t have the right resources. If you’re feeling that way, know that you can turn things around, and I am here with some insight to help you with that.&nbsp;

In the last couple of years, the industry has been moving at a very fast pace. It felt like there was a lot of business out there, but that’s not true anymore. **In his book “Shift,” Gary Keller addresses this very thing that happens in every economic cycle.** In the previous market, where there was high demand, you might have needed to talk to about 100 people to find 15 who would buy or sell this year, and about four of them would work with you. In a shifting market, if you talk to the same number of people, you may only find 10 or so who will buy or sell a home, and two might be convinced to work with you. The reality is that the numbers have changed.

**{% include pullquote.html %}**

A couple of years ago, there were about 6.1 million homes sold in the United States. In the economy we're in now, about 4.8 to 5 million homes have been sold. This is more proof that the statistics have changed. **To get the same results you did in the previous market, you need to either talk to more people or you have to convince more people to use you to solve their housing problem instead of another agent.**
