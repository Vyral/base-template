The holiday season is finally here, and the weather here in Tucson has been wonderful. This is the time of year when a lot of people start wondering whether they should wait until the beginning of the year to list, or if they should put their home on the market now.

In the next week or two, we will be seeing a lot of visitors coming to our area for the holidays. Homes are going to sell in this time frame and if yours isn’t on the market, you won’t be able to capture those buyers.

Many people do wait until after the holidays to list their homes. January is the #1 month in Tucson for new listings on the market. It can be very easy for your home to get lost in the shuffle when there are over 1,000 homes coming on the market. Listing it now means your home will sell faster and stand out more to buyers.

The people that are out looking for a home to purchase during the holidays are usually highly motivated buyers, otherwise they wouldn’t be out looking until all the homes come on the market in January.

If you have any questions for us at all, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to speaking with you!
