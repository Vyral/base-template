No matter which side of a real estate transaction you find yourself on, you don’t want to make more sacrifices than necessary. After months of searching for the perfect property or preparing your own for sale, it’s a major relief for both parties when negotiations are complete. Yet the potential for some last-minute negotiations remains on the table until closing is complete. 

Here are a few things every homebuyer and seller should realize about these final negotiations: 

First, **buyers may ask the seller to provide credits based on the results of an inspection.** Also, while general inspections are commonplace in any deal, buyers may choose to order additional, specialized inspections if the issues they’ve discovered warrant such measures. Since inspections can uncover details about a property the buyer couldn’t have known at the time they first negotiated the terms of the contract, they may want to renegotiate at this point in the deal.

To avoid this, sellers can have their property inspected prior to listing. This allows them to identify and address any issues that may have otherwise given rise to additional negotiations with their future buyer. It’s important to be upfront about known issues.

Sellers who are certain that their property is in great shape, though, may choose to ask for their home to be sold as is. This is not necessarily something that can be strictly enforced, but including this stipulation in a contract can help sellers to discourage buyers from excessive negotiations. 

If repairs are necessary, **one way sellers can safeguard against giving out credits is by paying contractors directly.** Buyers may sometimes overstate the cost of repairs or ask for credit simply to offset the cost of the home purchase without any intention of going through with home repairs. 

**Sometimes, buyers begin to feel emboldened as closing draws near.** They try to use negotiations to save a few extra dollars, believing that the seller wouldn’t possibly go back to the drawing board at this point in the transaction. However, this is not always a safe assumption. Especially in a strong market, sellers may have no issues looking for a new buyer if their current deal doesn’t seem quite fair.
