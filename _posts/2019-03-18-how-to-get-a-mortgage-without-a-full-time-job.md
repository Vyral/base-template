Nowadays, more and more people are freelancing, working multiple part-time jobs, and even working from home. When it’s time to purchase a home, however, it may seem impossible to do so while maintaining a flexible work lifestyle. **Fortunately, there are three simple ways to ensure your home buying dreams can still come true:**

**1. Organize relevant documents.** Gather your bank statements, pay stubs, proof of employment, and references. Getting your life on paper is key to getting approval from your mortgage lender.

**2. Explain what you do.** What is it you actually do for a living? Be prepared to explain this to your lender; help them understand you’re worth investing in. Lenders like stability and reliability. Even if you’ve found yourself hopping between jobs, at least show them that you’re sticking with the same industry or using a consistent skill set.

**3. Keep your debt low.** The deeper in debt you are, the worse you look. Why would a lender owe you money when you already owe a lot to others? By paying off your debt and keeping it at a low level, you’ll find your credit score will rise. These two things will work together to help you get your mortgage approved.

Taxes, debt, and credit scores can seem daunting, but we’re here to help you throughout every step of the home buying process. If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
