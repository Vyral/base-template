Recently, I received questions from a lot of people, so today we’re going to answer those in a quick Q&A session.

**Q: How do I make an offer?**

<br>A: In the state of Wisconsin, you would use a state-approved offer to purchase form. There’s usually an addendum that goes with it, and an attorney or a real estate agent can help you draft it. It’s possible to do it on your own, but there are a lot of contingencies and other items that you would want to be educated about before you try it alone.

**Q: How many homes should I consider before choosing one?**

<br>A: The answer here is subjective. It depends on the type of home you want, and how many homes are available. If your offer on a house that you love is accepted, you’re probably not going to be looking at too many homes. However there are situations that may warrant looking at several homes, sometimes as many as 20. Searching for the right home is a process, not an event.

**Q: How does purchasing a home compare with renting?**

<br>A: I always tell people that a house is essentially a bank account. Why not live in a place that you love and pay your own mortgage instead of your landlord’s? One thing to consider is a “stress test,” where you make sure that your house would be worth enough in a market that’s inferior, so you can sell it in the future. Nine times out of 10, owning a home is going to be way more beneficial than renting.

**Q: Is it worth getting a home warranty when I’m buying a house?**

A: If there are old appliances that may need to be replaced, then yes, and hopefully you can get that paid for by the seller. If everything is new in the house, it’s probably less important, because the chances of those appliances failing are much lower.

If you have any other questions, please keep posting them, and I’ll be happy to answer them for you.
