Today, I’d like to talk about a couple of things.

First, I want to make you aware of a great new construction listing that I’ve got on the market. Listed at $599,000, this property is ready to go.

Next, I want to talk about a common question my team and I get, which is: **“What’s the deal with the ‘We Pay Cash for Houses’ signs?”**

Well, these signs are actually designed to target financially-distressed sellers. Owners who are trying to sell trashed or damaged homes, who are evicting tenants, who are experiencing a divorce, or are otherwise experiencing financial hardship are the demographic for whom these signs are intended.

So, how do these firms pay? We used to refer to these firms as equity purchase companies (or EPs). **The strategy of a cash-for-home company is to negotiate the lowest price possible for your home.**

Realize that these companies are here to take over bad situations, and are not for conventional homes. Unless you are truly desperate, stick with a brokerage and an agent.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
