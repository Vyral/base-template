excerpt: 'Are you a move-up buyer who needs to sell your existing home in order to finance your next home purchase? This process can be tricky, but I have a way to make it much more manageable. Our Tucson market is just strong enough that most sellers won’t consider an offer from a buyer that’s contingent on that buyer getting just an offer on their current home. To strengthen your position as a buyer, you have to go farther than that. To see what I mean, watch my latest video.'

I met with a couple last night whose family is growing, and they need to sell their current home in order to buy a larger one. This got me thinking about contingencies and how they affect your strength as a move-up buyer.&nbsp;

If you’re in a similar situation and you need to sell your existing home in order to finance your next home purchase, I have a suggestion that will make this process easier for you.&nbsp;

**Put your existing home on the market, get an offer on it, and then start searching for your next home.** Here in Tucson, our market is just strong enough that most sellers won’t consider an offer from a buyer that’s contingent on that buyer getting an offer on their current home. You’re a much stronger buyer if you already have a contract on your home and your offer is contingent on your current home closing.&nbsp;

If you need any more advice about being a move-up buyer or you have any other questions about our market, feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I’d be happy to help you.
