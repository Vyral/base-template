There are a lot of sellers entering the market around this time, so I’ve determined that it would be a good idea to provide them with some tips about what to keep in mind as they list their homes on the market.

**1\. You need to be aware of market conditions, and keep an eye on your competition.** What other homes are selling in your area? You don’t want to put a 3-bedroom, 2-bath home on the market for $200,000 if comparable homes in your area are selling for around $150,000—that might make selling your home a little more difficult.

**2\. Look at comparable homes.** Keep an eye on the properties listed in your price range; homes that are priced under $225,000 are selling pretty quickly, and homes priced over $300,000 will sell as well, if they’re in the right condition and are properly priced.

**3\. Establish your own needs.** Do you need to sell quickly because you’re leaving the area tomorrow? Do you have time to play with the market? Adapt your selling strategy around your needs, with special emphasis on your time frame.

These are all things that we can sit down and talk with you about when you meet with us for a consultation. We can tell you what the best price would be for your home given the current market conditions and help you strategize to sell it quickly and for the most money possible. If you have any questions or need help selling your home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
