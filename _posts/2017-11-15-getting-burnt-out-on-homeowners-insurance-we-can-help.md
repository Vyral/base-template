With homeowners insurance, it often happens that homeowners will try to go through the carriers that they’re normally with, but those carriers inform them that they do not service the Tahoe-Truckee area.

There are quite a few companies that don’t insure homeowners up here, so today, Tally Meek from Sierra Insurance will tell us the way to go about getting homeowners insurance up here for your primary or secondary residence.

**Tally, what’s the process that you use to get homeowners insurance in the Tahoe-Truckee area?**

It starts with working with a local broker who knows this region. Outside of this area, insurance brokers don’t really know how to tackle the problem we have because the normal solutions aren’t there. Many major insurance carriers don’t write policies for our area anymore because there’s too much risk of wildfire or they already have too much of the market share and aren’t willing to take on any more risk.

So we’ve gotten creative. We’ve found new and specialty markets to provide a solution for those people. I had a phone call today for someone who had closed insurance the previous Monday. After three attempts to buy insurance, he found out he was getting stuck with the California Share Plan and had to purchase additional insurance to supplement it. He was exhausted and didn’t think he had any solutions.

But we had a preferred admitted insurance carrier ready to go for him, and we got him insurance that day. Having a local broker and knowing the right resources is the way to go.

**What are the biggest challenges that people face while finding homeowners insurance?**

The greatest challenge is the wildfire concern. It’s really hard to pick what house is going to have an issue with wildfire and which one isn't. I’d say that 85% of the homes up here are going to have wildfire problems.

Don’t make your buying decision based on whether or not you can find insurance—make your decision based on the house that you want, and we’ll find the insurance. It may be a little bit more than your typical insurance, but you’re getting your dream house. Don’t limit your options. The solutions are there.

**What can be done to lower the cost of insurance?**

The best way to do that is to take high deductibles and to avoid making small claims on your insurance. Small claims are the kiss of death with homeowners insurance. If you’ve had a loss in the last five years, you won’t find many people who are willing to insure you, and it’s already difficult enough in this area with the wildfire concerns.
