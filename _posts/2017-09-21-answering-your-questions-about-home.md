</i>  <div style="text-align: left;">Today, I have the pleasure of being joined by Heidi Marshall with First American Home Warranty as we discuss the most important things you should know about home warranties.<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">Heres what Heidi has to say:<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">**One of the biggest benefits of having a home warranty is the peace of mind.** You dont have to do research to find, for example, a plumber or an AC company. With a home warranty, it covers your major appliancesthe air conditioner, electrical, plumbing, and so on. If there is a claim that needs to be placed, you just call the number and can have any questions about repairs answered.<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">Another great thing about having home warranties is that **there is no charge for replacement refrigerant **or freon if your AC unit isnt functioning properly. Normally that can be very pricey.<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">**It can also be a great option for rentals,** which includes all parties. Landlords wont need to worry about a phone call in the middle of the night about a leak in the bathroom. Tenants can call the warranty company 24/7, place the claim, and the landlord wont have to worry about finding an emergency plumber.<div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">One of the biggest benefits of having a home warranty is the peace of mind. <div style="text-align: left;">And were all overif you have a rental in Los Angeles, Orange County, or Nevada, you can place your claim in any of those areas. It makes life easier both on you, and on your pocketbook.<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">Many clients over the years have been able to take advantage of their home warranties, whether it be for replacing a water heater or other important home appliance.<div style="text-align: left;"><b> 
</b><div style="text-align: left;">**Its very important that when your agent writes the contract, they put in the proper coverage.** Make sure that those things that are important to you are covered, such as an air conditioner or a pool. Personal appliances that you bring in the home should also be covered.<div style="text-align: left;">
