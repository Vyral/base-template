Today, I have the pleasure of being joined by Heidi Marshall with First American Home Warranty as we discuss the most important things you should know about home warranties.

Here’s what Heidi has to say:

**One of the biggest benefits of having a home warranty is the peace of mind.** You don’t have to do research to find, for example, a plumber or an AC company. With a home warranty, it covers your major appliances—the air conditioner, electrical, plumbing, and so on. If there is a claim that needs to be placed, you just call the number and can have any questions about repairs answered.

Another great thing about having home warranties is that **there is no charge for replacement refrigerant** or freon if your AC unit isn’t functioning properly. Normally that can be very pricey.

It can also be a great option for rentals, which includes all parties. Landlords won’t need to worry about a phone call in the middle of the night about a leak in the bathroom. Tenants can call the warranty company 24/7, place the claim, and the landlord won’t have to worry about finding an emergency plumber.

And we’re all over—if you have a rental in Los Angeles, Orange County, or Nevada, you can place your claim in any of those areas. It makes life easier both on you, and on your pocketbook.

Many clients over the years have been able to take advantage of their home warranties, whether it be for replacing a water heater or other important home appliance.

**It’s very important that when your agent writes the contract, they put in the proper coverage.** Make sure that those things that are important to you are covered, such as an air conditioner or a pool. Personal appliances that you bring in the home should also be covered.

If you have any questions about home warranties, please contact Heidi by phone or email and if you have any real estate questions, please contact us at the Scott Himelstein Group. Thanks again for watching our video blog.
