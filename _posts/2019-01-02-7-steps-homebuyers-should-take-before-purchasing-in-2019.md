Here are seven steps to follow as you get ready to buy a home in the new year:&nbsp;

**1. Check your credit**. Knowing your baseline score before your purchase is a must.&nbsp;

**2. Don’t open new lines of credit**. Resist temptation if/when credit card offers come in the mail. This is the time to devote all of your attention to home buying and not add to your credit card burden.&nbsp;

**3. Suggest financial gifts.** If, during the holidays, a loved one asks for some ideas for what you’d like, suggest cash or gift cards. That extra cash can go a long way when put toward your down payment.&nbsp;

**4. Keep tabs on interest rates**. We’ve seen some fluctuation with respect to interest rates, and in general, they are escalating—knowing where rates are sitting at all times is important.

**5. Find a mortgage lender**. You’ll want to find a lender who can get you pre-qualified and that you trust and are comfortable with.&nbsp;

**6. Get pre-approved.** Plan for the unexpected: The right house might suddenly come onto the market, and you’ll need to be ready. Having a pre-approval letter will allow you to write a timely offer, be on par with other buyers, and even potentially stand out.&nbsp;

**7. Find a great real estate agent.** I believe this to be the most important step—buying a home is much too big of a decision to carry out on your own. You’ll want to work with a professional agent who has your best interests at heart.&nbsp;
