{% include youtube.html %}The latest real estate numbers for Northern Virginia just came out, so I wanted to take a second of your time to update you on them.

* **New pending contracts increased by 9% from 2014**

* **The 4,308 new pending sales was just above our five-year average**

* **The number of closed sales increased by 17% to 3,118**

* **Inventory went up for the 21st consecutive month, and we have 9,522 listings right now**

* \*\*Median sales price of $425,000 remained the same \*\*

* **Half of the homes sold in April were on the market for 53 days or more**

{% include pullquote.html %}

In summary, the spring market is here, and we have a very large amount of inventory. Buyer demand is continuing to improve, so it's a great time to buy or sell, especially when you consider that interest rates are still sitting at historic lows.
