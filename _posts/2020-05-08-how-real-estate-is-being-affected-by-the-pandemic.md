How has the coronavirus pandemic affected our local real estate market? As everyone is adapting to this, the good news is that we are still able to do business virtually and safely. We can offer consultations, signings, and showings all over the internet. Sales are down about 19% from where they were last year, but inventory is down by almost that much as well. Home sales are only down 1.6% from last year, so that means people are still buying and selling homes right now. To learn more, watch this short video above.
