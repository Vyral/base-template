I’ve got a quick market update for you today as we head into the winter months. **The homes that are selling the fastest in today’s market are those that are priced below the median price range of $265,000.** Most of these tend to be single-family homes.

The homes that are struggling to sell the most in our current market are the ones that are overpriced. When sellers put homes on the market for significantly more than they are worth, it causes them to sit on the market with little to no activity until they eventually drop the price.

**Last week, we had a listing that we put on the market and it received multiple offers within 24 hours.** When you list your home on the market, you’re in a pricing war as well as a beauty war and you want to make sure that your home is the nicest house on the market in your price range.

If you have any questions for us about the market or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
