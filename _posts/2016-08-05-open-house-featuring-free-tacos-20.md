We’re here today to introduce our newest listing at 4407 Meadow Knoll Lane in Mansfield, Texas. It’s a beautiful home featuring four bedrooms, three living rooms, and three full bathrooms built inside its nearly 3,100 sq ft area. Tucked within the Meadow Glen subdivision, the neighborhood is great for raising a family. Nearby you can find community parks, pools, playgrounds, and Lake Ridge High School.

We’d love to have you come check it out for yourself at our open house this Saturday, August 6th, from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Since we ran out of pizza, this time we’ll be serving free tacos. Who doesn’t like free tacos?
