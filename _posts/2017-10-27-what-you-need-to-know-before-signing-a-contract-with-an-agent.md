In a real estate transaction there are many types of agency, but today we’re going to focus on buyer agency.

**When you first meet with a real estate agent, you will be provided with a consumer notice.** This consumer notice will help explain the different agencies in Pennsylvania.

Next, the agent will go over any questions you may have and will eventually ask you to sign a buyer agency contract. But before you sign this contract, make sure you are comfortable with the agent. This contract does bind you to working with them, so it’s important you feel secure moving forward with your decision.

Also, pay attention to the length of time the contract commits you for. The amount of time you’re locked in for could be fairly short, but it can also be a maximum of one year. Never rush into a contract you aren’t comfortable with.

You may want to think about interviewing multiple agents before committing to a specific professional. **If you do work with an agent before signing a contract, it’s important to realize they are then working for the seller.** Without any agency established on your behalf, you aren’t being represented.

My team and I understand what an important decision this is. For this reason, we provide a loyalty agreement with a cancellation guarantee when you work with us. We do this so that you don’t feel pressured into signing any long-term contracts.

We hope to perform to a standard that you’re happy with but if this isn’t the case for any reason, **it’s important to us that you have peace of mind in knowing you can cancel anytime.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
