There are 10 home repair and maintenance tips that every Utah homeowner should know, and I’d like to share this list with you today. 

**1. Change your furnace filter every three months.** This will extend the lifespan of your furnace and will also keep it running more efficiently. 

**2. Fix leaky faucets.** Being proactive and fixing leaks expediently is critical. Doing so will cut costs on your water bill and prevent what could become serious damage. 

**3. Unclog your drains.** I recommend pouring a cup of white vinegar down all the sink and shower drains in your home. This will help prevent clogs and eliminate odors.

**4. Know the location and functions of all the switches on your circuit panel.** Having this knowledge could make future electrical issues much easier to approach.

**5. Fix squeaky doors and cabinets.** This can be achieved by rubbing vaseline or WD-40 on the hinges.

**6. Know the location of your water shut-off valves. **

**7. Understand how to operate your water shut-off valves. **

**8. Determine whether water drains away from or toward your home.** This can be easily tested by placing a ball near your foundation and watching which way it rolls. If the ball rolls toward your home, your property’s foundation is at risk of water damage. 

**9. Check that your water heater safety valve is working properly.** The last thing you want is an exploding water heater. The pressure valve on the top of the heater can be popped up. Then, the line will be drained outside of the house into a visible location. If you see water coming out of the drain, the pop-up valve may have failed and needs to be replaced. 

**10. Caulk necessary areas as-needed.** To prevent water damage, you will need to caulk (or re-caulk) certain areas of your home periodically. 

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
