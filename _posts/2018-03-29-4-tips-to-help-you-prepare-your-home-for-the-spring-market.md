There are four key tips you need to remember to prepare your home for the spring market so that it sells quickly and for top dollar:

**1. Make sure your home is tidy.**As an agent who works with both buyers and sellers, when I’m out shopping for homes with buyers, they give me feedback all the time about whether a home is tidy or not. Your home needs to be in tiptop condition for buyers to see it as a premium selection among other available homes. Consider hiring a professional cleaning service to make sure the job’s done right.

**2. Make sure your home is painted with neutral colors.** Your walls should be painted with colors that appeal to different buyers in all categories. Sometimes, when a buyer walks into a home and sees pink, purple, or blue paint, it can make them disinterested because those colors make the home feel more personalized.

**3. Make sure it has good, quality photos.** Whenever buyers look for homes, they always ask for more pictures, so take as many interior shots of your home as possible.

**4. Price it right.**Today’s buyers are very price-conscious, and they’ll likely compare your home to other resale homes in your area. They’ll also compare it to any new construction communities in the area. The first two factors they use for their comparisons are price and condition, so offering the best-conditioned home at the most affordable price will garner it the most attention.
