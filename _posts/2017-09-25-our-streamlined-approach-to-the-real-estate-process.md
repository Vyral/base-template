Recently I was able to sit on a meeting with Greg Schwartz, the chief business officer for Zillow.

With all of &nbsp;his experience, connections and knowledge, Schwartz’s input very much aligned with how my team and I want to run the real estate process for you.

**The age of the discount business model has peaked.** When it comes to customer satisfaction, Realtors are toward the bottom of the list. Discounting has not equated to satisfaction or substantial market shares.

For example, consider Amazon. Right now, 60% of U.S. households have an Amazon Prime account while 70% have cable tv. Amazon hasn’t reinvented the wheel. They run your card like any other business, and don’t offer particularly low prices.

However, Amazon has made a business that is streamlined. Their business is predictable and consistent, which is what we really want. This is exactly the kind of process we want to bring to you.

We have a persona-driven process where the flow of information is easy for you to understand. The flow of our real estate transaction is mapped out and **we want to eliminate the stress involved in this process for you.**

This economy is highly concerned with the “ease of flow,” and we want to ensure that this translates to you and the service you receive. Simply put, you deserve better experiences. &nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
