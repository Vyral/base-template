Should you buy a home right now?

Recently, I was at a dinner party where this question was brought up, and someone who was, shall we say, *very* passionate about Gary Vaynerchuk claimed that the answer is no because Gary advised against it.

First of all, that’s not 100% true. What Gary actually says is that if you’re an entrepreneur looking to start a business, you’re better off putting your money toward that instead of buying a home. After your business starts growing, then you should buy a home.

Here’s my take on this subject: **Your home makes you money, too.** It won’t make you as much money as your own business will, but if you’re not planning on starting a business anytime soon, you can still put your savings to work for you by buying a house.

When you buy a home, you start paying a mortgage, and most of that mortgage is tax deductible. **When you rent a home, you’re still paying a mortgage—you’re just paying someone else’s.** Owning a home, however, means you can deduct the interest you pay.

On average, people live in a home for seven years, so if you buy a $200,000 home and its equity only appreciates by 3% each year—the worst-case scenario—you’ll still collect $6,000 per year, or $42,000 by the time seven years are up. Not to mention all the tax savings you’ll build up.

If you have a lot of money saved up—say, $100,000—another good idea would be to put half of it toward buying a personal home and the other half toward buying an investment home. If you buy another $200,000 property for your investment home at a 30-year fixed mortgage and then rent it out, someone else pays off that mortgage. At the end of 30 years, even if the home’s equity appreciates at a yearly rate below the worst-case scenario—$5,000—you’ll have gained $150,000. All told, your net gain would be $350,000 if you sold the home.

Of course you’ll have expenses you’ll need to cover over the years, but even if those expenses reach upwards of $100,000, **you’ll still have a $250,000 piece of change to retire on.&nbsp;**

Whether you want to buy a personal home or an investment home, I’d love to help you, so don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email so we can get started.
