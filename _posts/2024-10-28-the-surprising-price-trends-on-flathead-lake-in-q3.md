I don’t know if you have heard but there is some news that might surprise you about the Flathead Valley real estate market. We’ve just wrapped up the third quarter, and the numbers are in. Let me tell you—there’s been some serious action, especially with waterfront properties. If you've been thinking about buying or selling in this area, you’ll want to pay attention. Here’s why.

**Flathead Lake takes off.** Imagine this: sales on Flathead Lake have shot up by 200% from the second to the third quarter this year. Yes, you read that right! We went from just 7 sales in Q2 to a whopping 21 sales in Q3. That’s a big leap, and it’s not just about the quantity—the quality is impressive too. There were three massive sales over $10 million each. But there’s one catch: inventory is tight. Out of the 39 properties available, 74% are priced over $2 million, making it tough to find homes in the “affordable” range.

**What’s holding buyers back?** The main problem? Limited options. With fewer homes for sale, buyers are competing for the best spots. This can make things frustrating if you’re trying to find a lakefront property under $2 million. On the flip side, if you’re thinking of selling, this could be your moment to shine. Less competition means more eyes on your listing and possibly a quicker sale.

**How’s the condo market holding up?** If single-family homes aren’t your thing, let’s talk about condos. Condo sales have been steady with 13 transactions this quarter compared to 15 last year. It’s not a huge drop, but the lack of available units keeps prices steady and demand strong. Buyers are still snagging condos at a rate of about 4 to 5 per quarter.

**Small but steady gains.** The land market hasn’t been left out of this growth. We’ve had five land sales this quarter, compared to six last year. Again, we’re seeing that 200% jump from the second to the third quarter (from 2 to 5 transactions). While these aren’t huge numbers, it’s a sign that buyers are also looking for empty lots to build their dream homes.

**Other lakes are heating up too.** It’s not just Flathead Lake getting the love. We’ve seen 23 sales on other lakes this year, up from 19 last year. And the third quarter has been twice as busy as the second quarter. There’s clearly a strong desire for lakefront living across the region, despite the limited number of homes on the market.

With limited listings, you might think sales will slow down. But so far, demand is keeping pace. If you’re a buyer, now’s the time to act before inventory tightens further. Sellers, this is your chance to attract top offers. If you have any questions or want to dive deeper into this market, call or text me at 406-837-5531. Let’s make your waterfront dreams a reality!
