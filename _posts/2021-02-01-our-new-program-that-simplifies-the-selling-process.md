<center><em>Check out our Certified Pre-Owned Home program for sellers.</em></center>

<br>Have you heard about our Certified Pre-Owned Home program? Just like how cars can be sold as a certified pre-owned car, we can do the same for our home-selling clients.

We know that deals can fall through due to certain factors that give buyers pause. That’s why, under our program, **we’ll help you get a pre-inspection and pre-appraisal done to make sure your home is priced correctly in our current market and in the proper condition to sell for the most money possible**. We’ll also provide a home warranty to your buyers so they can be confident your listing is ready to go and will be protected even beyond closing.

If you’d like to learn more about our Certified Pre-Owned Home program and how we at The Wolek Group ensure our sellers end up with more money in their pockets at closing, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be so happy to share this program with you.
