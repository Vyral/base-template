Jennie caught up with Emily Fuller, Development Manager to learn about what the organization does for the Tulsa community.

Reading Partners is a national nonprofit that mobilizes communities to provide students with the proven, individualized reading support they need to read at grade level by fourth grade.

**Today, only one in four Oklahoma fourth graders is reading at a proficient level and** [**36% lack even basic literacy skills**](https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/)**. By partnering with parents, teachers, public schools, and community leaders in Tulsa, Reading Partners is poised to address Tulsa’s significant opportunity gap.**

The organization partners with Tulsa and Union Public Schools and engages volunteer reading partners to work one-on-one with students who struggle with reading. Volunteers provide hour-long tutoring sessions to students— following a structured, evidence-based curriculum developed with an expert team of curriculum advisors.
