This year has been great so far. Interest rates have gone up, so I commend those of you who have invested in property and chose us to help make your property more valuable. It was a smart move.

A lot of people want to know about our owner fees and how we earn them when it comes to maintenance and finding tenants. **We put a lot of work into these areas so that our owners and their investments are protected.**

Before we take over a property to manage, we first look at the appliances. If they need to be serviced, we take care of them. However, once the tenant gets in there, all bets on maintenance are off. People handle day-to-day living differently. Many times we’ll see a disposal overload or toilet backup.

Whenever something goes wrong, our property manager will contact the owner to see how they want to handle the situation. If they have a friend or family member that can take care of the maintenance, we will go to them. If not, we have our in-house vendors that we have approved and worked with in the past. **We won’t repair anything for you without your permission, however.**

Another area of our business where we are really strong is our marketing. We make sure to take pictures and video of our properties each time a tenant moves in or out. We also push our properties to the major websites like apartments.com, Trulia, Zillow, Craigslist, and more. Some of those sites have been very strong for us in finding good tenants.

**We do background checks, credit checks, and criminal checks on all potential tenants.** We believe in doing the hard work up front because once it’s done, we can foresee and chase out all the bad prospects or tenants we may get.

Once we have a tenant, we do a four- or six-month walkthrough to ensure proper maintenance in the home. If they have pets, it’s every four months. If they don’t, it’s every six.

In a nutshell, that’s how we earn our fees. We think we are more than worth our price, and many of our owners can attest to that. If you have any questions for us or you’re looking to invest in property here in Hawaii, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.
