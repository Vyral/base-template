If you’re in the process of downsizing, the first thing you must realize is that everything you have now you won’t have when you move.

This is why I highly encourage you to **go through you house, identify what your “must-have” items are, and label them as such.** Make sure you know what you must have before the time comes to sell your house or the time comes to buy your next house and there isn’t enough room for something you must have.

Remember, downsizing isn’t a bad thing—it’s a good thing. When you downsize, you’re going to have a smaller lifestyle in a more controllable and enjoyable house. You’ll have the freedom to travel!
