I just wanted to quickly reach out and wish you all a Merry Christmas. This is a special time of year for all of us and I hope you get to spend some great quality time with your family and friends. I know there are plenty of first responders out there who don’t get to spend as much time with their loved ones as the rest of us this year, and I wish you all the best. From my home to your home, have a merry Christmas and a happy new year. To see my full holiday message, watch this short video.
