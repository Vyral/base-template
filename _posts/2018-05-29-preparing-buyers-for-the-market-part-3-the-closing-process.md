We’re back with the third and final installment of our series on preparing buyers for the market, and today we’ll be covering how to get clients to the finish line. Associate broker David Dorius joins us once again to help discuss this important topic.

Once your buyer has successfully entered the market, made an offer, and gone under contract, what does it take to get through the closing process?

Before getting the answer to this, it’s important to note that **being under contract is not the same thing as the property being sold.** This is something your clients must understand. As a professional, it is your responsibility to keep your clients in touch with reality. They must realize that being under contract really only puts them halfway through “the race.”

One major hurdle of getting buyers through closing is guiding them through the due diligence process. And, because sellers are driving the market these days, something to keep in mind is that **while sellers in the past may have been receptive to taking responsibility for certain repairs, this is no longer often the case.** Sellers in today’s market tend to price their properties with its condition in mind to begin with. So, your clients should be aware of this as you proceed.

Another critical aspect of the closing process that your clients must understand is the importance of getting their finances in order. If their lender reaches out requesting further documentation, your client must respond expediently to make sure the transaction proceeds without any issues. **A lot of paperwork goes into buying or selling a home.**

If your client happens to be someone with a lot to do and a lot of things to manage within their financial portfolio, you may offer to communicate directly with their accountant. Getting their permission to make this contact can facilitate a much more streamlined process overall. Assisting a buyer with the logistics of their purchase is sometimes necessary to achieve a smooth close. Hopefully, all of the tips we’ve shared will help you and your client more successfully work through the buying process.
