Schools are such a big deal and it’s one of the main reasons people come to me about wanting to buy or sell a home. Oftentimes, people love their homes, but they realize that, as their kids are going into middle school and high school, they want to make a change based on the school.

The first thing they want to know is what schools they should be in. If they ask me, quite frankly I can’t answer, because it depends on so many different factors that are different for each family and your children. **What I can do, however, is point you to a couple of resources.**

**The first is [greatschools.net.](https://www.greatschools.org/){: target="_blank"}** It rates each school based on a 1 to 10 scale and you’ll see Yelp\! style reviews and testimonials, but please take them with a grain of salt. You may run into someone writing a review that has a conflict of interest.

Another source is the Portland Monthly School Guide. Though it’s a few years old, it breaks things down by the numbers which can be very helpful. It has a lot of statistical information for you to compare with other schools in the area.

**The other thing I really enjoy about being in real estate is that I have a great network of clients who have kids in schools all over the area.** If you’re interested in a certain school, I’d be happy to connect you with a client who has or has had kids at the school so you can get some more of your questions answered.

We can also help you create a home search based on the school district you’re looking in. If that’s something that’s important to you, we can certainly help make your search a lot easier if school is important to you.

If you have any questions for me or you’d like to sit down to create a buying or selling strategy of your own, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
