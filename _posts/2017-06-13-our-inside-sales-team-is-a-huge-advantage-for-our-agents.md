If you’re an agent who is considering joining a team, you need to make sure that team has an inside sales department. Why? Let me explain.
<br>
<br>**Over the last year, we have been developing our inside sales department.** We have two full-time employees in this department, and it’s their job to call leads, qualify them, and book appointments for our agents.
<br>
<br>Most teams in today’s market are simply buying leads, giving them to their agents, and letting them go from there. On our team, we have a hybrid model that has proved to be much more effective. The agents do call their leads, but so do the ISAs (Inside Sales Agents). Keeping up with 40 or 50 leads per month is next to impossible, so when you have someone working with you to cut that number in half, you can be much more productive as an agent. Our ISAs are calling leads 10 to 15 times in order to reach them and calling on different days and times of the day to increase their odds of making contact. **Unlike other teams, we aren’t relying on our agents to do this kind of work that they probably don’t like doing in the first place.**

<br>
<br>Our database of 5,000 leads grows by hundreds each month. Most of them have been nurtured for months, so we are handing off warm leads to our agents every day. This is a great opportunity for them to convert and it always keeps the pipeline fresh. Our inside sales team is actually booking over 60% of the appointments for our team at this time.
<br>
<br>We’re continuing to improve the department as well. We’ve been studying successful teams from around the country and seeing how their agents and ISAs work together. **If you aren’t working with a team that has an inside sales department, it’s going to be much harder for you to get going in your career.**
<br>
<br>If you have any questions for us or are interested in seeing what joining our team would be like, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
