Many of you are probably looking to social media as a marketing channel as you finalize your plans for 2017. I absolutely encourage you to do this.

Did you know that 75% of adults are active on some social media channel? The trick is finding out which one. Here are five tips to avoid when it comes to social media:

1. **No free-wheeling is allowed!** You've got to have a plan or it can become very time-consuming. Plan out where you're going to be in terms of budgets for things like paid ads and what you'll hold that budget accountable toâ€”how much business do you expect it to generate? Have a plan and content strategy for what's going to be your key messaging.

2. **Don't put all your eggs in one basket.** Even if you love Pinterest, don't put 80% of your focus there and spread 20% across all the remaining platforms. **<a href="http://Hootsuite.com" target="_blank">Hootsuite.com</a>** is a great scheduling program that allows you to push out the same content on multiple social media channels. It takes some time to schedule, but I suggest you spend about six hours a month mapping out your schedule. From there, it's basically set it and forget it. You also need to allow time to be spontaneous for things like big news. You want to be able to jump in with timely content on social media.

3. **Don't wait for the bugs to be worked out.** There are constantly new social media platforms coming out, and as soon as you start hearing about them, it is too late! You want to be an early adopter because there are usually benefits associated with being an early adopter. Applications like Hootsuite will keep you informed of this news.

4. **Be prepared to embrace rapid change.** The world of social media constantly evolves, so I like to stay abreast with a site called <a href="http:/Mashable.com" target="_blank">**Mashable.com**</a>. It's a good general clearinghouse for information about social media where you can get quick updates on things you need to be aware of.

5. **Keep an eye on your analytics.** Google Analytics, for example, is a great way to stay on top of your site's traffic and to see where it's coming from. Facebook has a great analytics tool, as well.

Good luck with your social media strategy in 2017! If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I'd be glad to help!
