We're back once again to have a conversation with transaction coordinator Karen Agar, who is here to share her story and talk about why she chose to join the Dave Hooke Team.

**Why this career, and why this team?**

*“I joined the team in October 2018, so a little over two and a half years ago. I’ve been in real estate for probably about 13 years. I was in new construction for a time, and then I got my real estate license. I spent some time with another brokerage but eventually moved over here.”*

You’ve always impressed me with your incredible work ethic and attention to detail. You’re one of the backbones of our operations team, so **tell us a little about what you do for the team?**

*“I am our list-side transaction coordinator and our listing manager, so I process all of our listings and make sure everything gets on the market accurately and quickly. I also handle everything from contract to close, whether that be inspection negotiations, coordinator settlement, or anything else.”*

**What would you say is your favorite thing about your job and the team as a whole?**

*“About a month ago, we had a crop of empty nesters all in one week. They were all selling their homes here and moving closer to their families. I thought about it like all of my birdies flying away; I just really like helping people get to the next step.*

*“My favorite thing about the team is our core values and team mentality. Nobody is too big to take a minute and help someone out. It feels like a family all the way through.”*

**What’s your biggest challenge right now?**

*“Right now, we’re in a busier season in the industry. There’s a lot of balls to juggle, and I have to make sure that everything gets from point A to Z.”*

**As you think about the future, what are you excited about for your career?**

*“I’m excited that I'm on the path to have a career. My past positions have all been jobs; there was not enough traction to move up. I have that here, and it’s exciting to be a part of.”*

If you or someone you know wants to learn more about Karen’s story or what we do here on the team, we are an open book, so we’d love to have a conversation with you. Contact us at (717) 216-0860 or [Dave@DaveHookeTeam.com](mailto:Dave@DaveHookeTeam.com).
