Today, I have a question for all of the homeowners out there who are debating whether or not to make a move: What is more important to you, your mortgage rate or your needs?&nbsp;

I know a lot of you may feel hesitant to move if your current mortgage rate is lower than the one that you would get on your next house. However, the key is that while mortgage rates are a factor when considering a move, they shouldn’t be the most important one. **Your lifestyle and changing needs matter more.&nbsp;**

Here are a few of the top reasons why people are choosing to sell this year: they want different features, to be closer to their friends and loved ones, or to downsize. In short, people are selling because their current homes cannot deliver what they need anymore, and I'd be willing to bet that a lot of you feel the same way. Therefore, **don’t lose sight of the reason you want to make a change in the first place.**

**{% include pullquote.html %}**

Remember, **you can always refinance your mortgage and get a lower rate when they drop**, which is expected in the next couple of years. Also, I work with a lender who will refinance your mortgage for free when the rates go down.&nbsp;
