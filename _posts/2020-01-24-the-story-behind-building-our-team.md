Starting out as a solo agent, I was eventually able to make real estate a lucrative business. But by the end of my first breakout year, I was isolated from friends and family and enjoyed life less than when I was only making $40,000; something had to change. In today’s interview with Lars Hedenborg, I share my journey of building the Dave Friedman Team, and explain the world-class model I built it around that affords agents real opportunities for growth.&nbsp;
