Welcome back to another edition of “Hacking Your Health.” This time, we’re talking about how you can hack your brain. Specifically, how you can hack your brain just by including certain foods in your diet. **There are 10 foods in particular that you should be aware of that will increase your oxygen intake, blood flow, and brain performance**.&nbsp;

To help you remember these foods, there’s a technique that we learned from Jim Quake, a brain expert. It’s all about associating the different foods with different parts of your body. You’ll have to use your imagination a bit, but the silliness is worth it.&nbsp;

1. **Avocados**. These are a good source of healthy fat and will improve the blood flow to your brain. Pretend you are balancing an avocado on the top of your head.

2. **Blueberries**. Or brainberries, as we like to call them because they are high in antioxidants. Imagine dozens of little blueberries coming out of your nose.
3. **Broccoli**. High in fiber, rich in Vitamin K, and a good enhancer of cognitive function. Imagine a steaming head of broccoli bursting out of your mouth.
4. **Coconut oil**. Another healthy source of good fats. Tilt your head to the side and pretend that coconut oil is coming out of your ears.
5. **Eggs**: Don’t just eat egg whites, all the nutrients are in the yolk. Imagine an egg is stuck in your adam’s apple.
6. **Spinach, kale, or collard greens**. These leafy vegetables have high levels of Vitamin E. Touch your shoulders and pretend that the green leafs are dancing on them.
7. **Salmon**. The best kind is wild, deep-water Pacific salmon. It’s rich in Omega-3s. Touch your collar bone and imagine you are wearing a salmon necklace.
8. **Turmeric**. This spice reduces inflammation, is high in antioxidants, and helps increase oxygen intake. Rub your fingers together and imagine they are sprinkling turmeric.
9. **Walnuts**. These nuts are very high in zinc and magnesium. Pretend they are popping out of your belly button.
10. **Dark Chocolate**. The darker, the better for you. This is probably the easiest one to remember. Touch your rear end and…you know the rest.

To see a full demonstration of our little memory game, watch the video above. If you have any other questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
