Welcome to the latest episode of *“What’s Working Now!”*&nbsp;

Today, I want to share a successful under-the-radar strategy for buyers frustrated by the lack of homes for sale.&nbsp;

Recently, I worked with some buyers who made an offer on a home. Unfortunately, there were two other buyers and my people didn’t win. They just weren’t ready.&nbsp;

Shortly after that, they became ready to make a purchase. The problem was that at that point, there was nothing to buy. I said, **“Don’t worry about it. I’ll go find you a house.”**

So, I put my sneakers on and went out to knock on some doors. I started calling expired listings and agents of properties that were under contract, hoping one would fall through.

Guess what? **I found an agent who had a contract that was about to settle, and the sale was falling through.**&nbsp;

I showed the house to my people, they made an offer, and they got it. Now they are getting ready to go to settlement.

So, remember when I put on my sneakers to go knock on doors? When I knocked on the very first door, I met some people who were not ready to sell their house, but they sent me a client. Their friend wanted to buy a house in a nice, big, fat price range, and there was not a house for her on the market.&nbsp;

I said, “Don’t worry about it. I’ll go find you a house!”&nbsp;

I started looking through expired listings, withdrawn listings, houses that were temporarily off the market, and houses that became rentals. **I found three houses that were expired listings that were about to come back on the market.&nbsp;**

I made appointments for all three of those houses, and now we are negotiating on one of them.
