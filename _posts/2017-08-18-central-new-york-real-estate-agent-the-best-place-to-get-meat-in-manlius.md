We’re excited to introduce you to another great local business calling Manlius home. This time, we’re with Greg Rhoad of Sidehill Farmers. I’ve been a big fan of theirs for a while now. This is easily one of the best butcher shops in central New York.

Sidehill Farmers has been in Manlius for three years now. Their mission is to bring local products from local farmers to local consumers in Manlius, Syracuse, and surrounding areas. **They are a real farm-to-table business, representing over 60 farmers around the area.**

They’ve got pasture-raised beef, pork, lamb, chicken, and more. All their meats are hormone and antibiotic free as well. People come from all over central New York for a cut, or just for a bite at the sandwich shop.

Sidehill Farmers is a whole-animal butchery, meaning they utilize every part of the animal from snout to tail. **They also take pride in their ability to provide any and every customer with the proper education about the meat they are buying and how they should prepare it.**  You can come in and get a quick bite, a holiday roast, or anything in between. Whenever you need meat, go head over to Sidehill Farmers.

If you have any questions for them, you can give them a call at (315) 682-MEAT(6328) or visit their website <a href="http://www.sidehillfarmers.com/contact-us/" target="_blank">here</a>. If you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out anytime. I look forward to hearing from you.
