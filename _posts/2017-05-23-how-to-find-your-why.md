Last time, we shared tips and strategies for you to improve your health, but those tips are all for nothing if we don’t also talk to you about your “why.” This is your reason for wanting to be healthy, and the thing that will push you through the difficult times. We had a wide-ranging conversation on the topic, **check out the timestamps below so you can jump between the different parts of the discussion**:

1:00-The difference between motive and motivation and why you can't have one without the other.
<br>1:50-How to find your "why".
<br>3:45-How "Mind Fric" can derail you from your goals.
