Whether you are buying a home, selling a home, or happy where you are, here are a few clever things you can do to make sure that your home is protected and secure:

**First, go around and inspect the locks on your doors.** Over time, locks can deteriorate, especially if it’s a door that you don’t use very often. Make sure that they are all functioning properly.&nbsp;

You can also install safety lighting around the exterior of the house. Motion-activated floodlights are sure to scare off any bad people lingering outside.&nbsp;

Be aware of what you showcase in your home. If you are selling your home, make sure that you don’t have any valuables or personal items out in the frame of the pictures. Even when you have guests over to your home, you don’t want to leave anything out that would entice someone to break into your home.&nbsp;

I also recommend that you take account of all your spare keys. If you’ve gone out of town and given a friend or neighbor the spare key, make sure you get it back so it’s not just laying around their house. It may also be helpful to change your locks every once in awhile.

When you go out of town on vacation, do you post on Facebook that you’re going away? If someone is interested in getting into your home and they know that you’re going to be out of town for a week, that’s when they’ll break in. You have to be very careful about your social media posts. Whenever I go out of town, **I wait until I’m home to post any photos or anything about my vacation on social media.**&nbsp;
