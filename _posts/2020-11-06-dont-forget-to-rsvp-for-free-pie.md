<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Remember to RSVP for your free apple or pumpkin pie!</em></p>

It’s hard to believe it’s that time of the year again—Thanksgiving is right around the corner\! We always look forward to the big pie event that we throw each year. Unfortunately, due to COVID, we’re not going to be able to hold it in a restaurant like we’ve done in the past.

Instead, **we’re hosting our Pie Day on Tuesday, November 24, from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. right here in our office parking lot at 2225 Old Emmorton Road, Bel Air, MD.** That way, we’ll have plenty of room for people to pull through and pick up their pies. We’ll have a tent set up in the lot and a moving truck to hold your pies until you come to swoop them.

You will need to RSVP by Friday, November 20, and let us know whether you want an apple pie or a pumpkin pie.

We look forward to reconvening in our usual spot next year when things (hopefully) return to something closer to normal. In the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out to us with any questions you have\!
