<div style="text-align: left;">Back in March, the median price in the San Fernando Valley jumped to $671,500. Its been sticking around that level since then. Were still seeing a lot of low inventory, which is keeping the market very strong.<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">Back in June, we saw a spike in inventory. In the three months since, weve seen a considerable drop as buyers continue to take advantage of the opportunity to buy with a low interest rate. We had 92 properties for sale in Porter Ranch in June, but we only have 75 on the market right now.<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">The average time for a home to sell for the San Fernando Valley as a whole is 39 days, but it only takes an average of 32 days in Porter Ranch. **The key to a quick sale is pricing. **If a home is priced right, it should be sold within a week or two.<div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">The key to a quick sale is pricing. <div style="text-align: left;">Only 2% of home sales in the San Fernando Valley are coming from foreclosures these days. With that being the case, youre starting to see certain neighborhoods hit their pre-2007 highs in terms of home values. The California Association of Realtors predicts a more healthy appreciation of 2% to 4% this year. <div style="text-align: left;">
