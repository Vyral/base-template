Today I want to talk about another success strategy for buyers so they can avoid the frustration caused by a market that looks like there are no houses for sale.

**This strategy is to find an agent who knows how to win.** They can give you advice on what you need to do if there are multiple offers so you can position yourself to be the best buyer for that seller. They can also offer advice on what contingencies you can actually get rid of by doing some things in advance. These contingencies can include a home inspection contingency, a finance contingency, or an appraisal contingency.

A good "buyer's" agent is someone who sounds like they’re working for the seller. If they know what the seller wants and they can position you to offer the seller what they want and more, you can dramatically increase the odds of winning your dream home.

Find an agent who’s confident enough to give you the right advice and isn’t worried that they’re going to push you too far. Let them know that you want to win and that you want to be pushed. After that, ask them what you need to do.

**If you want to buy a house in 2017, you want to work with an agent who has the expertise and the knowledge to get your offer accepted.**
