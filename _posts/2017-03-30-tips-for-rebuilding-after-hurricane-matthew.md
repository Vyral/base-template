We’ve been asked a lot lately about the effect that Hurricane Matthew is going to have on the real estate market and those thinking about selling their home. There have been tornadoes, floods, and hurricanes all over the last few months, so we wanted to give you some tips to make sure you’re approaching things the right way.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>**For starters, use a licensed contractor when repairing any damage or making any renovations.** Make sure you verify their license and make sure they are in good standing with the state. Contractors are necessary for things like electrical and plumbing work, and your insurance company may not cover future damage if you don’t use a licensed contractor.
<br>
<br>If you’re going to expand your square footage at all, you’ll need permits. **If you don’t have an addition permitted and inspected, it won’t be added to the square footage on your home when you list it.** When seeking out contractors, be sure to check their references and pay them when the work is complete, not upfront.

Certain jobs, like removing branches and tree limbs from your yard, don’t require contractors. In fact, you may even be able to reach out to the local scouts, YMCAs, and other service organizations that are looking for ways to help clean up.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>**Finally, make sure to keep copies of any receipts to prove that any repairs or renovations you made were legitimate.** If you have any questions for us or need any assistance or recommendations, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
