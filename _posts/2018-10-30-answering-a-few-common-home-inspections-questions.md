<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Expert home inspector Dan Sladek recently met up with us for a Q&A session about the inspection process, and we’ll be sharing highlights of that discussion with you today.</em></p>

A lot of buyers and sellers have no idea what to expect from the home inspection process. So to help clear up some of this confusion, I recently met with Dan Sladek of Perfection Home Inspection for some insight on the subject.&nbsp;

Dan has been performing inspections for my team and me for the past 12 years, and our clients have been very pleased with their experiences with him. With that in mind, let’s take a look at some of the highlights from my Q&A session with him:&nbsp;

**“What issues do you commonly see in a home inspection?”&nbsp;**

“Typically, one or two ground fault circuit interrupters [in a home] always fail and need to be replaced,” said Dan. After that, another common issue he mentioned was broken seals on double-pane windows. This problem can be identified by a cloudiness to the glass. Finally, Dan also said to watch out for drainage issues—especially if your landscaping slopes toward your foundation.

**“How much do home inspections cost?”**

According to Dan, the exact figure will depend on the size and age of the house, among other factors, but that a typical home inspection will cost about $375.&nbsp;

**“Should people test for radon?”**

“Absolutely,” said Dan. “Radon is an odorless, colorless gas that naturally comes up from the soil.” He also added that if you’re exposed to the gas for a long enough time and at high enough levels, it can cause lung cancer. If a test comes back positive, the seller has a responsibility to either mitigate the issue or, at least, to disclosure it. The average cost to mitigate radon levels in a house without a crawl space is about $1,250.&nbsp;

**“How much does it cost to test for radon?”**&nbsp;

“The cost to test for radon is based upon the number of devices you need. It’s $190 for one device, but if you need an additional device for a sunroom or a crawl space, then it’s $25 more.” This is ultimately a small price to pay for peace of mind.

**“Is it common for sellers to order pre-home inspections?"**

“More and more sellers are doing pre-home inspections,” according to Dan. These inspections work exactly the same as they would when ordered by the buyer. Pre-listing inspections help sellers avoid being blindsided by hidden issues.&nbsp;
