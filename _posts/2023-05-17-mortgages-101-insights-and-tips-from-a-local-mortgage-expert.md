Recently, we had the pleasure of speaking with Chuck Simmons of Motto Mortgage Midwest. He’s an expert on mortgages and the local market, so we thought it would be a great idea to pick his brain on what he does and how he helps buyers in our area.&nbsp;

Chuck has been in the mortgage industry for a while now. For the past four years, he has owned his own company, Motto Mortgage Midwest, with a business partner. They have helped thousands of buyers, gained a lot of experience, and worked with people to get them in the right spot. Every loan is unique and has its own set of challenges, **but they work with buyers to ensure they get the best product and rates and ultimately get to the closing table.**

They start by discussing credit, as most people are unaware or do not know much about it. They can pull their credit and work through any issues or provide tips to improve their score. Afterwards, they also discuss income, assets, and what to look for in employment contracts.

As a mortgage broker, Chuck works with investors directly, so there’s no bank middleman. **They can shop for the best rates and work with investors that follow guidelines and evaluate things.** For example, while some banks may not lend to people with a credit score below 620, they work with investors that will still work with them. Similarly, they work with investors that follow VA's guidelines and allow 100% financing on jumbo loans, unlike banks that may have overlays.

Working with a mortgage broker provides an advantage over banks as they can shop for the best rates and work with investors that follow guidelines, ensuring that you get the best product and rate. If you have questions for Chuck or us, please call or email. We look forward to hearing from you!
