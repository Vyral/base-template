Today, J.D. Nelson, a new team member with an extensive background in home inspections, joins us to discuss that very topic. He has some incredible insight. They are so important for buyers and sellers alike in the surrounding Des Moines area.

Sellers should **consider a pre-sale inspection.** This is a proactive approach before listing. You will know about any issues and have the opportunity to fix them before potential buyers view your property. The pre-sale inspection helps with the closing process and avoids surprises.

The pre-sale inspection **also gives the seller peace of mind.** Plus, if you resolve a few repairs before listing the property, you will most likely save money. When a buyer gets the inspection back and wants to negotiate repairs, they tend to overestimate the costs. If you fix something for $200, odds are that the buyer will request a $500 allowance to make the exact same repair.

**Doing the pre-sale inspection saves you money in the long run.** If you have to make substantial repairs that increase the value of your home, we can also build that into the listing price.

On the buyer side, **80% of buyers invest in a home inspection.** This goes over the same things as the pre-sale inspection and lets you know everything about the house before you close on the property. The general inspection will cover things like your HVAC system, roof, electrical system, and more. If the home inspector notices any major issues, they may recommend having a specialist come out to inspect the property.

You can also **add a radon and termite inspection to the property.** Depending on the square footage of the home, a general home inspection typically runs from $310 to $400. This is a great investment so that youâ€™re aware of any issues with the property before purchasing it.  

One of the benefits of working with J.D. is when he walks into a house, **he goes into inspector mode.** J.D. saves clients time by pointing out big ticket items that might need to be addressed. He helps them make educated decisions when looking at homes.
