Today I’d like to give you some insight into the Franklin County home appraisal process and how it works.&nbsp;

Per the state of Ohio, **Franklin County auditors are required to conduct an appraisal of all properties every six years.** Because of our county’s size, it’s usually about a two-year process that includes assessing property valuations and making tax adjustments accordingly.&nbsp;

Once every three years, the county will carry out its **Triennial Update,** wherein it’ll review recent market statistics to keep current with fluctuations in property values. As far as our area is concerned, we’ve seen a significant rise in values over the last few years, so we can expect Franklin County to take that into account as they assign newly adjusted valuations. The next Triennial Update and official county appraisal are scheduled for 2020 and 2023, respectively.&nbsp;

Given that the Triennial Update is just around the corner, it might be a good idea for you to inquire into your property tax bill once it’s concluded, which you can do by visiting the county auditor’s [website](https://www.franklincountyauditor.com/real-estate/appraisals/reappraisal-faq){: target="_blank"}. &nbsp;

**If you don’t agree with the county’s adjustment of your home’s value, there’s a process by which you can contest the findings.** As it happens, I’m familiar with the paperwork because I’ve personally been through the process, so if you’d like some assistance, I’d be more than happy to help. &nbsp;

If you have any questions or would like some help filing a property value complaint with the Franklin County Board of Revision, please give me a call at 614-323-4348, email me at DonaldPayne@VisionRealty.com, or visit me online at VisionRealty.com. I look forward to hearing from you\!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
