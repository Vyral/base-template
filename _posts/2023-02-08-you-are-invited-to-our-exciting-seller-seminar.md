We just wanted to take a quick minute to personally invite you to our upcoming seller seminar! If you haven’t heard about it already, this seminar is a great event that we host every year for anyone who wants to sell their home. This year's seminar will be on Saturday, February 11, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.

**At this event, we will go over the selling process, how to get your home ready for the market, some important stats, and more.** We will also have a variety of other professionals there to walk you through their side of the transaction, like title insurance agents, lenders, and home inspectors. We are all excited to be there to answer your questions.&nbsp;

We would love to see you there. You can [RSVP by clicking here](https://www.alaskatopagent.com/Pages/Seminar.aspx), and we will be sure to have a seat and some lunch ready for you. This is your last chance to jump aboard, so don’t wait! If you have any questions, call us at (907) 240-2804. We hope to see you at the seminar!
