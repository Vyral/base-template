Accountability is an essential quality for any successful real estate agent.
Take it from my friend, Ricky Cain.

Today I’m at the Keller Williams Realty Southwest market center with Ricky Cain of The Cain Team of Austin. Today, Ricky is going to talk with us about being accountable as an agent. Accountability is the most important thing you can do to ensure your success, Ricky says.

It starts by being accountable to a time-blocked schedule. **That way, you can accomplish the things that you need to get done when you need to get them done.** If it’s not in your schedule, it doesn’t exist. That’s a big BOLD principle.

In addition to being accountable to your schedule, you need to be accountable to your goals. Break them down to weekly and monthly goals, starting with a “1-3-5” or a “GPS” where you are breaking down the one thing that you absolutely have to accomplish this year that will make it the best year you ever had, then breaking it down to those three primary actions and five secondary actions within those primary actions that you intend on completing. Then, create a 4-1-1 plan that incorporates your 1-3-5.

**That all sounds easy and good, but who is going to hold you accountable to staying on track?** For us, it’s our MAPS coaches, our family, and ourselves. You need all three to maximize your productivity. It’s better to stick to a plan and have your goals exceeded than try to fit everything else in on the side.

This information all comes from “The One Thing” by Gary Keller. If you haven’t read it yet, stop what you’re doing and read it now. They also have some great podcast and webinars.

Thanks to Rick for joining us today. If you need any help in Austin, send him an email to Ricky@TheCainTeam.com. If you need anything else, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
