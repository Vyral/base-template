To truly thrive in the real estate business, you need more than just training. For example, here at Abby Realty, we help our agents succeed by providing a complete agent development program. There are four components to this program.

The first is **contract mastery.** I believe that agents should be masters of the documents. We should know what every paragraph means and be able to fill in every blank. Of course, the best way to learn this is by being in an environment that provides training and consultations, which is why we hold live contract mastery classes every week.

Speaking of that, the next component is our **business-building classes.** Lead generation and conversion, client servicing, and business planning are just some of the subjects we focus on during these weekly classes.

Beyond that, we provide peer support, or what we call **accountability.** We run business development groups that include a heavy dose of peer accountability. A lot of agents hear the word “accountability” and think someone’s going to reprimand them if they don’t keep their commitments, but we see accountability as just holding up a mirror so you can see yourself as you are and reflect honestly about the commitments you’ve made to yourself.

The fourth and final component of this program is **24/7 access to all of these tools.** We film all of our classes and broadcast them on our Youtube channel so agents can access this material any time they need to.

You might’ve noticed that I didn’t mention broker support because that’s my job. My passion is to help you access all components of this program so you can take your business to any level you desire.

If you have any questions about this program or you’d like to sit down for a free, no-obligation business consultation, give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you.
