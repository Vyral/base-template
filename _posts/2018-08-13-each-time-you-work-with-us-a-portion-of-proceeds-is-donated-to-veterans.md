Did you know that every time we do a loan for one of you or someone you refer to us, some of the proceeds go toward a great cause? **We’ve aligned ourselves with Homes for Troops**—a really unique organization that has helped thousands of disabled troops build customized homes when they return from deployment.

These homes can be designed to include specialized features like lower countertops, wider hallways, and accessible bathrooms.

**Next time you, a friend, a family member, or anyone else you know needs professional mortgage services, we hope you’ll think of us.** When you work with our team, you not only receive great service, but you also get to help us give back to our nation’s service members.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
