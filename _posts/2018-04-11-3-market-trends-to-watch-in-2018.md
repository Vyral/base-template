A lot of people ask me every day what the market is like right now and what they can expect in 2018. **Here are three things I want you to think about:**

**1. We’ll see continued appreciation throughout Salt Lake County.** Since 2011, the median price has increased 50% and has risen from $216,000 to almost $325,000 today. We saw a 10% increase last year and are projecting an 8% increase this year. That will bring us up to a median price right around $350,000.

**2. Interest rates are on the rise.** From December 2017 until now, we’ve seen a 0.5% increase in rates, pricing some buyers out of the market. We might see another 0.5% increase by the end of the year. The Fed is projecting four small rate hikes throughout the year which could bring us up to around 5%.

**3. The perceived low inventory.** The number of listings for all types of homes in Salt Lake County has been pretty consistent for all types of homes over the last four years, right around 22,500. It’s a perceived shortage that may be due to the high rates of net in migration and strong employment growth, rather than a decline in the number of listings.

So what does this mean? Are we headed for another great recession? I don't think so. Lending standards are much tighter than they were back then, and household debt has not ballooned like it has in the past. Also, home flipping isn’t nearly as popular as it used to be and the secondary subprime mortgage market no longer exists.

**This year, both household growth and net in migration are projected to be at near-record levels.** This is going to support very strong demand and prices will continue to go up. Couple that with rising interest rates and you’ll see that the best time to buy or sell a home is right now. 

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
