<br>If you’re curious about a career in real estate or are interested in joining a top team (like ours), **I invite you to attend my upcoming meet and greet on July 7**.

You’ll have the opportunity to learn about the many roles available in our industry and The Wolek Group. Your attendance is a simple way to get to know us better, and see whether you’d be a good fit. We’re happy to help discover the career path that’s right for you, and we’re always looking for great team members to join us as we help over 100 families a year buy or sell homes in the Tulsa area.

**Our sales team and operations staff have open positions**, so make sure you share this event with others who might be a great fit as well. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to me. I’m here to help, and I look forward to seeing you\!
