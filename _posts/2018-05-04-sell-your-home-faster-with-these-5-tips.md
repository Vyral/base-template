Today I'm going to be giving you five tips to getting your Wilmington, North Carolina home sold this spring<br>&nbsp;<br>Your goal whenever you list your house for sale is to get it sold fast and for top dollar. With these five tips, you can easily do just that.<br>&nbsp;<br>**1) Give your house curb appeal.** Trimming the shrubs, manicuring the landscape by adding some mulch or pine straw to the front of the house, and repainting your front door can give your home a much-needed facelift.

{% include pullquote.html %}<br>&nbsp;<br>**2) Declutter and depersonalize the house.** &nbsp;When a buyer visits your home, they must be able to envision themselves living there. Removing personal touches, like family photos, will give it a neutral feel, and decluttering storage spaces will make your home seem more spacious.<br>&nbsp;<br>**3) Clean the outside of your home.** Pressure washing the exterior gives everything a nice clean feeling leaving buyers less distracted when they walk up. Washing driveways and sidewalks can also greatly improve the appearance of your home.<br>&nbsp;<br>**4) Clean the inside of your home.** I recommend getting a professional cleaner. You want to make sure that your home is not distracting. If you don't have a very clean house, that is what buyers will notice first.<br>&nbsp;<br>**5) Add fresh interior paint and replace carpets.** New paint can make a place look new. Another option is replacing carpets. I donâ€™t suggest everyone does this, however. Not every home needs new carpet, but if your current carpet is old or is trapping unpleasant pet odors, for example, it may be time to swap it out.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I would be happy to come out and give you a couple extra tips on what you can do to make your home look its best for a quicker sale.
