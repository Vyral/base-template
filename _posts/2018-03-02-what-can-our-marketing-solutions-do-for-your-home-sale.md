<center><em>The real estate industry has changed dramatically. Today, I&rsquo;d like to explain how we&rsquo;ve stayed up-to-date to provide quality service for our clients.</em></center>

The real estate industry has changed dramatically in the last couple of decades. In the past, buyers had to search for properties by driving around to look for signs or by visiting a Realtor who had a list of available homes.&nbsp;

**These days, buyers can go online and access tens of thousands of property listings.** The role of a Realtor is now more focused on guiding buyers through the real estate process than it is about making them aware of available homes.&nbsp;

Today’s Realtors are responsible for telling buyers which listings provide a good deal, whether certain neighborhoods will fit their needs, and additional information about the homes a buyer is looking at.

These changes to our industry have influenced sellers, as well. Now, **it is more important than ever for Realtors to market properties to the fullest extent.** Modern marketing can now be done through video tours, high-definition photography, drone videos, and more.&nbsp;
