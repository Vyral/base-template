I’m often asked by other agents how they can find a mentor or if I can work with them as their mentor.

The answer I always give them is the story of how I found my own mentor. When I first started in the

business, I was looking for someone to help me get to the next level. I asked an agent if he could

be my mentor; he responded saying that, no, he wouldn’t, but he did invite me to join him when he

went to visit a homeless shelter.

While I was there with him to help the people at the shelter, I came to the realization that I was being

tested. He was trying to see where my heart was—if I was willing to be a giving spirit. Before he

imparted any of the knowledge onto me, he wanted to know if I was willing to do the same

thing.

If you are looking for a mentor in the real estate industry—or, really, any type of industry—ask them

what they do for volunteer work. What do they do to give back to the community? Then, when they

answer, ask if you can join them. I guarantee if you’re willing to step into that world with them, they’ll

be willing to show you what they know in terms of your career to help you get to the next level.
