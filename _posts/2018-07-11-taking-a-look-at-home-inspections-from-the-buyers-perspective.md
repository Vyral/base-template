When a buyer purchases a home, they tend to get excited. But when the inspection report comes in, detailing everything wrong with the property in a 53-page document, it can quickly become a different story.&nbsp;

The purpose of the home inspection is two-fold. It is for the home inspector to make sure that **the buyer is aware of everything that needs to be repaired**, as well as the overall condition of the home. It also details **how to operate the systems and appliances within the home.**

Once the buyer has received the home inspection report, they will have to decide whether to submit a request for repairs. The expectation from buyers is that the seller is obligated to repair everything. That is not the case.

**The seller is not obligated to to make any repairs.** A lot of times there are a few code requirements that are required prior to the close of escrow, but outside of that, the seller does not have to agree to the buyer's request for repairs.

There are a couple things to keep in mind about this, however. If the house has been on the market for a few months and this is the only offer in town, itâ€™s more likely the seller is going to be to work with the buyer on those repair requests. On the other hand, if it is a home that has six or seven offers and sells for $30,000 over the list price, the seller is less likely to take care or your repair requests.

If the seller decides not to fix something, remember **the buyer has the right to terminate the contract and receive their initial deposit back from escrow at no charge.**
