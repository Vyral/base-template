<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Today Im joined by a special guest, Suzi Cooper of RPM Mortgage, who is here to explain first-time homebuyer programs as well as how to purchase property in todays market. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">As you likely already know, **our area is currently in somewhat of a housing crisis.** But if youve been forced to move from place to place while renting under various, unreliable landlords, dont give up. There are strategies you can implement to purchase your own home. 
<div class="quote-box"><span class="quote quote-left"> 
<div class="quote-text">There are strategies you can implement to purchase your own home. 
<span class="quote quote-right"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">A program called the Home Ready Mortgage, for example, is one Suzi was excited to share with us. With this program, buyers need as little as 3% down and the income requirements are very flexible. As long as you can prove it, you can have income coming from roommates, family members, or elsewhere. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Actually, Ive got a listing I think could be perfect. Its a 3-bedroom, 1-bath, with a two-car garage and a view of Donner Lake. This house also has a studio right above it. Right now, its priced at $425,000. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">At this price, you would need to pay 15% downwhich in this case would be $63,750 with monthly payments of $2,314. The rent for the studio is currently $1,200. So, if you were to rent it out, you could take it out of your monthly payments and be left with less than half of what you were paying previously. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">**This is an opportunity that doesnt come around often.** In fact, you have several options you could implement here. If you would prefer, you could live in the studio and rent out the house, instead. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">We also have a few single-family homes in this price range, as well. **When it comes to these kinds of properties, you can put as little as 3% down with the Home Ready Mortgage.** 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">To utilize this program youll need about a credit score of 660 to 680, and for the FHA you need a score of about 580. Theres really a lot of flexibility. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">The first step is to speak to a local expert, like Suzi, who can look at your income, assets, and finances and help you determine what path to take moving forward. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
