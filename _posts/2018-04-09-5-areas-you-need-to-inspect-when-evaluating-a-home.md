When searching for a home, there are five areas you need to focus on to make sure everything is in working order:

**1. Roof**

**2. Plumbing**

**3. HVAC**

**4. Foundation**

**5. Electrical**

These areas can not only affect how you live in the home, but they can also affect that home’s resale value and determine how much cost you’ll have to bear when selling it.

Starting with the roof, you’ll need to know how old it is and whether it’s been entirely replaced or just the shingles have been replaced. Typically, the home’s owner will know the age of the roof, unless it’s an older home that’s never had a roof replacement.

As the joke in Texas goes, “Just wait and you’ll get a new roof pretty quickly,” which means because we have so many storms here, you have a lot of chances to get your roof replaced, and oftentimes the insurance company will take care of that. Your home inspector will recommend whether you need a professional to look at the roof before you make a repair request.

Plumbing is an issue to be aware of because of the water damage it can do to your home, so it’s important to look for any damage that’s been done to the home from previous leaks. You’ll also want to check outside for any hose bib damage.

When it comes to the HVAC unit, if this is not functioning properly, it will make a huge difference in how you live in the home and cost you upwards of $6,000 to replace. In an older home, not only would you have to replace the entire HVAC system, but you’d also have to replace the ductwork, which can be very expensive as well.

The foundation is an important factor to be aware of because of the soil composition in Texas, and foundation repairs can cost anywhere from $3,000 to $30,000.

Lastly, whether or not the home’s electrical system needs to be replaced or repaired will depend on when the home was built. If it was built during the 1970s, it likely has knob-and-tube wiring, which can be a fire hazard. Another thing to look out for is Federal Pacific panels, which are also a fire hazard. For safety reasons, you should ask for these to be replaced if you find them.** For newer homes, you generally shouldn’t have to worry about having to replace anything electrical.**
