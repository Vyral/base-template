Are you thinking about buying a condo and don’t know where to start?

I’m here to help. These are the 20 questions that you should ask when buying a condo:

1. What is the condition of the unit, the building, and the entire complex?<br>2. Where are the common areas and are they well-maintained?<br>3. **How many condos are for sale?** A high number may indicate issues.<br>4. What percentage of units in the building are owner-occupied? As a general rule, the higher the number, the better, as they would take better care of the building.<br>5. **How much are the condo fees?** Have they risen recently? What is their percentage increase over the years? What’s included in your fees?<br>6. What are the cash reserves for emergencies? Are their fees adequate to cover emergency repairs? If not, you would have to pay special assessment.<br>7. **What is the temperament of the strata?** This could affect your enjoyment and your living in this building.<br>8. Any lawsuits? Pending losses may mean a lot of things, but for mortgage financing, lenders don’t usually lend to buildings that have lawsuits.<br>9. What does the strata insurance cover? An underinsured building may mean extra money spent by you if something happens.<br>10. **What is the level of debt of the strata?** Underperforming strats may mean extra costs to you.<br>{% include pullquote.html %}<br>11. Are any units behind on their strata fees?<br>12. **Are there any special assessments?** Anything owed may become the buyer’s responsibility.<br>13. What’s the neighborhood like during the morning, day, and evening?<br>14. Does the unit come with parking?<br>15. When it comes to visitor parking, how many spots are there?<br>16. How much storage is there? Condo living is tight, and knowing how much storage you have is important to store anything like sports equipment.<br>17. **How good is the management company?** Are they are a reputable company?<br>18. Does the management resolve complaints quickly?<br>19. Does the strata limit the amount of rentals? How about Airbnb?<br>20. Are there other restrictions, like pet and age restrictions?

These are the 20 questions I would ask if I were buying a condo. If you have any other real estate questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would be happy to help you!
