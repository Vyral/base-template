There's no doubt about it, it's a very competitive market today if you are looking to buy a home.

Inventory is near record lows, and more and more homebuyers are entering the market. This means **you need every advantage to grab that perfect home** when you do find it.

One no-brainer is to get pre-approved for a mortgage. A pre-approval informs you of how much you can borrow and **it's something you will need to do at a later point anyway.**

A pre-approval can mean the difference between having your offer accepted or having to watch your dream home go to somebody else in a crazy market like this.

In spite of all these good reasons, **less than 10% of buyers who got a mortgage also got pre-approved by the lender who originated the loan.** In other words, you can definitely get a leg up on the competition by starting your home search at the loan office rather than at the open house.

Here are a few things that you will need:

1. **Proof of income.** At a minimum, lenders will want to see pay stubs from the past 30 days showing your year-to-date income, two years of federal tax returns, and two years of W-2 forms from your employer.
2. **Proof of assets.** You will need to present statements from your checking, savings, or investment accounts to prove that you have funds for the down payment and closing costs.
3. **Good credit.** Most lenders reserve the best rates for homebuyers with a credit score of 740 or above. You can still qualify for a mortgage with a lower credit score, but a good lender will also recommend ways that you can improve your credit and qualify for a better loan.

These are the biggest and most common things you will need to get pre-approved, though your lender might want to see some other documents as well.

Once you are pre-approved, the buying process will be faster, more convenient, and less stressful. Most importantly, it will make it more likely that your offer for that perfect home gets accepted.
