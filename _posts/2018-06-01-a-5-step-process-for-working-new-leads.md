Once you’ve entered a new lead into your CRM, what comes next?

There are actually just five steps to working a new lead in your CRM. So, allow me to share each of these with you today.

**1. Orient yourself on the new lead.** Check out the source of the lead, review their activity history, find out their name and contact information, and make note of any other important details you discover.<br> 

**2. Call them.** Start by introducing yourself and explaining your intentions. Let them know what you can do for them.<br> 

**3. Add notes to your CRM about the call.** Write down whether you reached them, what their real estate goals are, what their timeline looks like, and anything else you found to be important about the call.

**4. If it’s a buyer lead, create a custom property search.** If it’s a seller lead, create a custom market report. Both of these things prove to the lead that you’re willing and able to be a resource for them. The custom property search you create for buyers allows them to receive a daily list of homes that match their wants and needs. The market report you send to seller leads will provide them with a  monthly snapshot of local statistics.<br> 

**5. Establish a time to follow up.** After you make your initial call, determine a time in the future when you can reach out again to further discuss their needs. Always have a plan for following up with every lead you put in your database.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
