I just got a report with all the latest statistics from the Charleston real estate market and I wanted to share some of the most important numbers with you. **These five statistics paint a promising picture of our market and show just how far we’ve come since the recession.**

1. **New listings.** Almost 23,000 new homes have come on the market in the last 12 months.

2. **Home sales.** How many homes were sold during the same time frame? Some of you may be under the impression that every home that comes on the market is selling. However, that’s not what’s happening in reality. Out of those 23,000 listings, only 17,700 sold. That means there are between 5,000 and 6,000 properties that failed to sell. Regardless of what you think about the market, I encourage you to make sure that your Realtor has a strong marketing plan in place to sell your home. That's really the only way to guarantee a sale in this market.

3. **Median sale price.** This is intriguing. During the recession, the median sale price was around $180,000. Today, it’s at $240,000. It’s increased by over $50,000 in the past five years, but there are people who still think their home won’t sell. If that’s the impression you're under, I invite you to give us a call. If you tell us how much you owe and how much you’d like to sell for, we would be happy to give you our honest, professional opinion if that is doable.

4. **Market time.** How long does it take a home to sell on average? Over the past 12 months, the answer is 58 days.

5. **Average showings.** Finally, let’s look at the average number of showings it takes for a home to get an offer. Right now, homes are getting offers after an average of 11 showings.

If you’re interested in learning more and taking a better look at these statistics, you can view them in their entirety here.
