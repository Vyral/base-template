As we head into the summer months and the third quarter, it’s a good time to look back and see how the market is doing so far this year, as well as look at what is driving the market now.

**Demand is incredibly strong right now,** as is demonstrated by the low inventory in certain price points. Interest rates are still at historic lows, which is driving a lot of the buyer demand.

Overall, inventory in our market is down 29% from this time last year. In the higher price points, those statistics changed. Demand is strongest for homes under $300,000. Inventory in this price point has dropped by 54% year over year. Multiple offer situations are incredibly common in this price point.

In the $300,000 to $600,000 price point, inventory has dropped 23% compared to this time last year. This market is still strong.

When you look at the $600,000 to $900,000 price range, the market is not as strong as it is in those lower price points. Inventory dropped 14% year over year, but this is still a good market.

We should start to see inventory creep up over the next few months, as buyers tend to slow down a bit in the summer. **However, the market is still doing very well overall.**
