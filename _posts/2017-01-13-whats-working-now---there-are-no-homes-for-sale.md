Welcome back to another edition of “What’s Working Now!" Today we’re going to discuss… wait, shh, listen to the lament of today's serious buyers, "There are no homes for sale right now!"

It’s true—there is a continuing trend in our market that has created an incredible opportunity for home sellers to make more money. The weather is cold outside and many are under the impression that no one is out looking at homes right now.

In reality, buyers are saying they want to buy, they are well-qualified to buy, and there are no homes for sale right now. **If I were to put your home on the market now, it would probably be sold within a week or sooner!** Just the other day, I had an open house Sunday afternoon and Sunday night the seller had the pick of 3 offers and sold for more than full price.

**Even if you’re not quite ready to sell, this is a hard opportunity to pass up.** Mortgage interest rates have increased, and buyers have a sense of urgency to get into a home before rates go up even more.

It’s important to hire an agent who possesses creativity and can help you show your home even before it’s ready. By selling now, you can take advantage of the many well-qualified buyers out there who are looking to purchase before those rates increase.

Next time, we’ll continue this conversation and talk about what our current market conditions mean for buyers. If you are thinking of buying or selling or if you just have a question about real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
