To hiring managers, little things truly do make a big difference. What exactly does that mean for you?

Because of the high volume of people hiring managers interview, standing out is critical. Qualifications aside, being memorable can greatly improve your chances of nailing an interview.

**If you are the only one of 10 interviewees who differentiates themselves, you are already in a better position than the rest.**

There are a couple things that have made a difference for us here at Govig & Associates. First is having handwritten notes. In today’s technologically-inclined world, handwritten notes are not only different, but also show that you have a high level of interest.

Next, include a lot of detail in follow-up emails. Following up after an interview is essential, but going a step above by talking about what you learned and why you’re a good fit can really set you apart from other applicants.

In any email communication, though, **be very careful of your spelling, grammar, and punctuation.&nbsp;**This not only shows the hiring manager your interest level and your writing abilities, but also your sense of email etiquette.

Subconsciously, humans tend to judge other people based on their appearances within the first 30 seconds of meeting them. This first impression is critical, so it’s important to dress for success. You don’t need an expensive outfit, but choose one that fits well and looks clean and professional.

Your first impression should also extend to your actions, too. When greeting your interviewer, have a firm handshake with eye contact. This shows confidence and control.

Last but not least, remember the hiring manager’s name. **People tend to subconsciously like you more when you repeat their name at some point in the conversation.** It shows that you pay attention and also gives a personal touch.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
