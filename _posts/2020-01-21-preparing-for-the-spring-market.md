If you plan on selling your home in the spring of 2020, now is the time to start thinking about what you must do to prepare it for the market. Winter in Minnesota is actually a great time to get any indoor projects done because we spend much of our time indoors anyway.&nbsp;

Start with a timeline in mind. **December and January are good months to do an initial consultation with your Realtor.** If you call us, we’ll come out to your home, give it a quick walk-through, and give you a list of things you should do to your home to get it market-ready. These tasks can include cleaning, decluttering, painting, and staging.

If you’re curious what your home is worth right now, we can certainly run the numbers and give you an accurate estimate, but listing in spring means you should fine-tune your home’s price according to its listing date.&nbsp;

Generally speaking, **the spring market in Minnesota starts after the Super Bowl,** or early-to-mid February. This isn’t a hard and fast rule, though—things can change depending on the weather, inventory levels, etc. that being said, you should still be ready to list by that date.&nbsp;

If you have any specific questions about what you must do to prepare for the spring market or there’s anything else we can help you with, don’t hesitate to call or email us. We’d love to speak with you.
