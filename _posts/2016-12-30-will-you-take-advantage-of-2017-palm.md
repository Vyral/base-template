Three groups will have big opportunities in the 2017 Palm Beach real estate market. Today I’ll explain how the groups stand to benefit from market conditions.

We believe there’s always a great opportunity to be had in the real estate market, and you just have to position yourself to take advantage of it. That’s why today, I wanted to talk a bit about some of the great opportunities that will be available in the Palm Beach market in 2017.

**The first opportunity lies with people currently renting homes.** As a renter, your rent payment goes up when your landlord’s costs go up. By buying a house in 2017, you can lock in two things: your interest rate and your property taxes. If you rent, it’s time to get off the fence and into your new home. 

Move-up buyers also have big opportunities in 2017. Many homeowners have a home in a seller’s market price range, giving them the perfect chance to move up into their dream home. **If you own a house under $400,000, it’s likely the best time for you to take advantage of the record-low rates and the cooling luxury market.** You would be selling in a seller’s market and likely moving up to a buyer’s market.

Finally, the third big opportunity is for those of you looking to buy real estate as an investment to have tenants and positive cash flow.

If you have any questions about how you can take advantage of the market in 2017, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to help you.

Finally, if you take a look in the video above, you’ll see that I’m in an iconic part of Palm Beach. Do you know where I am? Send your guess and you might just win a prize! All you have to do is reply to this email with your guess.

I hope to hear from you soon!
