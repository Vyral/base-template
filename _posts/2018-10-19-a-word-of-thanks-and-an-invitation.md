I’m so thankful to all of you who showed up for our client event and fundraiser. It was great to see you all and have an opportunity to connect with you. Even though I didn’t get enough time to speak with all of you, I at least go to see your lovely faces and watch the awesome movie that I’d been wanting to see forever.

We were able to help a lot of people in North Carolina. As you know, we match whatever is donated, and thanks to your contributions, **we collected over 5,000 pounds of food.** Though transporting the supplies was difficult, it was worth it. We got to meet and help people who had lost everything, and I’m so grateful that I had the opportunity to pay it forward.

**Our next client event will be coming up soon: Operation Gratitude.** For this event, we’ll be collecting any donated leftover Halloween candy to be sent to our troops. Collection will begin on **November 1 and end on November 5 at our office, between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m**. Be sure to stop by during that time to donate any of your leftover Halloween candy.

Thank you so much for helping us accomplish what we have to help people in need. I love you all and really appreciate you being in my life.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I hope to see you at our upcoming event!
