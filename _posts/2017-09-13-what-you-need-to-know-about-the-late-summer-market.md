As we move from summer into fall, let’s pause for a quick market update.&nbsp;

First of all, is the market still hot? It depends on the inventory. If you are a buyer or seller in the $300,000 and under price range, inventory is still very tight—with only** two weeks of inventory available.**&nbsp;

If you are buying or selling in the $400,000 to $700,000 price range, there are some interesting things happening. Sellers are getting a little aggressive and price reductions are becoming more common.&nbsp;

Interest rates continue to hover in the fours or just below, so there is still strong incentive for buyers to get out there and make a move.

What does all of this mean to you?&nbsp;

If you’re a buyer in the $300,000 and under range, the competition is stiff. Multiple offers are common, so be prepared for that.&nbsp;

**If you are a buyer or seller above $400,000, price reductions are more common**. If you are a seller, make sure that you are priced a bit more aggressively than the competition. If you are a buyer, there could be some room for negotiation, so be ready.&nbsp;
