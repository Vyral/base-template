Thanks for joining us once again, as we continue to give you the most up-to-date information about real esate on the Wasatch Front. This time of year, all of our clients have been asking us what to expect in 2015 from a real estate perspective. So let's take a look at what we believe is in store for the housing market in 2015.


First of all, we are starting out at a much stronger pace than we did at this time last year. With the government shutdown, a lot of the nation experienced a slow down in real estate last year. Overall, oursales volume is down about 4.5% on the Wasatch Front, however the median home price is up 3% which is a good thing.

What we are looking for in 2015 is simple: a stable supply of homes. Anywhere from a 4-6 month supply of homes is considered a balanced market , and that's what we would like to see. We firmly believe inventory will stabilize in 2015 and we will see a moderate amount of housing appreciation. 

Thanks again for taking a moment to check out our predictions for 2015. If you have any questions for us at all, don't be shy. Give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help out!
