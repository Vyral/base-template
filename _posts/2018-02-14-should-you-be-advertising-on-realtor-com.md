A lot of people have been asking me recently about how to advertise on Realtor.com.
{: .present-before-paste}

There are actually two different ways to advertise on this website: Connections With Buyers and Advantage Pro. Today, I’ll start with some of the things I like and dislike about each of these options.
{: .present-before-paste}

Let’s start with Advantage Pro. In my opinion, Advantage Pro is something every Realtor should be paying for. It’s pretty simple. You’re paying to get the leads from your listings.

**The way Realtor.com charges depends on how many listings you carry, the average price point of those listings, and how many of listings you sell.&nbsp;**These and other factors are put into an algorithm to give you the price you’ll end up paying for this service.
{: .present-before-paste}

Think of it this way: An agent in California who is selling $2 million properties should probably be paying more for their leads than an agent in our local area selling properties at an average list price of $100,000.
{: .present-before-paste}

For me and my market, I have an average price point of $285,000. So, I’m paying about $40 to $43 per lead through Advantage Pro. At the end of the day, I’m getting a 4.5x return on my investment. **When you buy an Advantage Pro lead, you are the only agent who has access to that lead.**

These Realtor.com leads also often convert a lot faster than leads you get from other sources.

The other way to invest in Realtor.com is by using Connections With Buyers, which is where you are purchasing ZIP code leads. There are two ways to use this.
{: .present-before-paste}

{: .present-before-paste}

You can either purchase a lead and be the only agent who receives that specific lead, or you can share the lead with another Realtor. In the latter option, you and another Realtor, chosen at random, have an equal opportunity to capture the lead. It all comes down to who is able to reach out more quickly. Splitting leads as opposed to having sole access actually makes the investment more cost-effective.
{: .present-before-paste}

If you’re really good at lead conversion and have a quick response time, there’s no reason you shouldn’t be splitting leads when using this service. In fact, the ROI on these leads is higher when you split them. When you split these leads, the ROI can be between 3.5x or 4x your investment. If you aren’t splitting them, the ROI on those leads is about 2.5x your investment.
{: .present-before-paste}

**I personally don’t invest in Connections With Buyers anymore, though. In my opinion, it just isn’t worth it.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
