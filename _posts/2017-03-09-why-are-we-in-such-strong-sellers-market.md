We are in an extremely strong seller’s market now, despite slightly increasing interest rates. That said, sellers need a strategy if they want to capitalize on this great market.

Right now, we are in a strong seller’s market.

Interest rates are still historically low even though they have started to creep up a little. Now that the election is over and rates are still low, things are really selling pretty quick. Inventory is extremely low for the number of buyers out there and as a result, **homes are selling within a couple of days.**

We have a great strategy to help sellers get top dollar in this market: our “Coming Soon!” program. We put up a “Coming Soon!” sign in your yard two weeks before your listing goes live on the MLS. That way, we get plenty of calls about the house before it comes on the market.

By driving up buyer demand, this program helps you get multiple offers and higher prices because buyers do not want to miss out on your house. Then, you get to choose the best offer. Another benefit of this program is that our houses are selling very quickly.

**Rates will creep up soon** but if you’ve been thinking about selling, now is a great time to get a record-high price for your home.

If you’re curious about what your home is worth in today’s market or you have any other questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
