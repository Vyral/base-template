How does Zillow determine home value?&nbsp;

As a premier agent on Zillow, I can tell you that they do a great job of packaging listings for consumers. Whether you are checking out home values in your area or looking to see what listings are on the market, Zillow does a great job with all of that.&nbsp;

If you’re a serious buyer or seller, though, there are a few things you should know about Zillow’s Zestimate.&nbsp;

For example, here is a listing of mine in East Greenwich at 25 Oakbrook Ct. You have access to pictures, property details, a map, school information, virtual tours, and more. You will also see the property’s Zestimate. In this case, the Zestimate is $827,061 and my list price is $849,000.&nbsp;

Why are they different? Let me explain.

According to Zillow, the Zestimate is computed using a proprietary formula. It is not an appraisal. It is a starting point in determining a home’s value. The Zestimate is calculated from public and user-submitted data, taking into account special features, location, and market conditions derived from public records.&nbsp;

The key here is that a **Zestimate is not an appraisal,** which is ultimately the best way to determine a home’s value. We know that public data is far from perfect, so it’s important not to use the Zestimate as a precise home value. Zillow does not know that your home has beautiful water views or is in a desirable neighborhood with top-rated schools. Therefore, Zestimates can be way off. I’ve seen Zestimates off by as much as 20%, but sometimes they are accurate, especially if there are many very similar homes sold in a specific zip code.

For example, let’s say there’s a beautiful home for sale on a busy street, which negatively affects a home’s value. An appraiser will adjust for the inferior condition because he visits the area, knows the property, and can see the street. The Zestimate will not make this adjustment and show a higher value, which can be very frustrating for buyers and sellers.&nbsp;

That’s why it’s very important to hire an expert Realtor, like me, to determine a home’s value. There are three primary factors Realtors and appraisers use to determine a home’s value:&nbsp;

1. **Location:** Homes in prime neighborhoods in top-rated school districts or near water and convenient amenities will have a higher value.&nbsp;
2. **Condition:** Most buyers want updated homes that are turnkey. Therefore, these homes will demand a higher sale price. Spend some time preparing your home to sell. I always do a pre-listing home presentation and staging consultation with my seller clients.&nbsp;
3. **Past sales:** Past sales play the most important role in determining a home value. Comparable homes in the same location and in similar condition sold within the last six months are used by Realtors and appraisers to help determine your home’s market value.&nbsp;

That’s why it’s important to call me so that I can do a full market evaluation of your home and neighborhood. If you price your home too low, you’ll leave money on the table. If you price your home too high, the buyer will just overlook it.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions about real estate, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!<br>&nbsp;
