Today I’ll be sharing some secrets to maximize your time as a busy professional. However, if you have good ideas for topics, or if there is something you’d like to hear more about, please don’t hesitate to contact me.
1. **Tap into the power of ‘Now’**: Do it now, read it now, make it now.

2. **Relentlessly focus on one thing at a time**: Multi-tasking has been proven to be extremely ineffective, so stay focused on one thing at a time.

3. **Be decisive but also purposefully delay decisions**: Some decisions are easy - like what to have for lunch. But others will require more time. Perhaps you should take a run or ride a bike to clear your mind before making a major decision.
4. **Do the most-feared thing first**: Stop procrastinating your least favorite task. Get it out of the way and get on with your day.

Learn to say no to things that don’t advance your company: Learn to say 'no' to things that create little value for you and your company.  We were constantly being invited to events, and many of them were great, but we had to start saying no at some point.
Do one more: When you’re calling prospects, just try to call one extra person. Or when you’re mailing newsletters, just try to mail one extra out to someone.
Learn when to cut your losses: We’ve all had bad systems, bad clients, or bad strategies. Instead of sticking with them and hurting your business, you have to know when to call it quits.
I hope you’ve found these tips helpful, and I love hearing from everyone so please don’t be afraid to reach out to me!
