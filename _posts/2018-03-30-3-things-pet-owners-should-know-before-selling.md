Today we’re going to talk about how to sell your home if you own a pet. A lot of folks really don’t think that it’s possible because of all the odor, dandruff, and damage. **However, you can overcome this in three easy steps:**

**1. Have the interior of your home professionally cleaned.** Get a professional crew in to clean all of the carpets, drapes, and furniture to help get rid of the pet odor.

**2. Make sure any pet damage is repaired.** Whether the damage is to walls, carpets, or outdoor areas, get those things fixed. It will pay big dividends when it comes to the final sale price.

**3. Take the pet somewhere during showings.** Remove your pet and all signs of them from the premises while your home is being shown. A lot of people are allergic or get nervous around them. If they’re out of sight and out of mind, things will be a lot easier for you.

There are my top tips. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
