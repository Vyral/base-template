Are you sure that you are ready to purchase a home? Today I have a list of the five signs that you may not actually be ready.

**1.  The terms of your mortgage look like a trail mix of loans.** This is a red flag that you probably cannot afford the home you want to purchase.

**2.  Down payments.** If you are not prepared to come to closing with a down payment and are solely relying on the seller paying your closing costs, you may not be ready.

**3. You have just enough monthly income to cover your monthly mortgage payment.**

**4. You have to borrow funds from your retirement accounts.**

**5. You have a sinking feeling in your gut.** If you have a bad feeling, you need to listen to what your instincts are saying.

If you have any additional questions or are interested in buying a home when you are ready, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you.
