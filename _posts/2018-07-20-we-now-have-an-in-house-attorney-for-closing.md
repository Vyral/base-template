&nbsp;

Today I want to share some exciting news about a new resource we are offering our clients. We now have an in-house, preferred attorney.

This new member to the team will help close transactions in any of our Grand Strand office locations. They are also going to offer table funding.

This is important because buyers in our area typically have to wait until the transaction is recorded to get the keys to the property. Sellers also have to wait until recording to get their proceeds. However, if you use our in-house, preferred attorney, you do not have to wait until it is recorded.

**This can save you anywhere from several hours to an entire weekendâ€™s worth of time.**

If you have any questions or are looking to buy or sell, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
