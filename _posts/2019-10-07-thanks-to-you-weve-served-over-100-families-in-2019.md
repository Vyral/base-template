{% include youtube.html %}We’re excited to announce that we’ve served over 100 families in 2019. Because of our amazing clients, we’ve been able to help more, give back, have fun, and live large. With every home sold, we’ve been able to give back a portion of our proceeds to Keys to the City—a non-profit dedicated to giving back to our Tulsa community. We wouldn’t be able to do any of this without the amazing support of our family, friends, the people who help our team, and our clients. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

As always, if you need help with anything real estate related, don’t hesitate to give us a call. We’d love to hear from you.
