If you want to sell your home for the highest possible price, avoid these three mistakes as you make your preparations.

Too often, sellers make mistakes that only end up hindering their home sale success. Here are three common examples for you to avoid when you sell your home.

First, **overpricing** your home will only hurt your chances to sell for top dollar. Ordinarily, the agent will provide their seller with a range of pricing options, and that particular seller ignores their agent’s advice in favor of pricing high. That’s a mistake that will likely carry heavy consequences.&nbsp;

Failing to price your home according to current conditions will cause an unfortunate chain reaction: Your home will sit for months on the market, forcing you to make a series of price reductions. When this happens, it invites lowball offers. **Pricing correctly from the start is key to a quick, easy, and profitable sale.**

Another common mistake sellers make is **having a poorly devised marketing plan.** When it comes to marketing strategy, not all agents are created equal. It’s important that your home receives the maximum amount of buyer exposure. To aid your agent in their marketing efforts, advertise your home on social media and ask your friends to share it. It doesn't take much work and it’s a great way to get eyes on your property.&nbsp;

When hiring an agent, choose someone with proven marketing techniques that will not only get buyers’ attention, but will get your home sold. **I firmly believe that the Dar Walden Team and the Madden Team have the best marketing systems in the state of Alaska.&nbsp;**

The final mistake is just as consequential as the first two: **not making the home presentable.** When it’s on the market, your home needs to look immaculate and show-ready at all times. It’s not just about how it appears, though: Your home’s smell is a big part of show-readiness as well.&nbsp;

If you’ve cooked a meal with fish or bacon the night before, the scents tend to linger, which can bring about negative first impressions. At the same time, you also don’t want to go overboard and buy 50 fragrance plug-ins because buyers will suspect that you’ve got something to hide. Find a happy medium instead. &nbsp;

If you’re thinking about selling your home anytime soon, now’s the time to get serious about your preparation. Selling your home takes some work, but preparing up front will be well worth it and will help you achieve a higher sale price.
