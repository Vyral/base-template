A lot of people want to know how our team is able to be so productive. Our agents' 40 transactions per year, do over $10 million in volume, and take home big paychecks. How are they able to do this? A lot of their success is due to one simple tool that will change the way you approach your career.

It’s a simple form called “Dominate your day, win your week!” and it’s something our team members fill out each day. It helps you plan out your day to make it as productive as possible. **There are six steps to personal productivity mastery:**

1. Focus, do not multi-task, and eliminate distractions.
2. Make lists based on dollar-producing activities. 20% of your activities will produce 80% of the results.
3. Prioritize everything you do based on your goals.
4. Protect your time blocks. Plan your day in 30-minute increments and don’t let anything interfere.
5. Eliminate clutter.
6. Plan your week on Sunday and plan each day in advance.

Once you figure out what your top money making activities are, put those on your list first. Then, you can fill out the different time slots, noting when you plan to start and stop. As we move down the form, you have sections for determining how much each activity is worth to you so you can wrap your head around what it will cost you to neglect those activities.

There’s also a section on there for you to write down your “10 wins for the day” to give yourself a more positive focus. **Sometimes a win is setting an appointment. Sometimes it’s having lunch with your spouse.** It’s important to keep things in perspective.

Finally, there’s a section on the form for you to write down notes. Anything that comes to mind during the day can be written, including notes for the day and things you might need to add to your dollar-producing activities.

If you have any questions about this form or would like to get a copy of your own, just give me a call or send me an email and I’d be happy to get you one. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
