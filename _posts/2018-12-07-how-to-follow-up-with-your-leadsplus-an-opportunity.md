When it comes to following up with a lead, my first tip is to **do it with knowledge of what the lead has been calling about.** If someone from your office has taken a call from a person looking to sell their house, take three or four minutes to do some research about their house before you call them back.&nbsp;

Do be quick about calling them back, however; nobody likes to wait if they’re asking for your help. Clients want a salesperson to be knowledgeable about the product they’re selling, and even though real estate is more of a service industry than a sales industry, we still need to have a salesman’s skill set.

If, when you call that lead back, they don’t immediately answer, try sending them a text. **Let them know who you are, why you’ve contacted them, and leave your contact information** so they can return your message. Hopefully, they’ll call you back, but leaving a link to your webpage in addition to your phone number gives them a chance to see your web presence and gain insight into how you do business.

Overall, how do you follow up with a real estate lead? You do it immediately, with competency, and with concern for your prospective client. **If you’re in need of leads, I encourage you to reach out to me. I have good, solid leads, and I would like you to be able to help me service my clients.** Give me a call or send an email if you have any questions about this opportunity.
