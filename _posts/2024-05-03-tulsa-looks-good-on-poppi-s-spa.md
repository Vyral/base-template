## **Escape the Grind and Rejuvenate at Poppi's Spa & Lounge**

Treat yourself (or Mom this Mother's Day!) to a complete wellness experience at Poppi's Spa & Lounge in the heart of downtown Tulsa. Owner TJ Woodbury, a self-proclaimed spa enthusiast, created this unique haven after realizing the lack of a truly immersive spa experience in Tulsa.

**More than just facials and massages,** Poppi's boasts a one-of-a-kind spa lounge featuring:

* **Infrared sauna:** Relax and detox in the soothing heat.
* **Color therapy:** Immerse yourself in a specific light spectrum to target mood and well-being.
* **Salt therapy room:** Breathe easy and improve respiratory health in a calming salt environment.

**Plus, enjoy a variety of spa services** including facials, body treatments, and massages. Poppi's even offers memberships, making self-care a regular and affordable practice.

**Ready to unwind?** Visit Poppi's Spa & Lounge or check out their website for more information and pamper yourself (or someone special) today!
