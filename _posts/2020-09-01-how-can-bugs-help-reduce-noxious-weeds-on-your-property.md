<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s how you can use bugs to get rid of noxious weeds on your property.</em></p>

If you have noxious weeds on your property that you’d like to get rid of, I know of a solution that gives pest control a new meaning.&nbsp;

This spring, I came across a company called <a href="http://www.weedbustersbiocontrol.com/index.html" target="_blank">Weedbusters Biocontrol</a> that uses certain types of insects to reduce noxious weeds. After visiting with them, I placed an order to eliminate two types of noxious weeds on my property: leafy spurge and spotted knapweed.&nbsp;

After you place an order, **they agree to send you the insects needed when the time is right to introduce them to your land and start attacking the weeds.** This doesn’t eliminate them outright, but it does reduce them drastically. The insects are sent to you in a refrigerated cooler, and all you have to do is open it up and release them out into the forest.

I got my first order of insects for the leafy spurge, and about a month after we released them I received an order of weevils to take care of the roots of the spotted knapweed. Two weeks later, I received another order of weevils to take care of the blossoms. There were three releases in total, and hopefully, I’ll be able to give a report several years from now about how well the insects did their job.&nbsp;

It was well worth contacting <a href="http://www.weedbustersbiocontrol.com/index.html" target="_blank">Weedbusters Biocontrol</a>; they’re a great company to work with. All they ask is that you return any coolers they send (along with your payment for the insects). **At 4:09 in the video above, you can see a quick recap of each release.&nbsp;**

If you’d like to know more about my experience using <a href="http://www.weedbustersbiocontrol.com/index.html" target="_blank">Weedbusters Biocontrol</a> or have any real estate questions at all, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help.
