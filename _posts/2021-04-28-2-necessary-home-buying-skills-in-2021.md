Today I’d like to talk about what homebuyers need to succeed in this hot seller’s market. Things are very competitive right now for buyers. They’re facing a lot of competition for the very few homes for sale. In fact, there are 25.7% fewer homes for sale than there were at this time last year. This creates a lot of frustration when you’re not winning. In order to be successful as a buyer in today’s market, you need these two things:

**1\. Patience**. Be patient with your search process. Stay in touch with your agent, keep those communication lines open, and realize that you may not get your first choice every time.

**2\. Act immediately**. When you see a home you like, you need to make an appointment to see it right away. If your agent sends you a home you could see yourself in, reach out to them right away and set up a showing. If you do like the home after the showing, make sure you are ready to make an offer on the spot. That’s just the kind of market we’re in. If you hesitate, you might miss out entirely.

If you want more expert guidance in the home-buying process, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. You can learn more right now by <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="/uploads/ThingstoConsiderWhenBuyingaHome.pdf">downloading a copy of my free home-buying guide</a></u>, but I would love to hear from you as well. Until then, take care and stay safe\!
