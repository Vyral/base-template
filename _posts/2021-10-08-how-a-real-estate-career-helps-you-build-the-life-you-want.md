If you’re looking to make a career change, I highly recommend you consider real estate for a number of reasons. You can make your own hours, and there’s no limit to how much money you can make.&nbsp;**The biggest thing you should understand about a career in real estate is that it’s a sales job at its core.** A lot of people get nervous when they hear the word “sales,” but it’s been a blessing to me.&nbsp;

If you have a strong work ethic and are willing to learn, the income potential is unlimited. You can use real estate to travel, live life how you want, and make a great life. You’re also helping people make one of the largest financial decisions of their lives.

**Since Don Jr. got licensed in 2012, he has been able to reap the benefits of the career by working hard and constantly learning.** He’s been able to travel to places like Indonesia, West Africa, Europe, and Jamaica, just to name a few.
