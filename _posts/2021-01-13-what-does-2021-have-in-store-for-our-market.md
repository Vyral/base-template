<center><em>The future of our market looks good in 2021.</em></center>

<br>2021 is upon us, and it’s an exciting time for the real estate market. Although the economy took several unexpected turns in 2020, the housing market remained on solid ground. There’s a lot of buzz out there about the uncertainty of our economy and housing market, but a lot of that is based on what I call “uninformed noise.”

**In addressing the strength of our housing market in 2021, there are several key factors we need to keep an eye on moving forward**. The first is the fact that inventory is low. Second, homeownership is in high demand due to mortgage rates being as low as 3% (in many cases, even lower).

Third, the real estate industry was one of the first industries to recover after the pandemic hit, and the pandemic itself made a drastic change to the reasons behind people wanting to move and how they do it. We need to pay attention to where people are moving to, where they’re moving from, and why they’re moving in the first place. This in itself plays a big role in our market and other markets across the country.

**Rather than analyze these three factors in depth in today’s video blog, I’d like to offer you <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="/uploads/BBRealEstateReport_US_2021_Rick Canale_12-14-20.pdf">a free, comprehensive real estate report</a></u>**. This report will cover these factors in greater detail and explain why we’re looking at a very strong market in 2021. It also offers an interview that Brian Buffini, a renowned real estate coach who’s made spot-on real estate predictions over the past several years, recently conducted with Dr. Lawrence Yun, the chief economist of the National Association of Realtors. Whether you’re a buyer or seller, this report offers a ton of insight that will greatly benefit your future plans.

The bottom line is, a lot of interesting things are strengthening our market and causing it to grow. If you have any questions about buying or selling a home in Northern Nevada, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
