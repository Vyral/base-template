What kind of experience do you give your clients? Is it good? Could it be great?&nbsp;

I don’t know about you, but **every day I think about ways to provide a better customer experience** for everyone that I meet out in the community or otherwise.

In the customer experience class that I’ve been teaching, **I use the Five-S model****,** and today, I’ll demonstrate what the first of those five S’s means.

**The first S stands for “set.”** We know that in providing a great customer experience (and having an awesome business), we first need to know our own value proposition.

Year after year, I sometimes find myself struggling to figure out what makes me unique. What helps us, as a team, stand out from other agents in town? **In my class, we really dig deep into discovering your own personal value proposition, as well as one for your team.**

Whenever you’re in the process of delivering a great customer experience, you first present your value proposition to your clients and set your expectations. To set expectations, listen to your client’s needs, understand what their expectations are, and then verify that you’re both on the same page.&nbsp;

In future videos, I’ll walk you through the other four S’s so that you can have a better understanding of how to boost the quality of your customer experience.

If you’re interested in learning more about the customer experience, you can find my class on <u><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.kwconnect.com/search?q=jennie+wolek">KWConnect</a></strong></u>. I also have developed a shortened version, so contact me if you’re interested in that coming to your city.

For any questions or comments you may have, feel free to reach out to me and my team. We’d love to have a conversation with you.<br>&nbsp;
