<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s a significant factor to consider in your home-buying decision.</em></p>

In my opinion, the decision to buy a new or a resale home depends on what you’re looking for and the lifestyle you want to have.

**With a resale home, you can get a home in an established neighborhood** with character. You’re also going to generally get more land with these homes compared to a brand-new subdivision.

With a new home, you get to live in a home you designed, and it is a reflection of you. If it’s in a new neighborhood, you can watch that place grow over the years. Another advantage is the lack of deferred maintenance. All the systems and other major items in a new home will have a builder’s and manufacturer’s warranty because they’re brand new.

**At the end of the day, every situation is different.** If you have any questions for me about buying, selling, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
