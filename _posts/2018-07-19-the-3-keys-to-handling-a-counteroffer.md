How do you handle a counteroffer in our market? There are three key points to focus on.

First, **you need to understand why your offer was countered.** If you are a buyer, was your offer priced correctly? If you are in a multiple offer situation, are there contingencies you need to be aware of?

Second, remember that **knowledge is power when negotiating.** Whoever can capitalize on their knowledge will win the bidding situation. If you are a buyer, you need to know why the seller is selling, what condition the property is in, and whether they are looking to buy right away after they sell. If you are a seller, you need to know if the buyer has a lease that is extending or they are looking to sell their home as well.

In either case, make sure you work with a good Realtor, because they will be able to understand what is going on behind the scenes and they will be able to gather the data you need to put yourself in the best possible position.

Third, **know what your response will be.** If you are a buyer, are you putting yourself in a position where you will be working every day to pay your mortgage or do you have enough financial leeway to live your life and make updates as needed? As a seller, have you figured out your bottom line and do you know where you can sell your home at? Ideally, you will talk about these things with your Realtor before you enter into negotiations, but they are still crucial to the overall process.
