<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are five excellent reasons to invest in real estate this year.</em></p>

Here are five reasons why it’s a good idea to consider purchasing investment real estate in 2021:

**1\. Interest rates are incredibly low.** We’re seeing investment loans right now fetch a 3% interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage. That’s very cheap money and will give you more cash flow as an investor.

**2\. Home prices are appreciating rapidly.** Last year, we saw prices go up around 8% to 9% in Athens alone. If you purchased a $200,000 rental home last year, it’s worth $216,000 today just because of the appreciation. That’s a 32% return on your investment in just one year, without factoring in the monthly cash flow you’ll receive from the property and the depreciation from your taxes.

**3\. Rental rates are increasing.** There’s a big demand for rental properties in this area because rent has skyrocketed in the last few years. If they continue to rise, your cash flow goes up while your interest rates and payment stay the same.

**4\. It’s a hedge against inflation.** In my opinion, as more money is printed and produced, we should see some inflation. We might not see it in a year, but we will in five to 10 years. When inflation happens, your dollar is going to buy more, and your real estate assets will go up in value.&nbsp;

**5\. It’s better to buy sooner than later.** As a general rule of thumb, when you look at successful real estate investors, they grow their wealth over time. Think back to when your parents or grandparents bought their first house and the difference between what it was worth then and what it’s worth now. Unlike a vacant property or piece of land, you can make the mortgage payments with the rent from your tenants and keep the extra cash.

If you have any questions about buying a rental property or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
