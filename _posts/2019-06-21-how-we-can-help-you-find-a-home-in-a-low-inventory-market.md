Many buyers across Shelby County fear that**,&nbsp;**given today’s low inventory levels, sellers are hesitant to sell because they**&nbsp;**think**&nbsp;**they’ll be unable to find a home once they begin their search. If you find yourself faced with this common concern, the Peterson Team is here to help. How? Well, first we review your wants and needs and then apply those criteria to the neighborhood (or neighborhoods) you’re interested in. After this, we send out postcards to homeowners within that area (even those who don’t currently have a property on the market) and ask who they know in their neighborhood who’s thinking of selling. Doing this allows us to find “hidden gem” properties that other buyers won’t find anywhere on the MLS. We can introduce you to properties that aren’t even for sale yet, and get you through closing before the seller ever puts a sign in their yard. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
