Far too often, buyers find what they think is the perfect home only to be disappointed after they move in. Once the rose-colored glasses come off and problems start to become apparent, they are left with serious buyer’s remorse.&nbsp;

When it comes to real estate, regretting your purchase isn’t as simple as going back to a store and telling the cashier that you’ve changed your mind about what you bought.&nbsp;

However, this situation can be avoided if you’re equipped with the right knowledge. There are a few key things you should never overlook when buying a home. Today, I’d like to share five tips.

1. **Make sure to go see the property at night.** You want to make sure that you see your property at various times of the day. A home can look and be very different at different times. It isn’t just danger you need to worry about. Perhaps you’ve only seen the property during the day when many of your neighbors were out or at work. If you move in believing you have plenty of street parking only to find out that the entire block looks different after sundown, you could end up with some problems.
2. **Don’t forget to figure out your new commute.&nbsp;**Nowadays, distance tends to be measured in time instead of in kilometers or miles. Make sure you check out your route to work and other critical places when considering a new home. Traffic is another thing to consider, so be sure to drive the route you would take during different times of the day. This will give you the best feel for what things will truly be like.&nbsp;
3. **Pay attention to features that can’t be changed.** Don’t let yourself be blinded by flashy details. Things like a jacuzzi or an Elvis mural shouldn’t outweigh features like the floorplan and the lot location. Personal details and flashy touches can be added down the line. For example, even the most spectacular house may not be worth it if it's in a terrible location.&nbsp;
4. **Don’t overlook the property’s resale value.** Properties will always come with their own unique set of features and challenges. While a home sitting on a busy street may not be a problem for you, it will be an issue for other buyers. Even if you don’t plan to move for quite some time, you still need to think about resale value from the very start.
5. **Pay attention to the bedroom-to-bathroom ratio.&nbsp;**Ideally, you want to have an ensuite and at least one guest bathroom. The more bathrooms, the better. No one should ever be upset about too many bathrooms. And no, two toilets in one room do not count as multiple bathrooms.
