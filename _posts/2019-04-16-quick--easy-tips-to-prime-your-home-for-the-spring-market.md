How can you prepare your home for the spring market? There are a few simple tips to remember.

First, keep in mind that **nothing is more important than curb appeal**. In the video above, I’m at the home of one of my seller clients, and they’ve power-raked their lawn so that it will grow extra green in the coming weeks. They’ve also added fresh mulch to their landscaping. Besides doing these kinds of things, power washing your home’s exterior is always a good idea, too.

Inside the home, the owners have done a great job handling another important task: **cleaning and decluttering**. Specifically, don’t forget to clear the countertops in your kitchen and bathrooms. In general, do whatever you can to show off the master bedroom, master bathroom, and the kitchen area.

In each room, the beds should be made and the closets should only be half full. The goal is to show off how much storage you have, so pack up all your winter clothes and store them away.

When it comes to the windows, they should be cleaned from both the inside and the outside. This brightens everything up and enhances the home’s cleanliness.

Lastly, if you have a great deck, don’t be afraid to show it off—sweep the floor, bring out your furniture, and clean everything off. Also, don’t forget to power-rake your backyard just like you did your front yard.

**These tasks might seem like a hassle in the short term, but they’ll pay huge dividends down the line**.
