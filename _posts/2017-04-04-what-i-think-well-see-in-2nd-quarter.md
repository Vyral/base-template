The first important thing to note is that there was a lot of pent-up demand last year because of the storms we had and because of the election. **The first quarter of 2017 was absolutely amazing though with more people putting their home on the market than normal, more sales, and more people moving to Charleston. This is a testament to the market because the first quarter is typically one of the slowest quarters of the year. **

So what does it all mean for the second quarter?

Remember that even more people get their homes ready to go on the market at this time of year. They want to move during the summertime when the kids aren’t in school and they have more all-around flexibility, along with longer days. The real estate market typically has the highest turnover rate in the second and third quarters.

However, it’s important to remember that all the people planning to move to Charleston are planning their move during this period. That’s why **if you’re considering selling your house, now might be the absolute best time.** We can help you figure out exactly what you need to do to get your house ready for sale because now might be a perfect time.

If you’re thinking about selling your house or you have any other questions we can answer, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you out!
