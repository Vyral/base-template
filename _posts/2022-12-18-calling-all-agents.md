Agents: Our team is growing, and we are hiring\! Thanks to our wonderful clients, we have the opportunity to expand our team. There are three positions that we are hiring for.

1. **Buyer’s Agent.** This is somebody who has experience and skill in building relationships with both warm and cold contacts. This person will need excellent phone and follow-up skills. This agent will be showing properties and asking questions while listening to what is and isn’t being said. The position is open to licensed agents looking to become inventory specialists and show homes. The salary is commission based, but our buyer’s agents generally see between $5,000 and $10,000 per month, depending on the effort they put in. We provide qualified leads, and our price point is sitting at just under $600,000.
2. **Customer Service Database Manager.** This is somebody who is really focused on organizing our list of past clients and reaching out to them with different initiatives. They will manage our social media, host online and in-person events, and touch our clients while providing concierge-level service.&nbsp;<br><br>{% include pullquote.html %}<br>&nbsp;
3. **Concierge Sales Agent.** As the exclusive listing agent for Ritz-Carlton, I am looking for someone to help fill out that team. This position is for licensed agents and those looking to get licensed who are great with customers. Design experience would be a bonus so you can help customers with options and finishes. You must love being downtown and being part of a very exciting project.&nbsp;

Those are the three positions we are hiring for. View the postings for more information, and reach out to me with any questions you may have. I look forward to speaking with you.
