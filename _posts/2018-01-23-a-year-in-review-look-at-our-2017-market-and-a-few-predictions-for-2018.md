What’s the final word on our 2017 market? What can you expect from the market in 2018?

The 2017 Kauai market was bustling and brisk. **The overall number of transactions was up over 12%, and the dollar volume of those sales rose 5%.** This means more money was invested and traded in real estate in 2017.

Here’s a closer look at how the median prices for single-family homes and condos played out across all five zones in Kauai:

* Starting in Waimea, the median price for single-family homes rose 10.67%. There were no condo trades because there are no condos in that area.
* In Koloa, prices for single-family homes rose 6.15% and prices for condos rose 8%.
* In Lihue, prices for single-family homes rose 4.8% and prices for condos rose 13.1%. For condos, that number doesn’t necessarily mean that prices went up - just that the trades were higher because of a lack of inventory.
* In Kawaihau, prices for single-family homes rose 9.76% and prices for condos dropped 31.16%.
* In Hanalei, prices for single-family homes rose 1.32% and prices for condos dropped 12.44%.

Now, what can we expect from the 2018 marketplace?

**If things continue as they are (and there’s no reason to believe they won’t), we’ll keep seeing strong demand for property and only a limited amount of housing available.** Prices should continue to rise, and tourism should continue to stay strong, so if you own a vacation rental home, you should see good returns.

Prices for single-family homes in the modest price ranges will continue to trend upward. There continues to be a couple years’ worth of supply in most areas on the island for homes priced over $2 million, but down toward $550,000 and $600,000 range, buyers could find themselves competing for homes in multiple offer situations.

2017 was a great year for Kauai, and 2018 looks to be very promising. If you’re a buyer, it’s still a good time to get a toe-hold on the marketplace. If you’re a seller, the market is strong as long as your home is priced and marketed correctly.

If you have any questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to get in touch with us. We’d be happy to help you achieve all of your real estate goals, and we wish you a healthy, happy, prosperous 2018. Until next time, aloha!
