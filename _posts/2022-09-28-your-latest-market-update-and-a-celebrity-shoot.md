We’re taking you behind the scenes of our housing market while we’re behind the scenes at the newest Barbara Corcoran commercial\! We’ll discuss the latest numbers, where things might be heading, and, of course, what’s going on with the shoot.&nbsp;

First, how is our market doing? Experts seem to agree that after the initial shock of interest rate hikes, things are settling down. **All signs point towards a normalized fall housing market.** This means homes won’t be flying off the shelves in a matter of hours, but you can still get a fantastic deal if you play your cards right.

Meanwhile, experts predict that appreciation will slow but not decrease. In other words, **the value of your home isn’t going down; it just won’t rise as quickly as it has over the last two years.** At the same time, mortgage rates are projected to fall early in 2023. According to Fannie Mae, rates may fall to 4.5% by next year. This is fantastic news for both buyers and sellers since both parties will have plenty of opportunities.&nbsp;

Now to the commercial\! If you check out 2:20 in the video above, you can see us behind the scenes with Barbara. Even when we aren’t shooting, she is exactly how she seems on “Shark Tank.” If you want to see the finished commercial, check out 3:19 in the video; we’re very proud of how it turned out.
