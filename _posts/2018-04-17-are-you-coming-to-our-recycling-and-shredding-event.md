Today I wanted to give you a quick reminder about the community event we are hosting for our clients and friends. 

**On Saturday, April 21, we hope to see you out in the parking lot of Broadlands Community Center in Ashburn, VA for our recycling and shredding event.**

Bring everything that you need shredded to the shredding truck, which will be in the parking lot from 9 a.m. until noon. The recycling truck will be there from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.

**Collect the stuff you don’t want taking up space in your house and bring it down.** That’s what we’re doing. We’ll have light refreshments for you too. For all of the information about the event, click **[here.](http://www.wickerhomesgroup.com/events)**

If you have any questions for us in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>
