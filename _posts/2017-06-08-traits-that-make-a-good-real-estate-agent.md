People often ask me what it takes to be considered a good real estate agent. It’s actually quite simple.

**First, you need to be a good listener.** You have to be able to listen to your clients. You also have to be a problem solver. Understand what your clients are saying, what they are looking for, and then match them to the perfect home.

It’s important that you help them find something that fits their needs. Don’t try to be a pushy salesman.

Be honest and have integrity. You have a duty to put your clients’ needs before your own.

What traits should you look for in an agent if you're looking to hire one?

**Your agent needs to be a good communicator.** After all, your agent has to deal with other agents and a number of other people during the real estate process. They also need to be good at negotiating repairs or terms to make the deal happen.

A proactive agent has the foresight to see problems that may arise and nip them in the bud. &nbsp;

Finally, get a Realtor that really knows your market and understands what’s going on.
