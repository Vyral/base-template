There’s a lot of conflicting information out there about open houses. Specifically, people often debate whether or not they’re effective.

Well, statistically speaking, open houses do not generally work. But this may be partially due to the fact that most agents don’t know how to properly host one. If you do want to hold an open house, there are a few things you must do to make them as effective as possible.

**Open houses are an easy, non-formal way of bringing buyers in to look at your home.** But this arrangement also presents the concern of security issues.

To reduce the risk of security problems, it’s a good idea to have all potential buyers coming through the door fill out a sign-in sheet. This will let you know who was in your home and at what time they were there.

Another way to host an open house more effectively is to prepare. **Make sure you’ve advertised the event properly.** This can be done by putting up signs throughout the week and putting up even more signs the day of the open house. The more signs you have up, the more traffic your open house is likely to see. And more traffic means more potential buyers.

Also, don’t hesitate to let the neighbors know you’re selling. Even if they aren’t looking themselves, they may know someone who is.

Whether you’re planning on hosting an open house on your own or with the help of an agent, these tips will be crucial to making the most of the event.
