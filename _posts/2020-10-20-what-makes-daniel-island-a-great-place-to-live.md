<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Check out this fun tour of Daniel Island and the Smythe Park subsection!</em></p>

The Smythe Park subsection of Daniel Island is a beautiful place to enjoy the outdoors. We have a gorgeous lake that’s perfect for walks or soaking in a sunset. There’s also a pirate-themed playground, which is a great spot for kids to have endless fun on slides, swings, and so much more. Don’t forget to check out the treehouse that overlooks the Wando River\!&nbsp;

Another great aspect of Smythe Park is that kids can enjoy an easy bike ride to the Daniel Island School, which offers an exceptional education from kindergarten through eighth grade. For the littlest ones, we have Daniel Island Academy, and for high schoolers, we have Bishop England High School.&nbsp;

When it comes to property types on the island, we have everything from townhomes to condos, to lake-view homes and homes with a view of the Wando River. The infrastructure on the island was designed with nature lovers in mind; **there are so many phenomenal parks, trails, and available boat ramps for residents to get the most out of their outdoor experience.&nbsp;**

For those of you who enjoy shopping and dining, downtown Daniel Island is the happening spot to be. You can savor a nice sit-down dinner at Sermet’s Courtyard, or just grab some pizza at Orlando’s.

Did I mention there are three awesome pools, too? The Pierce Park, Scott Park, and Crow’s Nest pools all offer a great spot to unwind near the water. If you’re looking for something totally upscale, The Daniel Island Club has private pools, tennis courts, and world-class golf with the Ralston Creek Course and the Barrister Course.&nbsp;

Finally, **every Daniel Islander needs to experience the Volvo Car Stadium.** This stadium is home to many concerts throughout the year, and the annual Volvo Car Open brings ladies’ championship tennis to town.&nbsp;

It’s impossible to capture the full scope of why Daniel Island is an amazing place to live, but ideally, you now have a better sense of what this area has to offer. If you have more questions about properties in this or any other area of Charleston, please feel free to reach out to me by phone. I look forward to hopefully meeting with you in person to talk more about your home search or home sale\!
