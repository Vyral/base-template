At the beginning of the summer, as I’m sure you have heard, the UK voted to leave the EU. This became known as “Brexit,” and while it may seem like old news, we’re still seeing the effects of that decision in our real estate market today.

<br>**Here in the U.S., Brexit has been nothing but good news for our market.** Because of Brexit, investors all over the world wanted a safer place to invest and decided that the U.S. was the best option. This held down our already low mortgage rates and fueled the demand for houses in our Orange County market.

<br>What does this mean for you?

<br>If you are looking to buy a home, **these low rates mean that you will be paying less money.** As an example, taking out a 30-year, $750,000 mortgage today versus a year ago (when the rate was about .5% higher) would mean that you would save more than $75,000 over the lifetime of the loan.

Additionally, if you are looking to sell rather than buy, this reduction in rates also benefits you big time. The more mortgage rates drop, the more purchasing power that potential buyers have. More purchasing power will increase your buyer pool, which will, in turn, increase your chances of getting top dollar on your home.
