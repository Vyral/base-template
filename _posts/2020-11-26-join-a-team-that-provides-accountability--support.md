<p style="text-align:center;"><em>If you’re looking for a change, know that we’re expanding.</em></p>

This is the time of year when everyone is starting to write down what their goals are for the next business year.&nbsp;

One of our goals is to expand a little bit further. I obtained my real estate license in the state of Florida and we affiliated with eXp in the Marco Island/Naples area. **If you live in that area and you’re looking to join a real estate team that provides accountability, support, and training, I’ll be glad to help you there.**

We’re also continuing to expand in Harford, Baltimore, Cecil, and Anne Arundel counties, as well as a few more locales. At the end of this year, we will have sold just over 500 homes and done around $145 million in production.

So consider: Where do you want to go in your business? Are you in the right spot? Do you need a change? We’re looking for people who really want to put in the work to help their clients—customer satisfaction is key. **If you provide excellent service to the client, you’ll make more money, enjoy your life more, and grow closer to the people you work with.**

Too many people fail to consider their futures years down the road, but our team specifically maps out where we want to be in, say, five years, and what kind of lives we want to lead. It can be hard to do this for some since life often throws us curveballs. However, there’s always a chance to correct your course if you don’t feel like you’re on track to reach your goals.

If you’re interested in working with us in the Baltimore metro area or looking to move to the Marco Island/Naples area in Florida, give me a call at (410) 638-9555. I’d be glad to speak with you.
