If you’re selling your home inside an HOA neighborhood, you’re required by law to supply your buyer with a resale package.

**A resale package contains the rules and regulations of your homeowners association, and you have to give this to your buyer before closing.** Depending on the HOA, obtaining a resale package costs around $250. If you live in a property with two HOAs, you may have to pay for two resale packages.

After the buyer receives this document, they have five days to review it. If they don’t like any of the rules and regulations, they can cancel escrow and get their money back.

If you have any questions about this topic or you’d like help obtaining your HOA’s resale package, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.
