As the weather starts to get colder, we want to bring you some tips to prevent you from having to deal with the nightmare of frozen pipes. **I learned a few things from a report I recently read, and I want to share them with you.**

One typical preventative measure to take is getting a pipe sleeve that goes on a water line attached to an exterior wall. You can pick one of these up at Lowe’s or Home Depot, or you can just use newspaper as insulation if you’re in a pinch.

**There are quite a few things you can do in order to take preventative action against frozen pipes.** One is keeping your garage door closed, as pipes are sometimes connected through there. If you have a bathroom or sink that is attached to an exterior wall, keep those bathroom cabinet doors open on cold nights and let the faucet drip just a touch to prevent freezing.

If you’re going away or out of town, always remember to keep your thermostat to at least 55 degrees.

Hopefully these things can help you and hopefully you’ve learned a thing or two in the process. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
