So you’ve decided to sell your house. This is the best market we’ve ever seen for sellers who want to get top dollar, but where are you going to move to next?

**I think now is an excellent time to buy investment property and use that to leverage the future purchase of your dream home.** With low interest rates, you can get into a property that’s smaller for a short period of time and use that home as a future investment.

Spend wisely, find something with low or no monthly fees, and get into a property that will be a great potential future investment while you plant yourself there for maybe six months to a year. Prices will likely level off, you’ll be able to watch the market, and you can make an offer on your dream home without a contingency. **Then you can buy your dream home, rent the other property out, and start building wealth through real estate.**

If you’re looking to become a real estate investor or enhance your investment portfolio, let us know. This is an area I’m very passionate about, and this is a fantastic strategy to start building wealth while also finding your dream home.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
