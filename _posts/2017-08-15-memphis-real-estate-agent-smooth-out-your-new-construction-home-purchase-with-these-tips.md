I recently read an article in Realtor Magazine that claimed 2017 was the best year in a decade for new construction homes—not just in the Memphis area, but everywhere.

According to this article, “A shortage of homes for sale combined with growing buyer demand will likely spark home builders to construct the most homes this year than in the last decade.”

If you’re interested in buying a newly built home, there are a few tips you should know to make the process go smoother.

First, **choose a reputable builder.** Make sure they’re a member of the Home Builders Association (in our case, the West Tennessee Home Builders), which allows them to provide a one-year warranty. Beware of all of the add-ons, too, because there are many things that could be considered upgrades that might pull you out of your budget. Stay involved in the building process and don’t be afraid to ask questions. Also, learn about the surrounding neighborhood before you buy.

Next, **be flexible.** With the weather being how it is, builders can’t always determine when your house will be totally completed. They should be able to keep you updated and informed, but you’ll need some flexible dates in mind so everything can be controlled.

Lastly, **it’s not a bad idea to have a home inspection.** The builder will do a walkthrough with you, but it’s still worth the money to have a home inspection and let someone else take a look at the home to make sure nothing gets overlooked.

If you have any questions about buying new construction or any other real estate topic, feel free to give me a call. I’d be happy to speak with you.
