As a seller, there are three reasons why you’re better off listing now during the winter instead of waiting until spring.

First, **buyers are more serious during the winter.** Isn’t that what you really want: a serious offer? While the spring housing market may bring more buyers out of the woodwork, those buyers are more likely to hold off on making serious offers because there are more homes to choose from, and they can afford to be picky.

Sellers who list during the spring are just creating their own competition and providing more options for buyers. If you list during the spring, you better make sure your home is the best in show.

Second, **buyer demographics are different during the winter.** We don’t just have families looking to relocate because of their children—we also have empty-nesters looking to buy now and move in later, millennials who’ve been waiting on the sidelines to make their move, and others—like investors—who are trying to avoid the high real estate season.

We also see a lot of employees relocating this time of year. I work with Cartus, one of the largest relocation networks in the country, and we definitely have an influx of people asking for market analyses and home valuations in preparation for their move.

The third, and most important, reason to list now is that **you will face less competition from other sellers.** I briefly touched on this reason above, but it’s worth repeating. Less competition means more money in your pocket and a more timely move into your next home.
