I’ve touched on new construction in the past, but this time I want to dive deeper into the topic and talk about some of the pros and cons of buying a brand new home and what you can expect throughout the process.

**New construction purchases have many advantages over traditional resale purchases.** For one, you can see the different models, layouts, and features before you even start building. You can pick a lot of the features out in your home, from the floor to the kitchen backsplash and even the light positions. If it’s early on in the process, you can make this a really special and unique home. You also get to be the first person to live in the space.

Builders will sometimes even offer you incentives like design center credits to update your home to sweeten the deal. However, in an ideal world, you would come to them as an unrepresented buyer. That would be a mistake on your part.&nbsp;

When you work with an agent in buying a new home, it doesn’t cost you a thing. In return, you get the knowledge and expertise of a real estate professional who is on your side throughout the transaction. **Having someone who can negotiate on behalf of you and your best interests is invaluable when buying a new home.&nbsp;**

Overall, new construction is a great opportunity for homebuyers. These homes can be a little more expensive and take a little longer to build, but the sooner you can get in there and figure out your options, the better.

If you have any questions for me about new construction or anything else relating to real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.
