I’ve got an exciting announcement to make today. We are soon going to be opening an independent brokerage called Elite Realty Partners and we’re looking to bring on independent agents to our team.

We have an office at Smith Mountain Lake across from Kroger, as well as an office in Salem. **We’re also proud to announce that we’re not going to be charging a brokerage fee.** The only recurring fee is a $150 monthly fee that includes your errors and omissions and your MLS access.

If you have any interest in finding out what a true 100% brokerage model looks like, give us a call or send us an email today. **We’re looking to do some exciting things in central and southwest Virginia** and we hope to hear from you soon.
