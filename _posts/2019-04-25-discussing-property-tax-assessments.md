Welcome back to another edition of my podcast with Van and Bonnie. In this third installment, we discussed a ton of things, including property tax assessments, how to protest them, and much more.

**Here’s an outline of the discussion, with timestamps so that you can skip around to the section(s) that interest you the most:**

0:50- Explaining the county’s property assessment process

1:45- Is a high assessment good for home sellers?

3:15- What can you do if you’re not happy with your property’s assessment?

4:20- How can we help?

6:00- Why inaccurate information can hurt your home sale

7:05- Why I’m not shocked that most people's assessments have gone up and why it’s actually a good thing

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
