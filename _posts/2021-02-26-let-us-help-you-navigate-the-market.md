Hire a good agent to help you sell your home for a maximal price.

Today’s message is for all of the home sellers in our marketplace. The market is on fire, and there’s a larger shortage of inventory than I’ve seen in my 23-year real estate career.&nbsp;

When you’re choosing a real estate agent or broker to help you put your home on the market, find someone with knowledge and experience. **Listing a home isn’t just about price, but also about marketing and positioning your home.** Sometimes, not having the right real estate agent is the difference between leaving $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000 on the table.

If you’re thinking about selling your home, even if that won’t be for months down the road, reach out to me today. We’ll show you the Carbutti difference.
