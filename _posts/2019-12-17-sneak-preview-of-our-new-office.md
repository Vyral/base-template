&nbsp;

Today I want to give you a quick sneak preview of our new office\! At 0:20 in the video above you can see some of the features of our new space. One thing we’re thrilled about is our new call booths. These allow agents to have private communication with our clients, that way everything is confidential. Our agents are loving them, they’re already getting a lot of use. We also have a new training room. We’re enthusiastic about this because it’s an excellent space to educate team members without bothering the other agents at work.&nbsp;

If you have any questions regarding real estate, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us by phone or email (we’ll receive it at our new office)\! We would love to help you with your real estate needs.&nbsp;
