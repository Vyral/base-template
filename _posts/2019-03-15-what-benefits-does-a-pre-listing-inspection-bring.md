What can you do save time and money when it comes time to sell your home? A pre-listing inspection is a great first step.

I was recently joined by Kris Brown from Five Star Home Inspections to talk about the great benefits of getting a home inspection done before you put your home on the market for sale.

There are a lot of benefits to doing this pre-listing inspection. **The three key benefits are:**

**1. It saves time.** You will have plenty of time to research, compare, and find the best service providers to help you make repairs before you get your home listed.

**2. It saves money.** You’ll be able to competitively shop and not have to pay what the buyer is asking, which is usually a lot more.

**3. It makes the house more marketable.** The buyer will get a great feeling when they come in and will be much less worried about any repairs or improvements they had to make.

This pre-listing inspection is becoming more and more popular these days, and a pre-inspection is going to save you a lot of time and money in this type of market.
