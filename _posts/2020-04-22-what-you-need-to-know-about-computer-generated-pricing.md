<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s what you need to know about computer-generated pricing and why you simply can’t beat having boots on the ground.</em></p>

We’ll typically do three to six market valuations per week, helping people with pricing by looking at past sales and current listings. Our computer pulls up estimates from Zillow and a few other services on every single property we look at. Not only can we see what a particular property was listed and ultimately sold for, but it also shows us what Zillow estimated the value to be.

Zillow is a company well-equipped to handle very big data; if you take 10,000 houses and their computer crunches the numbers, their average price will be right on the money. **However, their computer doesn’t know a specific house’s value accurately.&nbsp;**

Zillow’s algorithm has no clue whether you have brand-new granite countertops, or if your feet stick to the carpet. This leads to a rather large variation—the estimate is 15% to 20% above or below market value.&nbsp;

In essence, **computer-generated pricing, like the model made popular by Zillow, gives you a sort of dartboard pricing from which to work**. It’s a start, but it’s simply not as accurate as a real estate agent who’s going through 50 to 60 properties a week and can truly understand the value of your property—updates, remodels, condition, etc.&nbsp;
