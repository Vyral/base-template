Today I wanted to discuss three important aspects of home inspections.

The first thing to remember is that you as a buyer will have to pay for the home inspection. You don't want the seller to pay for the inspection because if they do, they will choose the inspector. As a result, the inspector will look out for the sellerâ€™s best interests instead of yours. You want the inspector to be working for you so that he or she can give you an unbiased opinion of the home.

Secondly, you will get some recommendations for inspectors from the agent that is helping you buy the home, but you're not obligated to choose any of them. Feel free to do your own research on a home inspector that fits your needs.

Finally, don't expect the home inspection report to be very detailed; it will only cover the basics. An inspector is not going to break down walls and look at plumbing or wires. They will only cover the cosmetics of the home to make sure it looks decent, that the water is turned on, the gas works, the power outlets work, and whether the roof looks good. We still recommend having a roofing professional come out to do a detailed roof inspection to find out whether it's certifiable.

Hopefully, this gives you a better idea of what to expect when it comes to home inspections. Remember that you can be present during the inspection. That way, the inspector can address any specific concerns you have.

If you have any more questions about home inspections or you're thinking about buying or selling a home in the Sacramento area, give me a call or send me an email. I'd love to help you out!
