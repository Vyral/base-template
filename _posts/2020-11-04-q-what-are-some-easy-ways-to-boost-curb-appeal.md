*Here are some projects/purchases to keep in mind if you’re preparing to sell. *

First impressions are everything in real estate. Thankfully, improving your home’s curb appeal can be as simple as adding mulch and trimming both your trees and shrubbery. Additional enhancements to your front porch can instantly boost curb appeal, too, and some creative ideas include:&nbsp;

• Trendy outdoor furniture&nbsp;

• Window boxes for flowers

• Adding new house numbers

• Upgrading your mailbox

• Applying a fresh coat of paint to your front door

Even if redesigning your yard isn’t a priority, **you can always accessorize it with seasonal decor, birdbaths, fountains, or modern light fixtures.** Building up your home’s curb appeal doesn’t always require a ton of money or preparation; some of these simple, cost-effective ways to spruce up your home will help you attract the right buyers in your local market.&nbsp;
