What happens when your virtual assistant identifies an opportunity or a lead for your sales pipeline?

**First of all, your VA will send you an email.** Depending on the dialing system you choose to work with, that email is either sent out automatically or your VA will pause their dialer and manually send you an email. Either way, you get an immediate, real-time notification that a lead has been identified.

We also share a Google Sheet with you to keep track of every lead that you get once you start the program. These sheets start out basic but as the system and the program mature, they can get pretty complicated. You can integrate the Google Sheet with your ISA or inbound lead follow up person, who can then provide feedback to your VA within the spreadsheet.

What happens if you don’t have a CRM? You can use the tracker we provide as a rudimentary way to utilize and work the leads like you would in a CRM. However, we definitely recommend that you get a CRM as soon as possible to streamline your follow up process.

We definitely recommend getting a CRM as soon as possible.

**Our VAs also send you a daily report** explaining what they did for you that day and list your leads at the bottom of the email.

So, after your VA identifies a lead, you will get an immediate notification, the VA will add the lead to your Google Sheet, and your VA will make a list of all of the leads they identified in their daily report.

If you have any other questions about this process or if you would like to learn more about 1000 Calls A Day, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would be happy to help you!
