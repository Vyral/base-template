Can you trust websites like Zillow and Trulia during your home search? While these are very popular sites for home buyers, their listings may not be updated.

**Want to buy a home?** <a href="http://www.sellwithsikora.com/" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale.</a>

Many of our clients begin their home searches online by going through the listings on sites like Zillow, Trulia, and Realtor.com. They find a few they like and then ask us to get them private showings of the properties. What will often happen is that we’ll pull a home up on the MLS only to find out that it is already under contract or has already sold.

The reason that properties show up on these sites as “active” is because **agents have the ability to put their own listings on sites like Zillow, Trulia, and Realtor.com. However, they often do not take them down once the home has sold.** This could either be because the agent forgot to take the listing down, or it could be a strategy that the agent is using to get more leads by baiting buyers with the property and then trying to sell them on another home.

The nice thing about our website is that our listings come directly from the MLS, so **every property that you see listed on our website is still available.** It’s very regulated and there aren’t any false listings out there to dash your hopes for a new home.

Our listings are only linked with Hudson County right now, but we plan on expanding our coverage to the surrounding counties soon.

If you have any questions about how to find the home that’s right for you or where to begin your search, don’t hesitate to reach out to us by phone or email. We’re always happy to help you!
