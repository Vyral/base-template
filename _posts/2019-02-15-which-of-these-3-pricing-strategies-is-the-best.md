So the time has come to sell your home. Before you list, however, you’ll need to choose between the three different strategies you can employ when pricing your home for sale. Be careful, though—each of these options will impact the level of exposure you achieve in different ways.

Here are the three main ways you can go about pricing your home:

**1. Price it above market value.** This strategy may have been effective in the past, when sellers had more leverage, but it is now quite risky. You aren’t likely to gain much exposure by listing this way.<br>

**2. Price it at market value.** This strategy is much more effective than the first in this list. More buyers will likely be drawn to your home, which means your chance of selling will also increase.<br>&nbsp;

**3. Price it below market value.** It may surprise some of you to learn that this strategy is actually ideal. Why? Well, when you price below market value, you gain maximum exposure. And with several interested buyers in the picture, you’ll have the power to negotiate a higher price. Counterintuitive as it may seem, pricing below market value is a great way to earn top dollar for your listing.
