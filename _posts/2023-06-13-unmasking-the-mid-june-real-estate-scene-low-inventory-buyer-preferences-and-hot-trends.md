As we reach the midpoint of June, it's crucial to examine the current state of the real estate market. One prominent trend that persists is the shortage of inventory. However, it's worth noting that properties priced below $500,000 are selling swiftly.

Once we venture beyond the $500,000 mark, with a few exceptions, there appears to be a slight decline in showing activity, particularly noticeable at the $600,000 threshold and above. This change can be attributed to the impact of budget constraints, interest rates, and their effect on monthly payments and mortgage amounts.

**Buyers are now approaching their purchases with greater thoughtfulness.** They are not just focused on the price but also paying close attention to the condition of the properties. Unlike a few years ago, when buyers were willing to accept flaws and make compromises, they are becoming more discerning about a property's overall condition.

This discernment extends beyond repairs to cosmetic aspects as well. Buyers now express concerns about flooring, paint, landscaping, and even minor issues like cracks in the driveway—elements that were previously overlooked. Hence, it is crucial for sellers to consider both the price and condition of their homes when listing them on the market.

**In particular, one-level townhomes, also known as Rambler townhomes, are currently in high demand.** This style of property seems to have more leeway in terms of condition compared to other property types. However, it is worth mentioning that townhomes in excellent condition often sell within hours, if not before they even hit the market.

As we navigate these shifting market dynamics, it's essential for sellers to stay informed and adapt their strategies accordingly. When listing a home, consider emphasizing its condition alongside pricing. Addressing concerns related to flooring, paint, and landscaping can significantly improve the appeal of a property to potential buyers.

The real estate market has experienced significant changes over the past year, so it is crucial to keep abreast of these developments.
