How much is a typical real estate commission? Actually, there isn’t a “typical” anymore.

What is the typical real estate commission percentage? Over the years it was 6%, but why?

Traditionally it was 6% because 3% was always paid out to the agent representing the buyer in the transaction. **This means that if you hired the Larkin Group to sell your home, whatever brokerage brought the buyer got 3% of the commission and our brokerage got the other 3% of the transaction.**

There have been some changes, though, in the real estate market and there are now some new options available to you.

Have you ever had a time in your life when you bought the cheapest option because you were in a hurry and then regretted it later? I have. Six months ago I bought a pot and pan set from Kohl's for $49.99 and it's already dying. It’s the same with real estate commissions—you get what you pay for.

**As you look at real estate commissions, you need to look at how much money you want to put into your pocket at the close of sale.** You could easily list your home today for hundreds of dollars on the MLS and have the agent do no service or marketing, schedule no showings, and only show up when it's time to negotiate the contract or pay an attorney to negotiate for you. You could also pay a premium auction company $30,000 to $40,000 upfront to market your home and then also pay a 7% fee at the end of the transaction for your $1 million home.

When you meet with a real estate professional, you need to ask about their fee structure. At the Larkin Group, we actually have a flexible fee structure. It's based on what you want to put in your pocket at the close of sale.

If you have any questions about this or anything else real estate-related, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
