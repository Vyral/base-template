Today I want to provide you with three ways you can use energy sustainability to boost your home’s value.

If you are thinking of selling your home, think about sustainability. A new survey by the National Association of Realtors was just released, and it made some remarkable points.

**For example, 61% of Realtors said clients are interested in sustainability. A whopping 71% said energy efficiency is valuable for selling a home.**

If you are interested in sustainability and you want to sell your home for a higher price, there are some projects to consider:

1. **Energy-efficient appliances.** Energy Star-certified appliances like fridges, washing machines, and dryers can be as much as 40% more water-efficient and 25% more energy-efficient than standard models. Those numbers go way up if you compare energy-efficient appliances with even older models. Other gadgets that might need an upgrade include thermostats and water heaters.<br>{% include pullquote.html %}
2. **Solar panels.** Homes with solar panels sell 20% faster, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Even better, they sell for a hefty 17% more than comparable homes without solar. With a range of state and federal incentives still in place, solar can be a great way to make your home greener and more attractive.
3. **Windows, doors, and siding.** Renovating these three features typically recoups an 80% return on investment in terms of higher home values. However, a full suite of energy-efficient doors, windows, and siding might also be worth even more in the current sustainability-minded market. Not only that, but these projects increase your home’s curb appeal, making it more likely that your home will get more interest from more potential buyers.

Any of these projects can potentially add a lot of value to your home. If you would like to discuss which sustainability projects make the most sense per your situation or what kind of sales price you could achieve, feel free to reach out to me.
