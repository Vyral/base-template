Today we’re going to talk about the best time to sell your house.

Well, I’ve got an answer for that. It’s always the best time to sell your house in the world of a real estate agent.

In general though, **I’d say that the best time to sell your house is probably mid-February,** before everybody else puts their house on the market. This is what I’d tell my daughter if she called me to ask when she should sell. She lives in a neighborhood that is school-driven; people buy there for the school system, as well as for the gated neighborhood.

There, you’d want to get your house sold by the end of July, because school starts in August. In that case, that would be the best time to sell their house.

If you’ve got an acreage, **you do not want to put your house on the market in September** because everything will have started getting drab, dull, and cold. You don’t want to try to sell an acreage in the depths of winter, either.

But, should you try to sell a condo or a zero-lot-line garden home in the winter? Actually, that’s a great time to sell those, because folks living in condos and garden homes typically don’t have school-aged children, so they can move year-round.

Most of the folks in Oklahoma like to move during the warmer weather. Nobody likes to move during the cold or the holidays, so spring and summer are always good. But, **it’s always best to be first.**

Keep in mind that during the spring and summer, there are always more buyers looking, but you also have more competition.
