<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We’ll be giving out $25 gift cards to people whose questions are answered in our videos. Go ahead and ask!</em></p>

We’re doing things a little differently this week; **we want to reach out to you personally and invite you to email us any questions you have about real estate.** We’d love to answer and discuss your questions, and we’ll even send you a **$25 gift card** if we highlight your question in one of our videos. Make sure to include your contact information along with your question so we can easily send out your gift.&nbsp;

Even if you don’t have anything to ask, we’d still greatly appreciate it if you’d email us your updated contact information—we like to stay in touch. Don’t worry, we won’t bug or harass you! In fact, **we’re having a special event in November and would like to call and see if you’re interested in coming.** We’d simply like to have a head count of how many people would like to participate.

If you have any questions about real estate or need further information, feel free to give us a call at **(907) 240-2804** or send an email to [Dar@DarWalden.com.](mailto:Dar@DarWalden.com){: target="_blank"} We look forward to hearing from you.
