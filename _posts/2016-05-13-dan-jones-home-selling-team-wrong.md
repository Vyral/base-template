Purchasing a home is not as easy as people think. Most of the time, a buyer will go look at homes and actually purchase a home through the first agent they speak to. **That’s probably the worst way to go about purchasing a home.**

**You really need to talk to an agent and figure out what they do.** Do they work with a team? What kind of support staff do they have? You need the answers to these questions so you hire an agent who will make sure you get the best price, terms, and conditions when it comes to negotiating and understanding the market.

 The last thing you want to do is walk into a transaction with someone who just got their license or only sells two homes a year. **That agent really just doesn’t know what’s going on with the market.** They won’t know what it will be like for you to sell that property again in the next five to 20 years.

 **Think twice about what agent you’re using.** Interview more than one agent. Make sure you work with someone who really knows the market. You need someone from the area, who sells 30 homes a year, and works on a team of agents that can get you the best price, terms, and conditions.

My team and I can get you to the closing process with the least amount of trouble. We can make this a very easy experience for you. If you have any questions, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
