<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Sellers: What do you plan to do with the money you get when you sell your property? Here is a list of the top investments to consider.</em></p>

A recent survey asked, “For money you wouldn't need for more than 10 years, which of the following do you think would be the best way to invest it?” Here’s how the investors’ answers panned out in descending order:

1. “**Real estate**”—31%
2. “**Stocks**”—20%
3. “**Cash investments** (savings accounts/CDs)”—19%
4. “**Gold/metals**”—11%
5. “**Bonds**”—7%
6. “**None**”—5%
7. “**Bitcoin/cryptocurrency**”—4%
8. “**I Don’t Know**”—2%

I thought it was a good idea to pass on the results of this survey since they show a strong interest in long-term real estate investments. If you’re thinking of selling and you’ve contemplated owner financing, the survey shows that it can be a great investment for the long term with a pretty low level of risk.
