We’re super excited to be interviewing Andrew Johnson, our lead inside sales agent. He's an incredible guy, and he has been on our team for a while, so we wanted him to share his experience today.

**When did you join the team, why, and why real estate?**

I’m one of the older members on the team; I think I joined in August of 2017. I wasn’t thinking about a career in real estate at the time, but I had a mutual friend who was already on the team, and she recruited me.&nbsp;

**What’s your job title, and what do you actually do?**

I’ve had a few different titles in my four years on the team. I went from a buyer’s agent to a showing agent. Now I’ve found my niche as the lead inside sales agent. What does that mean exactly? I like to say I’m a bit like the nurse in the doctor’s office. I’m the first person people chat with whether they want to buy, sell, or just ask some questions. My job is to make sure they’re being served at a deep level, and I do a brief intake to see how we can make that happen. After that, I put them in touch with one of our senior buyers or listing agents.&nbsp;

**You are someone I respect a lot because you come in every day, put your head down, and put in the work. What would you say is the biggest challenge in your job?**

The hardest part is creating relationships with clients and making sure they feel served. We’re on the front end of the conversation, but we kind of take a back seat after that initial 30 minutes. Having longer relationships with clients can be hard, and it’s something I miss. Keeping that relationship is all about checking in every so often and making sure they’re taken care of, but I would say that’s the biggest challenge.

**What is your favorite thing about being on the team?**

The team has certainly grown since I started; we maybe had five or six people back then. Now we have close to 20. We always say that we’re a tightly-knit family, and that’s a big reason why I love being on the team. I love the culture, the accountability, and the fact that we spend time not only getting to know each other but working to serve our clients at a deep level.&nbsp;

**What do you look forward to in the next couple of years?**

I look forward to leading my department. Leading other people and helping them reach their goals is a passion of mine from my sports background. I look forward to pouring into the people under me and watching them grow and reach their potential.&nbsp;

If you or someone you know is interested in learning more about Andrew, our team, or how we can help grow your business, we’re an open book, and we would love to serve you. Just give us a call at (717) 216-0860 or email us at [Dave@DaveHookeTeam.com](mailto:Dave@DaveHookeTeam.com). We look forward to talking with you.&nbsp;
