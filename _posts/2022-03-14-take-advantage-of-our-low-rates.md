Should you take advantage of our current interest rates, or should you wait for the market to come down?

In our view, **you should take advantage of interest rates now.** Rates fluctuate over time, and they’re set to increase a few times this year according to the Federal Reserve. If you purchase a home now, you’ll be able to lock in our current low rates before they get any higher. After all, as interest rates increase, your buying power decreases, meaning you could be priced out of the range you were looking in.

If you're looking to buy a home or just have some questions, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send an email. We’d love to help you.
