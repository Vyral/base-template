<br>How have local businesses been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic? Today I’m joined by Adam Estavillo, owner of <u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.redemptionrenovations.com/">Redemption Renovations</a></u>, to answer this question and discuss the ways we can all lend a hand to businesses in need.

As a business owner himself, Adam wasn’t sure what to expect when the shelter-in-place ordinance first went into effect. Though he saw an initial slowdown in weekly estimates, serious customers aren’t letting the pandemic halt their renovation plans.
