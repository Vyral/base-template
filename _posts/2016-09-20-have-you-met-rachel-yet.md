I live right here in Kapolei, and have seen the Team Lally “Guaranteed Sold” cars around all the time. **I knew that I wanted to join a team that was confident and the fact that we guarantee to sell homes** or we will buy them ourselves really made a big statement to me.


Team Lally is the only team in the area endorsed by Barbara Corcoran, so that made a big statement to me too when compared to the other companies out there. **It shows that we are confident and we know what we are doing.**


When I met with Adrienne and Atilio, I knew there wasn’t another company that could give me the opportunity they could. Everyone is great, the team is excellent, and the atmosphere is amazing. They seemed to suit me best.

With a team, everyone here is unified and wants to help each other out to meet our clients’ needs effectively and efficiently. There is less room for mistakes and that’s why being with a team is very awesome. I’m just very excited to be with Team Lally and excited to help you find the home of your dreams!"
