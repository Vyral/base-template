You can brace and bolt your house almost for free—here’s how.

Last year, a neighbor told us about the Earthquake Brace + Bolt program (EBB) that would allow us to brace and bolt our house for minimal cost.

**To take advantage, here’s what you need to do:**

1\.&nbsp;[Apply](https://www.earthquakebracebolt.com/HomeownerRegistration){: target="_blank"} by the program’s deadline, March 19.

2\. If you’re accepted, you can have different contractors come out to your home to give you bids.

3\. Submit your bids to the program.

4\. As long as everything is approved, you get to work with the contractor of your choice.

Overall, **it was a pleasant process that was over in just one day.** Now our home is braced and bolted against earthquakes for just a couple hundred dollars.

Make sure you apply as soon as possible and tell anyone you know who could benefit from the&nbsp; Earthquake Brace + Bolt program how to do it themselves.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to be a resource for you.
