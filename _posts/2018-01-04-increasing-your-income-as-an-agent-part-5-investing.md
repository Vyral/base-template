Today I want to talk about how investing can help you get business and create more money for yourself.

It's amazing how many agents I see pass on deals when they know they could make $20,000, $30,000, $40,000, or even $60,000 if they flipped the home themselves.

When you’re in the real estate business, because there typically isn’t a 401(k) or a retirement plan, you need to take advantage of the deals you find. That means buying investment properties, rental properties, and/or houses to flip. Do these things so that when you want to retire, you can.

**A lot of people create amazing wealth in real estate, but not through buying and selling houses—most of that is done through flipping houses or rentals.**

If you’re going to be in the business of real estate, think about your future by investing in real estate.

If you have any questions about investing in real estate or increasing your net wealth through real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
