Just in time for Valentine’s Day, the Wolek Group is hosting a Date Night event on Thursday, February 13. We’re offering take-and-bake pizzas and either a six-pack of beer or a bottle of wine to all those who RSVP for the event.

I bring this up because date nights are a fun and easy way to reach out to and connect with the people in your database. You can get all sorts of touches from this kind of event, like promotion through video, or partnership with a nonprofit to help promote their organization.

The whole week leading up to this year’s Date Night event, we’re also doing a reverse BOLD 100, where clients call in to register to win a giveaway. Bear in mind that these **giveaways have to be big enough to entice people to call in.**

When those interested in the giveaway do call in, we take that time to confirm their contact information and ask them if they know of anyone interested in buying, selling, or investing in real estate that we can contact; that way, we get a double entry.

**We ALWAYS provide an Eventbrite link for them to RSVP for the giveaway**, which we cap in numbers. For example, on our upcoming Valentine’s Day Date Night event, we have 100 pizzas that clients need to RSVP for in advance. **Set up a call day a couple of days before the event to confirm the client’s RSVP** and ensure they’re going to stop by for pick-up—people often forget to do that, so calling them ahead of time will help you adjust your numbers to avoid having extras. Be sure to partner with a vendor who can help you offset some of the costs, too.

There are tons of ways to touch your database, but date nights are simple and fun. If you want to implement this event idea yourself and have questions about doing so, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to hear how your event goes and/or advise you on setting one up properly.
