The moving process can be very stressful. Thankfully, you can simplify it using these four tips.

**1. Get ready now.** Whether you’re moving in six months or six years, get started as soon as possible. Taking some time to prepare will mean you aren’t stressing out about getting things done at the last minute. The first thing you’re going to want to do is organize things into four piles: the keep pile, the giveaway pile, the maybe pile, and the trash pile. If you aren’t moving for at least a year, put the maybe pile into boxes and then put them away. If you don’t touch the boxes for 12 months, it’s probably safe to donate or get rid of the items.

**2. Try to be patient while you go through everything.** There are a lot of things you’re going to be looking through. Photos, documents, and more will all need to be sorted. Make sure you give yourself adequate time to do so. Once things are sorted, it helps to put them into clear plastic bags or into marked boxes.

**3. Get rid of old magazines and documents.** A lot of people keep too much paper. These things have likely been sitting around for too long, so it may be time to see what can be let go of. Shred things you don’t keep, and organize the rest.

**4. Do it now.** This is best and most valuable of all these tips. Don’t make things stressful for yourself right before your moving date by putting off these tasks. Take care of important tasks now, instead of later.
