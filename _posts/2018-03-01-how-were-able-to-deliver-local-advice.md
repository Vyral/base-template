We’re currently in Port St. Joe, Florida, which is also known as “Florida’s forgotten coast.” A lot of our clams and oysters are harvested out of this bay. There’s so much untouched beauty here, and I love visiting.

**My recent trip out here was a special one because it was with my team.**As a team, it’s great to get out of the office setting, spend some quality time with each other, and then come back and serve our customers on a much higher level because we work together better.
