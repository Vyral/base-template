<br>You’re all cordially invited to our upcoming event: “Sweet Buns With Sweet Clients.” Normally, we’d be preparing for our summer BBQ kickoff right now, but in light of the pandemic and following proper safety guidelines, we decided to hold this event instead so we can see you and thank you in person for your business, referrals, and loyalty. Join us on **March 25 or March 26 from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.** at our office (<u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://goo.gl/maps/jWNVSexCQBFKaptA9">9661 South 700 East Sandy, Utah 84070</a></u>) for some delicious, homemade cinnamon buns. **<u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sweet-buns-for-sweet-clients-tickets-138868612759">Register here</a></u> to reserve your time to come in, say hi, and get your cinnamon buns\!**

If you have any questions for us about the event or about real estate in general, do not hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
