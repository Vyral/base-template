Sellers often ask me when the best time to sell their home is in today’s market. The answer actually depends on one key thing: you. Ask yourself—are you ready to put in the time, money, and energy that’s necessary to prep your home for sale? In today’s competitive market, your home needs to look and feel perfect from the moment a buyer steps foot inside. So the best time to list is actually whenever your home is ready to show.
