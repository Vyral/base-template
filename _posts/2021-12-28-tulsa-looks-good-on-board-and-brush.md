Tulsa looks good on you, and it looks great on Stacy with Board & Brush Creative Studio. I’m feeling the energy and excitement here, and I'm so delighted to talk to her about all the fun things about her business today\!

**Board & Brush is a DIY paint-sip studio.** They serve wine, beer, and other beverages to go along with their unique wooden art projects. Nobody has to do the same project at their workshop, unlike other sip and paint studios. Everybody gets to decide on what they want to make.&nbsp;

Not only is it a fantastic place for holiday and team events, they also offer public workshops as well as private events for anniversaries, birthdays, showers, and more\! When you walk into the studio, you feel inspired by all the amazing pieces lining the walls.&nbsp;

At Board & Brush, **you can customize exactly what you want to make on your board.** You’ll choose a design ahead of time, then start with raw wood. Then their instructors will walk you through how to sand, stain, stencil, paint, and finish the project. There are different stains, techniques, and over 80 colors to choose from; the possibilities are endless.&nbsp;

Even if you aren’t the most artistic person, there’s something for everyone here at Board & Brush. If your creation doesn’t turn out how you like, they will help you fix it or fix it for you to your liking. To learn more about Board & Brush, **you can head on over to their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/boardandbrushokc), give them a call at (918) 615-0722, or visit their [website](https://boardandbrush.com/tulsa/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.**
