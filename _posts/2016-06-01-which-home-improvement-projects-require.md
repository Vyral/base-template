Do you need permits to build a deck, shed, fence, or other additions to your home? The short answer is probably, but it really depends where your property is located.

For example, a house outside city limits probably wonâ€™t need a permit for most of these additions if there is no Homeowners Association. However, if the house is in an HOA, there are likely building restrictions and application requirements you need to go through in order to get these projects approved.

If you are inside the city limits, you will definitely need to obtain the necessary permits from the appropriate entities in order to make those additions to your home.

If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
