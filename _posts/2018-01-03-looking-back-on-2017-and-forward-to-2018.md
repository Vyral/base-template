Today, let’s take a look back at the 2017 real estate market and take a look at some predictions for 2018.&nbsp;

In 2017, our median house price increased another 6%. **That is the third year in a row that our market has seen 6% appreciation or more.&nbsp;**

If you are sitting on the sidelines waiting to buy a home, keep in mind that a house that cost $250,000 three years ago will now cost you $295,000. Is waiting to buy a home really working out for you?&nbsp;

You should also know that in 2017, sellers got 97% of their asking price. Lowball offers are going nowhere fast.&nbsp;

So, what can you expect from the 2018 market conditions?&nbsp;

**I predict another 5% to 6% increase in home values in our area.** The folks up North are still ready to move on down here. The oldest baby boomers are hitting their late 50s and getting ready to move to Florida. The new tax laws have folks in high-tax states losing their deductions, and they are calling me about moving here.&nbsp;

As you can see, market interest is still strong and prices will keep moving upward.&nbsp;

How does all of this affect you?&nbsp;

If you are a seller, it’s poker time. Should you hold them or fold them? It’s been a good run so far and should be a good run for a while longer. However, interest rates are expected to increase three or four times in 2018. That will have an impact on your buyer base and will certainly start to impact the real estate market by the end of the year.&nbsp;

If you are a buyer, you need to know that prices and interest rates are both going up. Not making a move will cost you. If you are interested in buying a home, we can help you find some creative financing options to achieve your real estate goals.&nbsp;
