Today I’d like to cover four points about VA loans and the benefits associated with them.

1. **VA loans don’t require a down payment.** Military service people and veterans can essentially go to the closing table with zero down, which is a great benefit.
2. **They don’t require mortgage insurance.** Both FHA and USDA loans require mortgage insurance for the life of the loan. As a member of the military, you won’t have that requirement with a VA loan.<br>{% include pullquote.html %}
3. **VA loans aren’t restricted to single-family residences.&nbsp;**Essentially, you could buy a duplex, triplex, or quadruplex, live in one of the units and rent the other one out. This allows you to have your unit paid for by someone else.
4. **If you’re a disabled veteran, you don’t have to pay the funding fee.&nbsp;**This could save you anywhere from 1% to 3% on the cost of the loan.

If you or anyone you know is in the market to buy, sell, or invest in real estate, definitely give us a call or send an email. I’d be glad to sit down and speak to you, your friends, or your family and help you out.
