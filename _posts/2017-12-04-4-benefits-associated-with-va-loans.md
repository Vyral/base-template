Today I’d like to cover four points about VA loans and the benefits associated with them.

1. **VA loans don’t require a down payment.** Military service people and veterans can go to the closing table with zero down, which is a great benefit.
2. **They don’t require mortgage insurance.** Both FHA and USDA loans require mortgage insurance for the life of the loan. As a member of the military, you won’t have that requirement with a VA loan.<br><!--base32-c9gq6t9k68ppctvad9gqmc9n6tw32ck1cdm6wd3degtk0xb2cnhp8w1qc5u36d9mdnu36c3q6dq68u3g6wt7grk6cnm6mukqemtput3ee0t62rv8cwu6ux1kc4wkjw9rd1wk4r9tc9vjurk1edjk6cg-base32-->
3. **VA loans aren’t restricted to single-family residences.**Essentially, you could buy a duplex, triplex, or quadruplex, live in one of the units and rent the others out. This allows you to have your unit paid for by someone else.
4. **If you’re a disabled veteran, you don’t have to pay the funding fee.**This could save you anywhere from 1% to 3% on the cost of the loan.

If you or anyone you know is in the market to buy, sell, or invest in real estate, definitely give us a call or send an email. I’d be glad to sit down and speak to you, your friends, or your family and help you out.
