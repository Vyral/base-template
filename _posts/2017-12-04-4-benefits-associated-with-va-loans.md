Today I’d like to cover four points about VA loans and the benefits associated with them.

1. **VA loans don’t require a down payment.** Military service people and veterans can go to the closing table with zero down, which is a great benefit.
2. **They don’t require mortgage insurance.** Both FHA and USDA loans require mortgage insurance for the life of the loan. As a member of the military, you won’t have that requirement with a VA loan.<br><!--base32-c9gq6t9k68pp6eb7e4v78ebb6rw70w1pcnh3et9mervkgtb2c8v74xtq61vk6cv5d1v3cckm65u66y3je1uq4x3mcht7cdtrf1u6pdhtd1r70rv26dhpgw3bcdw7cd1pchn3crbmetpp8rvj6xkq4u3acdj72dk7ewrq4tbqe9rk4wkmdtjpux3bcdu32x34dtn3cxvr75nkcx38dcv7eebgcdm74uv3cmtpwdk4ddnp6y3pdmv7guvh6huq8w33chrkcxb4ddj6avkee4t78rk4cnm74dv1f0rpprved9nk0y1he0v3jx1qcdjk6cv5f1upprvrc9t3cdbee0v68cvhchj6wdv5cnh6mrv7e9rpaxbmdnjkgxvh71t78x35ehq3erbqddh3cdbae0w7auv26tu6gw35c9h34rtnehr62rvmd8pp4rbkcmtk4-base32-->
3. **VA loans aren’t restricted to single-family residences.&nbsp;**Essentially, you could buy a duplex, triplex, or quadruplex, live in one of the units and rent the others out. This allows you to have your unit paid for by someone else.
4. **If you’re a disabled veteran, you don’t have to pay the funding fee.&nbsp;**This could save you anywhere from 1% to 3% on the cost of the loan.
