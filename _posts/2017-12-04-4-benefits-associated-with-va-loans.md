Today I’d like to cover four points about VA loans and the benefits associated with them.

1. **VA loans don’t require a down payment.** Military service people and veterans can go to the closing table with zero down, which is a great benefit.
2. **They don’t require mortgage insurance.** Both FHA and USDA loans require mortgage insurance for the life of the loan. As a member of the military, you won’t have that requirement with a VA loan.<br><!--base32-fgjjaz156x12achn4mt30ubecdp7at354mt30w3ndhp72xbfehjjwu3mdnp2achg4mt3a99q8hy2a9bw-base32-->
3. **VA loans aren’t restricted to single-family residences.&nbsp;**Essentially, you could buy a duplex, triplex, or quadruplex, live in one of the units and rent the others out. This allows you to have your unit paid for by someone else.
4. **If you’re a disabled veteran, you don’t have to pay the funding fee.&nbsp;**This could save you anywhere from 1% to 3% on the cost of the loan.
