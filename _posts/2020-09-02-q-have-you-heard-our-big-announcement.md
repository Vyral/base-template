Today I am excited to announce the launch of House and Home Mortgage, our in-house mortgage brokerage at Homestead & Co. We’ve heard your complaints about the home buying process being too cumbersome and complicated by too many price fluctuations, and we’re here to address them. We’ve partnered with proven industry leaders and experienced loan officers, and backed it all up by industry-leading investors. This will allow us to give you a much smoother transaction process when buying a home. To learn more about this exciting new development, watch this short video.
