When I moved into my office, I made sure it was a great place for me to shoot my videos. Here’s how I did that.

I’m taking you on a tour of my office today to show you what’s going on behind the scenes in my videos. I’m excited to show you guys what I’m working with. All of the items I talk about in this video will be linked at the bottom of this blog post.

I don’t have an expensive camera or fancy equipment, but I do have some great tools that help me make professional quality videos. **I use my iPhone to record the videos and I have a few different tripods for it.**

I can use one of them for videos in which I am standing up, and I can use the other one to sit right on my desk to record videos while seated. I got the big tripod from Vyral Marketing, a great marketing company that helps us produce our videos. They sent one along when I signed up for their services.

**When I moved out to the market center, I made sure my office was set up to have great backgrounds for my videos.** I even had one of my trusted home stagers come in to help me with the space.

In one corner, I have my lead generation station with a stand-up desk. On one wall, I have a beautiful painting that my husband and daughter made me. Another wall is filled with books and shelves. They each offer a different setting, which I love.

I also invested in lighting. **It’s one of the keys to producing consistent high-quality videos.** I also have a bluetooth-enabled clicker that allows me to stop and start recording without having to walk over to my phone. Another thing I invested in was a selfie stick for on-the-go shoots.

**A good microphone is the last piece of the puzzle.** I have a lapel mic that plugs right into my iPhone and gives me great sound quality. You can hear the difference in the video above when I take it off.

That about covers it for my tips on creating good videos. **Make sure you’ve got a steady camera, good lighting, and a reliable microphone and you’ll be just fine.**

If you have any questions for me at all about the real estate business, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email, I would love to hear from you and answer any questions.
