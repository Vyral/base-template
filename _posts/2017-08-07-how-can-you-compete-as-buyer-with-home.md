How can you be a competitive buyer in a seller’s market with a home sale contingency?

By home sale contingency, I mean you need to sell your home and pull the equity out of it in order to purchase your next home.

In a seller’s market, sellers tend to get multiple offers and have the option of reviewing and choosing the best of those offers. The three things sellers care about are money, time, and stress—making as much money as the market will give them in as little time and with as little stress as possible.

A home sale contingency is a big risk for a seller to consider. Therefore, it can add a lot of stress to their decision. There are three things you can do to alleviate this stress and make your offer less of a risk for them.

First, **get your house pre-inspected.** Have an inspector come to your property, get an inspection report, and make all the necessary repairs listed in that report. Provide that in the offer for the home you wish to purchase.

Second, **get an appraisal done on your house.** A seller will want to see that the market price you set on your home is in line with the appraised value.

Third, **get your house staged, improve its curb appeal, and use professional photography** in your offer so the seller can see that the home will sell and close within the time of the contingency.
