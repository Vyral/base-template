Are you curious how you can protect yourself against the recent Equifax data breach? Here are five tips you can use:

**1. Know the facts.** Reach out to a professional and see if you’ve been affected.

**2. Find out if you’ve been impacted.** You can visit [www.equifaxsecurity2017.com](http://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com) to do so.

**3. Take action.** There is a resolution service you can use that will help you see what needs to be done. Place a 90-day fraud alert on all of your credit bureaus to let them know you’ve been affected by the breach. You can also take advantage of the free credit monitoring. I use Credit Karma, which is a free service and sends you an email once a month to keep you updated on the latest developments and lets you know what you can do to improve your credit.

**4. Raise your awareness.** Be positive about the experience. We even have to send out notices to our clients about different things that can happen with our emails in real estate work.

**5. If identity theft strikes, contact a resolution expert** so they can help you take care of it as fast as possible. Credit Karma actually has a service that lets you know if something has been done so you can know about it immediately. Some people don’t check their credit often, so they can be tremendously affected by this kind of thing.

If you have any questions about these tips, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help you.
