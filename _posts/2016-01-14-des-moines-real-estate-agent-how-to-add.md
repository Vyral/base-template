Today I'm excited to answer some questions about remodeling. We are always getting questions from clients about where they should put their money. **Today we are going to answer some of those questions.**

There are a few key concepts that I advise people to go by. **The first is square footage.** Whenever you are adding square footage to your home, you're adding value.

**Another thing that adds a lot of value is an extra bedroom.** If you go from being a 3-bedroom home to a 4-bedroom home, your home will be in a higher price bracket.

Adding another full or half-bathroom is another great idea. Even if you can't add anything, remodeling your bathroom will bring you a pretty good return on investment.

When you do decide to add value to your home through home renovation or remodeling projects, understand that **you won't always get a full return on your investment.** I found a cool graph in Realtor Mag, that shows how much value certain home repairs bring. If you update your heating and cooling system, you can expect to get around 71% of that cost back. However, **with hardwood floor refinishing, you can expect to get 100% of that value back** when you decide to sell.

My best advice is this. If you are considering adding value to your home through renovations or remodels, give us a call first. We can help you get started, and **put you in touch with some of the best contractors in the area** who will be able to take it from there. We are happy to help out, and would love to hear from you. Give us a call or send us an email today!
