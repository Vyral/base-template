Hurricane Harvey has caused a great deal of destruction along our coast.

Now, following the devastating storms that have hit our state, many people are wondering how they can aid those whoâ€™ve been affected.

First of all, there are many different organizations that are collecting relief effort funds. The mayor of Houston, himself, has begun collecting funds at the Great Houston Community Foundation. GoFundMe and the Salvation Army are both also accepting donations.

There are also ways you can aid those affected through non monetary means. **Blood donations are needed at the American Red Cross, and AirBnB has opened up an urgent accommodation site** that allows you to open your home to those who may have lost theirs.

Area food banks, too, are accepting donations of food and money.

This certainly is not a comprehensive list of the ways you can help. We merely wanted to provide you with a starting point. However, for a more complete list of ways to aid those affected, simply [click here](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/28/546745827/looking-to-help-those-affected-by-harvey-here-s-a-list).

**Finally, we would like to extend our sincerest thanks to those who have already given their time and effort to this cause, and especially to those who have risked their lives in doing so.**

We massively appreciate the resources, time, and money given by so many of you, already, &nbsp;to those in need. These relief efforts are truly saving lives. In this time of great hardship, please keep those affected in your thoughts, prayers, and daily efforts. May God bless Texas.
