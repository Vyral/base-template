Adam Diven found the Caul Real Estate Group after finishing his pre-licensing, and working with us afforded him the opportunity to get his post-licensing and become a fully licensed broker. Though we’ve heard good and bad things about the real estate exam, **Adam didn’t personally have much trouble with it—he’d just graduated from college when he took it, which he feels worked to his benefit**. He knows that some struggle with the exam, but he believes that if you’re committed to becoming an agent and you study hard, it’s absolutely doable.

Before joining our team, Adam explored the options of working as a solo agent and as an agent on a team. In the end, however, he feels blessed to have found a team to work with. On a team, you always have someone to lean on, and there are plenty of people to learn from.

1. He can dunk a basketball.
2. He drives two hours every day to get to work.
3. He’s the “token male” on our team of 15 people.
4. He wears special socks.
5. He used to have long hair.
