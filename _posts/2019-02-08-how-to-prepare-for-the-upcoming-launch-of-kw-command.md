I recently chatted with Shaina Moats, an agent from Austin, Texas, who is also a Labs Unleashed instructor with Keller Williams. We talked about how we can best prepare ourselves for the upcoming launch of the new KW Command operating system, and **I’d like to share some of our preparation tips with you.**

It’s a good idea to clean up your database by updating contact information, such as emails, phone numbers, addresses, names, etc. Being sure you have the correct info will make all the difference before KW Command, and the benefits of doing so will be felt even more once KW Command arrives. While you’re making updates, **why not take some time to touch base with your database?** Call some numbers, send some emails, and so on. Connect however you can; this is a relationship business, after all.

If you’re a Keller Williams agent, another thing to do is open up your Kelle app. Say “add insights” in the app to update your location. From here, **you can take pictures, add comments, and broadcast what you think of the area you’re in.** When the consumer KW mobile app is updated in the near future, potential homebuyers will be able to see the information you’ve posted. As they're scanning a neighborhood to get ideas, your comments and info will pop up. **If they see that you’re the one adding all the information, they’ll think you really know the area and can serve their needs the best!**

These are just a few things I recommend. If you’d like more information or have any questions, reach out to me. I look forward to helping you.<br>
