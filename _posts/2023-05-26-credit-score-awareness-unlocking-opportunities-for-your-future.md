Everybody should have some general idea of where their credit score is. There are three credit bureaus, and you're allowed to get one free credit report every year to stay on top of that. **You know where your score is, so you can put yourself in a position to buy a home** if you have some challenges; there might be some things you want to dispute with respect to your credit score, or some bills that you may have paid off that they didn't take off to get it improved.

Just like you have your Social Security number or your date of birth, you should know and stay on top of your credit score. Because our economy runs on that. Everything is done through credit. There are some people that buy cash, but a majority of them use credit. **So you need to stay on top of that so you can function in the economy of the United States.**
