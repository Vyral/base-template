  How can you make a competitive offer against all-cash homebuyers?  It’s
  getting harder to win a bidding war these days. People who need
  financing—about 66% of homebuyers—as well as those with smaller down payments
  often have trouble competing with all-cash buyers who are able to entice
  sellers with clean offers and speedy closings.  Does this mean a solid buyer
  shouldn’t attempt to compete with cash buyers?  Absolutely not. The truth is
  that a buyer getting a mortgage can still compete against cash buyers and win.
  These are the questions that can make all the difference:  How much are you
  putting down for a down payment? Are there any other programs that you qualify
  for? Are you well employed? Do you have any cash reserves in addition to your
  down payment? Do you have very little debt? Do you have good credit?  If you
  answered yes to most or all of these questions, your purchase should be as
  bulletproof as a cash homebuyer’s, but you still want to try to stand out from
  the crowd.  One strategy people are using to be more noticeable and to compete
  with all-cash buyers in this hot real estate market is writing a letter to a
  seller. It isn’t easy to compose a letter engaging and personal enough to
  convince the recipient that they should award the house to you instead of
  someone else. However, in this extremely active market with many all-cash
  buyers, your meaningful words could make the difference between getting the
  home you’ve dreamed of and having to go to another showing. If you want to
  plus-one this idea, add in a favorite picture of you, your family, and even
  your pets.  Do you need some help composing a letter to a seller? Have you
  been beaten out when writing an offer and are now tired of running around the
  market? Do you know somebody else who’s thinking about buying?  If you said
  yes to any of these, feel free to reach out to us. The Dailey Group is here to
  help you and those you care about move with confidence.
