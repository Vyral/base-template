Welcome to the latest episode of *“What’s Working Now!”*&nbsp;

Today, I want to talk to you about **an innovate way to generate additional buyer activity when selling your home.**&nbsp;

For example, we have a new listing that is getting market-ready. The seller is moving boxes around, packing, cleaning, and gardening so that the house is ready to hit the market in the next couple of weeks.&nbsp;

The seller had the idea that they would like to invite their friends over to say goodbye to the house. We picked a day on the weekend and invited them over in the middle of the day while the sun was out, and the friends all got to take a look at the house.&nbsp;

I thought it was a really good idea. Then, we started talking about other ideas we’ve used on past properties to market the home to the seller’s community.&nbsp;

When it comes time to market your home, I have a network of 3,500 real estate agents, 2,000 prospects, and a neighborhood listserv of 20,000 of my closest friends.&nbsp;

In the past, I’ve also had the sellers send my ad with the video tour of their home out to their own listservs.&nbsp;

Think about it. You may have a network of fellow college alumni, other parents from your kid’s high school, or you may belong to a church, synagogue, or music group. You may have your own “listserv” right on your own street.&nbsp;

If you take this ad and send it out to your friends, **you can tap into a whole new pool of people.** As a seller, your friends might know someone who would be interested in purchasing your house.&nbsp;

I’ve also had past sellers send the ad to their Facebook friends.&nbsp;

Basically, I show my sellers the examples of the ad and tell them about the networks and publications that I will send the ad to. Then, I say, “If you have a group of people or friends who might know someone interested in your property, why don’t we tap into those people as well?&nbsp;

If the seller isn’t sure, then I let it go. If they think it’s a great idea, we talk about their Facebook, their neighborhood listserv, or any newsletters they may send out as part of their job or other organizations they may belong to.&nbsp;

By sending out the ad to the seller’s network, we are tapping into even more people than I would ever have access to, which is great.&nbsp;

**I also have the seller make a video showing off their home.** The seller walks around and talks about family dinners, the wedding in the front yard, and the attic the kids used to play hide and seek in. I make the video look like a really nice home video.&nbsp;

Recently, before I could even offer, the owner said to me, “How about I send this video to my friends?”&nbsp;

I thought, what a great idea! We are doing just that with a new listing this week.&nbsp;

When getting ready to sell your house, make sure that you work with an agent who has some of these creative ideas. Think about who you know who may know a buyer for your house.&nbsp;
