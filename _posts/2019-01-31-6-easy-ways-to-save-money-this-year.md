It’s the little things—that can save you a ton of money this year.

Here are six of them that I’d like to share with you!

Cancel a service – Take a look at your monthly credit card and bank statements.&nbsp; Are you paying a monthly fee for a service that you hardly use?&nbsp; Or can you find the service somewhere else for free?&nbsp; For example—paying a monthly fee to Netflix when you can get it from the library.&nbsp; Or paying a fee for a service that you didn’t remember that you had in the first place.

Use every ounce – Just when you think your mayo container is empty, it’s really not — because you’ll find at least a couple of servings left at the bottom of the squeeze bottle.&nbsp; Same goes for shampoo and toothpaste.&nbsp; As a test, a friend of mine made it a habit of turning the shampoo bottle upside down and emptying what’s left into another bottle just to see how much gets thrown away.&nbsp; She was able to get two months’ extra supply of shampoo from the ‘empty’ bottle.

Watch your ATM Fees – If you have to pay an ATM fee, take out more money than needed because you’ll be paying the same fee whether you take out $20 or $120.&nbsp; Another way to save money is use your debit card at a grocery store.&nbsp; Buy what you need and use the “cash back” button to avoid bank fees altogether.

Don’t buy more than you need – Unless it’s a super-duper sale, buy only what you need.&nbsp; You are spending your hard-earned money “now” for things you “may need” in the future.

Create a no-spend weekend – For one weekend per month, don’t spend any money—that means your credit card too.

Save dollar bills – This is kinda corny, but examine the serial number of your dollar bills.&nbsp; Save the ones that begin with the letter A.&nbsp; You can do the same thing with coins.&nbsp; Put them in a money jar at the end of each day.&nbsp; Then take it to the bank and deposit it into a savings account so you are not tempted to spend it.
