**Looking to improve your real estate career?** I'm here to help you make a smart decision when it comes to growing your business, improving your bottom line, and choosing a place to work in real estate sales. If you'd like to learn more about working with Damon Gettier and Associates, contact me at <a href="tel:540-314-1199">540-314-1199</a> or <a href="mailto:Damon@DamonGettier.com"Damon@DamonGettier.com</a>.

To ensure our agents are successful, we have systemized everything â€“ **individual agents cannot to do everything, let alone be successful and earn and income.**

We have three different internet-based systems that we spend over $5,000 a month for the sole purpose of bringing in internet leads.  We also have an administrative staff that supports our agents. For instance, after we write a contract, the staff takes the contract to closing. There are also **three groups of inside sales agents** who call our listing prospects, buyer prospects and turn those prospects into viable leads. **This allows our agents to focus on writing contracts and showing homes.**

If you have any questions about the systems or techniques that we use, feel free to call or email me. Thanks and have a great day!
