Can you sell a property if you have a renter living in the unit? The answer is absolutely yes, but you are limiting the pool of potential buyers to investors if you are in the middle of a lease.

<br>**Most people actually wait until the lease is about to expire before they notify their tenants.** Here in the state of California, there are two noticing periods if you would like the tenant to vacate. If the tenant has been in the property for less than a year, you need to give them 30 days. If the tenant has been in the property for over a year, you need to give them 60 days to vacate.<br>Then, you can get in and clean up the property before you put it on the market.

<br>**However, if you’ve had really great tenants** and you think they may be willing to work with you to sell the home, I actually recommend allowing them to stay in the property. Once their lease is over, simply put them on a month-to-month lease. That way, you can show the home while it’s still furnished, which is very beneficial as some people have difficulty visualizing where things will go in the property.

<br>If you do decide to sell while the tenant is still in the property, you have to provide 24-hours notice to the tenants before each showing. The showings also have to happen during normal business hours, as the tenant has the right to inhabit the property with peaceful enjoyment.
