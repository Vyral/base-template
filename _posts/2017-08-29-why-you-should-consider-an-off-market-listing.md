{% include youtube.html %} Today I’m excited to be joined by Janae Papazian, our lead buyer specialist, to talk about how to find and purchase off-market properties.

Off-market properties are a great and often untapped opportunity. Janae has personally helped people find their home in this way. **When a home isn’t on the MLS, she says, the only real challenge is to go out and search** for homes by calling around or knocking on doors. &nbsp;

However, while finding an off-market home might take a little more effort to find, these kinds of listings simply don’t have the same amount of competition. Especially in a seller’s market like ours, less competition is ideal.&nbsp;

Since multiple offer situations are extremely common among most other listings out there, off-market listings are like a secret resource for those willing to put in the effort to find them.&nbsp;

Additionally, off-market listings carry the potential of being better deals. People who have restricted their home search to simply looking on websites like Zillow or Trulia are actually doing themselves a disservice—they’re missing out on a lot of great listings that take a little extra care to discover.&nbsp;

Zillow, especially, is often very delayed. **Many homes buyers find through this website may actually have already sold.** This can be incredibly frustrating.

This isn’t to say that no home listings on Zillow are valid, though. Janae herself has helped people to find their home through the website. However, this is just one of the many ways she has been able to help people.

When it comes to off-market properties, Janae has experience with helping clients through the unique circumstances they carry. For one thing, these kinds of listings mean that you as a buyer will be in more direct communication with the seller, as opposed to an agent. Sometimes, this can lead to people taking things a little too personally. Sellers also sometimes may have unrealistic expectations about their home’s worth.

In circumstances like these, Janae’s goal is to help get you into the home for the best deal possible. To achieve this, **she counsels both sides as the deal is worked out.&nbsp;**

In a seller’s market, off-market properties are a great resource. Having a buyer representative who is willing to go the extra mile is key.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&nbsp;
