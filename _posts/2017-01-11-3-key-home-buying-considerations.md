What should buyers look for in a San Antonio home?

We often see buyers look for homes with window dressings or modern fixtures and appliances. These are great, but it's just as important to look at these three factors when you choose a home:

1. Resale value. Don't just think about the house you buy, think of it as a house you'll have to sell in the future. Consider the neighborhood, the pricing, and the size. Buying the biggest and best house in the neighborhood could present major issues down the road when selling.

2. Make sure the house is structurally sound. It should have good windows, doors, floors, and roofing, and should not have water spots on the ceiling or cracks on the inside or outside walls. Look for the house that has the best 'guts' rather than just looking at the design. Always have a home inspection to make sure you're not overlooking something that could be a costly headache down the road.

3. Cost of repairs. Plumbing, heating and cooling, roofing, and water heaters are all very costly systems to repair or replace. Make sure they're all inspected and addressed during the inspection period of the home buying process before you're fully committed.

If you have any other questions about the important things to look for in a home, or you're thinking about buying or selling a home in the San Antonio market, give me a call or send me an email. We'd be happy to help.
