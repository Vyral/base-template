I'm extremely excited to announce that the Oregon Association of Realtors has picked me to be an instructor for real estate classes aimed at educating consumers. I was one of twelve agents chosen out of the entire state of Oregon, so I'm very humbled and honored to have this opportunity.

I've worked out a deal with Stellar Realty's owner, Paul Campbell, and he's also agreed to teach one class per month. I will also teach one class per month, and these two classes will be aimed at first-time home buyers, and then the other portion will be aimed at investing in real estate.

If you're interested in learning more about these classes, please don't hesitate to contact us or resister here! You won't want to miss out on any of this information!
