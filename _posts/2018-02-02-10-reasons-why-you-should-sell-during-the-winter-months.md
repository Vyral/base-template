10 Reasons Why You Should Sell During the Winter Months!

Today I wanted to speak with you about a big topic this time of year which is whether or not you should sell your home during the holiday season. To answer this, I have ten great reasons why now is the time to list and sell your home! There are a lot of myths out there that homes don’t sell during the winter months, but the reality tells us something different. According to our MLS statistics in the Greater Milwaukee Metro Area from December 2012-February 2013, there were almost 2,500 single family homes that went under contract.

<br>The ten great reasons to sell now are outlined below:

1. &nbsp;&nbsp; People who are looking for homes this time of year are more serious buyers.

2. &nbsp;&nbsp; The serious buyers have fewer homes to choose from. Our inventory level right now is the lowest it’s been in seven years. This is a great time to be a seller!

3. &nbsp;&nbsp; Since the supply of homes has dramatically dropped and will increase in the spring by 25-30%, there will be less demand for your home when there is a larger supply (less demand = less money for you).

4. &nbsp;&nbsp; Buyers have more money to spend this time of year. Where does this money come from? Tax returns, bonuses and also pay increases come this time of year.

5. &nbsp;&nbsp; Buyers have more time to shop during the holidays/winter then they do during the summer.

6. &nbsp;&nbsp; Some people must buy a home before the end of the year for tax reasons.

7. &nbsp;&nbsp; December and January are prime job relocation months.

8. &nbsp;&nbsp; You can still be on the market during the holidays and restrict showings on specific days.

9. &nbsp;&nbsp; You can sell your home now for money and move in the spring. This can be worked out during negotiations.

10. &nbsp;&nbsp; If you sell now, you have the option to be a non-contingent buyer in the spring when the supply of homes increases. This allows you to sell high and buyer low.

If you’re considering selling now or before spring, give me a call to take advantage of any of the reasons above. Thanks and happy holidays!
