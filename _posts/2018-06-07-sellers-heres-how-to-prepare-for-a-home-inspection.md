What kind of things should sellers do to prepare for the home inspection process? Let’s go over a few important considerations.

First, it’s important to determine whether your doorbell works and whether your handrails, if you have them, are securely attached.

Moving on, another way you should prepare is by moving items away from your furnace and hot water tank. **This will make it easier, and safer, for the home inspector to navigate your home.**

And while you’re working around your hot water tank, another preparatory step you can take is to make sure it’s functioning adequately.

One more area you’ll need to make accessible for the home inspector is the attic. If the attic is blocked off, the inspector won’t be able to provide an accurate and comprehensive report.

Also, as the inspector will be examining your home in great detail, it’s important to stay proactive in completing maintenance tasks like replacing the furnace filter.

All systems in your home should be functioning properly, and this includes your plumbing. Water pressure should be adequate, drains should be in working order, faucets shouldn’t drip, and your toilet should flush.

**Beyond ensuring that items and systems in your home are accessible and properly functioning, it’s also critical to make sure your home is safe.** One way to do this is by checking your smoke detectors to verify that they work and have fresh batteries. And as for your home’s exterior, a good way to prevent water damage is by grading your mulch so that drainage slopes away. Gutters, too, should slope away and be clear of debris. Lastly, make sure that bushes and trees are trimmed back away from the home.

Hopefully these tips will help you achieve as seamless an inspection process as possible.
