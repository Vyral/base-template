If you’re thinking about selling your home soon, it’s important to know that the market is heating up and properties are moving quickly. Buyers are finding homes online, and **here at the Northern Virginia Home Finder Team, we have an exclusive new technique that nobody else here in town is using.**

The technique we’re talking about is the ability to get our clients’ homes on the first page of search results on Google. Studies have shown that when a video thumbnail is on the first page of search results on Google, people will click on it 87% of the time.

We are able to create these videos with up to 50 different search terms and within a matter of moments, we can ensure that your property shows up on the first page of results when any of those terms are used.

In addition to that, we also have a 4.5% listing, where we only take 1.5% for our commission after having to pay 3% to the buyer side (it’s unavoidable). **We can do phenomenal marketing for you at a much lower price than our competitors, and that includes getting you on page one of Google.**

If you have any questions or you’re looking to list your home and get top dollar, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.

Teaser: The Northern Virginia real estate market is heating up. Homes are selling faster on average, and that’s certainly true of our listings. We are currently using a technique to get all of our listings on the first page of search results on Google for more than 50 different terms. To learn how we are using the power of Google search to help our sellers expedite their sales, watch this short video.
