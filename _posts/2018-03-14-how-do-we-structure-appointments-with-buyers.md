  In recent years, my team and I have re-worked the structure of our buyer
  appointments. Today, I’ll be going over what these appointments look like,
  now.

In the past, the way I would conduct myself when first meeting with buyer clients was much less structured than the way I conducted listing appointments.

My listing process involved a set number of steps I would carry through, so I began to wonder why my team and I weren’t applying this same sense of structure to buyer appointments.

So, I checked around with some of the highest producing and most innovative brokers in the country, and, sure enough, their buyer appointments were just as structured as their listing appointments.

Now, **from the moment we’re setting up an appointment with a buyer, we explain what they can expect from the process.** We let them know that we will first come together at the home, then go over the consumer notice and walk through the property, and then finish by discussing the real estate process.

Once the buyer confirms that they would like to proceed, we can move forward knowing everyone is on the same page. We also review what will happen during the process at the start of every appointment.

Thanks to this sense of structure, we’re able to build rapport, ask questions about the buyer’s goals and motivations, and solidify a professional relationship. Also during the appointment, we provide a packet containing mortgage information, the consumer notice, the buyer agency agreement, and what I call a buyer presentation. This last item outlines and unpacks the entire buyer process and goes into the role of a buyer’s agent.

The buyer presentation is about 15 pages long, slightly shorter than our listing presentation, and is **designed to help buyers understand exactly how we as agents can advocate for them through the transaction.**

Finally, we ask the buyer if they understand everything we’ve gone over. If they do, we can move on to signing the buyer agency agreement and get the rest of the process underway.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
