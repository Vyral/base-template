*Recently, I helped sell my mother’s home in the United Kingdom, as I’ve always been interested in international real estate. Transactions are different in each country.*

I’ve long been interested in international real estate and I have many connections with Realtors all over the world.

 This month, with the help of a great local real estate company, we have sold my mother’s home in the United Kingdom, as she is about to go into assisted living. It’s been an interesting process because **things are done a little differently here.**

For one, the buyers are called applicants, and they are not legally represented here the same way they are in America.

In the U.K., real estate agents don’t have to be licensed, and one in three transactions fail. You have to use solicitors and attorneys. **The whole process takes approximately three months.**

That said, my mother’s 3-bed, 1-bathroom, 1,100 square foot bungalow sold for the equivalent of about $330,000.

So, let us know if you know anyone who is interested in buying or selling a home. We can help them meet their goals anywhere in the world. We look forward to hearing from you!
