How did I get into real estate?

The story goes all the way back to my childhood in Canton, Mississippi—a small town nicknamed the “City of Lights.”

I’ve always been an entrepreneur, and when I was 12 I started my first sales job selling newspapers around the town square. After that I worked in a grocery store and in college I got a job as an EMT driving an ambulance for a number of years.

**In 1996, I decided to get into the real estate industry.** After I got my real estate license, I quit my EMT job, so it was either sink or swim. I sold a house during my first month and did well during my first year—I didn’t go a single month without a sale. Then a month finally went by where I didn’t have a sale, and it scared me to death. I decided then that I needed to analyze the job better and work harder.

**In 2004, I opened my own brokerage.** Within a few months, I sold more houses in the Jackson metro market than any other real estate company in the area. From there, I was named to several real estate committees and various boards and asked to teach classes.

When I look back on my career now that it’s 2018, I realize I’ve been directly responsible for over $1.25 billion in sales. Over 9,000 transactions have had my name on them somewhere along the way. Honestly, I’m amazed by this. It’s pretty cool to know that I’ve been a part of that many lives over my 22-year career, and I still feel like I’m just beginning.

As you know, I’ve recently rebranded my team, and we’re now known as “The Moving On Team.” **We’re also increasing our staff and increasing our services.** According to the latest statistics, the average agent did three sales by the end of March this year. By that time, I’d already done 55.

This year has gotten off to a great start, and I can only imagine where it will take me. I couldn’t do any of this without my wonderful family: my wife, Amy (who’s also my principal broker) and my two sons, Seth and Grant. I also have a wonderful staff supporting me. Lastly, I give all glory to God.

If you have any real estate questions for me or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
