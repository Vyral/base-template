It’s very important to fill out a residential property disclosure if you’re a homeowner. If you’re planning on selling, you should fill it out yourself and disclose anything that has happened to the property in the last five years.

**For example, it’s important to explain any major issues, such as pipe bursts or remodels, and make sure you have the proper documents and receipts.** An unresolved issue can prompt a renegotiation, which you definitely want to avoid.

**Filling out this form is very important in order to get the highest and best possible price for your home.** It also puts the buyer at ease when they know everything about the home up front.

Disclose how old your appliances are as well. They may be a little older, but if they are working fine and you've had them serviced recently, there shouldn't be a renegotiation because of it.

If you have any questions about your residential property disclosure or anything else relating to the sale of your home, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
