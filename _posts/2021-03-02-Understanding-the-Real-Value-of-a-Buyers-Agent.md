What improvements should and shouldn’t you spend money on before you list your home for sale? Some updates will net you more, while others will cost you.

You want to focus on the areas buyers will concentrate on the most. **From the moment they walk into your house, the predominant thing they’ll see is the main floor living area.** Focus on creating a personality in the main living area; installing updated floors such as vinyl planking will help. The other area to concentrate on is the kitchen because it’s where people gather; many of us center our lives around food\! You could paint the cabinets, install new cabinets, change the countertops, or you may want to do a full renovation to create a more open floor plan.&nbsp;

Second-most important to focus on is the master bedroom and bathroom because **people looking at the home will remember the areas they will spend the most time in**, and for many, that’s the master suite. No matter which area you’re upgrading, only spend money on what will get you a great return on your investment.

So what shouldn’t you do? There’s no need to overhaul secondary bathrooms—don’t spend a ton of money on them. You also don’t need to update the major systems such as the heating and air conditioning systems and water heater. 99% of buyers will ask for a home warranty plan, which will cover all those major systems and protect the seller. Requests for repairs on these systems can be negotiated later.&nbsp;

Additionally, **painting accent walls or adding wainscoting or crown molding isn’t necessary.** These will help a house sell quicker, but they won’t net you more money.&nbsp;
