Has your home been on the market too long? Have you ever sat at a closing table for way too long? If so, we have great news for you.

Some homes are selling quickly, while others sit on the market for a long time. The reason some are selling fast—and often for top dollar—is because they’ve been updated; they have the right colors, carpet, countertops, and so on. We have just created a program called Revitalize. **It streamlines the process of updating your house before you come on the market.** Your property will sell faster and often for more money.

There have been many times where I’ve sat at a closing table for four to five hours. Now, we pre-fund loans. During the closing, there are many people involved in the transaction. One of the things the title company has to do is send paperwork to the lender, and the lender reviews it.&nbsp;

However, we’re getting rid of that process. Many of our loans are being pre-funded. We’re sending an email to the title company before the buyers and sellers even walk in, so all they have to do it sign the paperwork.&nbsp;

Call or email us with any questions about real estate or lending. We would love to help you.
