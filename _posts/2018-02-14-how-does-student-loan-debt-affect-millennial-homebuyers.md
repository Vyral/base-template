Student loan debt continues to grow in size and share of the economy. Currently, the U.S. has student loan debt of $1.4 trillion, which accounts for 10% of all outstanding debt and 35% of non-housing debt.&nbsp;

How does student loan debt impact millennial homebuyers?&nbsp;

A new joint study on student loan debt recently released by the National Association of Realtors and American Student Assistance&reg; shows that while **the amount of debt has risen, the rate of homeownership has fallen, especially among younger homeowners.&nbsp;**

In fact, in spite of being in the prime age to buy their first home, the majority of millennials with student debt do not currently own a home and do not plan on buying a home for up to seven years, as debt delays their purchase. &nbsp;

Only 20% of millennials currently own a home. 28% rent with roommates, 15% rent on their own or from friends and family, and 15% live with friends and family without paying rent. Of the 80% of current non-owners, 83% believe that their student loan debt has affected their ability to buy a home.&nbsp;

The median student debt load is $41,200, which suprasses the median annual income of $38,000.&nbsp;

79% borrowed to finance their education at a four-year college, and 51% are repaying a balance of over $40,000. **A significant percentage, 17%, are paying a balance over $100,000.&nbsp;**

85% of survey respondents believe that they are delayed due to their inability to save for a down payment because of student loan debt. 74% of those do not feel financially secure enough to buy a home, and 52% cannot qualify for a mortgage.&nbsp;

48% of younger millennials born between 1990 and 1998 cannot qualify for a mortgage due to their debt-to-income ratios, compared to 57% of older millennials born between 1980 and 1989.&nbsp;

If a student loan borrower did not have to pay toward student loan debt, more than three-fifths would put the extra money toward a long-term savings investment or purchase of a home.&nbsp;

For those millennials with student loan debt who do own a home, 28% face housing hurdles and are unable to sell their existing home and buy another property. They face a variety of problems: 21% believe that it’s too expensive to move and upgrade to a new home, 4% have trouble with credit, 3% are underwater on their home.&nbsp;

42% of those with a student loan debt of more than $100,000 and 33% of older millennials are in a situation where they would rather sell and purchase another home but cannot.&nbsp;
