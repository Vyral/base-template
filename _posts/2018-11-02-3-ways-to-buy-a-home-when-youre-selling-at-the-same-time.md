<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you’re worried about finding the right home while you’re selling your current one, today’s message may help. There are three ways you can navigate this common scenario.</em></p>

What happens if you sell your home too quickly in today’s super-fast market? If you sell, what are you going to buy?&nbsp;

This is one of the single greatest concerns our team’s buyers have encountered lately, and so we’d like to shed some light on it today.&nbsp;

First, to give you some perspective, let’s consider the example of a listing our team recently sold. Within three days of going on the market, we’d received eight offers, and our seller ultimately earned $20,000 more than their list price. This kind of scenario is exciting, but is exactly the sort of situation that might elicit the concern we mentioned earlier.&nbsp;

Thankfully, there are several ways you can protect yourself from ending up without a home after you sell. Here are three of the best (and most common) solutions:&nbsp;

**1. Purchase a home before you sell.** If you have the means to do this, this is the ideal solution.&nbsp;

**2. Get a bridge loan.** Though less preferable than our first option, this financing solution allows you to literally “bridge the gap” as you sell one home to purchase the next.&nbsp;

<br>**3. Submit a contingent offer.** Although the third-best of these options, this solution has become very common. Submitting a contingent offer essentially means that when you write offers as a buyer, you include a contingency stating that your purchase is subject to the success of your own home sale. However, sellers are sometimes skeptical of this kind of offer.&nbsp;

Whichever option you choose, our team would be happy to guide you to the perfect home. We have the systems and resources to find your next property, even if it isn’t on the MLS.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
