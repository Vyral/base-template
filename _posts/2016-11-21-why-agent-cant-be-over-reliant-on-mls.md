Today I want to talk about how the MLS has changed in our real estate industry. Ten years ago, our value proposition was centered almost entirely on it.

Thinking about a career in San Diego real estate sales?
 Email me today for a private San Diego real estate career consultation.

You may see what’s happening out there in the market, but I want to talk about a functional perspective of the MLS and how it’s changed our real estate industry.

Ten years ago, the value proposition of a real estate agent was basically just the MLS. We had access and everyone else didn’t. They had to go through us to get the info. That’s not the case anymore. The bar has been raised for what a great agent does. Now, I’m worried about agents who rely on the MLS as the cornerstone of their business.

**In today’s fast-changing world, you’ve got to do what other agents aren’t willing to do to survive.** This means knocking on doors, working your sphere of influence, and finding sellers before they know they’re sellers. That’s how you create the best opportunity for your buyers. You can’t rely on the MLS for that anymore.

If you have any questions, please feel free to drop me a line or shoot me an email.
