One of the biggest questions I get is “Should you build your dream home or buy an existing one?” It’s not an easy choice, and there’s no one-size-fits-all answer. But don’t worry—I’ve got some real insights to help you decide.

**Why does the parade of homes matter?** The Flathead Builders Association just brought back their Parade of Homes after a five-year break. This event is a goldmine for anyone thinking about homes—whether you want to build or buy. Homes were divided into three categories this year: attainable, luxury, and dream homes. Each category shows what’s possible in today’s market, from prices to trends to square footage. I dug into the data to compare the costs of new builds versus existing homes. Let’s break it down.

**Attainable homes.** If you’re looking at entry-level homes, the numbers are close. The new homes in this category cost about $226 per square foot, but that doesn’t include the land. The average price was around $366,000. Existing homes in the same price range averaged $306 per square foot, and that includes land. So, what’s the catch? If you’re okay waiting for a home to be built, you might save some money. But if you need a place now, buying an existing home is simpler.

**Luxury homes.** Luxury homes in the Parade of Homes were priced at $466 per square foot for new builds (excluding land). Existing luxury homes came in lower at $404 per square foot, and that price included land. If you want luxury, buying an existing home gives you better value. Building might cost you more after adding land prices.

**Dream homes.**  Dream homes had the widest range. New builds started around $400 per square foot and went up to $800 (excluding land). Existing homes in this category averaged $853 per square foot (with land). If you’re okay spending top dollar and want a brand-new home, build. But, if you’re looking for more immediate options, existing homes might work better for you.

The choice comes down to your timeline, budget, and needs. If you can wait, building could give you exactly what you want. But if you need a home now, buying is easier and often more cost-effective. **If you’re curious about the Parade of Homes or want more insights, feel free to call or text me at** [**406-837-5531**](tel:4068375531)**.** I’ll help you find which home is the right one for you.
