Today I want to talk to you about what to do if you find yourself with multiple offers coming in as a seller. With low inventory over the last few years, we’ve been seeing this situation occur much more frequently.

**How do you get yourself in position to receive multiple offers?** It starts with us doing a very throughout market analysis on your home in order to attract the highest level of interest possible.

**Once you have multiple offers, how should you go about choosing which one to accept?** Obviously, there are a few factors you need to key in on. The first is price. We want to break down each offer and see which one will net you the most.

Secondarily, if we have some offers that are very close in price, we will take a look at the terms. Is it a cash deal or financed deal? A cash deal is much more likely to close. We don’t have to deal with appraisals, lenders, or anything else like that.

**Other important things to look at include the number of days of the due diligence period, the earnest money amount, and any other contingencies that might be in that offer.** We have to weigh the whole offer, look at all sides, then help you make the decision on which one is best.

If you’re looking to sell your home, I’d be happy to help you get started on the path to multiple offers. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>
