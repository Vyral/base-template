What is the difference between a home appraisal and a home inspection?

In short, a home appraisal proves value while an inspection proves condition.

<br>A **home appraisal proves value specifically to the lender,** **who will come into the home and take a few measurements.**

&nbsp;From the information they gather, the lender will then compare your home to others in order to determine its value. A home appraisal allows the lender to be sure that the home is worth the collateral they need to give you a loan.

A home inspection is a different story altogether. **Home inspections are done to prove the condition of the property for a current or future homeowner.**

Inspectors will carefully examine every part of the home, from its roof to its electrical systems, to uncover potential issues.

This will enlighten the inspector, and therefore the homeowner, to any potential repairs or costs that may come up.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
