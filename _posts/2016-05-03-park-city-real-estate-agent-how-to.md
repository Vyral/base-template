What is the right mindset for someone who plans on moving? This is a crucial question every agent should know the answer to if they want to get results for their clients. An important role of the agent is to get the seller into the right mindset to move so that, should an offer come in, it is easy to facilitate the transaction. So, how can you get your clients in the right mindset?

**One of the first things you should tell your clients to do upon listing is explore moving companies.** Several companies offer local benefits to home sellers, so it’s important to have your clients explore all of their options. We like to use Two Man Movers; they have a program where, during the listing period, they provide a storage container in a climate-controlled facility in Salt Lake.

**Next, give staging and packing advice to your clients.** Suggest they take family photos off the wall. Have them package them up and store them away so that potential buyers can envision themselves living in the home. Additionally, bulky furniture that doesn’t help showcase the property should be moved and stored. Another staging tip is to get rid of cords; either coil them together, label them, and put it near the device or keep a box with all the labeled cords. These are only a few of the many things you can suggest to your client in order to get better selling results.
