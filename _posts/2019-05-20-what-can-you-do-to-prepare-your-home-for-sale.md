Today we’re going to discuss six ways to get your home ready for sale this spring:

**1\. Let natural light in.** Open up your blinds, windows, and let that natural sunlight in.

**2\. Renovate what’s outdated.** If your kitchen or bathroom is stuck in the 1980s, it’s time to freshen it up a bit to get top dollar for your home. Updated faucets, towel racks, and cabinets are things you can do even if you’re on a tight budget.

**3\. Think small with renovations.** Don’t overdo it with expensive renovations. Instead of replacing all of your cabinets, just paint or replace the doors. If you’re going to spend money, spend it on curb appeal.

**4\. Paint with whites and neutrals.** A fresh coat of paint is relatively inexpensive and an easy way to give your house a facelift. Keep the colors neutral so that buyers can better imagine the home as their own.

**5\. Fix anything that's broken.** Repairs can take some time, but getting them out of the way allows you to sell your home much faster.&nbsp;

**6\. Pay attention to odors.** The smells inside your home can kill a home sale, and you may not even notice a lot of them. If you have pets, smoke, or regularly cook fragrant foods, consider getting your carpets freshly cleaned and adding a fresh coat of paint.
