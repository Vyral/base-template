To thank all of our wonderful clients, both past and present, we’re excited to announce that we’re hosting our second annual Thanksgiving pie giveaway on November 20. 

You’re eligible to receive a free pie whether you’re a current client or a past client. **All you need to do is reach out to us by November 9 and let us know your pie of choice.** You can choose from apple, pumpkin, peach, or pecan pie.

**The giveaway itself will take place from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. at our office here in Prior Lake, which is located at 14198 Commerce Avenue NE, Suite 100.**

In the meantime, we’ll be sending out postcards in the mail as a reminder, which will include all the information you need. Last year, we had the pleasure of giving away over 100 pies, and hopefully we can top that this year. We hope to see you there!

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to speak to you.
