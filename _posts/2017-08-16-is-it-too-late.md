Our summer market has been great so far, and that trend is expected to continue into fall. Let’s take a look at the numbers.

Now that summer is ending and we’re about halfway through the year, it’s the perfect time for a look at what’s going on in our St. Cloud market.

Recently, I’ve received a lot of calls from people asking if it’s too late for them to jump into a real estate transaction. The truth is: no.

**Though summer markets are notoriously hot, this fall market is set to be excellent, as well.**

In the last six months, 1,621 homes have sold in our local market. With 3,200 families making a move, this has been a very good year so far.

The current 363 pending sales we’re seeing today is down only just slightly from March, when that number was 452.

**Within a 20-mile radius of St. Cloud, there are 962 homes on the market.** Compared to the 640 homes on the market we saw in January, this is a significant growth.

With a good selection of homes, a market time between two to eight weeks, and interest rates at record lows, our current market holds a lot of great opportunities for buyers and sellers alike.
