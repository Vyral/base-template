If you are curious what your home is worth, do not rely exclusively on a Zestimate. Here is why.

If you are a home seller or are just curious what your home is worth, you need to be wary of relying on Zillow’s Zestimates. Why?

First, a **Zestimate cannot replace a professional valuation done by an agent like myself.** This is because, basically, Zillow’s Zestimate is just an algorithm. While this method of determining a home’s value is accurate in cookie-cutter subdivisions where most of the homes are very similar, it is not elsewhere.

If you are talking about custom homes, though, you will typically see a big difference between its Zestimate and its actual value. Let’s face it—you can buy a 3,000 square foot home for $300,000 or buy another 3,000 square foot house for $600,000. The difference between those two homes and their prices is their upgrades and features.

So, be careful how much emphasis you put on a Zestimate, because the truth is it could be way off. In fact, studies show that Zestimates can be off by 15% to 25%.
