Today I’d like to take a look back into our recent Memphis market. What happened in November?

**The month of November was the third time that home prices did not increase in 2017.** This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it just indicates a lack of change.

However, we did see the percentage of homes sold increase by 4%. This means homes are still moving off the market despite our low inventory.

Of course, **prices and inventory levels do vary between municipalities.**I’d be happy to send information about your specific information to you. All you need to do is reach out.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
