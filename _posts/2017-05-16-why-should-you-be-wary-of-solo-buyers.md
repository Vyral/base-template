Beware of solo buyers. If they don’t have an agent representing them, they probably don’t know what they’re doing.

**Want to Sell Your Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.com/list/" target="_blank">Get the Value of Your Central or Southwest Virginia Home</a>
**Looking to Buy a Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.net/" target="_blank">Search All Homes on the MLS</a>

Why should you be hesitant to trust a solo buyer? There are a number of different reasons, but let me start with this. A solo buyer could be anyone. **You don’t know whether they are qualified, whether they want to buy now or later, or whether they can even afford what they’re looking at.**

If someone is actually serious about buying a home in this market, they will hire an agent. I can’t ever recall seeing a serious or committed buyer who hasn’t worked with one. It’s like treating yourself instead of letting a doctor do it.

Whenever a buyer who isn’t working with an agent comes to your house, don’t take it too seriously. **They probably aren’t a serious buyer.**

If you have any questions for me about real estate or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, give me a call or send me an email today. I would love to hear from you.
