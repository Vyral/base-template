Have you ever tried cleaning algae or mildew stains off of a concrete or brick patio? Many homeowners aren’t sure how to tackle this annoying aesthetic issue, so **today we’d like to share a spring cleaning tip with you that will have your patio looking great in no time.&nbsp;**

Unlike using a power washer, which is an admittedly quick fix, the method we recommend is both fast *and* inexpensive.&nbsp;

So what is this message? It’s a simple chemical spray called Mold Armor. Simply spray the solution on using the garden-hose attachment, following the instructions on the label, and let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes. **After that, rinse it off and enjoy your newly clean deck.&nbsp;**

Best of all, while power washing can remove a layer of concrete or damage the grout between your bricks, Mold Armor poses no such risk.&nbsp;

You can find Mold Armor at your local Lowes, Home Depot, or any other similar stores. If you have any trouble finding it, however, please reach out. We’ll see what we can do to help.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
