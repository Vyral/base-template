Today I want to talk about co-borrowers. **With extremely high prices in the L.A. market only going higher, we’ve found more and more people buying properties together,** rather than waiting until they can afford something on their own.

If you and a friend both want to buy real estate but aren’t able to individually, consider partnering up. We have attorneys that can help write up a partnership agreement. It’s a fantastic way to start building wealth by investing in real estate.

**We’re here for you anytime.** If you have any questions or any real estate problems that we can solve, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
