<p style="text-align: center;"><em>What decisions are troubling you? Here’s how to help yourself commit to your choices.</em></p>

In recent weeks, I’ve seen many clients suffer from analysis paralysis—they’re simply having a difficult time making decisions. My team and I have to make hundreds of decisions each week—each day, even. We’ve learned it’s important to make a commitment.

**Decisions are rarely fatal, but we still beat ourselves up about them often.** You just can’t go back and change the past, however. After you make a decision, you need to commit to it and move forward. Too often, we’ll judge a decision based on the outcome, but that’s the wrong way to do it. A decision should be made based on the data you have at the time and the likelihood that it will lead you to the desired outcome.&nbsp;

If you drive under the influence and make it home without hurting anyone, **it does not mean you made a good decision.** It was a horrible one based on the data you had available.

Once you commit to a decision, the anxiety and pressure you feel will go away. And if your decision wasn’t good, it can still be a learning experience and help you make adjustments for the future. Keep in mind, too, that bad decisions aren’t usually the end of the world anyway.
