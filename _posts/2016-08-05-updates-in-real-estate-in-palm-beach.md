In this fluctuating market, traditional subdivision are selling faster and easier than luxury homes. It is really important for sellers to have the three factors right: price, condition, and marketing to reach a successful closing. It is also imperative for high-end property owners to do something especial to stand out. Having the help of an agent that knows and understand those changes in the market can make all the difference. Join Lisa Treu and Brian Mudd while they share the most reliable market analysis and the best advice to get your home sold fast and for the most money.
