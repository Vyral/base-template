The other day I was speaking with a neighbor who had a friend who was looking to sell their home as For Sale By Owner (FSBO). They were asking me to give them ideas and highlight some of the differences between FSBO sellers and those who enlist the help of a Realtor.

Here are four reasons why it makes more sense to hire an agent to sell your home:

**1. The contract.** Buying a home is likely the largest asset you’ll own, and the process of drawing up a contract is extremely important. As Realtors, we study contracts, so we’re well versed in how to write and negotiate them. We also recommend that you hire an attorney to protect you in the process.

**2. Marketing.** An agent’s marketing will likely be more extensive than a FSBO seller’s marketing. I’m not entirely sure how FSBO sellers market—they might be able to make a flyer and post the listing on a few different sites. But we have an extensive plan that includes hiring a designer, strategic Facebook marketing, Fusion photography, Matterport 3-D tours, phone calls to the neighborhood and high-producing agents, as well as a database of over a thousand people. Do you have time to manage all of those avenues on your own? Probably not, and not all of these outlets are even accessible to people who aren’t agents.

**3. Pricing.** Incorrectly pricing your home can be devastating, especially in a changing market. We know Zestimates and other, similar online tools are inaccurate—you need someone who knows exactly what’s going on in the market today, how to price your property to get the most exposure, and how to get the most money for your home in the shortest amount of time.

**4. Buyers may take advantage of FSBO sellers.** Spending a long time on the market will give your home a stigma, causing buyers to attempt to take advantage of you by lowballing their offers. They know you’re not a professional, so they think they’ll be able to cut themselves a deal. The National Association of Realtors consistently shows that FSBO sellers often make around 18% less than those who sell with the help of an agent. In some cases, that figure can be even more.

Our job is to market your property for the most exposure possible so you can get more money in as little time as we can. If you or someone you know is debating about whether or not they should try to sell their home on their own, please reach out to me. We will show you how we do what we do to get homes sold.
