{% include youtube.html %}How can you stage your home for sale while you’re still living in it? Follow these three tips:

**1. Remove all signs of personalization.** This is one of the most important elements in home staging. Homebuyers need to be able to visualize themselves living in the home, rather than feeling like they are invading your space. If you have sports pictures, religious icons, or home movies, make sure you remove them. Depersonalization can take a lot of work to accomplish and may leave your home looking stark or bare. Consider buying some framed landscaping photos to brighten things up a bit.

**2. Redefine the purpose of each room.** Many homeowners have taken the liberty to customize the space of a home based on their current needs. For example, a former living area at the front of the house might have been converted to a home office or kids’ playroom. Convert those spaces back to their original purpose. You may need to store the kid’s toys in a closet or work at your kitchen table for a couple of weeks, but doing so will help you sell your home.

**3. Make use of a storage unit.**As you start packing, you may want to move some of your belongings out of the house. A lot of people just cram all of the boxes in the garage but that may not be the most ideal situation, as many prospective buyers may want to walk through the garage. A storage space gives you easy access to your belongings and allows you to clear away any pieces that don’t look as stylish or make your home seem smaller than it actually is.

If you follow these three tips, your home will be more appealing to buyers and fairly easy to live in while it’s on the market. If you have any other questions about staging or selling your home, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
