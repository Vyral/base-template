With the new year ahead of us, it’s the perfect time to take a look at our market. Today, I’d like to share some statistics on the outlook for 2018.

**Over the last three years, we’ve seen an increase of 42.7% in our Boise market.** That’s an impressive number in relation to appreciation.

In terms of days on market, the average in Ada County is 31 days. In Canyon County, the average is 35 days.

According to the National Association of Realtors, a healthy market should have an inventory of homes between five to six months. This means our area currently has a big shortage of properties.

This presents a great opportunity for sellers, who can take advantage of the lack of competition when they list.

But it’s also a great time to buy since interest rates are still very, very low. Overall, **I’m very excited about the market outlook for 2018.** We’re seeing phenomenal opportunities for people in our market to buy, sell, or invest in homes.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
