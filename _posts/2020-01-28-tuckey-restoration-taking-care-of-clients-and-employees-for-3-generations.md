For three generations, Tuckey Restoration has taken great care of its customers and employees.

I couldn’t be more excited for today’s Brand Ambassador video, and that’s because I’m spotlighting Tuckey Restoration—a third-generation, family-owned construction and manufacturing business.

**Tuckey is one of the backbones of our community** because of the way they invest in their employees and care about their customers. Joining me to talk a little about how they do this are brothers Nathan and Matt Tuckey and their father, Ken Tuckey.&nbsp;

In short, they aim to be your one-call contractor for construction and manufacturing. From mechanical services to metal fabrication restoration, the list of services they provide seems endless. As explained in their tagline, “If you don’t know who to call, call Tuckey.”

Tuckey Mechanical Services, Inc. was started by Nathan and Matt’s grandfather back in 1968. His motivation, according to Matt, was to have a small business and be able to serve his neighbor well, and that’s what continues to motivate them to this day: to serve their neighbors and their neighborhood well.&nbsp;

As business leaders, we all have issues and challenges that keep us awake at night. One of Tuckey’s core beliefs is that success is faithfulness, and what keeps them awake at night is whether they’re being faithful to their commitments, customers, employees, and the team they’re building.

**Down the road, they’re excited to continue to be a part of a vibrant, growing place like Cumberland County,** whether that means being a part of its development or just supporting local nonprofits. According to Ken, his favorite part of being in this business is the fact that all of their businesses are service-focused. They can enter into any situation and help their customers.&nbsp;

As I said, Tuckey Mechanical Services, Inc. takes great care of their employees, and while I was at their offices, I even got a chance to tag along on one of their mold remediations...in a full hazmat suit (3:15 in the video).&nbsp;

So if you don’t know who to call, call Tuckey. I’ve hired them before, and they’ve taken great care of my family. You can reach them by phone at (717) 249-3733 or visit their website [www.tuckey.com](http://www.tuckey.com).&nbsp;

If you have any questions regarding today’s video, don’t hesitate to call or email me. Until then, stay tuned for my next “Brand Ambassador” spotlight.
