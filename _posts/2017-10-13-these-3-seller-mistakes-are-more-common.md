The days of putting a sign in your yard and expecting your home to sell itself are gone. Today, I’ve got three selling sins to avoid if you want to achieve listing success.

There are a lot of ways to succeed when selling your home, but there are just as many ways to fail. When it comes to selling your home this season, it’s important that you avoid these three home selling sins.

**1. Asking too much.** Of course you don’t want to sell your home for less than it’s worth, but overpricing your home can cause it to sit on the market for months and either sell for a low price or not sell at all. Buyers can see how long your home has been on the market and how many times the price has been reduced. This causes a lot of doubt. Even if a buyer likes a home, they’ll wonder what’s wrong with it if it’s taking a long time to move off the market.

**2. Not advertising enough.** Your home isn’t going to sell itself. These days, it takes an aggressive marketing plan and budget to get your home off the market. The days of simply putting a sign in the yard and waiting for buyers are long gone. Today, you need to advertise to get your home sold for top dollar. You can advertise online, on TV, on the radio, in print, or in a number of other ways. My team and I spend over $60,000 a month advertising our listings. As we like to say, it isn’t the market that gets homes sold, it’s the marketing.

**3. Not making your home presentable for showings.** Buyers expect a meticulous home. They expect nothing less than something that looks like a model home. Be sure to clean, declutter, and stage your property accordingly.
