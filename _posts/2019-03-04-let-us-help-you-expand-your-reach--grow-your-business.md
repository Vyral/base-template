Now let’s discuss the most popular types of calls we get.

If you’re a Realtor, **we make traditional real estate calls on your behalf**, including calling “For Sale By Owners,” calling expired or withdrawn listings, as well as doing circle prospecting and open house calls.

**We can also do re-engagement calls with past prospects or clients**. Let’s say you’re a Realtor and you have a list of 10,000 old Zillow leads. Those leads never did anything; they said they were interested in at the time, but maybe you didn’t follow up with them well enough, or maybe they just went dark on you. Regardless, we can enact a re-engagement calling plan to reconnect with all those people, see where they are currently, follow up with them, maybe offer them a free gift, touch base, and/or confirm that we have their correct contact information.

Additionally, we can do some **non-traditional real estate calls**. For instance, if you purchase a data list of people who are most likely to sell their homes in the next 12 to 24 months, we could help you connect with them. These are people who are statistically identified through different indicators that they would be most likely to see.

**This data list could consist of mortgage data, life events, how much equity they have, and so on. Whatever the case, lists like these provide great opportunities for you to bring people into your world who have never been there—before your competition does. However, you’ll need to keep in touch with, drip on, and nurture these leads for anywhere from 12 to 24 months; these are for longer-term sales, but it’s always good to increase your sphere.**

**This next type of call we do very commonly is for investors**: If an investor is putting together a list of leads they want to go after—distressed properties, motivated sellers, people in financial troubles, etc.—we can absolutely help them pursue those types of calls. Our most common campaign is calling motivated sellers for investors. Now, investors would provide that data to us, or else we could help you connect with one of our data providers to purchase a list like that.

The final type of call we can do for you is specific to recruiting. If, for example, you’re a Realtor who is growing your real estate team, **we could help make calls to recruit new members for you.**&nbsp;We could also do outbound messaging, where you have a set script of messages that they’re sending out to people through social media, email, and text, on top of the other tools we have available to distribute outbound messages. By doing this, we can see who is interested, and follow up with those people, pre-qualify them, and then pass them on to you.

Mind you, if your business isn’t in real estate, there’s still a good chance that we can help and work with you. These are simply some of the most common types of calls and campaigns that we run here at 1000 Calls A Day.
