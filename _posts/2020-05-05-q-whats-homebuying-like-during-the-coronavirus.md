<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s everything you need to know about buying a property in a spring market affected by COVID-19.</em></p>

Since real estate is considered an essential business here in Los Angeles County, there are still plenty of ways to view a property. We make sure we create 3D virtual tours for our listings so that buyers online can better understand features and layouts before moving forward with an in-person viewing, which requires extra safety precautions.&nbsp;

Gone are the days of bringing your entire family into a home showing—**only the decision-makers responsible for the purchase will be allowed to tour a property.** There won’t be open houses to attend, but private showings (with the proper protections) are still common.

Ultimately, homes are still selling, and rather quickly at that. **We just had a listing in Sylmar receive seven offers and sell for $30,000 above list price;** it only took a couple of days to get it into escrow. With rates dropping, buyers are taking advantage of the situation. Yes, plenty has changed, but supply and demand haven’t. Because there’s a 65% to 70% reduction in our showings, buyers can enjoy significantly reduced competition on the market.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about real estate, or you’re interested in buying or selling but don’t know where to start, reach out by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
