Apart from market trends, I know you’ll want to know more about Flathead Lake’s water levels. Last year’s low levels caused significant disruptions. This year has seen some improvement, so we must ensure that the lake's water management is handled correctly. **We encourage everyone to voice their concerns to local leadership and regulatory bodies to maintain stable lake levels, which are vital for both the environment and the economy.** For more information, visit [www.FillTheLake.com](http://www.fillthelake.com).
