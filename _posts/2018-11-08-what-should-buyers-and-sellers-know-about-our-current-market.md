<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Our real estate market is changing right before our eyes. Here’s what you need to know whether you’re thinking of buying, selling, or doing both.</em></p>

As we wind down in 2018, I’ve been getting a lot of questions about our marketplace and what’s happening with home values. Today I have an update for you.

Through October of 2018, our closed sales are down 15%, from 453 homes sold in October 2017 to 386 homes sold in October 2018. Our days on market is also down 5% from last year, going from 44 days to 42 days on average.

Are we in a buyer’s market or a seller’s market? A buyer’s market occurs when our inventory is more than six months and a seller’s market occurs when we have less than six months of inventory. **Right now, we are officially in a buyer’s market with just over six months of inventory available.** Our inventory has risen from 829 homes at this time last year to 944 homes just last month.

Even though the inventory has increased, home values are still up 6%. They have risen from an average of $573,000 to $609,000. What does this mean for buyers and sellers as a whole?

**For sellers, the holidays are a great time to get into the market due to less competition and more serious buyers.** For buyers, interest rates remain historically low, but they’re slated to go up several times in 2019. For every 1% that rates go up, you lose 10% in buying power. If you’re thinking about buying, now is the time to get into the game before costs go up.

If you have any questions for me about the market or you have any real estate needs that I can assist with, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
