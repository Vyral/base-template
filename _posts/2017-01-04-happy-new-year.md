Happy New Year!

It’s the start of a new year, and I wanted to give you an important real estate tip. The spring market starts now! **Even if you’re thinking about putting your house on the market in May or June, you should be speaking with a real estate professional now, to come up with a game-plan.**

If you’re thinking about putting your home on the market, please contact us for a free consultation. We’ll be happy to set up an appointment with you to go over the value of your home, and our marketing plans.
