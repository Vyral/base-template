When you are getting ready to sell, staging is an important step. One thing you should do is turn that home gym back into a bedroom.

**Want to Sell Your Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.com/list/" target="_blank">Get the Value of Your Central or Southwest Virginia Home</a>
**Looking to Buy a Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.net/" target="_blank">Search All Homes on the MLS</a>

When you sell your home, there are a lot of important things to keep in mind. One of these is keeping your rooms single-use.

Let’s say you have an extra bedroom that you put an exercise bike and TV in. That’s perfectly fine to do when living in the home if you have the room. However, **you don’t want the buyer to think there’s not enough space for them.**

So take the exercise bike and TV out of that bedroom. Open it up and make it more inviting. **If you have a room that has a desk that you work from home on, get that out of there too.** To buyers, it looks like you don’t have enough room in your house.

I really like to stress keeping rooms for their desired intention. A kitchen is a kitchen, a bathroom is a bathroom, and a bedroom is a bedroom. We like to keep things singular in purpose.

If you have any questions for us about staging a home or anything else relating to real estate or selling a home, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you soon!
