<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here is my latest update on the trends and conditions of our Connecticut housing market.</em></p>

Hopefully, you and your family continue to remain safe and healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic. I’m reaching out to provide you with an update on how the Connecticut housing market is faring this spring. Our market here is alive and well; at the end of April, we had 18 pending sales. For sellers who want or need to sell, just know that there is no reason that you can’t move forward with your real estate plans. We are selling properties very quickly and for top dollar here in Connecticut. To learn more about our current market and what that means for you, watch the short video above.
