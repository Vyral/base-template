Did you know if you’re 60 years old, you can buy a house and have no house payments? It’s called a reverse mortgage and today, **Kathy Burns from On Q Financial** will be telling us more about it.

<br>With the reverse mortgage purchase program, clients are typically required to bring in a 50% to 60% cash down payment. **There is also a flexible payment option, meaning they can make a full payment, partial payment, or even no payment.** It all helps to increase their monthly cash flow while still allowing them to enjoy homeownership.

**We’ve had clients downsize and sell their property, and using a reverse mortgage, buy a new home with no monthly payments and a lot less stress involved.** They even get some extra money in their pockets from the deal. There are many options to choose from when taking advantage of the program.

If you’re looking to buy or sell a home, have any questions, or would like further information, feel free to contact us. We look forward to hearing from you.
