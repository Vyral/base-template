Buying a home isn’t easy. There are plenty of mistakes that can be made throughout the process. Not knowing how much they can afford is a big one.

**Additionally, not realizing that the wrong mortgage can cost thousands of dollars in needless expenses is another big mistake.** You’ll need to look beyond a standard 30-year mortgage and investigate other options that are available.

One of the biggest mistakes is choosing the wrong real estate agent to represent you. You need someone who can represent your money and interests by making time to investigate your options. **You also want someone who has experience in the area you want to live** and most importantly, has the experience to discover hidden defects in a home before a purchase is made.
