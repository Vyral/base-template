As usual, August in Arizona was warm. Most people are going to be spending $200 to $400 keeping their homes cool as a result.&nbsp;

However, this doesn’t have to be the case. Today I’ve got a few ways to save money on your utility bills by making your home more energy efficient&nbsp;

First, check your ducts and vents. **All it takes is a little bit of time and a little bit of duct tape to save up to 20% of your utility costs.** Simply seal your ducts and vents, and you’re good to go.

Another way heat tends to penetrate homes is through single-pane windows. To save money, consider replacing these with multi-pane windows—which are much more energy efficient.&nbsp;

You may want to replace your insulation, as well. If your home is between 20 and 30 years old, chances are that your insulation is, too. Through time, insulation compresses and becomes less efficient.

All of these fixes can make an large impact on the energy efficiency of your home for minimal effort. You could be saving a lot of money for very little work.&nbsp;

**For more personalized ways to make your home, specifically, more energy efficient, you can hire energy efficiency testing companies** to come out, assess your property, and make suggestions.
