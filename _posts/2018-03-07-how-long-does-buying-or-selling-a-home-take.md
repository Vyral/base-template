Today I want to talk with you real quick about the timeline of purchasing or selling a home.

When you’re getting ready to list your home on the market for sale, **it’s best to get the ball rolling early on in the process.** We’d love to come out and give you some tips on what will help it sell for more. Once it’s ready, we can go over comparable homes and find a good listing price for your home. Once we have the home listed, the market average for Southwest Indiana was 62 days in 2017. **Our team actually averaged 47 days.** Once the home goes pending, it usually takes 30 to 40 days for the transaction to close. Sometimes we can negotiate possession of the property for up to 30 days after closing if you need it.

**If you’re looking to buy, you should come in and meet with one of our buyer specialists.** It will take a week or two to find something, then another 30 to 40 days to close. We typically tell homebuyers that they really need to start looking about 90 days before they truly need to be in the home. If you’re in a lease and you have to be out in 90 days, it’s time to get the ball rolling.

If you have any questions about the timeline or anything else related to real estate, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.
