Today I want to talk to you about business planning workshops. Recently, we launched our first in a series of upcoming business planning workshops. It was a fantastic experience.

{% include pullquote.html %}

**10 agents from different companies got together for a three-hour session where we discussed the six key pillars of building a successful real estate business, which are:**

1. Lead generation
2. Lead conversion
3. Listing presentations
4. Buying presentations
5. Transaction management
6. Reviews and referral systems

The level of experience in the room ranged from three months to 18 years. We all talked about the different methods for success, what I have used successfully in my business, and what they have used in theirs. **It was a great collaboration on how to approach things differently in our businesses**.

The session is designed to be collaborative and fun. It will give you tangible tools that work here in central Iowa to help you have a successful year. Itâ€™s so important to take time not to just work in your business, but also on your business. When you do that, we all can be better.

If this sounds like something you would be interested in, be sure to sign up for one of our upcoming events. If you have any other questions of me in the meantime, please give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
