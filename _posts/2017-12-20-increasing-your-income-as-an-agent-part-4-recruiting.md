Many agents out there want to increase their income, but how?

There are two ways to do this: sell more houses or sell houses for more money.

In this market, it’s a little harder to do the second option because inventory in the higher price ranges is limited. That leaves selling more houses. To do this, though, you need a lot of systems, staff, and admin in place. You’ll also need to spend a lot more time selling those houses.

I don’t know about you, but I got into real estate to have more time.

**One way to sell more houses and have more time is to leverage yourself with people.** The easiest way to do that is by starting a team. We’ve had a team for about 10 years now in the Roanoke Valley, and we’ve done extremely well.
