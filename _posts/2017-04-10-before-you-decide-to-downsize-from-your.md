My team is on the lookout for a good Home Selling Specialist. Joining us comes with many advantages and opportunities.

 Today I have some important news to share—my team is in the process of hiring a Home Selling Specialist.

 Home Selling Specialists are a highly valued member of my team. In this position, your job is to meet face to face with our sellers and help them strategize pricing, value, what kind of marketing approach is appropriate to take for their goals, and guide them through the process of a successful sale and closing.

 There are three tremendous advantages of being a Home Selling Specialist with my team.

 The first is our unparalleled marketing. With exposure on radio, television, and many Internet enhancements, our sellers have the exposure to help them get top dollar for their home in the shortest amount of time.

 The second is our amazing operations team. Instead of spending your time as a courier putting up signs or as an administrative assistant filling out forms, we provide that service for you so that you’re able to leverage your time for the highest-producing activity—selling!

The third is a guaranteed, steady flow of highly qualified seller leads.

 We’d love for our ideal candidate to have a real estate license and some real estate experience. However, we’re open to candidates who have experience in related industries, such as insurance or mortgage. It’s extremely important that our Home Selling Specialist enjoys working with numbers, analyzing data, and coming to conclusions to give our sellers good advice.

 It’s also important for them to have the ability to have both happy conversations about retaining equity and tough conversations about changing the seller’s expectations, especially when they have a life-changing need such as a death or a divorce that require them to get their home sold in a timely fashion.

 If this sounds like something that would be of interest to you—to be able to leverage your time, our amazing marketing machine, and 17 years of real estate sales experience, I’d love to talk. <strong>Just click on the <a href="http://www.soldincentraliowa.com/Join-Misty-s-Team" target="_blank">“Join Misty’s Team”</a> button on my website to get started. </strong>

 As always, if you have any real estate questions, I’d love to answer them. We’re here to help!
