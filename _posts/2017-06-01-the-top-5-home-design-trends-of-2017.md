We are delighted to be joined today by Angie McCoy of Evergreen Staging and Design, who is going to be talking with us about the top five home design trends in real estate for 2017. Without further ado, let’s take it away.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>**1. New paint colors.** Paint is a wonderful way to update your home because it’s inexpensive and creates an upbeat look. Sherwin Williams has come out with their color of the year for 2017, Poised Taupe. It’s a mix of gray and brown that fits perfectly in any room. The color experts, Pantone, also picked several colors that they think are going to be big this year, including purple and grape shades that people love.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>**2. Rich materials.** These include things like reclaimed wood on fireplaces and metal mixes of silvers, golds, pewters, and bronzes. It also includes furry textures on throw rugs and pillows.

<br>**3. Going green.** Basically, make the home more energy efficient. People want to feel like they are helping the environment and they can do that in many ways like updating windows, adding solar panels, and getting tankless water heaters.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>**4. A functional home office.** More and more people are working from home these days, and they want a designated space to do that. Turning a third bedroom into a home office is a good way to find that space.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>**5. Splurging on kitchen renovations.** Kitchens are almost single-handedly selling homes in this market. The kitchen is the heart of the home, where most people begin and end their day. Small updates like changing the backsplash or upgrading appliances are great ways to add value and increase the functionality of your kitchen.
