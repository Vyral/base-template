What are the three ways investors make money out of a rental property?

**1\. The property appreciates in value.** If you buy a property right now for $250,000, for example, and the average appreciation rate for homes is 3%, it’ll be worth $390,000 in 15 years.

**2\. Increasing the rent.** Rent is directly tied to inflation, so it’s almost always increasing. This means if you increase it at the same rate as appreciation increases—3%—and you start at $1,500 per month, in 15 years, you’ll be collecting $2,300 per month.&nbsp;

**3\. The rent pays the mortgage.** If you start using your collected rent to pay the mortgage on the property, in 15 years you’ll have paid off a good portion of that mortgage.&nbsp;

Based on our calculations, investors get a 40% to 60% return on their investment per year from rental properties, which makes it one of the best investments you can ever make.&nbsp;
