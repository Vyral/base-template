As our market continues to grow, you’ll see new hotels, restaurants, and apartment buildings all over. The 2019 residential real estate market is looking at similar growth. **There are likely to be close to 18,000 transactions again this year, and the median sale price will probably end up being around $280,000.&nbsp;**

Year to date, the number of transactions in our market is down about 5% due to limited inventory, but the median sale price is up 4.8% at the same time. Home values are increasing, and that’s what we’re all looking for.

**If you're looking for something fun to do in Charleston this month, there are a ton of great upcoming events, including:**

May 8: Charleston Beer Fest at Riverfront Park<br>May 19: Preservation Pedal of 5 Historic Cemeteries<br>May 24: Southern Soul Blues Express at N Chas PAC<br>May 25: 10th Annual Southeastern Beard and Moustache Championships at Music Farm<br>May 26: Granger Smith at N Chas PAC<br>May 27: Memorial Day<br>May 29: Grass in the Hall at Chas Music Hall

With Memorial Day right around the corner, Matt Mieras of CMG Financial wanted to bring to mind a few special financing programs out there for veterans. K**eep in mind that if you’re a vetaran, you’re eligible for 100% financing, seller paid closing costs to break your current lease, and more.** If you have any questions about that, reach out to Matt at &nbsp;(843) 670-5512 or send him an email to MMieras@cmgfi.com.
