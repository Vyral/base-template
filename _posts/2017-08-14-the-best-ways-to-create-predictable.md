What is the best way to build predictable revenue? According to one of my favorite books, it all boils down to systematizing your sales process.

“Predictable Revenue” is a fantastic book by Aaron Ross and Marylou Tyler. I recommend it to all of my clients. One of the main lessons I’ve learned from this book is **how to systematize your sales process.**

If you want to grow your business exponentially, you need to delegate certain duties and replace yourself in certain roles.

For example, if you don’t like prospecting, hire someone to do that for you. Not into lead follow-up? Find someone to take care of that for you. That way, you can dedicate all of your time to meeting with clients and closing deals.

Your lead follow-up system should be systematized to the point where it reads like a recipe.

A lot of clients have trouble letting go of managing every part of the sales process. However, it’s important that you trust your team members and **hire people who will do the things you don’t like to really well.** Look for a detail-oriented person who complements you.

If you don’t like cold calling and finding new opportunities, or you don’t enjoy following up with leads, find someone who is really good at following instructions and systematizing their day.

Again, it can be difficult for you to delegate at the beginning. However, once you see your calendar stacked with appointments and your business starts doubling—or even tripling—it will get easier.

When you work with 1000 Calls A day, we handle the outbound prospecting for you. We call thousands of numbers a week to get those verbal opt-ins to add to your sales pipeline. I always recommend that you hire one person inside your office to take care of the lead follow-up. They will be more focused and able to convert leads at a higher level than you could on your own.

Ultimately, systematizing your sales process will give you more time to do what you do best.
