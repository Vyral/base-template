Happy Thanksgiving to all of our clients. Your referrals and support have made this our best year by far.

With Thanksgiving coming up quickly, I just wanted to take a few moments to say thank you to all of our great clients.

**2016 has been our best year by far, and it’s all thanks to your referrals and support.** You made this year a success for us, and I just wanted to tell you all how grateful we are to have you as clients.

So **Happy Thanksgiving from us to you!** I hope that you have a great holiday and enjoy spending this time off with your friends, family, and anyone else important in your life.

I also wanted to let you know that if there is anything that we can do to help you outside of the real estate world, **we have a lot of connections within our database** from plumbers, electricians, and landscapers to attorneys and lenders. If you need any referrals, feel free to reach out to us and we can connect you with people we trust.

Once again, I hope you all have a happy Thanksgiving. In the meantime, if you have any other questions about real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help you!
