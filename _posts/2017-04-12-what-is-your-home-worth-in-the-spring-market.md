If you are thinking of listing your home during the selling season, then you need to find out what your home is worth. There are four ways to do just that:

**1. Find out what your X factors are.** Knowing which homes have sold in your neighborhood is a great starting point, but you must also figure in which features your home has that could increase its value.

**2. Remember the three C’s of pricing: consumption, condition, and competition.** Consumption is the number of homes sold in your particular neighborhood. You also need to compare the condition of your home to other homes on the market; evaluate your home as if you were a picky buyer. Finally, it’s important to know who your competition is. How many homes in your area are on the market? How many of those homes are in your price range?

**3. Hire an appraiser.** Now, appraisals can cost $400 to $500 but if you get varied results from different agents, then it may be a good idea to bring in an appraiser to give you a better range.

**4. Hire a real estate professional** and ask for a comparative market analysis, or CMA, to get a more accurate value of your home. If you are interested in one, [click here](http://friscoarearealestate.com/homevalue/).
