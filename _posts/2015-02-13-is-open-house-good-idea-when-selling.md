With the spring selling season just around the corner, we figured it would be a good time to discuss open houses.

Are they worth it? If so, what value do they provide?

Today, we'll answer those questions, so you can make informed decisions when selling your Savannah home.

The McIntosh Team often holds open houses, but we prefer to do them when the home is vacant. The reason we prefer showing an empty or properly staged house is because a lot of people will come through. If you have valuables or cherished family items, you put them at risk during an open house.

In most cases, you'll only have a few Realtors watching your home. If five different people show up at the same time, you may have strangers wandering through your home, which is never a good thing. Obviously, we try to do the best we can to keep an eye on everyone, but it can be very difficult. The biggest risk of having an open house, then, is how uncontrollable it can be. While rare, it's something to keep in mind.

On the other hand, there are many advantages to having an open house. Any exposure is good exposure when it comes to selling your home. Will their be tire kickers, neighbors, and professional lookers? Of course, but they might have friends, family, or coworkers who are looking to buy. The chance that they might spread the word about your home makes an open house completely worth it.

It's all about weighing the risks against the rewards of having an open house. Ultimately, it comes down to your specific situation. If you have questions about whether an open house is the right move for you, give us a call or shoot us an email. We would love to help you make the decision that will benefit your home sale!
