*2017 was a great year, but how is 2018 shaping up so far? Let’s take a look at what we’ve seen up until this point.*

Happy New Year! 2017 finished off as one of the best years we’ve had in a decade.

Our spring market typically begins in the first week of January, but things got started much sooner this time around. Right now, **we already have a 198 pending sales waiting to close.**

Typically, we don’t see this many pending sales until April or so.

Another thing worth mentioning is that we’re currently seeing a great market for sellers. Inventory right now is at 571 homes. To put that in perspective, we had 3,000 homes listed for sale in the market during the recession a couple of years ago.

Tight inventory is a great sign for sellers. **If you’re looking to put a home on the market, it may be a good idea to do so soon.**

Buyers should know, however, that there’s still a decent selection out there for those looking to buy a house.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>
