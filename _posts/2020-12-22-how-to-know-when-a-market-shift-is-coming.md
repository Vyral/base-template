To determine whether the real estate market is shifting from a seller’s market to a buyer’s market, there are three warning signs that you need to look for:

**1\. Days on market.** How long does it take for a property to sell on average? If the average is just 21 days, that’s pretty good. If the time increases to let’s say, 45 or 60 days, that’s a good sign that prices will be adjusting downward.

**2\. Incentives.** When sellers start offering more incentives, you know the market is on its way down. These incentives are signs that buyers are getting ever so slightly nervous about the market.

**3\. Supply.** When supply starts to increase, that’s the ultimate sign of a market shift. If supply increases faster than demand, we’re moving away from a seller’s market to a buyer’s market. This could lead to an increase in demand and potential price adjustments.

These three signs will tell you where prices are going, but even in a downward shifting market, it takes a long time for the market to shift—anywhere from eight to 12 months to see a significant impact.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
