Homebuyers in the $200,000 to $600,000 price range have been experiencing many difficulties in the current market. **There’s not much inventory available for them, which has caused some struggles.** If you’re a buyer in this price range, what can you do to quickly capture homes in this price range when they come on the market?

**The most important factor is communication with your agent.** The first step should be to talk with your agent and confirm your criteria for a property. Then, we’ll set up a drip campaign that will automatically send properties to you that match that criteria. This ensures you’ll see each new listing as soon as it hits the market.

In addition to having clear communication with your agent, your agent should also have good communication with other Realtors. **Those Realtors may be aware of other listings that match your criteria, but haven’t hit the market yet.** This way, you can be prepared to submit an offer on a property that matches your criteria as soon as it’s listed.

If a home is priced correctly, it should have no issues selling in the current climate. It will likely have multiple offers as well. Buyers should be ready with contracts in place to make an immediate offer if they’re looking for a good home right now.

If you have any questions about this market or are interested in buying or selling a home any time soon, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
