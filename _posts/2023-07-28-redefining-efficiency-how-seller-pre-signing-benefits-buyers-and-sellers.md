In the wake of the pandemic, the real estate industry saw a significant shift in the way transactions were conducted, with social distancing protocols becoming paramount. One aspect that underwent a remarkable change was the closing process. Today, we'll be shedding light on the practice of seller pre-signing and its impact on buyers and sellers in the current real estate landscape.

The pandemic prompted adaptations in various aspects of real estate, and the closing process was no exception. Traditionally, buyers and sellers would sit across from each other at the closing table, signing an array of documents to complete the transaction. However, the need for social distancing led title companies to introduce seller pre-signing, revolutionizing the closing process.

**With seller pre-signing, sellers now have the option to sign their closing documents in advance.** This process occurs before the actual closing date specified in the purchase agreement. The buyers, on the other hand, sign their papers on the closing date, as indicated in the purchase agreement.

One of the most common misconceptions regarding seller pre-signing is the actual closing date. While sellers may sign their documents early, it is essential to understand that they maintain ownership and possession of their home until the official closing date, which coincides with the date specified in the purchase agreement.

Seller pre-signing offers several benefits, especially in terms of flexibility and reduced stress. Sellers have the advantage of getting all the legal paperwork out of the way early, leaving them with ample time to prepare their homes for closing. **Notably, seller pre-signing appointments tend to be shorter than those of buyers, saving valuable time for sellers.**

While the pandemic brought numerous challenges, the adoption of seller pre-signing emerged as a positive outcome. Previously, Minnesota was among the few states where buyers and sellers sat together at the closing table. However, due to the pandemic, this practice changed, aligning with methods that have long been employed in other states.

The introduction of seller pre-signing has streamlined the real estate closing process, providing sellers with added convenience and efficiency. This modern approach allows sellers to complete their paperwork in advance, easing the final stages of the transaction.
