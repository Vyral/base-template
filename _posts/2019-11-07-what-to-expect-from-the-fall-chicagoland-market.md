There’s a great deal of volatility in today’s market, but there are a few trends that we typically see around this time of year that we wanted you to know about today. In the Chicagoland market, a ton of homes come off the market and supply goes low in the fall. The buyers who are in this market are intentional and ready to make a purchase. If you’re debating as to whether you should sell now or wait until spring, we highly suggest now because of the current conditions.
