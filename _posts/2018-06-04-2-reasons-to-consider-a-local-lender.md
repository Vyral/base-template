We are in a hot selling season. So, with multiple offers, **how do you stand out?**<br> <br>Today we are going to talk about why a local lender helps you stand out in a competitive, multiple offer situation.<br> <br>For our properties, I want to see someone who has more than just a pre-approval. I want a lender that can reach out to me and say, “this is why you want to go with them.”<br> <br>I want this for two reasons:<br> <br>**1. If they close deals, I might know them.**<br> <br>**2. I'm talking to them.** Even in a text and email world, you want to be able to have at least a conversation. If you can't have a conversation, make sure that lender is sending out a video text.

You, as the consumer, may be thinking you are going to go to Quicken Loans and save a quarter of a percent. Well, the fact is that after everything is done, it's about the same. Also, I guarantee any top listing agent is going to look at  Quicken Loans a little bit differently than someone who we know gets deals done.<br> <br>In this market, if you want to win in multiple offer situation, **you need a lender that is proactive in the market,** well-known, and willing to reach out on your behalf.<br> <br>If you have any further questions about why you should consider a local lender when purchasing your new home, please don’t hesitate to ask. I look forward to speaking with you soon<br>
