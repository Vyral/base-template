*Are you searching for the right lending professional to help you secure a home loan? Consider a local lender.*

<center>&nbsp;</center>

We are in a hot seller's season right now, which means competition among buyers is strong. This leaves many buyers wondering how they can set themselves, and their offer, apart.<br>&nbsp;<br>Today we are going to talk about why a local lender helps you stand out in a competitive, multiple offer situation.<br>&nbsp;<br>Our team helps sellers all the time. When we list a property, we look for buyers with more than just a pre-approval letter to reinforce their offer. Our team seeks out buyers who are working with a lender who can back them up, and who would be willing to reach out to us directly. I want a lender to be able to tell my team exactly why it is they believe a buyer is qualified.<br>&nbsp;<br>I want this for two reasons:<br>&nbsp;<br>**1. If they close deals, I might know them.**<br>&nbsp;<br>**2. I'm talking to them.** Even in a text and email world, you want to be able to have at least a conversation. If you can't have a conversation, make sure that lender is sending out a video text.

You, as the consumer, may be thinking you are going to go to Quicken Loans and save a quarter of a percent. Well, the fact is that after everything is done, it's about the same. Also, I guarantee any top listing agent is going to look at Quicken Loans a little bit differently than someone who we know gets deals done.<br>&nbsp;<br>In this market, if you want to win in a multiple offer situation, **you need a lender that is proactive in the market,** well-known, and willing to reach out on your behalf.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you have any further questions about why you should consider a local lender when purchasing your new home, please donâ€™t hesitate to ask. I look forward to speaking with you soon
