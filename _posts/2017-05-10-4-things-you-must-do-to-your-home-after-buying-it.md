If you’re a brand-new homeowner, there are four things that can help make your home a better place to live in and start your experience out on the right foot.

First, **have all your locks changed to one key.** When you get your new house, you will get a set of keys to let you in. The problem is, you don’t know how many of those keys are out in the world in the possession of other people. Your best option is to call a locksmith and have all the locks changed to one key. If you’d like to save money, you can visit your local hardware store, buy the right tools, and do the job yourself.

Second, **change your air filters.** They’ve probably been around too long, and you don’t want to smell someone else’s air—you want to smell your air. If you clean these filters, your house will be nice and fresh and be a more pleasant place to live in.

Third, **swap out the toilet seats in the bathrooms.** That way you’ll have nice, clean toilet seats and no cracks in the paint to take away from the beautiful new house you’ve just purchased.

Fourth, **change the filters in your furnace.** You want to breathe in nice, clean air for a happy, healthy home. These filters should be changed anywhere from two to 12 times a year, depending on their size. To find out exactly how often you should change your filters, just take them to your local hardware store and they will make a determination for you.
