It’s time to continue our series on selling your house faster and for more money. **For the fourth installment, we’re going to focus on making your home more energy efficient.**

There are plenty of things you can do in order to accomplish this. Replacing your current light bulbs with LED bulbs is a good place to start.

Replacing your water heater isn’t a bad idea either. An instant hot water heater will heat hot water only when you need it, not all day long. Energy-efficient windows are a good idea as well.

Finally, a programmable thermostat is a must. You can use it to make sure the home is heated or cooled when you need it, not 24/7.

**Things like this are going to entice a buyer to want to buy your house because of lower heating and A/C bills.**

If you have any questions for me about how you can make your home more energy efficient, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
