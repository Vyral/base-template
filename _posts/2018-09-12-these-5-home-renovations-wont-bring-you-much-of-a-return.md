It’s always fun to talk about the best home renovation projects to do, but it’s just as important to discuss the worst of them. Today I’ll walk you through five of those projects and tell you why they’re not likely worth your time or money:

1. **Over-the-top improvements.** Before your minor upgrade turns into a home improvement bender, ask yourself whether potential buyers in your area are likely to pony up for posh upgrades. Forgo that steam shower and carved marble tub—chances are you can’t take them with you when you move.
2. **Home office overhauls.** Home offices don’t generally produce a high return, but if you’re working from home, they’re definitely a must. Keep the structure of the space, especially if it was once a bedroom or a garage. That way, you can easily stage the room if you want to sell it, since bedrooms are more marketable than home offices.
3. **Swimming pools.** These are great to have, but are controversial to buyers, since they require extensive maintenance.
4. **New roofing.** Replacing your roofing can help with the resale, but don’t go overboard with the material—clay, tile, or metal roofing don’t usually have as high of an ROI as a normal shingled roof.
5. **Specialized spaces.** Certain upgrades have a limited audience they’ll speak to, such as a wine cellar, installing a slide in your kid’s bedroom, a playroom, and a basement.
