To help educate you about military relocation professionals, I’m going to answer a few common questions relating to them.

**What is the difference between a Realtor that's certified as a MRP and one that is not?**

A military relocation professional has certified knowledge of what a service member does and what they have to go through when they move. There are a lot of things that have to be done and certain timelines they have to meet.

**Are there any other benefits to using a military relocation professional?**

Being part of the military relocation program keeps you up to date on any new regulations or other changes. When I was in the military, I went through a lot of moves, but that was many years ago. Being an MRP, though, allows me to stay updated.

**What are some of the nice things about relocating to the Gulf Coast?**

Keesler Air Force Base is a wonderful base that’s only a block away from the beach, and the Seabee base isn’t very far from the beach either. There are lots of activities and plenty of quality housing nearby.

We will release a military relocation guide this month on our website. In the meantime, if you have any other questions about MRPs or any other real estate topics, don’t hesitate to give us a call. We’d love to speak with you.
