If you’re thinking about selling your home in the near future, here are some things that you can do this fall to prepare your home for sale in the next six months.

**When it comes to preparing your home in the fall, the things that should be looked at most closely are the exterior items.** Once the cold and snow set in, many of these things can’t be done. Look for areas of paint on the home’s exterior and trim that need to be touched up. Examine any uneven concrete on your driveway or sidewalk. If you see any windows that might need to be replaced, the fall is a great time to do that as well. Fall is also the best time of year to plant shrubbery.

A common question we hear in the fall is “What is my home worth right now?” The answer to this question will often determine whether homeowners decide to sell right away or wait until spring. When a home is priced in a fall market, the data used is often from the spring. In the spring, those numbers are completely outdated and the market may have changed drastically by that point. **When looking at pricing a home in the fall for a spring market, it’s very important that it’s evaluated based on the current conditions.**

Another great thing you can do right now is take some photos. If you do end up listing in the winter, these green photos will be used as supplements to the winter photos. It gives buyers a better idea of what they’re getting into.
