Up until now, solar roofs have been expensive and complex. Now, they are coming to market on a massive scale thanks to Elon Musk.

As some of you may know, I have a real affinity for Elon Musk and the ingenuity he brings to the table. From space travel to automaking to energy management, he’s doing a lot of great things to improve our world.

The latest and greatest comes with the bringing of his Tesla solar roof to market, and there’s some new information about it that we are very, very excited to share with you.

Recently, Tesla merged with SolarCity, another one of Musk’s companies that manufactures solar panels. With the merger, **it is predicted that the cost of installing this solar roof will be less than installing a traditional roof.** That is amazing! If you need a roof replacement, how great would it be to save a little money and get a solar roof?

On top of that, the roof will eventually pay for itself in energy savings alone. There will be four different shingle options when this product comes to market: textured glass, smooth glass, French slate, and Tuscan tile. They will be manufactured in the U.S. as well! **We will be sure to keep you updated on who will be installing these in our area and when.**

If you have any questions about this solar roof technology or any other questions about Utah real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
