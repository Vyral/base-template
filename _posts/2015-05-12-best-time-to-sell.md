Lately, a lot of clients have been asking us, "What is the best time of year to put my home on the market in Northern Virginia?" Today we are going to answer that question, by giving you an overview of a typical year in our real estate market. It has peaks and valleys like any other market, and when you understand that, you can have great success buying and selling.

So, if I sit down at my desk on January 1, and try to predict the year in advance, here is what I would come up with. The lowest points of the year are generally the month of August and mid-December through mid-January.

By mid-January, we tend to get the early spring market, where people are trying to list their homes to get ahead of the true spring market. This generally works, as homes on the market a little earlier tend to sell a little quicker due to more eyes on the property.

By mid-March,  the normal market kicks in. This lasts all the way through Independence Day weekend, which signals the start of the summer slowdown. By August, the market is pretty dead. People are on vacation, kids are getting ready for school, and there's a lot less activity.

After Labor Day, the market tends to pick up and, usually a week or so after that, we will have a pretty good fall market through Thanksgiving and into mid-December, when we hit our winter slowdown once again.

Be sure to remember to give yourself plenty of time to get your home ready for sale. Preparation is essential for a smooth sale and getting top dollar for your home.

Thanks for taking the time to check out my blog today. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me a quick email. I look forward to speaking with you!
