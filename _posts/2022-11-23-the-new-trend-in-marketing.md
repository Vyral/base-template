Have you heard about the latest trend in home-for-sale marketing? Sure, there’s the tried and true method of hiring a real estate professional to market your home effectively, but what else could you be doing? There’s a home up on Zillow right now with **somebody dressed in a Halloween mask hidden in every photo of the home.** This might be pretty effective in getting eyes on the property, but will it pay off with a sale?

Remember, if you don’t want your home sale to be Zillow gone wild, there’s only one real way to market your house: Hire a trusted real estate professional. If you are looking to sell your home without the Halloween mask, reach out and give us a call. We’d be happy to help you out.
