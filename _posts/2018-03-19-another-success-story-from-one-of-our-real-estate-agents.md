We have an amazing real estate team. We’ve been in business for 15 years. Whether you already have a license or not, I’d like to talk to you. We help our real estate agents be successful by providing the marketing, leads, systems, processes, presentation, and operation staff you need.

Instead of just listening to me, here’s what Whitney Muncey has to say:

I started working with Jeff Cook Real Estate at the end of February in 2016. I had no real estate experience prior to working here. I did a few different things. I worked at a domestic violence and sexual assault shelter, coached JV basketball, and ultimately ended up teaching second grade.

Working at Jeff Cook Real Estate has changed my life in so many ways. My financial freedom has certainly changed from being a teacher and doing the things I used to do. **I have a little bit more room there that ultimately makes me happier and makes everyone happier.**

The other thing that working at Jeff Cook Real Estate has done is made me realize my why. If you don’t know what your why is, stop whatever you are doing and figure that out. Until you do that, you’re not living. So many of us go through life and it’s the one thing we really only get one shot at. We find our comfort zone and sail along. If you do that, you cut yourself short from so many things, so many experiences, and education.

With Jeff Cook Real Estate, I was able to figure out what my why was. Once I dug that up, it was my motivation to push forward to financial freedom and it gave me the ability to push myself to find out what I can do. **Jeff Cook Real Estate changed my life in many ways.**It can certainly change yours as well.

If you’re looking to get into real estate, there are a few things I would suggest before you start that venture.

The first and most important is that you want to be happy with where you are. Culture is a huge thing. In real estate, you deal with a ton of different people with different personalities. You have to work with people who have fun, and you need a support system. That’s what I got here at Jeff Cook Real Estate.

Equally important to culture is that during the process of our 60-hour or 30-hour class for real estate, people from different agencies and brokerages are going to tell you, ‘Come work with me, we’re amazing. We’ll make you $1 million right out of the gate.’ However, there is no commitment from them to you. They all say, ‘Show me what you’ve got. You’ll spend a lot of money and a lot of time away from your family. Six months from now, if that doesn’t work out, I’m sorry.’ And that’s all there is to it.

When Jeff came in, he had an entirely different story. He talked about the systems we have here at Jeff Cook Real Estate and confirmed that he is investing in me prior to my having to prove myself. To have someone who doesn’t know you invest a lot of time, money, and effort in you before you prove yourself means a lot and it really stood out to me.** That was my decision-maker.** If this man is willing to take something that he’s worked so hard to achieve and invest in me, then I can’t go wrong.

I would like to thank Whitney for taking the time to share her experience today. If you have any questions about joining our real estate team, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
