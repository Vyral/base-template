Are you passionate about investing in real estate? Are you trying to create wealth through real estate? Do you want your child to have options for college by using real estate to pay for it? If you want to begin using real estate to your advantage but don’t know where to start, **we’d love to help you at <u><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Central-Valley-Wealth-Builders/">CentralValleyWealthBuilders.com</a></u>**.&nbsp;

We have a free program where we’ll meet once a month as a group via Zoom and answer all your questions about how to invest in real estate. We’ll go over contracts, finding tenants, flips, how to structure deals, how to sell a home, how to buy a home, and more. These are all things you want to know when investing in real estate.

**One of my goals in life is to create 40 millionaires. The only question is, do you want to be one of them?** If you’re interested, we’d love to have you join us, just register at the link above.&nbsp;

We do this to help clients; we see gurus out there charging $25,000 to $40,000 for classes, and then they have all your money, and you have very little education on the topic. Save your money for your investment. We want to help you succeed at investing in real estate.&nbsp;

If you have questions about this program or real estate in general, call or email us. We’d love to be your real estate resource.<br>&nbsp;
