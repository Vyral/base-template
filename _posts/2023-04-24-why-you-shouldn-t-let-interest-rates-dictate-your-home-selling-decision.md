Are you letting your low interest rate stop you from selling your home? If so, I completely understand. Today’s rates aren’t as good as what we saw not too long ago! However, I’m here today to remind you that the decision to move is based on a lot more than an interest rate.&nbsp;

Realtor.com recently surveyed a bunch of home sellers and asked them why they sold their homes. 33% of those people said they wanted to make a profit, 32% had changing needs, 30% wanted different features, 27% wanted to live closer (or maybe further) to family or friends, and 25% wanted a smaller home with less work. This shows that **when you think about moving, there's a lot more to consider than just your next interest rate.&nbsp;**

Today’s interest rates may be higher, but don’t let them stop you—I’ve even purchased two homes in this environment! Therefore, I can help you through this process. If you have any questions, know that there are no bad ones. Maybe you’re wondering about timing the market or converting your home into a rental and buying a new one—whatever it may be, I have answers for you.&nbsp;
