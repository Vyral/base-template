It’s the beginning of the fourth quarter, and 2020 is right around the corner. We’re going to keep focused for the rest of this year, stick with our lead generation, and stay optimistic.&nbsp;

People often ask me what the agenda is for our goal planning event. First, you need to have a meeting in October or November to plan for the next year, but October is best. Whether you’re a single agent or a big team, everyone needs to get together and plan for the coming year. This may take an entire day.

Some of our agenda items are the same each year. **You should run this like an official meeting;** have lender partners or title company friends come, bring in lunch or breakfast, and build in some fun and community. The team needs to know this is a business meeting, cell phones should be turned off, and everyone should display full focus. Our own meeting always starts with breakfast and an ice breaker to have some fun with the team.

It’s critical to reflect on the goals we set for this year. What were our goals, how did we do, where are we in relation to those goals, and what were our missteps? We will check our “GPS”, which stands for goals, priorities, and strategies. Where did we blunder, what can we get better at, what can we tweak? By setting these goals you can detect any gaps. **Everyone should agree on what the team’s standards are.&nbsp;**

You should end the day with some kind of fun, maybe a happy hour out or a teambuilding activity.&nbsp;

Let me know what you do to have an amazing planning day for next year.&nbsp;
