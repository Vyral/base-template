Welcome back to part two of my home-staging video. I'm going to be discussing some common mistakes that buyers make when they stage their home. If you play your cards right in the process, you can see a nice return when you sell your home. Hopefully these tips can help you sell your Portland property for a little extra this spring!

Numbers one through four were discussed last week:

1. Being too personal. You don't want people to walk into a room and be able to identify the type of person living in it.

2. Pack away your personal items. You don't want your potential buyers distracted by photos and other belongings of yours. Your home should stand out to them, not your collection of sports memorabilia.

3. Don't paint with dark colors. Darker colors make rooms feel smaller, and we always suggest colors that are light and bright. Earth tones seem to be popular right now, and they tend to be more inviting colors for buyers.

4. Not taking advantage of natural light. You want every window of your house open and light shining in. Buyers like to see homes that are well-lit, and opening up your windows and letting the light come inside is a very simple and easy way to improve the look and feel of your home. A lot of buyers want nice natural lighting in their home.

5. Thinking more is better. Remove any large furniture that you have in your home. It will make the room feel smaller and it can clog up traffic in your home when buyers are viewing it.

6. Forgetting the fixtures. Make sure every fixture in your home works and that every light has a fresh bulb. This is also a small pet-peeve that can really irritate some buyers during a viewing. Bright houses always sell.

7. Having pets at home. I love animals, but not when I'm trying to sell a home. They bring along odors and can cause unsightly stains. Remove any litter boxes from your home or kennels that are left out. Try to make it appear as if no pets are in your home.

8. Neglecting the exterior: Buyers are beginning to care more and more about outdoor spaces of properties. Buyers are drawn into your home by what it looks from the outside, so paint your front door, mow your lawn, plant some flowers, and make sure that it looks as inviting as possible. I might even recommend power washing the sides of your home as well as your driveway.

Hopefully, these eight tips can help you sell for top dollar this summer in Portland! If you have any questions about these topics, please don't hesitate to contact me!

Thanks for watching, and stay tuned!
