Many homeowners are asking the Dave Knight Real Estate Team if now is still a good time to sell. Well, because inventory is still generally low, **the answer to that question is yes, if you’re thinking of selling in the near future.**

Interest rates are also historically low, meaning that many people are still looking to purchase homes. This, in turn, gives the seller the ability to sell their home at a good price.

Home prices tend to rise and fall over a seven-year cycle. Right now, the market is more normalized than it was about a year ago, when sellers were getting top dollar for their houses.&nbsp; So **while the market has cooled a little bit since the summer of 2018, it’s still a great time to sell.**

For homebuyers in the market, now is a good time to think about jumping into the market. As I said, interest rates are still very low right now. **By waiting, you run the risk of allowing them to creep up again, which would reduce your buying power even if home prices go down.**

If you would like more information, or would like us to do a comparative market analysis to give you an idea of what price your home could get, reach out to us. We’d be glad to provide that information, as well as any other resources you need to make the best real estate decisions.
