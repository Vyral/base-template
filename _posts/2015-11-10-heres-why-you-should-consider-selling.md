Today we just wanted to give all of the sellers out there a quick market update as we head into the fall season. The market has been very strong so far this fall, and we are off to a fantastic start.

In September, we closed and gave the keys to 22 different buyers! In September, we had another 17 homes go under contract, a very strong number for this time of year.

The pace isn’t quite as crazy as it was this summer, but we are still seeing a lot of buyers on the market. Many of them are buyers who wanted to buy in the summer, but were tired of getting outbid on multiple offer situations. These buyers are back looking to buy, so they can take advantage of our historically low interest rates. They are going to go up at some point soon, but for now, they remain near 4%.

With the number of sales we have been seeing recently, and the number of buyers that we know are on the market, it’s a great time to sell. If you want to take advantage of these great market conditions and sell your home, give us a call or send us an email. We have the knowledge and expertise to get your home sold for top dollar this fall. We look forward to hearing from you!
