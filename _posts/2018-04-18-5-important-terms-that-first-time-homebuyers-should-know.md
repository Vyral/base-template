Today, I would like to go over a few terms that all first-time homebuyers should know. 

**1. Fixed-rate mortgage.** This is a mortgage with an interest rate that is fixed for the life of the loan. This means that the rate will not change for the entire life of the loan. 

**2. Adjustable-rate mortgage.** This is the opposite of the fixed-rate mortgage. You will start out with a lower rate for a certain period of time, say two to five years. After that, your rate will adjust annually based on the current interest rate. With this type of loan, you start out with a lower monthly payment. However, over the life of the loan, you will end up spending more money because the rate will be higher. 

**3. Pre-qualification.** This is basically the beginning of getting qualified for a loan. This means you will contact the lender, give him your information about your assets, income, and debts, and the lender will come up with how much you are able to qualify for. They will give you a pre-qualification letter that allows you to go out, search for a property, and feel comfortable submitting an offer.

**4. Conventional loan.** This is a mortgage that is not insured by any governmental agencies. The guidelines usually cap your debt-to-income ratio at 48%. You can get this loan with a down payment as low as 3% or as high as 20%. Generally, if you take out a loan and put less than 20% down, you will have mortgage insurance. The good news is that with a conventional loan, the mortgage insurance will disappear after your home reaches 80% of its value. 

**5. FHA loan.** This is backed by a governmental agency and can be a very good loan for first-time homebuyers. The FHA loan allows you to get into a home with only 3.5% down, and you can qualify for this loan with a credit score as low as 580. It’s very popular for first-time homebuyers, but it does come with mortgage insurance. Unlike the conventional loan, the mortgage insurance will remain with the FHA loan for the life of the loan.

I hope you found this information helpful. If you have any other questions about buying a home or about real estate in general, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you.
