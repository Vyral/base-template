<center><em>This one quick tip could win you the home of your dreams.</em></center>

<br>Are you considering buying a home in this extremely hot real estate market?&nbsp;

Our team loves thinking outside the box to set our clients up for success. These days we’re frequently seeing multiple offers on houses, and it can be stressful for all involved. One way we have found to help our clients win the home is to write a love letter.&nbsp;

**Writing a letter to the seller about why you want to buy their home and what features you love will help your offer stand out** amongst the competition. It should be written by the buyer, not the real estate agent. When a seller is comparing a bunch of offers, your letter is something different for them to consider.
