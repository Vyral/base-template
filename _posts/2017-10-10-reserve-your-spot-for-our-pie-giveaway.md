Welcome to October! Fall is finally here, which means it’s time to invite you to our holiday pie giveaway!

**This is just our way of thanking you for your support over the years.**

We will be giving away pies at Town Lake Hills East on Friday, November 17th from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.

Santa Claus will make an appearance, and we will have a photographer available to take a free picture of you and your family. We will also have hors d'oeuvres and drinks, along with your free pie. &nbsp;

**There are a limited number of spaces available for the photos,** so make sure you give us a call at 678-389-3887 &nbsp;to let us know that you’re coming and Kathy will help you out.

In the meantime, if you have any real estate questions, just give us a call or send us an email. We are here to help.

We look forward to seeing you!
