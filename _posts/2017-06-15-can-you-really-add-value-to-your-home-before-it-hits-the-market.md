I've fielded a lot of questions lately from people selling their home wondering what kind of things they should do to their home prior to listing it on the market. Should you remodel the bathroom? Rebuild the deck? Update the kitchen? Replace all the carpet?

Over the years, my response has always been to do small things that add nice touches. Report after report has shown that larger upgrades and remodels never seem to get a dollar-for-dollar return. For example, if you spent $10,000 remodeling your kitchen the research shows you're likely to only get $7,500 back in added value to your home.

**Some of the best things to consider are those that make the home more saleable rather than trying to create value.** This includes things like a fresh coat of paint on your front door or updating a light fixture here and there, which can be done relatively inexpensively. Leave the rest for the new homeowners because their preference for the carpet or the countertops will almost certainly be different than yours.
