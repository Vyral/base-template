For our team’s latest training session, we talked about how we got our start in the real estate industry, the model we used to build our team, and how experience can be shared for the greater good in our business.&nbsp;

**Once again, I’ve provided timestamps of the video above so that you can skip ahead to the section(s) that interest you the most:**

**0:28 -** How I got started in real estate&nbsp;<br>**3:44 -** Moving back to Cleveland and getting my ego in check&nbsp;<br>**5:21 -** Asking my sister Tina to join me&nbsp;<br>**6:41 -** How Tina got her start in real estate<br>**7:37 -** The model we used to build our team&nbsp;<br>**8:20 -** Determining where the agents on our team have most of their business: the listing side, the buying side, or a 50/50 split<br>**8:58 -** The importance of helping newer agents in the business

As always, if you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you.
