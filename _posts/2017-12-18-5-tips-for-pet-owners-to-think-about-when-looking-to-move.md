Today I have five great tips and things to think about for buyers who looking for a new home and need pet-friendly accommodations.

**1. Research what laws or restrictions the area has regarding pets.** Some communities are restrictive about why type of pets you can have, whether or not they need to be restrained if outside, and so on. You’ll need to know this information since the deed to the property is subject to those covenants.

**2. Is there a yard, and is the yard fenced in?** This is an especial concern for those with dogs, cats, or other such animals that they don’t want to escape out into the world. Having a fenced-off yard would grant those pets a space to be able to safely run around outside and play.

**3. Is the neighborhood and surrounding area safe for pets?** Is it near a major highway or busy intersection? Establish whether or not your area is conducive to the safety of your pets, with particular regards to vehicular traffic.

**4. Are your floors okay for pets to be on?** If your pets aren’t inside-trained, having carpet could become an issue. If you have soft wood floors and a Great Dane as a pet, scratches will be an issue as well.&nbsp;

**5. Does the layout of the house work for your pet?** Older pets may have trouble in homes with lots of stairs. Additionally, some pets require more space in general to thrive.

Like any member of your family, your pets have needs as well, so be sure that your new home suits them well, for your sake and theirs.
