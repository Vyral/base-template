*Contrary to what you may have heard, the holiday season is actually a great time to sell your house. Why? I have four reasons to share with you today.*

Are the holidays a good time to sell your house? Absolutely. Let me give you a few reasons why:

1. **Interest rates are still low.** This means there are still many buyers out shopping for homes.

2. **There are fewer homes on the market this time of year than there are during the peak season.** Right now, sellers can beat a wave of competition that will hit the market in the springtime. With so few homes on the market right now, you can beat that competition.

3. **Homes decorated for the holidays show better.** Christmas decorations and lights give a home that cozy feel, and they show better because of it.

4. **Buyers are more serious.** You may have fewer buyers come to your home overall, but the buyers who do come through will be much more serious about buying. They usually want to get a deal done before Christmas or before the new year.

Here in Austin, the market is strong, so it's still an ideal time to get your home on the market. If you're thinking about selling or buying a house this season, give me a call or send me an email soon. I'd be happy to help you.
