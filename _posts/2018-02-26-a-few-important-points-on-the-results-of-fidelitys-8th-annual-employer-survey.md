Today, I’d like to share some information regarding Fidelity’s eighth annual employer survey of retirement plan sponsors.

For eight years running, Fidelity has hired an independent third-party contractor to contact employers like you to get feedback on your retirement plan and how your employees are using it.

This year, Fidelity’s contractor was able to reach out to about 1,100 employers. **Across those employers, plans spanned from about 25% in the 0 to $25 million range, 50% in the range of $25 million to $50 million, and about 25% in the range of $250 million and above.**

About a third of the employers who were contacted were CEOs or owners, while a little less than another third of those contacted were CFO or finance professionals. The remaining third were HR professionals. There were also a few employers of miscellaneous job descriptions who fell outside these categories but were still responsible for plan oversight.

It is always interesting to see what comes of this survey. One of the things that stands out to me about this year’s survey is that healthcare concerns are becoming increasingly common.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
