There’s no shortage of opportunities for buyers or sellers in our spring market. Today’s market update will tell you all you need to know.

Take one glance out the window and you’ll see that, at last, spring is here\! That also means we’ve entered our spring market, which has been buzzing with activity over the last two months. &nbsp; &nbsp;

Let’s look at how our market is performing this spring:&nbsp;

Right now, we have 349 pending sales—even by spring’s standards, this is great news. **Our inventory has crept up lately to about 660 homes**, so buyers have a range of options at the present time.

If you’re looking to sell this spring, market conditions bode very well for you, because we’d ordinarily have about 1,000 homes on the market at this time.&nbsp;

The numbers are somewhat distorted in that our total for new listings taken isn’t much different than last year, but these listings are selling quicker.

All in all, the 2019 market is full of opportunity, whatever your real estate goals may be—**there is ample selection for buyers, and the market is in a predictable state for sellers.&nbsp;**

Something else of note: **Interest rates have gone through a recent drop as well.** It wasn’t all that long ago when they were bumping up against 5%, and they’re now in the low-4’s.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about our market or you have suggestions for future video topics, please feel free to give us a call. I hope to hear from you soon\!&nbsp;
