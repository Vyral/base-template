As a team, we try to keep an eye on certain patterns and trends in the industry. Since we’ve reached the summer market in 2018, I want to discuss some of the market conditions we’ve studied that could trigger you to sell your property sooner than later.

1. **Job growth in Columbus is slowing.** That means that we’re still growing and adding jobs all the time, but the rate at which we’re doing so has gone down. We’re still at an all-time low for unemployment, though, which is great.
2. **Interest rates are rising.** Higher interest rates make it harder for buyers and developers to purchase. Additionally, construction costs have also been going up here in Columbus. The 33-year fixed-rate mortgage has gone up 33% in the the last 23 months, and it’s still rising. &nbsp;Many people have failed in their search for properties, and it’s just another reason they’re starting to change their mindsets.
3. **Unit price growth is exceeding wage growth.** This is especially true for apartments. In the last year, the average property price has grown three time faster than wages. Trends like these are viable for now, but they can’t be sustained long-term.

The good news is that we’re seeing a lot of out-of-town investors flocking to Columbus and chasing cap rates that they can’t get in their own market. We haven’t seen a better time to sell in a while.

I think these trends are really interesting to watch, and if you want an update or have any questions, feel free to reach out to us. We'd be happy to help you.
