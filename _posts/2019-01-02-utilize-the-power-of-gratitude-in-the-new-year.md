2019 is upon us, and today I want to explain how you can make it your best year yet.
{: .present-before-paste}

With 2019 just around the corner, now is a great time to reflect on our future goals. Whether you’re looking to hit the gym more often, drink less, or have something else entirely you’d like to accomplish, it’s always good to have something to strive toward.&nbsp;

With that said, though, it’s also important to appreciate what you already have. I’ve been doing a lot of this lately.&nbsp;

As you all know, I recently tore my bicep during a race. This injury has made even simple daily tasks, like getting dressed, much more difficult than what I’m used to. This is the sort of thing a lot of people would be upset about, but I’ve decided not to be. Instead, I’m thankful.&nbsp;

**Life isn’t about the things that happen to you, it’s about how you react to them.** Before this injury, I took having full use of both my arms for granted. I’m lucky to say that my arm will eventually recover and I’ll have full use once more, but this isn’t true for everyone. This experience has taught me to be happy with what I’ve got, and has helped me realize that comparison is the thief of joy.&nbsp;

There’s a good reason gratitude has been a prevailing theme in my messages lately. It’s because I truly believe in the power and importance of counting your blessings.&nbsp;

Of course, being thankful is not the same thing as being complacent. You can be happy with what you have while still working toward self betterment. The key is to stay humble and to keep yourself grounded in what really matters. After all, the greatest things in life aren’t things at all.&nbsp;

Now that we’ve covered today’s main message, I’d like to also like to make you aware of an opportunity on the horizon.&nbsp;
{: .present-before-paste}

**I’ve got a goal in 2019 to help two motivated individuals start building wealth through real estate.** If you’ve got the desire to succeed (and a decent credit rating), I want to help you get into the real estate business. That’s right. I plan to help two people invest in a multi-family home and start earning passive income.&nbsp;
{: .present-before-paste}

Spreading the wealth is important to me. I love propping people up and positioning them for success. So if you’re interested in this opportunity, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I guarantee that it will change your life.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
