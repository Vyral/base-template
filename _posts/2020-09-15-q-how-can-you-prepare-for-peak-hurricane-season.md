&nbsp;

Hurricane season in the Carolinas is no joke, and over the past few years we’ve had our fair share of serious threats. **Hurricane officially lasts from June through November, but its peak lasts from August through October.&nbsp;**

Our first tip is to review your local area’s evacuation plan; follow your favorite local news channel on Facebook to get live updates on dangerous incoming weather.&nbsp;

**The rule of thumb is to prepare for 48 hours without electricity**. Make a storm kit that includes non-perishable food; snacks; batteries; flashlights; a first aid kit; a radio; and bottle water in case of emergency.&nbsp;

Locate the water, gas and electricity shut-offs in your home. By staying familiar with your utility shut-off points, you can act quickly when local officials tell you to turn off your gas.&nbsp;

If the power goes out at your home, be sure to unplug all appliances to prevent a power surge. **Board up your windows and place sandbags at your home’s entrances to help guard against flooding** and bring all outdoor furniture and grills inside before the storm gets too powerful.&nbsp;

Lastly, gather important documents such as insurance forms so you know exactly what your policy will cover. Keep these documents in your storm kit so they’re readily available in the case of damage.&nbsp;
