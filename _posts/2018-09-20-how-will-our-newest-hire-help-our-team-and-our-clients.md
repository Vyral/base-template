Our team has been growing a lot lately. With that growth, we have a big announcement to make about a new team member we have hired.

**We have recently brought on a full-time social media and marketing expert to help us bring value to our agents and our clients alike.** This will help all of our clients’ listings get exposure all over the internet and all over social media.

**We’re really excited about the value that this is going to bring to all of our agents and all of our clients.** We’re going to be able to give your home a lot more exposure when you list it on the market, which will bring more buyers and better offers.

If you’re a fellow agent and you’re interested in learning about what our team has to offer or if you’re in the market to buy or sell a home in Baltimore, please feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you soon.
