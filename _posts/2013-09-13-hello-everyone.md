Hello, everyone. When you decide to sell your home, you want an agent with a proven track record of getting the job done. In the last part of this two part video series I talk about the last four questions you should ask a listing agent before hiring them.

Are you an area specialist? Is my house in the area you specialize in?

I often find many agents specialize in a specific area. At The Gresh Group, we don’t believe in specializing in a specific area. We want to help everyone and we need to know our entire market.

Do you have an assistant or team?

Many agents are solo agents. Any agent you hire should have at least one assistant. You need an agent who can focus all their time on getting your home sold, not on paperwork.

The Gresh Group has an experienced, trained staff to handle paperwork, office duties and other background noise while the agents focus on getting your home sold.

Are you an active or passive agent?

There are two types of agents. Some agents just put your home on the MLS and wait for buyers to show up. This is a passive agent.

Others, like The Gresh Group, are active. We execute a first class multi-media marketing plan; we actively seek buyers from our own client base and from a large pool of like-minded active agents. We don’t wait for it to happen, we make it happen!

What is your Broker’s share of the market?

Some agents will tell you this doesn’t matter. The truth is the larger the Broker’s market share, the more in-house agents and their buyers will be directly exposed to your property even BEFORE you go on the market!

The Gresh Group is part of Keller Williams Realty, the #1 brokerage in the WORLD!

Thank you so much for watching. These are eight important questions you need to ask your listing agent before you hire. If you’re ready to sell, give us a call!
