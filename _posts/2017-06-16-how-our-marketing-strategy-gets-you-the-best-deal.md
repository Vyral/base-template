When you sell your house, there are certain things you can do to make sure you don't leave any money on the table.
<br>
<br>Some recent clients, John and Lauren, are a perfect example of how our marketing plan accomplishes this. We had to compete against some other brokers for their listing. Like most others, getting the most money for their home was very important to them.
<br>
<br>On the first weekend after listing their home, **we had more than 40 families come through on the first day of the open house and received more than 14 offers.** This allowed them to get more money than they ever imagined for their home. They also got the terms they wanted in the offer.

<br>
<br>For instance, we knew John and Lauren needed to stay in the home a little after the sale and that the home needed some repairs that they were concerned about negotiating. Since we had bid up the price so high, we also knew it might not appraise. We negotiated a deal to let them stay for a week longer, and while the houses didn't appraise, we negotiated a deal to have the buyer pay the difference between the offer price and the appraised value.
<br>
<br>We take a lot of pride in making sure sellers walk away from their deal feeling good about everything, and we accomplished that with John and Lauren.
