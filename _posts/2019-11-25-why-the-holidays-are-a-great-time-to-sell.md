The world has been trained to think that spring and summer are the best times to sell a home, but is that true? While more sales do happen during these seasons than fall and winter, there are a few reasons why selling during the holidays is also a great opportunity.&nbsp;

First, **off-season buyers are more serious than peak-season buyers.** These buyers need to move because they’ve been transferred into the market or they don’t have as much cash and their offers weren’t as strong in the spring and summer. Additionally, because there are fewer sellers during the colder months and fewer homes on the market, you’ll face less competition during the holiday season.

Furthermore, the tasteful decor that pops up during the holiday season goes a long way toward putting buyers into a more positive mood when they walk through your home. On that note, **here are a few tips to remember when decorating your home while it’s listed for sale:**

1\. Don’t block important selling features (e.g., the fireplace, stairs, or stain-glass windows)<br>2\. Tone down the size of your Christma tree<br>3\. Don’t leave wrapped gifts all over the place, and don’t leave expensive presents under the tree<br>4\. Use more splashes of red than green—red is more emotionally appealing<br>5\. Resist the urge to hang any banners and use greenery instead (I would encourage you to use artificial greenery so as not to set off any allergies)<br>6\. Display centerpieces made of pine cones and other wintery pieces from nature&nbsp;<br>7\. Set out a plate of cookies on the counter<br>8\. Hire a home stager

Lastly, remember that **your first step toward a successful holiday home sale is hiring an experienced real estate agent with a plan.** If you’d like to list your home now or you have any other real estate questions I can take care of, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
