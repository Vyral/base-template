We’re often asked if we sell commercial real estate and land in addition to residential real estate. The National Association of Realtors’ code of ethics policy tells us that Realtors should always tell you if they don’t specialize in certain fields. **Commercial, residential, and land sales are all different types of transactions, and only one is our specialty.**

When you’re looking to hire an agent, you should ask them if they specialize in any of these three areas. No matter the answer, you still have the right to choose whatever agent you want—but it’s still important to know what they do best.

Though we’ve sold land and commercial real estate before, **our team specializes in residential real estate.** We often work with our buyers and sellers during hard times, sometimes even representing them in home sales for free. We also have a guaranteed sale program where we’ll buy a home for a fair price ourselves if we don’t get it sold.

We specialize in residential real estate because it’s what we know best. I have been personally responsible for over 9,000 transactions—more than $1 billion in sales. The majority have been in residential property. I know how to best market to and reach residential customers, and with my years of experience, **it’s what I specialize in and prefer.**

So when you hire an agent, find one who enjoys what they do and has in-depth, specialized knowledge in what you’re looking to accomplish. If you would like to see what we can do for you, have any questions, or need further information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to helping you soon.
