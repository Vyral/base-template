<p style="text-align: center;"><em>It’s fall here in St. Cloud, but our real estate market remains hot. Here are the latest numbers.</em></p>

Now that summer is behind us, it’s back-to-school time. Since the fall has arrived, I wanted to bring you a quick update on the St. Cloud real estate market. I have some really great news.

**For starters, we’ve had 1,747 sales over the last six months.** Those are really strong numbers for our area. These numbers are especially strong for homes under $200,000.

We currently have 316 pending sales, indicating that sales are moving along strongly. **This is in part a result of interest rates dropping back down to historic lows.**

Right now, we have just 795 homes on the market. Although it keeps us in a seller’s market, there is still a good selection of homes available. I predict this strong fall market to continue through late October before slowing down during the holiday season and picking up again in January.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
