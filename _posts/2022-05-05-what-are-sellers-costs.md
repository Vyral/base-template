During the sales process, home sellers have a multitude of costs to take care of. Today I’ll discuss a few seller’s costs to anticipate if you plan to list your home.

For one, sellers have closing costs, which can include **transfer taxes, title insurance, escrow fees, HOA fees (where applicable), attorney fees, and more**. Closing costs can amount to anywhere between 8% and 10% of the purchase price. The city requires a recording fee, which is a fee to note in city records that you’ve sold your home. Sellers also need to account for the costs of moving between homes, as well as fees associated with utilities.

Another major cost is **agent commission**. Sellers pay for commission for both parties; even though the buyer pays your purchase price, the agents’ commission comes out of the seller’s proceeds.

If you have any questions about seller's costs or anything else to do with real estate, give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to speak with you.
