<center>Are you thinking about buying a brand new home? Here are some ways hiring an agent can make your life easier.</center>

Why does it make sense to hire a real estate agent when you’re buying a new construction home? There is a lot of information to cover on this topic, so I’ll just give you a few things to consider.

**1.** The on-site agent can write a contract for you. However, **they represent the builder and developer, not you or your best interests**.

**2. There are questions to ask that you may or may not know about.** For example, if you like a lot that is lined with trees in the back, do the trees go on your land?

Also, mirror-image floor plans are important to know about. You may see a floor plan that you love on paper, but because of the rules with the HOA or with the utility company, your home can be built as a mirror image from what you actually saw on the paper floor plan. You’ll want to know this up front.

Consider the fees in the contract. Are their contribution fees for the HOA? A fee in the contract for a survey? All of this stuff is important to you and we go over it all upfront to make sure there are no surprises.

**3. Having an extra set of eyes during walkthroughs is very helpful.** We can point out when stuff doesn’t match up to the contract, and handle any problems there might be.

If you’re thinking about buying a new construction home or if you just have any questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
