If you’ve put your home on the market and it is not selling, there are a couple of key factors you need to examine and steps you need to take to rectify the situation.

The first factor you need to look at is **timing.** What is the average days on market for listed homes in your area right now and where does your home fall within that average? This can vary depending on what price point your home’s in.

The second factor is **how your home compares to other homes on the market** and what kind of activity they’re getting. Your real estate agent can help you with this by pulling some numbers from the MLS.

After that, **you need to determine whether your home is priced appropriately based on those factors.** If your home has spent more than a month on the market but it’s still getting decent showing activity, be patient and see what happens. If it’s not getting decent showing activity, look at how your home compares to other similar homes on the market in terms of showings and online views.

A lack of showings could mean one of two things—either there aren’t a lot of buyers in your price point and the market’s slow in general, or buyers are eliminating your home from consideration in favor of other comparable homes. If it is the latter case, it is usually because of price. This is why, **when putting your home on the market, you never want to overprice it.** This can cause it to sit on the market, become stale, and prevent you from getting market value for it.

Remember to discuss these points with your real estate agent. If you need help selling your home or you have any other real estate questions for me, please feel free to call or email me anytime. My team and I would love to help you.
