A lot of people have been asking me recently whether it’s a good idea to sell your current home before purchasing your next. Trying to coordinate a transition between homes can be stressful, so today I’d like to shed some light on the best way to handle such a move.

To give you a short answer, selling before you buy is probably your best option. However, to explain why this is the case, I’ll need to delve a little deeper. There are five indicators you should check for within your own circumstances to see if this arrangement is right for you: &nbsp;

**1. You don’t want to carry two mortgages.** In a perfect world, the timelines of your two transactions would perfectly align. However, things don’t always work out this way. When you sell first before buying your next home, you can eliminate any chance that you may become responsible for handling two mortgages at once.

**2. You can’t qualify for a second mortgage.** If you don’t think you meet the necessary criteria to qualify for a second mortgage, you may want to sell before you buy.

**3. You’re buying in a competitive market.** If this is the case, it may take you longer to find and secure the right home. Selling in this kind of environment, meanwhile, will likely prove to be somewhat easier. In addition to this, having the funds from the sale of your current home available to apply toward your next purchase will better prepare you to compete as a buyer.

**4. You’re selling in a sluggish market.** As we touched on in the last point, it’s important to consider the state of the market as you prepare to transition between homes. If the market is on the slower side and it might take you a while to sell, it’s always a good idea to get this out of the way first. Otherwise, you may be waiting around to close for some time, even after you’ve found the perfect home to purchase next.

**5. You’re just not ready to buy.** The decision to purchase a new home isn’t one to be taken lightly. You should think long and hard about where you want to live and what kind of home you want to live in before taking the plunge. Selling first will give you the chance to carefully review your options and proceed with care.

With all of these reasons in mind, there’s still the matter of where you'll live in the meantime if you choose to sell before you buy. Thankfully, there are a couple of options. You can either negotiate a rent-back period, in which the new buyer allows you to continue living in your previous home past closing for a set period of time, or you can temporarily rent an apartment.
