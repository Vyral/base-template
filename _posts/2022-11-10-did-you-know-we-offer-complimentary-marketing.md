You probably know that property managers take care of your properties, but did you know that we do a ton of marketing?&nbsp;

We try to get the word out about your rental to as many people as possible. That way, you can garner competition and pick the best tenant. The best part? We do all of this at no cost to you.&nbsp;

Recently, sites like Zillow, Trulia, and HRN, have started charging a small fee to host your rental. For most of these sites, it’s only $10, which is a very small amount considering the benefits. While **we will always do our free marketing for you, we also recommend you put your listing on these sites to reach as many people as possible.** As always, call or email us if you have any questions. We are always willing to help\!
