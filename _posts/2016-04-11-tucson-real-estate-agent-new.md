Construction season has arrived in Tucson, and today I’ll be giving you tips to help you when you’re buying a newly-built home. The last few years have been a little slow, but the developers are coming back and we’re going to see a particularly strong year. New subdivisions are going up everywhere.

However - be warned - you might want to hire an agent to help you buy a new home. The agent at the home works exclusively for the seller, so they will not be attempting to help you buy the home. When you do hire a buyer’s agent, the builder will pay their commission, so there is no reason not to hire some help. If you don’t you have a very large chance of not getting the best deal possible. 

Our team of agents has established relationships with builders and we can get you a great deal on a new home. Interest rates are low, so it’s a fantastic time to purchase a home. Please don’t hesitate to contact us!
