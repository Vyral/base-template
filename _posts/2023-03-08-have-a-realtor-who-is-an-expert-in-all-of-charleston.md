Does your real estate agent have a comprehensive understanding of all the areas within the greater Charleston real estate market? Yesterday, I spoke with an agent who seemed to be well-versed in one particular area and believed that it was essential for Realtors. However, I find being a master in a single area in the city limiting, especially for those clients relocating from another area.
