Spring is already in the horizon and very soon we have to get rid of the winter clothes that we have in our closets and replace it with clothes more appropriate with this season of blooming flowers. We should not forget that our homes will be in line with the spring fashion line!

No need to repaint your house. The colors of spring suit well with almost all shades. Throw in some citrus colored accessories in your home. Match it with brightly colored vases and spunky patterned rugs and throw pillows. This will create a casual living room that sings “spring”.

Revamp your bedroom by adding more floral prints. Liven up your plain headboard by adding or just by simply draping over a floral printed fabric. If you have a bare wall in your room, you can make simple spring decoration by cutting out floral prints that goes along well with your room’s color palette. Frame it using simple old picture frames or if you want to buy cheap ones it’s ok. The simplicity will complement the beautiful pattern of your cut outs. Then add a little vase with a real or plastic flower on your beside table. Waking up to these will guarantee you a good mood to start your day.

If you want your walls to have that spring feel, but you don’t want to repaint it. Then use removable wallpaper with spring time vibe. Use little floral patterns or a color that’s light and fresh, like pastel yellow and orange.

You know those ready-made ceiling rosettes? Who says they’re only for ceilings? With a little creativity it could add life and style to your living room. Just paint them with different shades of yellow and hang the discs on the wall. Since they are lightweight, they are pretty easy to hang and they are available at most home centers.

If you have egg cups in your home and you don’t really use it. You may improvise by using these cups as storage for your little office knickknacks, put paper clips, stamps and such. Or you may also put little candies on it and put it on your side tables for visitors.

Flowers are not the only thing that blooms in spring. New leaves also blossom out of those trees and shrubs. So add a simple green centerpiece on your living room table, use a bundle of fern leaves an put it in a vase. It doesn’t have to be flowers all the time.

Spring means good sunlight. Let those rays grace your room by putting up simple sheer panels. It lets the sunlight in and because it’s light, it moves easily with the breeze, making your room look fresher and brighter.

New life, new beginnings, and renewed hope; these are the things that Spring Season gives each and every one of us. So start celebrating spring season in your very own abode.
