It’s been a while since I made one of these blogs, so I wanted to give you a quick market update. Everyone wants to know where the market is headed.

**We have about 0.92 months of inventory in the Anchorage municipality across all price ranges,** which is extremely low. We have over 562 homes under contract right now. That means they are sold and in the closing process. We have a really high pending ratio, but that tells us that there are still homes out there. It’s not that we aren’t getting enough listings; instead, as soon as a listing comes on the market, it goes under contract.

We put a $500,000 property on the market a week ago. It got 16 offers and sold for $115,000 over the list price. **So if you’re thinking about selling, prices are the best I’ve seen in my 22 years of experience.&nbsp;**

It is a great time to capitalize on your equity, but things have slowed down a bit because of interest rates. Our average number of homes sold in Anchorage is about 186, and our average sales price is $424,000.

If you have any questions, give my team a call at (907) 240-2804 or email me at [Dar@DarWalden.com](mailto:Dar@DarWalden.com). We’d love to hear from you.
