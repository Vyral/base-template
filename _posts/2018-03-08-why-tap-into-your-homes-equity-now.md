Do you notice that pile of cash you're sitting on right now?&nbsp;

I'm not joking. **42 million homeowners with mortgages have equity in their home right now.**

When added up, tappable home equity recently reached $5.5 trillion. That's about $3 trillion more than when the housing market bottomed out in 2012. "Tappable equity" here is defined as the amount a homeowner could borrow before they hit 80% of debt to value.

Not surprisingly, **many homeowners are looking to tap into these hidden reserves.** As just one sign of this, mortgage applications are up 4.1% this January over last year. That's mostly been driven by mortgage refinances, **as homeowners are looking to take advantage of low (but increasing) rates to take out some of that equity as cash.**

Another option to a mortgage refinance is a home equity line of credit (HELOC), a kind of checking account on your home. While HELOCs have been growing in popularity, they've hit a slight snag recently because the new tax bill eliminates the deductions for interest paid on such lines of credit.&nbsp;

What are homeowners who tap into their equity actually doing with the extra cash? Most people are spending it on **making their homes even more valuable.** According to one survey, 80% of borrowers would consider using that cash to renovate their home.&nbsp;

However, other homeowners are using their **home equity to cover education expenses, to pay down other debt, or simply for investing**, whether in stocks, real estate, or even cryptocurrencies.

So should you tap into your home equity?
