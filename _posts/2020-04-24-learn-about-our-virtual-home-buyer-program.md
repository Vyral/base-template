We realize that it’s a different sort of time, but the real estate market continues to be going strong\! Serious buyers are out there and taking advantage of this opportunity to find their perfect home\! We always strive to offer only the best in client experiences so we designed a program that has made this process safe and easy for our buyers. We’ve had a ton of people reaching out and wanting more information so we thought this would be helpful to share\!

Join us on April 29th at 4:00 pm on Zoom where we will share the process and walk you through the virtual steps of buying a home\! Register at the address here - [https://bit.ly/VirtualHomeBuyerZoom](https://bit.ly/VirtualHomeBuyerZoom) - Seating is limited so make sure you sign up soon to ensure you have a spot\!

We also want to take this opportunity to give back to the community which means that one lucky participant will win a $100 gift certificate to a local business of choice\!

We look forward to seeing you there\! Make sure you bring your questions as we’ll have a Q&A session at the end\!
