When you’re moving from one place to another there are a LOT of details to keep track of and of course much to do. That’s why sometimes it helps to have a system in place and a good team on your side. We spoke with Jim Finch of Barrett Moving & Storage today to find out what his company suggests are some good tips for a smooth move.

**Be Flexible and Plan Ahead**

Keep in mind that no two moves are exactly the same. Depending on the number of items, amount of stuff that needs to be packed on moving day versus pre-packed, distance to be traveled and other factors – your move can take anywhere from one day to several weeks or more. The initial visit is a crucial component of understanding what to expect from your move and should be sought as soon as possible.

**Don’t Waste Time, Call Way Ahead of Time**

A common mistake is not to call soon enough after the decision to move has been made. The advantage by calling ahead of time is the ability to make plans accordingly. This could mean anything from selecting only some things to be packed by the movers eventually (just furniture or fragile items, for instance) or making sure the best services are chosen according to your needs. If you are listing your home, as soon as it is on the market contact your mover to get an idea of what to expect.

**Always Get an Estimate in Person**

Though you can select online estimates from some large national chains, Finch advises against using that method if you want an accurate estimate of how much your move will cost. The expense will largely depend on the amount of items, extent of packing or other services needed as well as the size of move and distance traveled.

**Don’t Move at the End of the Month**

Most movers are very busy during the last week of the month, particularly during the spring and summer seasons. Though they will accommodate your needs, it’s still a good idea to schedule your move during the first three weeks if possible so that you can enjoy the least amount of scheduling hassles.
