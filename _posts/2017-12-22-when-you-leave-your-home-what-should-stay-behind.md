As a seller, what items should you leave behind for the buyer when you move out of your home? Here's a list of key items and things to consider.

**1. Leave a key for every door.** This includes any outdoor buildings, sheds, or padlocks that are on the property.

**2. Leave your garage door remotes.**

**3. Leave the keyless code for garage entry.**

**4. Leave any warranty paperwork.** Remember to leave behind receipts for repairs and instruction manuals for any of the items in your home.

**5. Leave building materials.&nbsp;**Some buyers will not want these items. Which brings us to the next point.

**6. Ask buyers if they want certain items.** This includes paint, building materials, shelving units, and big pieces of furniture that are difficult to remove.

**7. Wipe down appliances and countertops.**

**8. Sweep and vacuum.**

**9. Leave a note about the neighborhood and neighbors.**

**10. Leave a bottle of wine, a wine opener, and a nice note.** If you have had a very positive experience with the buyer so far, this can be a good way to foster further positivity.
