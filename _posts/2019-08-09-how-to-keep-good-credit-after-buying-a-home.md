Once you’ve bought a home, there are a few things you can do to help you maintain your good credit, and today I’ll share them with you:

**1\. Furnish your home and get a good rate.** Plenty of furniture stores have pretty good interest rates, especially for those whose credit was good enough to buy a home. However, be careful; if your credit is good, they’ll give you lots of money, but you don’t want to go into debt just to furnish your home.

**2\. Start saving some money.** There are so many different ways that you can save money with a good credit score; many services offer discounts, like your insurance or airline companies.

**3\. Be careful about starting a new job.** Some jobs will run your credit score to see where you’re at; if your job is one of them, it’s a good idea to keep your credit score from dropping too low. Furthermore, you’ll need a good credit score if you’re thinking about refinancing.
