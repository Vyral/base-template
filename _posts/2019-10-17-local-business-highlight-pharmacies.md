Today I’ll introduce you to Richard Gobin, founder of a group of local pharmacies that have been serving us for 60 years.

Today I’m bringing you another brand ambassador local business highlight\! We’re going to learn about the story of a group of local hometown pharmacies here in Pennsylvania consisting of Quality Care Pharmacy, Holly Pharmacy, and Big Spring Pharmacy. I’m going to introduce you to Richard Gobin, the founder of these pharmacies, who built a group of local businesses that have served our community for a long time.&nbsp;

In full disclosure, Richard Gobin is actually my uncle, I call him uncle Rick. My family came to this area many years ago, and uncle **Rick has been a business leader in the community for years.** I’ve taken many cues from him, he’s been a mentor to me and other family members as to how to do business and how to give back to the community. I use this pharmacy myself and I couldn’t be more thrilled to introduce you to my uncle Rick.&nbsp;

Here’s what Rick has to say about his business: “We make every attempt to be different and provide more personalized service, not only to the patient but to the family. We remain in contact with the physician and try to see if there is any way to save patients’ funds on the medications that are ordered. **We support the community and try to pay it forward when possible.**”

I’ve noticed when I come here that you get to know the pharmacists by name. They live locally and a lot of them have been here for a long time. They go out of their way to not just give me my prescription, but also give me advice on other things that can save me money.

When asked about his history, Rick says, “My story goes back about 60 years. We moved into Carlisle from the farm when I was about 16 years old. I heard about a job opening in a drug store, I went in, and I was told ‘If you want it, it pays 40 cents per hour.’ I showed up, and that’s how my career started. It was quite different back then.

There was no plastic, no computers, **but I was instrumental in getting the public the items they needed.** The technology changes have been one of the most considerable shifts in this industry. It can provide great advances in medication interactions and patient care if it’s taken advantage of. It can be both a management tool and a medication tool.”

I’ve been coming to this group of pharmacies all my life and I have forged wonderful relationships with the pharmacists here. I encourage you to contact this group of pharmacies. Reach out and learn about them. I hope to see you here sometime soon\!

If you have any other questions you can always reach out to me by phone or email, I would be glad to speak to you about these pharmacies, or any real estate topic.
