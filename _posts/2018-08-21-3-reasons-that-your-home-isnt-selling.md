<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Today I have three reasons that your home may not be selling in our hot market.</em></p>

Why isn't my home selling? This is a crazy question only because we are in probably the best real estate market the Washington County has ever seen.

While many people will say that 2005 to 2006 was a hotter market, it wasn't. Much like when you go on a road trip and eat a lot of junk food only to feel like you need real food, 2005 and 2006 were a junk food market. People were buying homes without seeing them and lying about their income to qualify for loans. Now in 2018, we have a healthy market full of people who qualify for loans necessary to buy a home.

So, why isn't your home selling? In the last six months, there have been 2,170 homes, condos, and townhomes sold in Washington County. It is so hot that I put my friend Charlotte's home on the market last week and we received five offers before selling the home for $12,000 over asking price.

While over 2000 homes sold in the last six months, 712 didn't. They went unsold for three reasons.

**1. Price.** I know a lot of people do not want to hear this but 80% of the cases that the home didn't sell it was priced outside of the market. Even though the market is fantastic, it is a market and there is a certain price that you are willing to pay or not pay.

**2. Condition.** You probably have a home that needs to be updated with new carpet, paint, landscaping, etc. You need a good agent to tell you the truth about what you need to do to spruce it up so you get the most money.

**3. Marketing.** This is not usually the primary issue; however, if your home is not marketed fully, it is very easy to fall back on the mentality of “Well, it's a hot market.” Just putting it on Craigslist or Zillow is not enough.

The reality is that poor marketing and poor condition could actually be costing you $15,000 to $20,000. Meanwhile, the wrong pricing strategy could cost you a sale entirely.

If you have any questions about this or buying and selling in general, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
