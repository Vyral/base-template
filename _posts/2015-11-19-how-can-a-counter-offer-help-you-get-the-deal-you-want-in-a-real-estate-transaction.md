The real estate process can be confusing at times, so today I want to briefly discuss one aspect of it that often catches people off guard: counter offers.&nbsp;**Often, people don't know how quickly they need to respond to a counter offer**.

**If you're selling your property and you receive an offer that is unacceptable, you can always counter the offer in either price or terms before submitting it to the prospective buyer**. The same works in reverse: if you're a buyer who doesn't like the seller's offer, you can rework the offer to fit your needs and resubmit it to the seller. Counter offers are a nice tool to use when buying or selling real estate. When you're selling, it's a good way to avoid taking a deal that is unfavorable to you without turning the buyer down outright.

**Now that you know how a counter offer is used, you're probably curious about how quickly you need to respond with one. When an offer is submitted, there is a Binding Acceptance, the date of which a counter offer pretty much makes irrelevant**. In my experience, however, the quicker you respond to an offer or counter offer, the better the chance that you and the other party come to an agreement.
