There’s a lot of confusion surrounding the subject of credit scores, so I’d like to demystify a few key points on the topic today.

First, it’s important to note that about **35% of your credit score is based upon your payment history.** Consistently making your payments on time is critical to a healthy score.

Second, you must also keep in mind the amount owed. If you’re constantly maxing out your credit limit, this will be detrimental to your score. However, completely paying off a line of credit is, surprisingly, also not ideal. To make sure this contributing factor, which accounts for about 35% of your score, has a positive impact, it’s best to keep your balance at or below 30% of your limit. Creditors see a higher balance as a higher risk.

Moving on, **your score is also impacted by the length of your credit history.** Maintaining good financial habits over a longer period of time will have a greater positive influence on your score. Not only that, but the types of credit you hold will also play a part in your score. Credit card debt, auto debt, and any other credit lines you’ve taken out will account for about 10% of your score.

The last 10% of your credit score will be determined by the frequency with which you make credit inquiries. As you’ve likely heard, having several credit inquiries in a short period of time can pose a detriment to your score. Less frequent credit inquiries, especially those that result in a new line of credit, however, will tend not to make as much of an impact.

**Hopefully this has helped answer a few of the questions you might have had about the “hows” and “whys” of your credit score.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
