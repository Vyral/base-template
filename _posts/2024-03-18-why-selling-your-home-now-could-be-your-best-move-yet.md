Are you contemplating a move but uncertain about taking the plunge? Let's take a closer look at the current housing market trends. It's crucial information that could influence your decision.

First off, let's talk about the state of the market. Right now, we find ourselves in a seller's market where there are more buyers than available homes. **This imbalance puts sellers in a favorable position.**

What does this mean for you as a potential seller? It means that if you list your home this spring, you could find yourself in the enviable position of having multiple buyers vying for your property. Homes that are priced correctly are selling quickly, often with multiple offers.

As we enter the peak buying season, which typically spans March, April, and May in Louisville and southern Indiana, the demand for homes is expected to surge even more.

One important metric to consider is the absorption rate. This metric calculates the number of months it would take for the current inventory of homes on the market to be sold, given the current rate of sales. A lower absorption rate indicates a stronger seller's market.

Currently, our data shows that we are in an exceptional seller's market. Many price ranges are experiencing a supply of only 1 to 4 months, indicating high demand and low inventory.
