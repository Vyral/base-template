Jennie headed to Sapulpa earlier this week to connect with Tami Fleak, one of the many volunteers behind the amazing holiday extravaganza in Sapula, OK!



Entering its second year, the Route 66 Christmas Chute is the brainchild of a group of business owners and city officials to bring families to downtown Sapulpa to enjoy a walkable Christmas experience.



With 800-foot-long canopies filled 10 magical themes, there is something for every member of the family to enjoy!



Open daily from 8:00am- 10:00pm, November 16th through December 31st, this merry mainstream provides pop-up shops, restaurants, downtown shops, and weekend events…including Santa!
