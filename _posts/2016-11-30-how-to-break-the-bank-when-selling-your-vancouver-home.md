For most people, “getting top dollar” is number one on their list of goals when selling their home. These same people, however, feel ill-equipped to achieve this goal.

Since various market factors can cause large swings, pricing a home is an imperfect science to begin with, and the skills of the person responsible for negotiating for the home can also impact the outcome of the transaction.

However, negotiating effectively doesn’t have to be as difficult or scary as you would expect. Like anything else, **if you have a proven system to follow and know the signals and language, you can successfully turn the tables in your favor.** Who better to borrow these skills from than professional negotiators who sit across the table to try to out-bargain their opponents every day?
