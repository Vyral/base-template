Today I’d like to give a shoutout to all you good people. I’m very grateful for the opportunity to have worked with so many buyers and sellers throughout the year. **Thank you all very much.**

A lot of you have referred friends and family to me this year, and I want to give you a huge shout out for that as well.

Most of all, **I want to wish you all a very happy Thanksgiving** this year. Be safe and eat lots of turkey!
