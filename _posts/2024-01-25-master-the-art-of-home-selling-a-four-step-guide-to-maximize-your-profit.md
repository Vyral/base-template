Are you ready to sidestep the stress of selling and maximize your profit at the same time? Today, Iâ€™ll guide you through the four-step home selling process:

**1\. Prepare your home for sale.** The first crucial step in the home selling process is preparing your home. While staging is an option, it's more about ensuring your home shows and smells its absolute best. Investing time and, if necessary, money in this step is essential for attracting potential buyers. We provide a detailed "34 Steps to Greatness" document to guide sellers through the process, ensuring your property is presented in the best light.

**2\. Price your home competitively.** Pricing your home is a delicate balance. We offer comprehensive market data, showcasing what other sellers are getting for their properties. With our guidance, you can make an informed decision on pricing that aligns with market dynamics and positions your home competitively.

**3\. Marketing - Putting your home in the spotlight.** Unlike many others, we invest significantly in marketing, spending about $20,000 per month to ensure our clients' homes receive maximum exposure. This involves leveraging various channels to get the most eyeballs on your property. Our commitment to marketing sets us apart from the average Realtor who spends less than a thousand dollars per year on marketing. This step aims to enhance the visibility of your home on the market.

**4\. Gathering feedback.** In the final step, the focus shifts to feedback. We use a digital feedback system to provide sellers with valuable insights into what potential buyers are saying about their homes. While the feedback may not always be what sellers want to hear, it is crucial to make necessary adjustments to increase the likelihood of a successful sale.
