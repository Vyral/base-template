Put it in your business plan for 2018 to give back to your community. We have some ideas about how you can do that.

Today I wanted to talk with you about giving—giving back to your community.

Giving is awesome, and it feels great. **Make sure you have it in your budget and your business plan for 2018 to be able to give back to your community.** The following are some ways that we like to give back.

In 2013, devastating tornadoes hit our neighbors in Moore, Oklahoma. They hit so close to home that at that point in May, **we chose to, as a team, donate $100 of all the rest of our closings that year back to the relief efforts in that area,** including the food bank, the Salvation Army, United Way, and so on.

That felt really good; we got to give back about $4,000, which really makes a difference. As a team, we chose to continue with that feeling of giving and charity. **Since then, for every closing that we have, we call up our client after closing and thank them so much for allowing us to help them choose which organizations we can give to in their name.**

Honestly, those are the best conversations ever. **When people give, it makes them feel good, and then we all feel good.**

Another way we give as a team is on our green sheets. **If you’re with Keller Williams Realty, we have distribution authorizations that pull donations out of our money at closing automatically.** Our team gives to the Keller Williams Kids Can organization, as well as KW Cares.

Don’t forget that there are ways to give that are mindless and easy, and just feel great.

Let me know what ideas you come up with! I’d love to hear other ways that you’re giving. And guess what? If you already have this in your budget, when disaster strikes our country, you’ll be able to be first on call to give back.

I look forward to hearing from you.
