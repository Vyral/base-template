If you were to ask any general contractor along the Wasatch Back what their most valuable asset is, what do you think they’d say? Do you think they’d say their subcontractor list? I bet they would.

**You should really build up your bench with qualified vendors, and I have advice about how to do just that.**

First, determine all the vendors you can contact who would positively impact your clients. Don’t be embarrassed to rifle through all the categories of the Yellow Pages to find vendors of all different types, like CPAs, plumbers, roofers, and so on. If you don’t have a vendor who has been referred to you by an associate, you can use this as an opportunity to generate leads. Let those businesses know that you’re building your bench and that you have the ability to influence your clients to use their service.

It’s a good idea, however, to set a service standard. **Ask each vendor you contact a range of questions, such as:**

* “How much of your business is based on referrals from past clients?”
* “Do you have a website with reviews I can look at?”

Be sure to qualify the vendors you contact so that your clients are sure to have a great experience.

As part of a lead generating activity, check in once a quarter with the various vendors on your list. Ask them about their services and whether or not anything has changed so that you can better advise your clients about using them. I promise that if you are thorough enough with this activity, you can generate more business and deliver a high-level experience for your clients.

**There’s also a great, low-cost app called HomeKeepr that allows you to have all this intelligence right on your phone.** If you bump into a client at the store and they ask you about recommendations for a carpet service, you can just pull up the relevant information then and there. I’d love to hear what kind of results you get if you decide to use the app.

If you have any questions about building up your bench, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you.
