Today I want to thank you in two ways:&nbsp;

**First, you’re invited to our client appreciation tamale giveaway.** We do this for our forever clients, people who have referred someone to us, and people who have been referred. We want to pull together our whole network and say thank you.&nbsp;

We’re working with a family who has started making fresh, homemade tamales. **They will be available for pick-up December 4th.** Last year, we gave away over three thousand, so just put in your order, and put it on your calendar.

Second, we want to expand our connections. Odds are you will need help finding someone to help you do some work,, whether that be a plumber, roofer, etc. **We are never too busy to help connect you to trusted professionals.** This next year, feel free to call us—even if it’s outside of real estate. Maybe you need a family attorney, CPA, bookkeeper, or financial planner.

Make it a great day, and thank you for a great year. We couldn’t do it without you. As always, if you have any questions, feel free to give us a call.
