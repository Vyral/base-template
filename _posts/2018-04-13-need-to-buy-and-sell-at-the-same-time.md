These days, most people in our area have to sell their home before they can purchase a new one. In our low-inventory market, they’re afraid that when they sell their current home, they might not be able to find another one.&nbsp;

There are a couple solutions to this dilemma, however.&nbsp;

The best option, in my opinion, is to **put your home on the market and allow your agent to negotiate a rent-back arrangement** that would allow you to rent the home back after closing for a certain amount of time. Because inventory is so low, we have a pool of pre-approved buyers who’d be willing to let you stay in your home until you find another one—whether that be 60, 90, 120, or however many days it takes.&nbsp;

Another option is to **delay the closing for however long you need to identify and close on a new home.**&nbsp;

Generally, both of these options give you ample time and opportunity to find a new home.&nbsp;
