We recently represented a family that had the most stringent and difficult search criteria you could imagine. Not only did they want to live in a particular neighborhood in a particular school district, but they wanted to live on a specific street on a specific block.

I’m proud to say that after a year of looking, we found them the right home and they’re extremely happy. The process also reminded me of four important tips you need to know to find the right home, particularly now that inventory is so low.

First, **be prepared**. We had the family that we represented talk to a lender in advance so they’d be ready to write an offer as soon as the right home became available.

Second, once you find the right home, **be ready to take action**. Once this family found the right home, they wrote an offer within 24 hours.

Third, **be flexible.** The home this family wanted needed a lot of work, but they were willing to be flexible.

Fourth, **have a backup plan**. All the while, this family was looking at other options and were prepared to write an offer for a home that was a few blocks away. It was important for them to have this backup plan in place just in case.

After a lot of work, we were able to find them a home that wasn’t even on the market yet.

Oh, and one more thing—this family that we “represented” was actually me and my family.

The point is, I know that housing inventory is tight and a lot of buyers feel like they won’t find their dream home. My family felt the same way. If you’re a buyer, rest assured that there’s a strategy to finding the right home and plans we can put in place to help you.

If you have any questions about finding the right home or you’re looking to buy a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
