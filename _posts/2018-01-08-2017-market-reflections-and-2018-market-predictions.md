What happened in the 2017 real estate market?

**Overall, 2017 was a market of low inventory**. We stayed between a one- and three-month supply of inventory.

To put that in perspective, a balanced market has five to six months of inventory. A buyer’s market has more than six months of inventory, and a seller’s market has less than five months of inventory.

We spent most of the year in a strong seller’s market. Since we usually had one month of inventory, we were actually closer to a frenzy market.

Since we stayed between one and three months of inventory, there was quite a bit of inflation in housing prices depending on where you are. In the Seattle area, you’re looking at 13% appreciation. In outlying areas like Maple Valley, **that appreciation was anywhere between 10% and 12%.**

So, what can you expect from our real estate market in 2018?

I would say we can anticipate more of the same. The market will stay strong, and we only have one month of supply right now. Nationally, home prices are expected to go up between 4% and 5%. Locally, home prices are expected to go up between 10% and 12%.

**Since inventory is so low, now is a great time to sell your home**. It can also be a great time to buy because of affordability and low interest rates.

If you plan on buying or selling a home in 2018, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. The beginning of the year is a good time to talk to a professional even if you are not quite ready to make a move yet.

If you plan on selling a home, there are things that you can do several months ahead of time before you put your home on the market to increase the amount of money you get out of your home sale. Some updates will get you a better return on investment, and we would be happy to point you towards the updates that will increase the value of your home.

Just give us a call or send us an email if you have any questions. We look forward to hearing from you!
