What does today’s market look like for buyers? Are there opportunities buyers can take advantage of? I’ve received these questions a lot from clients. Today, I’ll respond to them and talk about why now is a fantastic time to purchase a home.

Our business has always been strong with buyers, so be rest assured that I am not one of those fairweather agents who choose to talk about buyers just because the changes in the market are turning in their favor. I’m proud of our balanced business, and I truly love working with buyers.&nbsp;

The most exciting thing about this market if you want to purchase a home is now that things have normalized, there’s no need to rush the process. **Buyers can take their time, make sure the property's value matches up with the asking price, and negotiate for a better deal.**

However, there’s still a reason why you might want to act quickly: mortgage rates are increasing. If you’re wondering whether to wait for rates to drop, remember that prices in general have gone up. Still, **there will always be people who need to move and buy a house because of their circumstances in life**, despite how the market is.

I've been doing this for two decades now, and I know several creative programs that will help you buy a home if you don’t like the current rate. For example, you can buy down the rate or get an adjustable-rate mortgage.&nbsp;

If you want to talk more about your options, call or email me. I’d be happy to discuss your situation and offer you my real estate advice.&nbsp;
