How are interest rates impacting our current market?

They’ve been increasing slowly lately, and we’re above the 4% mark now. It’s hard to complain, though, since they were so low for such a long time, and it’s predicted that they won’t be that low again for a while.

For the rest of 2018, rates are expected to rise even further into the high 4% range. This means a lot of sellers have been looking at their current interest rate and thinking about refinancing. Any seller who’s considering refinancing is probably staying where they’re at, and **this trend has created a shortage of inventory in our market, both locally and nationwide.** As you can see in the [**graph in the video**](https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/Melissa+Thompson/Memphis_Year_to_Dat_Home_Sales_Active_Inventory-1.jpg), our year-to-date inventory is the lowest it’s been in the last decade.

**If you’re a buyer, the current situation might be a bit of a struggle.** There aren’t very many homes to choose from, and in some price points, multiple offer situations are common. If you’re a seller, you might be able to get more money that you thought you could for your home sale right now. &nbsp;

As spring progresses, &nbsp;the inventory situation will hopefully get better. In the meantime, if you have any questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email.

I’d love to help!
