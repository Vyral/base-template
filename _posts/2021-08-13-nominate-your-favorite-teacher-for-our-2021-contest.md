I’m so excited to announce our third annual Teacher Giveaway. When we started this three years ago, we gave away $500 to five deserving Central Iowa educators. Last year, with all the challenges of 2020, we upped the number to $2,020 in gifts. This year, we decided to make our contribution even bigger by giving $2,500 to 50 different Central Iowa educators.

**To enter, go to our Facebook page or [website](www.SOLDinCentralIowa.com/TeacherGiveaway){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, tag your favorite teacher (and the school they’re from), like our business page, like the post, and share the post.** Get the word out and help us celebrate our local teachers\!

I would like to give special thanks to Home Warranty of America and Eric Bokker at Mortgage Central for making this happen.&nbsp;

What are you waiting for? Head on over to our page and tag your favorite educators. We can't wait to see who wins\! **We’ll announce the winners on Facebook Live on August 19 at 4 p.m. central.**

If you have any real estate-related questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
