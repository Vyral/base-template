As I’ve mentioned in the past, unexpected costs can arise during any home purchase. Today, I’d like to go over one type of cost in particular: utilities.

If you were renting a property before you made your home purchase, things like your water or heat may have been included. However, as a homeowner, these costs must be accounted for.

One thing I highly encourage is for buyers to ask the home’s current owners about average monthly utility costs. **These numbers won’t be ironclad, but they will help you understand what you should expect.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
