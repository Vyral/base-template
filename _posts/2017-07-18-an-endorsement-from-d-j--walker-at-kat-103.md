Recently, we were delighted to receive a glowing endorsement from none other than **D.J. Walker from KAT 103 Country**. He had some really nice things to say about our team and specifically, our guaranteed sale program. Here’s what he had to say:

*“The solution is Ron and Eva Cedillo at Home Buyers Realty. They give you the homebuyer guarantee. You’ll meet with them and agree on a price and a deadline. If the deadline passes and your home isn’t sold, they’ll buy your home. Their marketing system is on an entirely different level than any other agent because they invest in making sure your home gets seen and their buyers know about your home.”*

**D.J. also shared a story about a recent client we worked with**:

*“After many life changes and financial stress, Esteban needed to sell his home in Tracy fast. After having it listed with another agent for eight months with no success, he hired Ron and Eva. With their aggressive marketing system, it sold in just one week at his listing price of $645,000.”*

With our guarantee, there is no risk. If you want to get out of your contract, we will let you out free and clearly. However, we are rarely taken up on that offer because we continue to sell homes for top dollar.

**Thanks again to D.J. and KAT 103 for recommending us**. If you have any questions for us about our team, our guarantee, or the real estate market in general, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
