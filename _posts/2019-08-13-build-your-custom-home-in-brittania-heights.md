Today I’m on-site at a beautiful custom home subdivision called Brittania Heights to give you a sneak peek of what it has to offer. This subdivision is officially located in Nampa, but it sits right on the Ada County/Canyon County border. Though it has a bit of a country feel to it, it’s no more than a six-minute drive to the freeway, and **you can be in downtown Boise in about 15 minutes**.

Prices range from $450,000 to $700,000, and these beautiful homes have all the features you can think of. Lots are hard to come by here, but I have four available with custom builder Central Valley Homes.

If you’re interested in building your future home here or you have any questions about Brittania Heights, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
