If you’re thinking of buying a home, home inspections are something you absolutely must do.

With that in mind, I’m joined today by Jim Nelson of Home Assured Property Inspection Services to discuss the different inspections they offer and how each may benefit you. This way, you can get an idea of what your options are.

The first type of inspection they offer is **the 200-point inspection**, which covers the entire house. If you only want to know the home’s general condition before you buy it, this is the inspection you want.

Next, they offer **a WDO inspection, or what’s commonly known as a termite inspection**. Most lenders require this type of inspection, and it simply involves investigating a home for the presence of termites.

Your next option is **the four-point inspection**, which is required by insurance companies if the home is 17 years old or older. The four “points” this inspection refers to are the home’s roof, and its electrical, plumbing, and heating systems. Since this inspection is required by insurance companies, it’s written in a language that underwriters can understand so nothing can be misconstrued.

Lastly, **you can get a wind mitigation inspection, which can help lower your insurance costs**. Essentially, wind mitigation inspections check how hurricane-friendly a home is. Since we’re in a state that’s vulnerable to hurricanes, Jim says that there’s been a lot of code-changing in the way homes are constructed. If your home has certain characteristics that protect against hurricane damage (e.g., an 8-penny nail connecting your roof to your truss), you can get your insurance costs reduced. In fact, Jim has had clients whose homes were so hurricane-friendly that they received a 40% discount.

If you have any more questions for Jim about home inspections or you’d like to order an inspection from Home Assured Property Inspection Services, you can give their office a call at (813) 419-2661 or visit their website at [homeassuredinspections.com](http://www.homeassuredinspections.com/).

As always, if you have any other real estate questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’d be happy to help you.
