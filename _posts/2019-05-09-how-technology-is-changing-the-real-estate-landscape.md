<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you’re fearful of being replaced by technology, don’t be. Today we’ll share a few important points on how we as an industry can make technological advances work for us, instead of against us.</em></p>

Technology has changed our industry a lot since I first went into business 18 years ago, and even more so since my father (and his father) got there start decades before me.&nbsp;

There’s no denying that industry has altered (and will continue to alter) the way real estate works for good. But what specific changes have taken place? And how will we, as real estate professionals, respond to them?

{% include pullquote.html %}

**There are two main changes technology has introduced to our industry: big data and artificial intelligence (or AI).&nbsp;**

The truth is that these changes, in and of themselves, are not a bad thing. The best way to approach the increasing prevalence of technology in our industry is not to fight against it, but rather to embrace it. Make technology work for you—don’t work for technology.&nbsp;

When leveraged correctly, technology can make the lives of real estate professionals like us much easier. Automating certain aspects of the real estate experience **using technology may even allow us to spend more time doing what we do best: advising and guiding our clients.**&nbsp;

If you have any other questions about this, or about the real estate masterminds our team will be hosting in the near future, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
