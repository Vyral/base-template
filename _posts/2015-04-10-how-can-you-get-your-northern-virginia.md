Today we are excited to talk about getting your home ready for the market if you are a seller. You'll want to do several things right out of the starting gate.

Loudoun County, in Northern Virginia, is the fastest growing county in the nation. One of the first things a buyer in Loudoun County will do is visit the builders, who are the smartest sellers on the planet. They don't just build a beautiful home, but a home that has a decorator to design and furnish the home. That's the competition your are working against as a seller.

When you are preparing your home for sale, the main eye you have to please is the eye of the camera. Buyer activity has gone to the Internet, and people are looking at homes multiple times online before they ever decide to see it in person.

To prepare your home for the camera, you've got to declutter it. Keep in mind you are selling your space, not your stuff, and you want a buyer coming through your home imagining their stuff in your space.

Next, you'll want to talk to our professional stager. We have a company that can come in and give you a full staging report, letting you know what you need to do in each room to get your home ready for sale.

Another thing you'll want to do is try and gather the important documents from when you purchased the house, including a copy of the plat survey that was done on your home, and a copy of your title insurance policy.

These are just a few of the tips we recommend you take advantage of when getting your home ready to sell. If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us a quick email. We can't wait to hear from you!
