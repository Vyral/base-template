Often, agents will come to me saying that there aren’t any comps for a home.

What you need to realize is that **if there are no comps, then there is no sale.** A bank will not loan if they don’t have any comparable sales to look at because Wall Street wants to know what they’re investing in.

The harder it is to find comps for a home, the more your skill levels come into play. First, **try looking back in your market six months to a year.** Be sure to stay in the same geographical area and school system. The more unique a property is, the fewer restrictions there are on comps and the further back you can go.

In the end, there are always comps, and in the unlikely event that there aren’t any, you won’t be able to sell that home.
