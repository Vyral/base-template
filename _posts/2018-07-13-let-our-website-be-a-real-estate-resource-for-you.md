We want our website to serve as a key resource for all of your real estate needs. So today we would like to highlight and explain a few important features you’ll find when you visit our site. You can follow along in the video for a demonstration, or follow these steps by on your own.&nbsp;

Let’s start by covering how to sign up. **First, visit [www.globalrealtyservices.com](www.globalrealtyservices.com){: target="_blank"}.** Once your page loads, navigate your cursor to the person-shaped icon in the upper right-hand corner. Clicking on that icon will open a pop-up window with sign-up directions. If you have already signed up for an account with us, you may simply log in at this point. If not, feel free to enter your contact information to get the ball rolling.&nbsp;

There are many great reasons to sign up for our website, which will you see listed on the sign-up window. By signing up, **you will receive property email alerts, price change alerts, detailed property information, and more.** You will also be able to save property searches to view for later, view information about neighborhoods and schools, and track the status of your favorite properties. All of this and more will be available to you.

After signing up, be sure to check your email account for the automatic confirmation we will send you. This email will make sure that you account was created legitimately, and will contain the link you will need to follow to get started. After that, you are all set. The link will send you to your profile, where you can view your saved searches, favorite homes, and other information about your account. For future reference, the same person-shaped icon you clicked on to sign up will serve as the link to your account from now on. **You can click this icon to sign in, sign out, edit your account, and view your profile.&nbsp;**

At this point, you are ready to make a search. You can do this from the homepage of our website. This property search feature is updated every five minutes based on information from our MLS and contains every home listing available in our area. After you make your first search, we will save your preferences and show you results that match this criteria in the future.

We hope this has been helpful and that our website becomes a valuable resource in pursuing your real estate goals.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
