He’s also helping us buy our new house and he’s been fantastic there too. Just the whole process he went above and beyond. I know he worked really hard. The builders that we’re using to build our new house, in the beginning, were a little hard to work with and he definitely went above and beyond to make sure our interests came first and make sure that, I know he really had to fight hard for us on a few things that we needed to get from the builders. And I know Doug was working really hard and went way above and beyond working with the builders that we had to deal with."</span></span></i>
