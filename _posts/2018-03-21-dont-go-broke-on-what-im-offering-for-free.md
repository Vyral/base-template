Today, I’d like to let you know about the coaching meetup group we offer. It’s called the Central Valley Wealth Builders, and the purpose of this group is to teach regular people how to buy investment properties and create wealth.

One of my goals in life is to help 40 people become millionaires. The best way I can achieve this is by educating people and showing them that there is a path to wealth through creating investments. **Educating people through Central Valley Wealth Builders will help me meet my goal, but, more importantly, I hope it will help you meet your goal.&nbsp;**

It has always frustrated me to see people do big, splashy campaigns to convince other people that they need to sign up for expensive coaching programs. I’ve seen people lose all of their money getting coached on the very same things I’m teaching for free.&nbsp;

Our group meets once a month for dinner, drinks, and great conversation, and I sincerely hope you’ll join us. **This group is a free resource designed to help you reach your goals. &nbsp;**

We’re seeking anyone who’s ready to receive some great advice and work toward building wealth through investments. We kindly ask agents looking to expand their database to refrain from joining us. If you’re looking to sell something, this group is not for you. **The Central Valley Wealth Builders provides a space for people to learn, not for them to be sold to.&nbsp;**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
