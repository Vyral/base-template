Here are four surprising factors that can have a big impact on your home’s value:

**1. How close you are to a Starbucks.** According to a Zillow study, home prices increased overall by 65% from 1997 to 2014. During that same time period, though, homes located within a quarter mile of a Starbucks increased in value by 96%. Homes located near a Dunkin Donuts, however, only appreciated by 80%.&nbsp;

**2. Having a blue kitchen or bathroom.** Another study conducted by Zillow found that homes with blue kitchens sold for $1,800 more than those with white kitchens, and homes with pale-blue or periwinkle-blue bathrooms sold for $5,400 more than homes with different-colored bathrooms. In general, homes that are painted with light blue and light gray colors are perceived to be better maintained and, therefore, sell for more money.&nbsp;

**3. Trendy features.** Everybody knows that granite countertops and hardwood floors add value to a home, but other features like barn doors and farmhouse sinks go a long way in doing so as well.&nbsp;

**4. Proximity to cities.** More people are trending toward a lifestyle that focuses on walkability and being close to where they work, so the closer your home is to a city, the more valuable it is.&nbsp;
