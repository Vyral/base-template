Should you sell your home now or wait for the spring market if you're preparing to move? Today I'll explain why you should list now.

I recently received a great question from a viewer that I wanted to answer for everyone. She asked, "Should I list my home now during the winter months or should I wait until the spring?"

There are three reasons why I feel you should list now rather than waiting for the spring market:

**1. Less competition.** There are only about three months of inventory here in the Capital District, and this will make your home stand out more with the buyers out there. In the spring, you will compete against many more sellers.

**Buyers are really motivated right now.** The buyers who are out looking for homes in the cold and snow are not just kicking tires; they are highly motivated to buy a home for reasons like a job transfer or tax reasons. Additionally, interest rates just went up, so buyers want to get a deal done before they go up again.

**Your home looks great if it's tastefully decorated this time of year.** Buyers make emotional decisions when buying a home and you want them to feel comfortable in your home. Buyers want to be able to picture themselves in your warm, cozy home next year when they're celebrating the holidays with their family.
