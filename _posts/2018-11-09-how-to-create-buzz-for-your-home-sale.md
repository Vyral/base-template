Welcome back to part five of our six-part series on how to sell your home faster and for more money. **Today we’re talking about how to create a buzz around your home in advance of listing it.**

When we are getting ready to list a home, we take it through a two-week “Coming Soon” period. Not only do we put a “Coming Soon” sign in the yard, but we also get pictures, promotional materials, and social media posts together so that our clients can start sharing that information with their friends and family, and get those people to send it to their friends and family.

**The more you can help your real estate agent find those people who are willing to purchase your home, the easier it will be to sell.** If you can start creating that buzz early on, you will sell your home faster and for more money.

If you have any questions for me or have any real estate needs that I can assist with, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
