<center><em>Super Home Warranty is one of our most-trusted service providers. Here are a few different reasons why.</em></center>

&nbsp;

I recently caught up with Leslie Stotts from Super Home Warranty to talk about home warranties and their importance when buying a home. **We always try to make sure that we negotiate a home warranty for all of our buyers so that they have peace of mind when moving into their new homes**.

Who wants to spend $2,000 out of pocket after you just bought a home? No one. With a home warranty, you have the assurance that you won’t have to do that. You can live in your home and if something goes wrong, it’s covered under your warranty.

Super Home Warranty is actually able to get you a brand-new system if your heat or A/C goes out. Most home warranty companies prioritize repairs, but they are different than most companies in that sense.

**Another thing that makes them different is their dedication to customer service**. They make sure your calls are answered, your scheduling is done with high-quality service providers, and your claims are handled quickly.

Just like Uber came in and really upset the taxi industry, Super Home Warranty is doing the same for home warranties. I’ve had a lot of experience working with them over the years and can attest to this. In the past, we’ve worked with home warranty companies that were really slow and did shoddy work. With Super Home Warranty, these problems don’t exist. **They’re in constant communication with their high-quality service providers and they approve repairs on the spot**.

For all of these reasons, we only work with Leslie and Super Home Warranty when it comes to home warranties. If you want to get in contact with her and learn a little more about what Super Home Warranty can do for you, give her a call at (972) 655-8068. If you have any additional questions for me, you can always give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
