Today I want to talk to you about how we can assist you whether you're a Realtor, homeowner, renter, tenant, or investor. We get a lot of calls and emails asking questions like, “Is this a good house to buy?”&nbsp; “Will this cover my mortgage?” or “My tenants did X, so what can I do?”&nbsp; No question is a bad question. I've been in real estate since 2001, and there are still things that I come up against that I have to research or call an attorney for.

**After doing this for 13 years, we are experts in property management.** We know all about repairs, collecting rent, vetting tenants, and educating Realtors on the eviction process and other landlord- specific laws.

If you have any questions, give us a call at 808-445-9223 or send us an email at Duke@HiPacificPM.com. We would love to help you and answer any questions you may have.
