You’re hereby invited to our annual community appreciation event **at the Riverdog Stadium on June 7th at 7:05 p.m.**&nbsp;

This is a very special event in which we’ve teamed up with ServiceMaster Lawton Hayes to host it for the last three years. We’ll have drinks, food, and for every person who attends the game, I’ll donate $10 to the Burned Children’s Fund at MUSC.&nbsp;

This fund is truly amazing, and I know for a fact that all the money that was raised at this same event last year was used to install 3,000 smoke detectors into homes that needed them. Two different people have even confirmed for a fact that their lives were saved based on this event and everybody showing up and contributing.&nbsp;

The best part? It’s 100% free. **If you’re interested in attending, just reply back to our email and let me know how many ticket vouchers you need.&nbsp;**Look for me in front inside the Dave Friedman Team tent where you can exchange your vouchers for tickets.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this event, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to seeing you soon!
