For our fifth episode of Community Spotlight, we’re featuring True North Remodeling—a great local business that got its start just a year ago when co-founders Anthony Devita and Bruce Pugh partnered up after working together within a large corporate company. 

It was their goal to offer clients the perks of a corporate remodeling experience, like warranties, and combine them with the benefits only a small business can bring. **They put craftsmanship and customer service first**—just one look at their work makes this clear, as you can see in the before and after photos featured in the video above.

Better still, working with True North Remodeling is very affordable. They offer qualified clients zero money down and 0% financing for up to 18 months.
