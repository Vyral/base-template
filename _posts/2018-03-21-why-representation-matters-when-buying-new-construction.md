Today, we’re excited to be joined by special guest Steve Becht, the sales manager for CreekStone Homes, to talk about whether people need to work with an agent when buying a new home.&nbsp;

According to Steve, working with an agent when purchasing new construction isn’t a necessity, but it is highly preferable. **People on the build site are working on behalf of the builder.** If you aren’t working with an agent of your own when you purchase new construction, you aren’t being represented in the transaction.&nbsp;

Involving an agent will make the transaction move more quickly and more smoothly. Contrary to what some may think, **buyers do not get a better deal by forgoing representation and working directly with those who are representing the builder.&nbsp;**

In fact, the builder and the professionals who represent them tend to prefer working with buyers who are represented.&nbsp;
