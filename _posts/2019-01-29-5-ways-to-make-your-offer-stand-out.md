When it comes to being a buyer in a buyer’s market, there are a few things that will give you an edge among the competition. In fact, the winning offer in a multiple-offer situation is often less than list price, meaning there are many other ways you can ensure a sale outside of simply offering the most. **Here are five tips to help you compete during a buyer’s market:**

**1. Sell your home first.** Don’t buy a home before selling unless you can qualify for two mortgages. If you’re a first-time homebuyer, however, you’ll likely have an advantage over buyers who still have a home to sell.

**2. Play nice.** Don’t ask the seller for any personal items or expect them to cover any of your closing costs. You could even offer to pay costs that are customarily paid for by the seller, such as closing, transfer, and escrow fees.

**3. Find out what’s important to the seller.** Ask your agent to find out what the seller is truly looking for. See what it takes to seal the deal and then do it.

**4. Share the love.** Most sellers have an emotional attachment to their home and want to see it fall into the hands of an acceptable buyer. Become that buyer and write the seller a letter showing why you’d love to make their home yours.

**5. Prepare for a counter-offer.** You could write the best offer in the world, but a competent listing agent often tells their sellers to counter all offers.
