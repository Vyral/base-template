One of the things that we at The REllis Group do as a team is, every single quarter, we pick a book that makes a big impact—something we’ve read or heard about from someone else that impacts us personally or our business.

**Today, I want to recommend three books that I’ve read that I believe will really impact your business as well.**If you don’t have a copy of one of these books, feel free to come grab one from our office, on us.

**The first book is called “The Go-Giver” by Bob Burg**, which talks about the five principles of a giving attitude. It’s an easy read—I actually read it in a night, but it’s a very good read that discusses how focusing on giving, rather than taking and trying to see what you can gain from a certain situation, can really impact someone’s life and your business.

The second book that I’ve passed along to other agents is **“The Millionaire Real Estate Investor.”** Having that investment mindset is really critical to being a great agent, in my opinion. We sell a lot of multi-family investments, work with flippers, and all types of people. We also like to work with clients that have a little bit of financial sense—after they buy properties and make repairs, we help them prepare for the future by looking at trends from the past couple years.

“The Millionaire Real Estate Investor” has profiles of people from across the country who have really successful businesses. One of these is Vena Jones-Cox, who hosts a real estate meet-up once a month called COREE, or Central Ohio Real Estate Entrepreneurs, which many of our agents attend. It was great to see her in person and learn more about how she’s built a successful business.

**The final book I recommend is Grant Cardone’s “10X.”** It’s a simple message about doing 10 times the amount of what you’re expected. Why make five calls when I could make 50? Why sell three houses this month when I could sell 30? Obviously, I probably won’t sell 30 houses, but the point is to ask ourselves how we can focus on activities that are going to produce more— how can we get more out of our efforts?

These three books have made a really big impact on myself, my team, and my business. If you need a copy, please reach out to us and we’d be happy to lend you one.
