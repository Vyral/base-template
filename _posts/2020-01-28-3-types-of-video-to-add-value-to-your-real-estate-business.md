{% include youtube.html %} Today I’m going to talk about&nbsp;**three videos that you need to make for your real estate business right now.**

A lot of times I am asked about where to get started. To be honest, video has really changed my business and my life. Simply by being a real person, people will trust you, like you, and use you to help them with their real estate needs.

**The first video I ever made was a pre-listing video.**&nbsp;I find value in sending a video in advance before I get to the property; this way, the clients recognize me when I get to the door and they know what to expect. In the video, I just tell them about how I look forward to meeting them, what our objectives will be for our time together, as well as some links for them to review.

{% include pullquote.html %}&nbsp;**Another video to make in advance is one geared towards buyers.&nbsp;**Do the same thing as the first video I mentioned, only make this one like a buyer consultation. Let them know that you are excited about meeting with them and give them some links to materials to get started. Mention the importance of pre-approval, if they are obtaining a mortgage, downloading your apps, and anything else they can do before your in-person consultation.

Finally,&nbsp;**the third video to make can be used for buyers, sellers, and the general public.**&nbsp;Talk about your value proposition—are you on a team or are you a single agent? How will you best serve them in their real estate ventures?

You can make these videos cheaply, even on your phone, upload them to YouTube, and share them on social media. If you really want to get fancy, you can later enlist the services of companies to help you edit them, but&nbsp;**do not let the editing and details bog you down.**

I can share my videos with you so that you will have an idea of what to do. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I would love to help you.
