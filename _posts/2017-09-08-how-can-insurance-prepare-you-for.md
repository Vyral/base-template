</i><div style="text-align: left;">In light of the recent natural disasters in our country, I wanted to talk today about how you can be prepared for these kinds of happenings.<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">To help me cover this subject, I recently met with Zachary Schneiderman of Schneiderman Insurance. Having insurance coverage is just one of the many ways you can prepare for potential disasters.<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">Something Zachary suggests to everyone is to ask for an annual review. To do this, call your insurance agent and make sure that your home is insured to its current replacement value. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">This is especially important given the fact that a study recently revealed a high percentage of homes to be uninsured based on their current replacement values.<div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">Make sure you are properly insuring your home and its contents. <div style="text-align: left;">If you are underinsured by over 20%, **certain insurance policies will carry clauses stating that they may only insure you for a percentage of the loss.**<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">Making sure you are properly insuring your home and its contents is critical. Its also always a good idea to review your other insurance policies, as well. It is much better to be safe than sorry. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">Even small, preventative measures can make a big difference. For example, you should absolutely save your insurance agents number into your phone. Also, store your policy number somewhere that is easily accessible. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">**Being able to contact your agent at a moments notice will become greatly helpful in the event of an emergency.** However, remember to talk to your agent before filing a claim. An insurance agent will help you determine whether the claim is appropriate to file. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: left;">If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon. ny other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
