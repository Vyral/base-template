In light of the recent natural disasters that have been happening around our country, I want to talk today about the importance of being properly insured.

In light of the recent natural disasters in our country, I wanted to talk today about how you can be prepared for these kinds of happenings.

To help me cover this subject, I recently met with Zachary Schneiderman of Schneiderman Insurance. Having insurance coverage is just one of the many ways you can prepare for potential disasters.

Something Zachary suggests to everyone is to ask for an annual review. To do this, call your insurance agent and make sure that your home is insured to its current replacement value.

This is especially important given the fact that a study recently revealed a high percentage of homes to be uninsured based on their current replacement values.

If you are underinsured by over 20%, **certain insurance policies will carry clauses stating that they may only insure you for a percentage of the loss.**

Making sure you are properly insuring your home and its contents is critical. It’s also always a good idea to review your other insurance policies, as well. It is much better to be safe than sorry.

Even small, preventative measures can make a big difference. For example, you should absolutely save your insurance agent’s number into your phone. Also, store your policy number somewhere that is easily accessible.

**Being able to contact your agent at a moment’s notice will become greatly helpful in the event of an emergency.** However, remember to talk to your agent before filing a claim. An insurance agent will help you determine whether the claim is appropriate to file.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
