**You've got questions; we've got answers.**

Why would we need a letter from someone who’s not on the loan documenting access to an account?

Consider this example: A husband and wife have a joint account, but the wife is the only person on the mortgage. There can be a lot of reasons why this may happen—maybe only she has an income, he has bad credit, etc.

When we don't have both account owners on the loan, however, the account owner must give the other person access to those funds. **We will need an access letter to do this.**

If you have any other questions, please contact us. We look forward to speaking with you.
