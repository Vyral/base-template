During this confusing time, there are many questions being asked about jobs and income. How do you continue a successful real estate business when the world looks completely different than it did 3 weeks ago? How do you adapt to the current state of your community when it changes daily? Here is a list of tips to keep your business running:&nbsp;

<br>**Scripting:** Change your script when you call leads, but donâ€™t stop calling\!

**Technology:** Utilize available technology, such as Zoom for virtual meetings, and WhatsApp to stay in contact with clients and fellow agents in your office.

**Culture:** Promote the same culture that is usually in your offices by conducting virtual hangouts, happy hours, lunch and learns and check-in on each other.

**Contracts:** Aim for extending contracts, instead of releasing them.&nbsp;

**Showings:** Explore walk-through videos, 3D Tours, or solo showings via Facetime and Skype with your clients.

**Webinars:** Offer Home Buyer and Seller Seminars online via zoom webinars.
