The Clarksville market is heating up and it’s as busy as ever. Each time I look, the inventory goes down and the market gets busier. As of March 27, there were 844 houses for sale on the market.

**I’ve been working in Clarksville real estate since 1992, and that’s the lowest level of inventory we’ve ever had.**&nbsp;The amount of available listings is down from 1,135 at this time last year. That’s a 25% drop! This means we are in a true seller’s market right now.

As far as closed home sales go, we're up almost 10% from this time last year. We closed 857 last March and 942 this March.

**The average list price in Clarksville right now is $186,000.** This is up 7% from the $173,000 average that we saw last year. We can list a house for anything, but what did it really sell for? **The average sale price is up to $184,000** from $171,000 last year. We had a flat market for a long time, but since December 2015, our market has been creeping up to where it is now.

The average days on market has dropped about 24% to just 54 days. Anything listed under $100,000 is selling extremely quickly, but the hottest market is actually between $100,000 and $240,000. If your home is in immaculate condition and priced right, it will sell quickly and for a great price.

If you have any questions for me about the market or have any questions about buying or selling a home in Clarksville, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
