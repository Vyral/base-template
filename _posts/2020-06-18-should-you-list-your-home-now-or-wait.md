Homes are still selling, and here’s a story to illustrate how it’s done.

I’ve been getting many questions lately about how our current market is doing. One question some people have is whether they should list their home now or wait until the coronavirus eases further.&nbsp;

One client who asked this recently had a vacant house in Arrowhead Lakes. **We got together on a Zoom call and discussed the current market,** I showed them a market analysis of their property, answered all their questions, showed them examples of our video walk-through tours, and more. They decided to list the home, and the price was set at $675,000. By the time it came on the market, some restrictions had been lifted and we were able to host a real open house. Everyone had gloves and masks, the real estate agent in charge used Clorox wipes, and all the doors were left open so buyers didn’t need to touch anything.

One of the buyers that came through the house fell in love with it, wrote a full price offer, and we’re currently in escrow. This property was actually listed with another agent before us, but they weren’t using all the marketing we are, and the sellers had to take it off the market. **We used a 3D Matterport video tour and professional photography,** and it only needed one open house. Then, with us, the home sold for full price.

This is just one example of how the market is moving; the pandemic has slowed the market a little, but houses are still selling.

If you would like more information or have questions about listing your property for sale, please feel free to give us a call or send an email. We’d be happy to help you.
