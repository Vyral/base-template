A couple of weeks ago, I was presented with an investment opportunity when my neighbor informed me that they were putting their property up for sale. Around the same time, I was alerted to an investment opportunity of a very different stroke. Believe it or not, I soon found myself asking these questions: Do I invest in real estate or Bitcoin? Or do I invest in both? Now, I’m not a financial advisor, but today I want to walk you through my decision-making process, sharing the pros and cons of each investment along the way.&nbsp;
