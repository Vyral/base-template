We recently discussed automatic features that can help your employees create a paycheck for life. I’ve given you the first four elements of courageous plan design. In case you forgot, they are:

Automatic enrollment

Automatic escalation of the deferrals

Automatic investment into the qualified default investment alternative

Automatic re-enrollment of both the investments and those not contributing

The fifth element to courageous plan design and the topic for today is called the stretch match. **There are two main benefits:**

**1. It gives your employees the opportunity to save more now.** We know that gives them the opportunity to get to that retirement bullseye sooner and they can retire on time with a paycheck for life.

<br>**2. It helps your highly-paid employees contribute more in a non-safe harbor plan.** If your employees are able to contribute more because they see you contributing more, they will be very happy.

What is the stretch match concept? Let’s say you match 50% of the first 4%. You simply stretch it out and match 25% of the first 8%. Your employees are smart and will take advantage of other people’s money. A lot of them will look to increase their contribution right to 8%.

This is just one element of courageous plan design but a very important one, especially if you don’t have a safe harbor plan. If you have any questions about this topic or would like a courageous plan design created for you, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
