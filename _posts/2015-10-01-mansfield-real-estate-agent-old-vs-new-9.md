Today, we'll talk about the importance of the age of your home when buying. You may not want an older home because you are looking for a newer neighborhood, or you may prefer an older neighborhood with mature trees. Older homes also have different character than newer homes.

First, you need to know that the age of the home doesn't affect its appreciation. You may find a neighborhood that is depreciating rapidly, but those neighborhoods are far and few between.

Next, any home you buy, you can upgrade. You may need to make changes for energy efficiency, layout, or other updates. I have seen older homes updated with new windows or roofs to make them more energy efficient. Sometimes making these upgrades yourself makes your property more energy efficient than new construction homes.

Regardless of the age of the home, you need to get an inspection. The inspector will be able to tell you about all the idiosyncrasies in the home so you have a clear idea of what's going on with the house from the foundation to the roof.

My appeal to you is to go with what suits your personality. Don't let the fact that a home is 50 years old keep you from buying it. The neighborhood should play a bigger factor in your decision than the age of the home.
