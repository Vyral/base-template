I’m here with Jen Denton, the owner of Buda MedSpa, to explore everything this great local business has to offer.

Buda MedSpa is located on South Main Street in a great old house full of character. The spa offers a wide array of services. **There are actually three different practices under one roof.&nbsp;**

The first is Jen Denton Aesthetics, which focuses on skincare and wellness. You can get anything from facials to medical aesthetics, which includes things like Botox, injectables, dermal fillers, and chemical peels.&nbsp;

The Buda MedSpa is also home to Michael Meuth, a holistic healthcare provider who provides acupuncture, herbal medicine, and more.&nbsp;

Finally, Cathy Jenray is a therapeutic masseuse who offers a more medical massage.&nbsp;

Jen’s favorite things to do are brow shaping and dermal fillers, which is actually sculpting faces. Those are also some of the most popular services at the MedSpa.

**If you haven’t been to the MedSpa yet, there are a few specials you can try out this March.&nbsp;**

For example, there are a couple different exfoliation treatment specials. There is a medical-grade chemical peel called the VI Peel that is normally $275. This month, you can get a VI Peel for $190. The VI Peel is an excellent peel that corrects photodamage and sunspots.&nbsp;

Britney, their junior aesthetician, is offering a combo treatment with dermaplaning and a superficial lactic acid peel. Normally, this combination is $155; in March, it is only $125.&nbsp;

In addition to that, all of their Glow Mineral makeup will be 15% off.&nbsp;

If you haven’t been to the Buda MedSpa yet, now is a great time to take advantage of these specials and check it out. You can visit **[BudaMedSpa.com](http://budamedspa.com)**or call (512) 295-3000 for more information.&nbsp;

I’d like to thank Jen for taking the time to talk to us today. As always, if you have any real estate questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would be happy to help you!
