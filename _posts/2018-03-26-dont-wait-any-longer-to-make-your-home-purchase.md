One thing people always ask is, “How’s the market doing?” Today, we’ll be bringing you the answer by taking a look at a few year-over-year statistics.

In February of 2017, 955 homes sold in Benton County for an average sale price of $217,000. This February, 988 homes were sold at an average sale price of $231,000.

This means there has been a 6.4% increase in price. In other words, b**uyers who waited until this year to make their purchase instead of taking the plunge last year ended up paying 6.4% more.**

Also, interest rates right now are at an average of around 4.4% and they’re only going up. If you’re thinking of buying this year it’s time to get off the fence while the market is hot. Now is the time to make your home purchase in Benton County.
