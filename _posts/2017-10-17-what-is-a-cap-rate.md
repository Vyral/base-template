If you’re a real estate investor or thinking about becoming one, your cap rate is one of the most important things to know about. **To help explain what a cap rate is and how it’s calculated, I want to give you a quick example w**ith some real numbers.

For example, let’s say you have an eight-family unit that is generating $6,400 per month in rent. That equals out to $76,800 per year. Now, let’s suppose that you have $21,800 in yearly expenses. These include things like lawn maintenance, snow removal, or a property management company.

Based on those numbers, your annual net profit for this property would be around $55,000. **If the asking price for the property is $550,000, that would give you a 10% market cap rate.** To get the market cap rate, you simply divide the net profit by the asking price. Typically, we like to see the rates closer to 12% or 15%, but anything above 10% is good.

You may be thinking, “What about the mortgage and down payment? Do I factor those in as well?” The answer is yes, but you typically want to keep your buyer expenses and business expenses separate.

This is a good strategy to apply to any size of property. If you have any questions for us about real estate investing, market cap rates, or anything else, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
