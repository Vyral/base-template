If you’ve been driving down the highway or listened to the radio recently, you have probably seen a few repeated real estate buzzwords like “iBuyer” or “Guaranteed Offer” or “How to Net More With X Agent.”

**There’s a ton of noise out there in the market, but what can you believe and trust?** I think it’s important to give agents like us a call. We can help you cut through this noise and figure out what’s behind these specific buzzwords and promises. Those signs are good marketing, but it takes a true professional to give you the honest truth.

**The key is to look at things from a local perspective.** A lot of these messages are very broad, but an agent who knows the local market where your home is will be an invaluable tool throughout the process.

If you have any questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
