In today’s episode of “Community Spotlight,” I’m sitting down to speak with Evan Brown, the owner of the new restaurant State Fare.

Open from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. from Monday to Sunday here in Catonsville at 748 Frederick Road, **State Fare serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner from a menu featuring classic pub fare and All-American comfort food.** Their high-class bar also serves a variety of cocktails and has an extensive bourbon and wine collection.

“We basically envision people coming in here, sharing a bunch of plates, having a couple drinks, sitting down and having dinner—a real nice community vibe,” Evan says.

Additionally, State Fare offers carryout service, which you can order during any meal period, and after 10 p.m., they specialize in classic late-night fare like pizza, french fries, etc. **For more information about State Fare, including their location, hours, and menu, visit their website [www.statefaremd.com](https://www.statefaremd.com/){: target="_blank"}.**

As always, if you have a local business or organization you want to see featured in a future episode of “Community Spotlight,” don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you!
