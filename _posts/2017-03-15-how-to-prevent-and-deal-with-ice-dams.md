Today I’d like to talk about a common winter problem homeowners in our area have to face from time to time: ice dams.

An ice dam occurs when you’ve got a lot of snow on your roof and your attic is just warm enough to melt some snow, causing it to run down the roof until it gets to the colder parts and freezes. That water backs up the shingles and will eventually start coming in underneath through the roof.

The vent on our roof is snowed over, so the heat isn’t escaping out the top. One of the ways to prevent that is installing heat tape in the summer so it’s ready for the winter. Shoveling the roof off is also an option, but it is dangerous. A roofing company would be able to do it for you without damaging the roof. Also, if you google “roof rake” or “roof snow rake,” there are a lot of products out there that will help get the snow off your roof.

It’s not too late to get that taken care of, and you’ll want to make sure another snow storm doesn’t add to the problem.
