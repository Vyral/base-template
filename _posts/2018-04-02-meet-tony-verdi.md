**WHY I DO WHAT I DO, EVERY DAY…**<br>I’m a proud father of 5 children and I know how meaningful and fulfilling it is to own a home. That’s why I devote myself as a full-time Broker-Associate to helping people achieve their real estate dreams.

In case you want to know about my background, I grew up in East Greenwich, RI and started in sales at the age of 14, helping my dad (Tony, Sr.) in the family business, Coastal Food Service, Inc., located in Providence and Cranston. After graduating from Boston University in 1992, I joined my father and brother, Chad, at Coastal. In 2004 I branched off to own and operate Thorpes and Verdi (originally called Thorpes The Place For Gifts) in East Greenwich. Bottom line to all of this, being a business owner for over 25 years–mastering skills in communication, negotiating and marketing–prepared me to achieve the most personal satisfaction and success in my career as a Realtor&reg;.
