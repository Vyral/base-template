**WHY I DO WHAT I DO, EVERY DAY…**<br>I’m a proud father of 5 children and I know how meaningful and fulfilling it is to own a home. That’s why I devote myself as a full-time Broker-Associate to helping people achieve their real estate dreams.

In case you want to know about my background, I grew up in East Greenwich, RI and started in sales at the age of 14, helping my dad (Tony, Sr.) in the family business, Coastal Food Service, Inc., located in Providence and Cranston. After graduating from Boston University in 1992, I joined my father and brother, Chad, at Coastal. In 2004 I branched off to own and operate Thorpes and Verdi (originally called Thorpes The Place For Gifts) in East Greenwich. Bottom line to all of this, being a business owner for over 25 years–mastering skills in communication, negotiating and marketing–prepared me to achieve the most personal satisfaction and success in my career as a Realtor®.

**COMMUNITY GIVING, AWARDS, ASSOCIATIONS & DESIGNATIONS…**<br>• In 2018, I will donate a portion of my net commission from each transaction to The Tomorrow Fund for children with cancer at the Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Providence. Your trust in me provides a brighter tomorrow for children with cancer and their families. www.tomorrowfund.org<br>• 2017 Gold Circle of Sales Excellence Award by Greater Providence Board of Realtors®<br>• Member: National Association of Realtors®, RI Association of Realtors® and Greater Providence Board of Realtors®. Zillow Premier Agent. BBB Accredited Business.<br>• Designations: ABR, Accredited Buyer Representative. SRES, Seniors Real Estate Specialist. PSA, Pricing Strategy Advisor.
