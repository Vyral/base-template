Up until recently, it has been an extreme seller’s market due to the lack of inventory coming out of the Great Recession. **Sam Simon joins me today so that we can discuss the fact that the local and national markets are changing.**

Sam sees the market shifting as an opportunity. Because she comes from an investor background, when she sees a shift in the market, that poses an opportunity for both buyers and sellers. When more inventory enters the market, prices typically come down, which makes Sam excited for the investors she’s working with. It’s a chance to push the prices down and help get them great deals for their investments.

Sam speaks from experience when it comes to investing. **Over a seven-year period, she bought, fixed up, and sold 40 properties.** She sees past the minor flaws a property has and turns it into an opportunity to “give love to the neighborhood,” which is what she calls flipping.

How much of an opportunity a property presents depends on who she’s representing. A family who is looking for turnkey properties might not be as excited about a home that needs moderate to major renovation, so it does take some consideration of the client’s needs.

Sam joined Keller Williams because of the resources we have that help her analyze investments differently: our team of supportive agents, as well as our seminars, classes, books, and other materials that helped educate her on the other aspects of being an agent besides investing. **One book in particular stuck out to her—“The Millionaire Real Estate Investor” by Gary Keller.** It’s a comprehensive guide on how to work with investors
