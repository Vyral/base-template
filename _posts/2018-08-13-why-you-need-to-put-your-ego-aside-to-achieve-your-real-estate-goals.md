Does your personality get in the way of achieving your goal?

Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, I have noticed a trend lately of people wanting to “win” their transaction instead of achieve their ultimate goal.&nbsp;

I’m a stock investor, and the other day I was reading a book about investing where the author made an interesting point. He said there is a buyer and a seller in every transaction (just as in real estate). If you’re selling, somebody’s buying, and there is a loser in that transaction—somebody’s wrong. The stock will either go up or down. No one knows which way it will go, but someone’s betting wrong.&nbsp;

The author is right in an absolute sense, but he fails to take into consideration the motivations of the buyer and the seller. The buyer is buying for a reason, and so is the seller. For example, perhaps the seller is retiring somewhere or building their dream home and don’t care whether the stock goes up or down after the deal’s done. They’re taking that money out in order to reach their ultimate goal.&nbsp;

The same logic applies to real estate—**buyers and sellers have different motivations.** I have seller clients who want to downsize from a single-family home into a townhouse, but it still all boils down to “winning” for them. They still only think about getting the best price possible.

My wife and I bought our current house 17 years ago for $3,000 over its list price. At the time, everyone told me I was nuts. Now, that home’s doubled in value. Does that $3,000 still matter? Not to me.&nbsp;

**Whether you’re buying or selling, focus on the reason you’re doing so.** Put your ego aside and don’t worry about “crushing” the other party. I know life is stressful, but I’ve seen so many people put their lives on hold because they want to beat the buyer or seller and save an extra $1,000.&nbsp;

It’s a great time to be in the market, which means it’s a great time to achieve your ultimate goal. If you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give me a call. My team and I would love to help you.
