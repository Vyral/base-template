Does your personality get in the way of achieving your goal?

I have noticed a trend lately of people wanting to “win” their transaction instead of achieving their ultimate goal.&nbsp;

And this fact is true in transactions outside of real estate, as well. The other day while reading a book about stock investing, I came across an interesting point on this subject. The author stated that because **there are two sides to every transaction (a buyer and a seller), someone will always come out on top.** Yet this assessment fails to take into account that the buyer and seller each have individual motivations. 

Still, buyers and sellers can sometimes lose sight of their goals, and, instead, begin focusing on the idea of "winning." For example, I've worked with seller clients who want to downsize, but become too wrapped up in earning the best price and coming out on top to reach their original goal.

My wife and I bought our current house 17 years ago for $3,000 over its list price. At the time, everyone told me I was nuts. Now, that home has doubled in value. Does that $3,000 still matter? Not to me.&nbsp;

**Whether you’re buying or selling, focus on the reason you’re doing so.** Put your ego aside and don’t worry about “crushing” the other party. I’ve seen so many people put their lives on hold because they want to beat the buyer or seller and save an extra $1,000.&nbsp;

It’s a great time to be in the market, which means it’s a great time to achieve your ultimate goal. If you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give me a call. My team and I would love to help you.
