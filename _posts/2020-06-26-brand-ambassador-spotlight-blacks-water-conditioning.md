Jason from Black’s Water Conditioning joins me to talk about their company.

For today’s Brand Ambassador message, I sat down with my friend Jason for some Q & A about his family business, Black’s Water Conditioning, Inc. here in South Central Pennsylvania.

**“How did you get into the water business?”**

Jason is the third generation in his family to get involved in the water conditioning business. His grandfather was a farmer who found himself in a positive where he had some free time and a need for water treatment equipment. The process intrigued him, and the technician he worked with agreed to show him the ropes. 50 years later, the business is still going.&nbsp;

**“What is the main service or product sold at Black’s Water Conditioning?”**

Water softeners are the first thing people think of when they think of water conditioning and treatment, so Black’s naturally sells a lot of those. They also sell ultraviolet lights to disinfect drinking water and reverse osmosis.

**“Who are your core customers?”**

Black’s serves anyone who wants good, quality water in the South Central Pennsylvania area\!

**“What is the No. 1 question you hear most often?”**

Black’s customers most often ask about the white or orange stains their untreated water leaves on dishes, clothes, bathtubs, etc. They know they have a problem, but they don’t understand the root cause of it.

**“What’s the best way to get in touch with Black’s Water Conditioning?”**

If you have a water treatment issue in need of solving, you can call Black’s at (717) 486-5033 or visit [www.BlacksWater.com](http://www.blackswater.com).

**“Are there any deals or incentives of which the audience should take advantage?”**

Black’s always offers free consultations, and if it’s determined that you need to have a technician come out, they’ll be happy to send someone to help you figure out what’s causing your issues and what can be done about it.

Don’t hesitate to reach out to them for any of your water treatment needs\! In the meantime, if you have any questions or recommendations for businesses you think would benefit from our Brand Ambassador spotlight videos, give us a call\!
