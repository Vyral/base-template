When you sell your home, following these three steps will help you net the most money possible.
 1. **Staging.** The National Association of Realtors has statistically proven that homes that are staged and displayed with great photography (and video) net up to 6% more than houses that aren't.

2. **Mega open houses.** This is something I share with sellers in our very first consultation. Any buyer who is serious about buying your house will take three showings. The first is typically online (remember, amazing photos and videos are important!) and the second typically happens when a buyer drives around the neighborhood to see if it's one they'd want their family to live in. Can their kids go play at the park? Is this where they'd like to go buy groceries? The third and final showing for motivated buyers is the “mega open house” when they come visit it in person. We hold these mega open houses for all of our sellers, and they are a giant party! We have food, champagne, wine, and beer, and we make it a great experience. Motivated buyers will possibly look at four to eight houses in a given weekend, so we want to be the house that sticks out in their mind.

3. **Inspections.** When a buyer looks at a home, they like to know that all the little issues have been addressed up front. As a seller, we ideally like to have inspections up front, like the property inspection, termite inspection, and a chimney or pool inspection if the home has them.

If you have any questions about this topic or you're thinking of buying or selling a home here in Bay Area, give me a call or send me an email. I'd be happy to help you out!
