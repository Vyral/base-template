How should buyers deal with multiple-offer situations to get theirs accepted? Here are a couple tips and tricks that I use:

**1. Go in with high option money.**This will show the sellers that you’re serious about the deal.

**2. Accept the house as-is.**This can be risky, but it will be an attractive option to sellers.

**3. Don’t ask for closing costs to paid for by the seller.**This will make yours a very competitive offer in the seller’s eyes.

My final thought on multiple offers is that while you’re going in with the understanding that you might not have yours accepted, you also need to look at the home. Sometimes you might wind up paying a little too much for that property, just out of the desire to lock down that home.

If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me. I’d be happy to help.
