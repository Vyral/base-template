Today, we want to invite you to a fun event.&nbsp;

Mark your calendars for **Saturday, April 21 for our Paper-Shredding and E-Waste Event.** If you have boxes of files to shred or old electronics to get rid of, bring them by. We will pay for the shredder and the E-waste company.&nbsp;

All you have to do is stop by La Salle High School (3880 E Sierra Madre Blvd). We’ll be in the upper parking lot from 9 a.m. to noon.&nbsp;

Hundreds of past clients come out for this event, and it’s always a lot of fun. If you could benefit from it, bring all your junk and drop it off. **We’ll take care of it.** We’ll also have some food available.&nbsp;

Just so you have an idea, here are a few examples of things you can bring:&nbsp;

* Computers
* Audio equipment&nbsp;
* Household appliances
* Old TVs
* Printers&nbsp;

And, just to be on the safe side, here are a few things NOT to bring:&nbsp;

* Household chemicals
* Batteries&nbsp;
* Old paint cans&nbsp;
* Syringes&nbsp;

If you have any junk (that’s allowable), make sure you bring it on by on April 21. We look forward to seeing you there.&nbsp;

Please don’t hesitate to reach out to us with any questions in the meantime!&nbsp;
