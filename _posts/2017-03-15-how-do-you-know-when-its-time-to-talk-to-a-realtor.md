If you want to sell your house, when should you contact a real estate agent?

As soon as possible!

Even if you're nine months out from selling your house, you want to contact a professional Realtor like myself as soon as possible. **We can come to your home and tell you what needs to be updated, what you should keep in the house, and the things you should take out of the house to prepare it for the market.** This will help you get the most money you can from your home sale.

The other reason to contact a Realtor early is that we want to keep the buyers in mind.

How will buyers look at your house? We know that 96% of all buyers look at homes online in the convenience of their own home or office to decide what they want to go see in person. Your home's online presence will determine whether a buyer wants to come see it in person. We want to come up with a list of things we can do to make your house look as perfect as possible on the Internet.

Both your goal and our goal is the sameâ€”to get the most money possible for your house, and this list will help you do just that. If you've lived in the house for 35 years, this could take some time, so you want to reach out to us as soon as you know you are selling your home. It'll maximize your sale and minimize the time and money you put into the house in order to sell it.

<br>If you have any questions for me or you're ready to speak with a Realtor about selling your house, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
