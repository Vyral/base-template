We just wanted to stop by today to give you a quick recap on the year and extend to you our warmest holiday greetings. First, some great news about the market.

**In the upper price ranges especially, our market is greatly improving.** Right now, we have 279 pending transactions. For this time of year, thatâ€™s an outstanding number.

It looks like we will have an early and strong start in January. For those of you itching to get going on a new home, our spring market starts January 2nd. If you have any questions or if there is anything we can help you with over the holidays, let us know.

**2016 was great, but we expect 2017 to be even better.** Thanks to all of you who helped out our business this year. We are always here for you, just give us a call or send us an email.
