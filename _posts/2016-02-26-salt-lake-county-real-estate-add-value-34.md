When you’re choosing what home improvements to invest in, it’s important to know what types of improvement will bring you the highest value. Here are the five safest bets when it comes to making worthwhile improvements.

1. Kitchen. This is the center of attention in any house and is the most looked at online. It’s the one room that will largely determine if online buyers will come take a look at your home. To make sure your kitchen looks great, make sure you have matching appliances and fixtures. Also make sure the cabinets are in great shape. 
1. Bathroom. Look at the small things first. Buy a brand new toilet seat and ensure that the sink looks great. Bathrooms also need storage space, so consider adding cabinets if you can!
1. Exterior. This is always the first thing people look at when deciding whether to buy a home. Remember, the front door is the first impression a buyer has of your home, so you should repaint or restain it if necessary.
1. Roof. Make sure that the roof is leak-free and in great shape. If you wait for the buyer’s inspector to find a problem with your roof, it could cost you a whole lot of money!
1. Landscaping. Make sure your grass and landscaping is in good condition and well-maintained. If you can, add some plants and trees to your yard to make it even more appealing to buyers.

These five tips should help you add value to your home! If you would like additional advice, feel free to reach out to us at any time. We’re always available to assist you!
