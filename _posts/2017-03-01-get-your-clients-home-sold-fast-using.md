Now that warmer weather is fast approaching, you’re probably anxious to start listing homes for your spring clients. Luckily, I have two tips to share with you today that will reduce your days on  market.

Suggest that your client get two reports that are really going to help you narrow down the pricing and expedite the sale: a home inspection and an appraisal.

Your client is probably going to tell you that they’ve maintained their property beautifully. However, you need to know what’s behind the walls and how the roof is looking, not to mention making sure all the major systems like the A/C unit and furnace are working. Any issues with the home are going to come up during the buyer’s due diligence period anyway, so the seller might as well get out in front of that. Having that information will also help you price the home accordingly.

Along with the home inspection, make sure your clients go ahead and do a radon inspection as well. Most home inspectors have an add-on which isn’t that expensive, and it’s important to many buyers that the radon inspection is done.

The appraisal is going to be the best tool you can use for pricing the home. Prices have increased fairly quickly in the last month, so keep in mind that the appraisal might be a bit off as they haven't caught up yet. You can factor in a little bit for appreciation and take a good look at what’s been happening in the neighborhood to come to a fair market price.

If you have any other questions about pricing a home for a quick sale or if you are curious about other real estate topics, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
