Can you still sell a house during the holidays? You absolutely can. Allow me to explain why this time of year is actually a great time to sell your house.

Is it a good idea to list your home for sale during the holidays?

We sell homes 12 months out of the year, so I can personally say that selling your home during November or December is a great idea. If now is the time for you to put your home on the market, we can absolutely sell it during these months.

Of course, the holidays bring many celebrations and visits from friends and family. These types of things can make selling a house difficult. If you want to sell your home, but you think it's difficult because of the guests and celebrations, we want to meet and get everything set up so that we can 'pre-list' your house.

That means **we'll get everything set up, signed, and agreed on.** We want everything in the home ready for the photographer to shoot pictures; that way, we're ready to go live with your listing right after the first of the year.

You have two choices: you can sell right away if you don't think your guests and family traditions will hinder the sale, or we can pre-list you and wait for the beginning of 2017. We just had a listing last year with a client who listed on December 1st, and the house went under contract by the middle of December. It really works!

If you have any other questions about selling this time of year, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I'd be happy to answer any questions you have!
