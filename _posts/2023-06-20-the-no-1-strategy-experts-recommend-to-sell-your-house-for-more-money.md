Why does staging your home matter when selling? **Simply put, it makes your home look better.** Decluttering and preparing your home allows buyers to envision themselves living in your house.&nbsp;

One time, I had a client who was reluctant to stage his home, but I was fortunately able to talk him into it. He ended up receiving $15,000 above typical market value for his area, and he was incredibly happy about his results.&nbsp;

At the end of the day, **staging leads to a smoother selling process and more money in your pocket.** Call or email us if you have questions about staging or anything else. We’re always willing to help!
