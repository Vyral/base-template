What does all of this mean? **There aren’t enough homes for sale, so prices continue to rise and the average days on market continues to drop.** Until we see more inventory, things will stay this way. One significant change to mention is that the financial markets are going crazy due to the coronavirus. Treasury bills are way down, and mortgage rates are loosely tied to them. The morning I recorded this video, I spoke to a lending professional who told me buyers were locking in rates right around 3%.&nbsp;

If you’re a homeowner with a mortgage rate over 3.5%, you should refinance. If you’re a buyer, now’s the time to buy, because your buying power just got much stronger. Just a quarter of a percentage point in an interest rate is worth about 10% of your buying power. Basically, it's the difference between being able to afford a $200,000 house and a $220,000 house.&nbsp;
