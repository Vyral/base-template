**The main pro to having your home or property in a trust is avoiding probate.** Probate is very expensive, and it typically takes 10 months to a year. It cost 4% of the first $100,000 and 3% of the next $100,000. It then costs 2% of the next $800,000.

Something important to know is that real estate is valued at its fair market value. So, if you have a $1 million house with a $900,000 mortgage, you don’t have a $100,000 probate, you have a $1 million probate. **So, if you want your loved ones to inherit the house instead of having to sell it, it’s best to do a trust.**

**The con to having your home or property in a trust is that is does cost a little bit.** Always avoid Internet bargains because you could get scammed. If you do want to put your property in a trust, have a professional help you.
