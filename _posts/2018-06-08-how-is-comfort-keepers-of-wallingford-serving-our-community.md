For today’s community spotlight, we’ll be highlighting a great non-medical in-home care company: **Comfort Keepers of Wallingford.** According to office manager Randi Gaetano, the company’s goal is to keep seniors happy, healthy, and safe in their homes for as long as possible.

**The space out of which they operate is centrally located, easy to find, and great for hosting caregiver training sessions.** “The support staff here at our office is second to none,” says Randi.

Comfort Keepers is unique in that clients are specifically matched to caregivers. This works incredibly well, as different clients will have different needs. Whether it’s making sure breakfast is done, helping clients get out of bed, or reminding clients to take their medication, **there are so many services in-home caregivers provide.**

As someone who grew up in Wallingford herself, Randi says she loves the community. And with a couple of her family members having owned businesses in town as well, Randi has been able to establish her name as a fixture in the town. This means people know, recognize, and trust her.
