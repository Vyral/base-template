<br>Before we list a home for sale, we know there are always key improvements that the owner can make to increase the home’s value. We call these intelligent fix-ups, and we define them as something that will generate a three-to-one return. In other words, for every dollar you invest in that fix-up, you should expect a $3 increase in your home’s sale price.

These fix-ups are very home-specific, so ideally the best way to do them is to go room to room and identify the key improvements that will increase your sales price.

In this regard, the two most important rooms of the home are the kitchen and the master bedroom/bathroom combo. About 60% to 70% of the buyer’s decision to put an offer on the home or not comes from the quality of these two rooms. The main techniques that we use to modernize them is painting or staining the kitchen cabinets and using a special coating to refinish the bathroom countertops.

Usually, any given home will have key improvements and a few important areas to focus on. For that reason, we’re in touch with a list of wonderful vendors and contractors who also abide by our three-to-one return principal. Not only are they really good at what they do, but they’re also cost-effective.

If you’d like us to do an evaluation of your home and determine which improvements would give you an opportunity to increase the amount of equity beyond what you have already and then put you in touch with these vendors and contractors, we’d be happy to oblige.

If you have any questions or are thinking of buying or selling, please feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to speaking with you!
