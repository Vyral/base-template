Today I’m joined by special guest Missy Stewart, of Missy Stewart Design, whose portfolio is so impressive that I just had to bring her on for a discussion. 

Missy is an interior designer who works primarily with luxury residential properties. You can see a few examples of Missy’s work in the video above. 

According to Missy, one critical consideration when hiring an interior designer is to make sure they are someone with whom you can communicate. **Missy says that a quality interior designer must be able to really listen to their clients.**

This is especially important for someone like Missy, who works with clients in a number of circumstances. Her work is “very customizable,” she says. Of course, this requires her to stay in-tune with the latest trends. 

For 2018, Missy told me that beige is out while greys are in. This is something Missy definitely incorporates in her own work. She told me that she prefers to keep homes in a mostly monochromatic palette with just a few pops of color throughout. 

If you’re interested in seeing more of Missy’s work or booking a consultation, you can find her on Instagram and Facebook at “MissyStewartDesigns.” **You can also contact Missy through her website:** **[www.missystewartdesigns.com.](http://www.missystewartdesigns.com)**

And, as always, if you have any other questions or would like more information from me, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
