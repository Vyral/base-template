What’s the difference between obtaining your mortgage through a mortgage broker and getting a mortgage through your bank?

Getting approved and getting the best possible mortgage is a large component of buying real estate, and I find that many people don’t know the difference between these two. I wanted to clear the air for you on this topic today.

What is a mortgage broker? Here at the Greater Toronto Group, we have partnered with specific mortgage brokers who are the in the top 1% in Canada. These are people we know we can trust who can provide some very specific products to our clients. **They have strategic wholesale lending rates, which can save you thousands of dollars.** Additionally, they are not owned by the lenders they represent. This means they represent you specifically and are in your corner during the process.

Another cool fact about these lenders is that they have special software that allows them to scan all the lenders for the best rates and terms for you, the buyer. In seconds, they can shop for the best mortgage opportunity for you without you having to do any extra work.

I also have clients who decide to work with their bank, and I get that. **It can be convenient to have all of your accounts and mortgage at one branch.** However, be aware that your bank can only provide you mortgage options that they already offer. One time, I had a mortgage broker assist my client with a pre-approval, and it turned out that he was able to get the client a better mortgage with their own bank that what the clients were able to do by just walking in and requesting a mortgage with their bank.

It’s kind of silly, but it’s important to see all options rather than just one.

I like to think of the different between getting a mortgage from a mortgage broker and a bank this way: a mortgage broker is a huge wine store with every brand and type of wine selection available and a staff that gives opinions, insight, and recommendations, as well as points out which ones are on sale or are of good value. A bank, in this example, would be like going to a wine store with just one wine available. The horror! Then, they try to convince you that this one kind of wine is the best and that you should buy it.
