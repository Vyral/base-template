We wanted to give you a quick refresher on some of the most important things you can do to prepare yourself for this hurricane.

Today I wanted to lay out a plan and offer a few tips for you to consider as Hurricane Irma continues to bear down and has us all guessing where and when it might land. This is currently a category 4 storm and potentially one of the worst storms ever recorded.

I just wanted to offer some reminders to help you get ready for anything Mother Nature might throw at us.

**1. Stay tuned to the local weather station.** They’re going to keep you updated on the critical info from the National Weather Service.

**2. Check your disaster supply now.** Your supply kit should be ready to go with a gallon of water per person, non-perishable food for three days, flashlights, batteries, and candles.

**3. Remove or tie down objects in the yard.** Make sure things like patio furniture are stowed away or secured so they can't blow away or cause damage.

**4. Take inventory of your property.** We haven’t had a ton of hurricane wind damage in a long time here on the Crystal Coast, but we’re very susceptible to flooding. Take pictures, do a walkthrough, and write down everything. That way, if you ever have a flood or wind insurance claim to make, you’ll have something to fall back on.

**5. It’s a good idea to turn the fridge and freezer all the way down.** Setting the fridge and freezer to the coldest setting will help you keep it cool if the power goes out, and your food will stay fresh longer. Keep the doors closed as much as possible if you lose power.

**6. Don’t forget to turn off the gas.** If you have propane or other small appliances, make sure they're turned off.

**7. Keep your gasoline tank in your vehicles full.** If there's flooding and you need to get out of town, be prepared to exit with a full tank.

**8. Have an evacuation plan in place.** This way everyone in your family will know what to do and you won't be scrambling at the last minute.

As always, if you have any more questions, don't hesitate to reach out to us at the Star Team. We would be happy to help you. We wish you all good luck and safety through this big storm.
