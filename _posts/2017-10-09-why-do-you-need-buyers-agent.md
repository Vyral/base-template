Buyers need a buyer partner to represent them in our market so they can look out for their best interests and get the best deal possible.

**Want to buy a home?** <a href="http://www.valeriehunterkelly.com/search/residentialadvancedsearch.aspx" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale</a>

 In our market, it is very important that you as a buyer have a buyer partner representing you.

As our very own buyer partner Melissa Hayes explains it, **a buyer partner is someone who protects the buyer, works with them from start to finish throughout the transaction, and helps them through the whole process.** They can also make sure you have certain stipulations put in the contract that are for your benefit.

What do buyers need protection from? A few different things. For example, if you pull up to a house and see an agent’s name on the “For Sale” sign, that agent is representing the seller and looking out for their best interests—not yours. A buyer’s partner like Melissa, on the other hand, protects her buyers and makes sure they get the best deal possible.

Think of it this way—if you were getting divorced, you wouldn’t want the same lawyer representing you and your soon-to-be ex-spouse, would you?

If you have any questions about buyer partners or you’re thinking of buying a home in our market, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to speak with you.
