  The Edina real estate market has changed quite a bit since summer began. We’re
  here with the latest numbers that show where we’re at and where we’re heading.
  For example, inventory is still down in most price points, especially below
  $400,000. As you move up in price, however, more and more inventory is
  starting to come on the market. To find out what this means for you if you’re
  thinking of buying or selling soon, watch this short video.

We’re taking a look back at our real estate market today and how it has changed since summer began. These are the things we’re paying closest attention to.

Inventory is down overall and is extremely low in certain price points. In the $300,000 range, for example, homes are selling very quickly. Homes priced at $400,000 and above are in more of a balanced market for the time being.

The biggest changes we are seeing are in the upper $300,000 range. Inventory and days on market are starting to increase significantly here. However, homes are still selling in an average of 33 days, which is faster than they were selling at this time last year. This has caused pricing to continue to go up as well. We’ve seen about a 5% increase there.

We’ve been talking to some builders in the area lately and all signs point to increased new home inventory throughout the rest of summer and fall, mostly in the $400,000 to $600,000 range.

If you have any questions for us or need any advice on what you should do in this market, give us a call or send us an email. We are always happy to help. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
