<center><em>Everyone should have an agent when buying a new construction home. Here are three reasons why.</em></center>

<br>Many people wonder whether they need a real estate agent when buying a new construction home. The short answer is “yes,” and here are three reasons why:

**1\. The agents you speak to in the sales office work for the builder**. They’re looking out for the builder’s needs—not yours. Due to this, you need someone who can help your needs be met.

**2\. The agents don’t have your best interests in mind**. Since these agents are working for the builder, they’re not interested in getting you a good deal. By hiring your own agent, you’ll have a professional who can look out for your needs and help you navigate upgrades, add-ons, and more.

**3\. There’s no additional cost**. You have nothing to lose by hiring an agent, as the builder’s pricing is the same whether you have an agent or not.
