I always get a lot of questions from people about how they can determine what their house is worth and what’s involved in listing it.

For us, determining your home’s value is pretty straightforward. We start off with a comparative market analysis (CMA), which we’re happy to do for your home at any time. **We provide these to our friends and clients at no cost and with no commitment** in the hopes that you’ll think of us when it comes time for you to list the home and you’re looking to get top dollar on the sale.

We’ll come out to your house, take a thorough look around, and take detailed notes. After we learn as much as we can about your home, we’ll take our data and schedule the next meeting at our office.

In this second meeting, we’ll review the value that we came up with for the home. We’ll walk you through the process step by step, including what homes we used to compare yours with and all the features of your home that add or decrease its value. You’ll walk away with our determination of what the market value of your home actually is. **The market moves quickly, however, so the analysis is only accurate for a month or two.**

The final step is the execution of paperwork, where we have you sign a listing agreement and provide you with a bunch of important documents. It usually takes about seven to 10 days to get the home on the market after this. In the meantime, we’ll schedule a professional photographer to come out and take pictures of the home, and write up a detailed MLS report for when the time comes to list.<br><br>That’s our three-step process that has worked pretty well for us in the past. **If you’re thinking about selling your home or you’re just curious about what it might be worth in the market,** feel free to reach out to us and request your free CMA. We look forward to hearing from you.
