Lately, a lot of sellers have been asking, “Should I be present during my home showings?” My answer is absolutely not! There’s never an instance where that’s a good idea.

I understand how you feel. It’s a huge inconvenience to leave your home for every showing. You might also feel that you are the best person to point out the features in your home. After all, you know your house best. You probably also want to know what potential buyers think of your home, so you want to be there and see the reaction.

When the homeowner is there, the buyer tends to clam up. They don’t talk. They don’t want to offend you. We need the buyer to be open and vocal. We need to hear what they think about the paint colors, the flooring, and the price of the home. That way, we can overcome any objections and get an offer.

Most of our showings are going to be set up within a two-hour window. You don’t have to leave for the full two hours. Be ready to go. Have the dog and the kids in the car, and when the buyer shows up, go for a drive around the block. Most showings only take ten minutes. If you’re sitting at the corner waiting for them to leave and they’re taking half an hour, get excited! That means the buyer is likely interested in the property.

Showings can be inconvenient, but it’s important to never turn down a showing. I know emergencies come up, but every time we turn down a showing, there’s a chance the buyer is going to go down the street and buy your neighbor’s house.

We are also going to request feedback. We ask every buyer who looks at your house what they like, what they dislike, and what we can change. We will share that feedback with you so you’re never out of the loop.

I also have a quick sheet with tips to help you prepare for your showings. If you are interested, just give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to share it with you and answer any other questions you might have!
