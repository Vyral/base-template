Hi, this is Ciera with the Jeff Cook Events Team\!

As members of our Family and Friends Group, we wanted to inform you about our upcoming Jeff Cook Cares event\! As an initiative in 2020, we are partnering with The Fuller Center for Housing, a non-profit organization, to help build and repair homes for families in impoverished communities. With this new project, we are hoping to not only make a difference in the families in our own local community but also give back to those who are suffering in other communities.&nbsp;

On Monday, March 23, we will be hosting a golf tournament at Coosaw Creek to benefit our Buy a Home Give a Home initiative. This program is a way for us to give back to the community in a big way\! 100% of the profits will be going back to a family in need. Our partnership with The Fuller Center allows us to reach these families in Peru and Nicaragua.&nbsp;

Our goal is to raise a total of **$6,500** from the event to build a home for a family in need. If youâ€™re interested in participating, download the form and send it to our operations office by **March 4th.**&nbsp;&nbsp;

**8761 Dorchester Rd. Ste. 101 North Charleston, SC 29420**

If you would like to contribute with donations please email donations@jeffcookrealestate.com.

We are so appreciative of the continuous support we receive from our Family and Friends Group and the community for a cause that is near to our hearts.&nbsp;&nbsp;
