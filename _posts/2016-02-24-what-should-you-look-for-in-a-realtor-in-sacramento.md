{% include youtube.html %}Whether you’re buying or selling a home, before you hire a Realtor you need to ask them a few questions. We’ll be discussing two very important questions today.1. Is your Realtor full time or part time? You want a full-time Realtor if you’re buying or selling. Why would you let a part-time worker help you make such an important investment? You want someone that is dedicated to you and your needs.1. How many homes did they sell last year? If they sold less than 20 or 30 homes, you may want to find someone with more experience. This industry isn’t easy, and you need someone that can help guide you through it, especially in the tough Sacramento market.
