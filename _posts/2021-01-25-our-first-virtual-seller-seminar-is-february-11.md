<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Our seminar on February 11 is a great way to prepare for the market.</em></p>

We want to hold this event every year, but because of the pandemic, we’re holding it virtually in 2021. Join us on February 11 from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. via Zoom to learn everything you need to know about selling a home. The one great thing about this virtual event is that instead of our usual limited attendance, we can have as many people as possible.

To register, you can either call our office at (907) 240-2804, visit us [online](http://alaskatopagent.com), or send an email to [info@darwalden.com](mailto:info@darwalden.com). We can’t wait to hear from you.
