What do you do to your home and with your home while it is on the market? Many people talk about what it takes to get your home on the market and what to do when you are closing; however, they neglect to mention while it is on the market. For this reason, I want to talk today about this unique topic and share some ideas with you to help get you through this stressful process.

To start, **you should begin packing.** A lot of people think that that means there are boxes in the living room or a pod in the driveway, but that is not necessarily the truth. All you need to do is tidy up and make every room have a defined idea or intent. This means that you do not want to have an office with a workout room where you also store grandma's china. I would rather have your potential buyers see boxes in the back of your closet than to have to trip over something because it took up too much space.

Along with packing, **take some time to identify the stuff that you no longer need.** Hold a yard sale or try selling your unwanted things on Facebook. Especially if you are downsizing, it is easier to choose what you are going to get rid of now rather than trying to squeeze it all in last minute. Go ahead now and start getting rid of the things that you do not use as much anymore and let your house show in a better light.

**Another thing that you should be doing is cleaning.** I know that it can be challenging, especially when you have children, but it needs to be done. We suggest getting your children involved because it helps get you and your family to the next step in selling. It becomes a mission.

All of these things are for more than just you the homeowner; it is for the entire family. All of you want to get prepared to go to closing so that you can get to the next chapter in your life.

If you have any questions or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
