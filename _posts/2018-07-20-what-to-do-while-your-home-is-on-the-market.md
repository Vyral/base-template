Sellers who want to know how to list or prepare for closing will find no shortage of advice on these subjects, but today I'd like to address a topic that receives far less attention: The steps home sellers can and should take once their property is already on the market.

First, you should begin packing. This doesn't mean you should load up the moving truck right away, but rather that you take the time to declutter and pack up anything you won't need before moving day. Not only will this make your eventual move easier, it will also give you the chance to make each room look its best before buyers set foot in the home. As you pack, make sure each room is clearly defined. Buyers will be thrown off if your home gym is also where you store your grandmother's china. Additionally, make sure that you are highlighting each room's potential space. This will be important to buyers.

Along with packing, **take some time to identify the stuff that you no longer need.** Hold a yard sale or try selling your unwanted things on Facebook. Getting rid of these belongings sooner will be much easier than trying to do so at the last minute, especially if you are downsizing.

Cleaning is another great way to prepare your home while itâ€™s on the market. I know that this can be challenging, especially when you have children, but it needs to be done. We suggest getting your children involved because it helps get you and your family to the next step in selling. It becomes a mission.

Each of these steps will prepare you and your entire family as you move toward closing, as well as the next chapter in your life.

If you have any questions or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
