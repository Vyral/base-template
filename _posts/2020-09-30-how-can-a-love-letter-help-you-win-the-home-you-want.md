<center><em>Writing a buyer &ldquo;love letter&rdquo; will help get your offer accepted.</em></center>

<br>When submitting an offer on a home, a great way to get an edge over any competition is to write a buyer “love letter.” There are a few reasons why.

First, **it allows you to thank the seller for letting you into their home and considering your offer**. It also gives you the chance to ask them to take a closer look at why you’re making an offer. Additionally, it shows genuine sincerity and enthusiasm for their home. Everyone loves to hear how great their home is, and you can tell them what you love about it.

On top of that, it allows you to personally connect with the seller. If the seller is receiving multiple offers, this connection can make all the difference because they’ll be able to see the person behind the offer.

Lastly, **writing a letter lets you tell your story and talk about your family**. You can elaborate on how you’ll love the home as much as they did. Everyone has a story to tell, and everyone’s situation is different. Many of our clients have entered into multiple-offer situations without being able to submit the highest offer and still won because of writing this letter.
