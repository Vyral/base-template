*How long will your home take to sell? It depends on these factors.*

According to Realtor.com, the average number of days on market nationwide is about 65 right now. However, there are some different factors that will determine your number when you list your home.&nbsp;

**The first is location.** How close you are to a main street or transportation hub will play a huge role in your home’s value and the speed at which it sells.

Then there’s price. You definitely don’t want to overprice your home because it will result in a limited buyer pool. **You could also run into appraisal issues down the road.**

Inventory plays a factor as well. What’s it like in your neighborhood? We’ve seen neighborhoods with no houses for sale, which is ideal for you. We’ve also seen neighborhoods with so many houses for sale that it makes sense to wait it out a bit.

**School districts are a huge factor for buyers with children.** A lot of people go online to research schools and how they rank.

Walkability is important, too. Is the house somewhere where you can walk to a Starbucks or Trader Joe’s? Some buyers really care about this, while others don’t care at all.

These are typically some of the factors that determine how long a home is going to take to sell. If you have any specific questions or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.<br>&nbsp;
