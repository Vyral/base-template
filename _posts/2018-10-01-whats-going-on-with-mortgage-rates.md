What’s going on with mortgage rates in our market?

Right now, the average 30-year fixed rates is about 4.77%, which is the highest it’s been in the past seven years. Experts predict that it will continue to creep closer toward 5%, but it’s still at a historically low level.

Is this really affecting our market? Not right now. I think **what’s actually affecting the market is the dramatic price increases we’ve seen the past two years.** Home prices are significantly higher now than they were when the market crashed in 2008. Additionally, inventory levels are still really low.

Low inventory, price increases, and rising mortgage rates have produced a little bit of a slowdown, but our market’s still extremely good right now. We’re heading into a time of year where more homes are expected to come onto the market, so it’s still a good time to buy and take advantage of these historically low rates.
