Today I want to take a quick look at how to get started with the mortgage approval process.

We start by collecting your name, social security number, address, residence history, and employment history. This information helps complete the base of the application.

There are three different ways you can provide this information.

**1. Face-to-face.** You are more than welcome to come into my office. I would love to see you.

**2. Over the phone.**

**3. Online.**

Whichever you prefer, I would be happy to assist you.

If you have any questions, please feel free to let me know by phone or email. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
