As a real estate professional, I love helping my fellow agents thrive. And one of the ways I do so is by encouraging them to consider joining my team. However, not everyone accepts this offer—and it’s certainly not because our team isn’t good enough. Rather, some agents feel such a strong sense of loyalty to their current broker that they’re unwilling to make a move in their career.&nbsp;

Loyalty is a wonderful thing, and something I respect very much, but it’s important for agents who feel this way to reflect on what kind of loyalty they’re actually experiencing: friendship-based loyalty or career-focused loyalty.&nbsp;

**In the case of friendship-based loyalty, an agent might refuse to leave their current brokerage because they have a genuine, emotional bond with their team leader.** The beautiful thing about this kind of loyalty, though, is that it never has to end. Given that the loyalty stems from personal, not professional, reasons, there is no reason an agent couldn’t switch brokerages while still remaining emotionally loyal to their interpersonal bond with their former team leader. A true friendship should never hold you back from pursuing growth.&nbsp;

But what about the second kind of loyalty I mentioned: career-based loyalty?&nbsp;

**With career-based loyalty, the only reason a person might be hesitant to leave their current team is the fear of sacrificing their stability and income.** If these fears have ever held you back from making a change, yourself, I encourage you to consider this: If you are truly loyal to the success of your career, then you should be willing to take risks to improve it. And, if you are a truly committed professional, changing brokerages shouldn’t pose a risk at all.&nbsp;

You should always be motivated by the desire to get the most out of your career, rather than by the fear of change. So **if you see an opportunity to further your career by moving to a different brokerage, then you need to make that move.** You owe it to yourself.&nbsp;

I help agents navigate issues like the ones we’ve discussed today all the time, so if you have any other questions or would like more information, please reach out. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
