<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Did you know there’s an easily accessible winter wonderland just over an hour away from the San Fernando Valley? Check it out!</em></p>

Especially if you have kids, Pine Mountain Club is a quick place to get to if you and your family are looking for a place to enjoy winter activities like hiking, skiing, camping, equestrianism, and more. I do like Big Bear and all the amenities that it has to offer, but traveling a winding road up the mountain can be laborious, particularly with kids in tow. If you’re thinking about going to Mammoth, that’s an even longer drive; Lake Tahoe, at this time of year, is probably only accessible if you fly.

**The convenient location and distance of Pine Mountain Club make it a great alternative to the other winter destinations that people are familiar with.** Right now, there are only about 2,400 residents at Pine Mountain Club; many people have second homes up here to have a place to enjoy both the winter and summer months.
