If you’re thinking of selling your house, now is the perfect time to do it. Why?

Not many people are aware of this, but our **Orlando market has a shortage of inventory**. For example, we recently listed a property in the Hunter’s Creek area that received six offers in seven days. Our biggest fear with this property was that we listed it at $260,000, which was the very peak of where it would appraise.&nbsp;

Some of the offers, however, went above our asking price, and the home ended up selling for a $266,000 all-cash offer. For that neighborhood, I netted my seller $12,000 more than the next highest sale and did it 63 days faster than the neighborhood’s average days on market.&nbsp;

If you’re thinking of putting your house on the market or you’re interested in buying a home, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.&nbsp;
