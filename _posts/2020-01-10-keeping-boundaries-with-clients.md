Today I’m going to discuss how to keep your boundaries with your clients. This is a difficult thing to do because real estate agents are expected to work all day and night, and every weekend. We are expected to be accessible 24/7. Ultimately, you have to be the one to set your own boundaries and keep to them. Otherwise, your work/life balance will not be stable.&nbsp;

**As real estate agents, we often give most of our time to our clients, and not enough to ourselves.** I challenge you to do your best to keep to those boundaries this year. If you have any further questions about boundaries, feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I would love to speak with you… within my healthy boundaries, of course\!
