There are three questions every buyer should ask themselves:

1. Why am I buying a home in the first place? This is truly the most important question to ask. Forget about the finances for a minute and focus on the reason you’re considering purchasing a home. For most, the reason has nothing to do with money. A recent survey revealed that 75% of parents said that they were looking for a home because their child’s education is important and they wanted to find a place that supported that primary need. What does owning a home mean to you? What non-financial benefits will you gain from owning a home? The answer to these questions should be the biggest reason that determines whether you should buy a home or not.

2. Where are home values headed? According to the latest home price index, home values are projected to increase by about 5.3% over the next 12 months. Simply put, if you’re planning to purchase a home that costs around $250,000, that same home will cost an additional $13,250 if you wait until next year. Your down payment will have to be higher as well to account for that higher home price.

3. Where are mortgage interest rates headed? A buyer must be concerned about more than just price. The long-term cost of a home can be dramatically impacted by even the smallest increase in mortgage rates. With rates being historically low right now, it’s a great time to buy and lock in a low rate on a 30-year mortgage so that you’re protected by the lowest possible rate that you can get.
