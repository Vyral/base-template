What are best plan practices and why are they important?

Today, I’d like to share some information with you about the context of plan practices for your 401(k) or other qualified retirement plan.

As an advisor, I follow the Department of Labor’s recommendations as my baseline. According to the guide “Meeting Your Fiduciary Responsibilities,” **the obligations of a fiduciary is to operate a qualified retirement plan in the best interest of your participants.**

One of the things I think about most as a fiduciary is how my plan practices meet the test of providing benefits for my employees and their beneficiaries.

Another obligation for fiduciary oversight is to pay attention to the fee structure. It’s imperative that you’re only paying reasonable fees. But, what are reasonable fees?

The Department of Labor has published yet another helpful guide on this subject, called “Understanding Your Retirement Plan Fees and Expenses.” **I would be happy to get you copies of both of the guides I mentioned today, so feel free to reach out.**

The two points discussed in these guides are really the baselines on which I build my plan practices. Ultimately, it’s all about your employees having adequate savings for their retirement needs.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
