Although you are not required to get a pre-listing inspection on your home before it hits the market, there are a few advantages of doing so.

**First of all, a pre-listing inspection will uncover any issues with your house before it goes up for sale.** This saves you a lot of time because contracts often depend on whether or not you can repair certain items in your home.

Getting the inspection in advance gives you a little more time to repair those things in your home and save you money in the long run. By making repairs before the home hits the market, you won’t have to worry about buyers reducing their offer price after they order an inspection on your home.

**Finally, a pre-listing inspection can boost your marketability.** People want transparency. They want to know what’s wrong with the house up front. Even if you don’t have the money to fix everything before you list your home, you will be able to say, “We know that there are some issues with the house, and those issues were taken into account when we created the listing price.” That will give you a lot more credibility with future homebuyers.
