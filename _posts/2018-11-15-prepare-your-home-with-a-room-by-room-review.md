Prepare to sell with a room-by-room review. You’ll learn what (and what not) to do to get your home ready for listing.

Things are about to get hectic; Thanksgiving is just around the corner with Christmas and New Year’s following quickly after. And if you’re wanting to sell your home soon, the craziness just keeps piling up!&nbsp;

Instead of thinking about everything you’re going to need to do in the future, focus on what you can do now. Today we’ll be talking about how a room-by-room review is important for making sure your home is completely ready when you decide to list.&nbsp;

You’ll begin by meeting with your marketing expert to receive a room-by-room booklet and begin getting your home ready. You’ll find out how to rearrange, what to paint, and when to call a professional. **The staging ideas provided are key to having your home prepared for when you go to sell.**
