To keep pace with constant changes in the market and in the world at large, businesses must learn how to adapt and continually reinvent themselves in order to secure a future. Why do companies need to do this, though? It reminds me of the Winchester Mansion project. Let me tell you why.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Sarah Winchester was an heir to the Winchester Rifle fortune. Unfortunately, after her husband died she became convinced that she was cursed by all the victims that had lost their lives to Winchester rifles.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>She decided to build a sprawling mansion and she never stopped. She built stairways to ceilings, doorways in floors, and all sorts of hidden passageways and secret rooms. What appeared to be beautiful from the outside was actually very chaotic and confusing on the inside

<br>&nbsp;
<br>An evolving business can be like that. **When you think about the technology advancement, market shorts, organic growth, and new leadership all playing a part in a company’s future, what can appear to be calm on the outside is often chaotic from the inside.**
<br>&nbsp;
<br>When you’re living in a business day in and day out, you don’t necessarily see what’s going on. So take a step back and be objective when looking at your organization and how it needs to adapt in order to continue its success in the future. **What was relevant yesterday just might not be relative today.**
