Today we want to talk for a minute about a career in real estate.

People always ask how the market is and whether now is a good time to get into real estate. **A common misconception is that the answer depends on what kind of market we’re in.**

Here's what we have learned from being in real estate for more than 10 years.

**It’s not what the market conditions are, but whether you have the right strategies for success.** How do we know this? We had a phenomenal year during the worst real estate bubble in history. We did a ton of short sales.

That is an example of having the right strategy—we adjusted for the market we were in. In fact, we have been able to grow strategically year over year for the last 10 years.

We have what we call a strategically driven business, and not an economically driven business. The difference? Our business does not go up and down with the economy, but rises upward with strategic growth. How do we do that? Come to one of our Career Nights or check out <a href="http://www.jointeamlally.com/">JoinTeamLally.com</a> to learn more. We’d love to see you there!

Thanks and Aloha!
