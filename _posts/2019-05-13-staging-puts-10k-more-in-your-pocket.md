Sellers often ask whether staging their property before selling is worthwhile. They probably understand that it could help put their home in a better light, but may still feel uncertain about going through with the process. They wonder things like, “Why is staging important?” and “How much more money will I earn by staging?” 

These are both good questions. To avoid being bitten by what I like to call the “Staging Shark,” there are a few important points you need to understand. Staging doesn’t need to be expensive. There are many small, low-cost upgrades you can do to boost your home’s value before you sell. 

Perhaps the most important reason to stage your home is that doing so will help you reach a wide audience of buyers. Only a handful of buyers are looking for a fixer-upper, and these buyers are usually hoping to score a discount. The majority of buyers in our market would prefer a property that’s neat, clean, and move-in ready. 

Staging is the first “shark” for a few reasons: 

<strong>1. You want your buyers to have a positive, lasting first impression of your home.</strong> Since most people begin their home-hunting process online, it’s a good idea to have a professional photographer capture your listing in its best light, so that when buyers see the interior pictures online, they can decide whether they want to see the home. Did you know that buyers often decide if they want to buy your home within the first 30 seconds after having seen it?

<strong>2. It’s important to stand out from the competition and beat them to the punch by selling your home first.</strong>

<strong>3. Staging keeps the home-selling waters clear of the other home-selling sharks.</strong>

<strong>4. Staging helps you determine your marketing and pricing strategy.</strong> You cannot market or price a home until you know what the product is going to look like once it’s on the market. When the staging plan has been put in place, then you can market the home and price the home accordingly. 

<strong>6. Staged homes sell six-times faster and can net 169% more than unstaged homes.</strong>

If you want to attract more buyers and earn more money for your home, then all you need to do is follow these simple tips.

Remember: Clutter eats away at your equity. Staging is a critical step in the selling process for those looking to maximize their results. It allows you to make a great first impression. After all, the goal of staging isn’t to show your property as your current house, it’s to show the buyers what it could be like as their future home.
