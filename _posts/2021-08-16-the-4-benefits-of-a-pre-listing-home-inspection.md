Pre-listing home inspections can be an incredibly valuable tool for home sellers, but they’re often overlooked. When done properly, a pre-listing inspection allows sellers to understand their property’s status and know what needs to be fixed. This allows them to get their home in great condition and know how to price it before they list.

Pre-listing inspections can also make a transaction more efficient and reduce the chances of big surprises popping up. **Here are the key benefits that come from getting a pre-listing inspection:**

**1\. Provides sellers with a list of issues:** The inspector will lay out everything that needs to be done to repair the home, which saves time and money later on.&nbsp;

**2\. Time and money savings:** A pre-listing inspection costs about the same as a regular inspection, but it gives sellers plenty of time to fix problems. Better yet, they have the time to compare repair costs for different companies and negotiate the best deal.

**3\. Reduces risk of buyer requests:** Because buyers know everything up front, they’re less likely to ask for seller concessions or price reductions.

**4\. Earns a higher level of trust:** The pre-listing inspection aids the seller’s disclosures, earning the seller a higher level of trust from buyers. It makes the home seem more attractive as well.

The goal of an inspection is to provide a clear picture of a home’s issues and offer guidance on how to fix them. It truly pays to invest in a professional that allows you—and your buyers—to feel more comfortable about the transaction.
