Thursday, May 11th, **we’re hosting the first of a three-part series of real estate investment seminars at 7 p.m. at our office at Keller Williams Realty Professionals on the first floor, and we’d love for you to join us.**

Our own agent Michele DesCombes suggested putting on an investment seminar. I’ve always enjoyed investing in real estate over the years and helping others invest in real estate, and I was more than pleased when she came to me with the idea.

Michele wanted to do a seminar because she loves working with investors. With the rental market how it is in Portland, she also realized that now is a great time to maximize the opportunity for investment and maximize your income. Michele is partnered with Mark Irwin, an experienced lender from Directors Mortgage with a wealth of investment experience who will speak at the seminar.
