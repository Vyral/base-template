Today we are going to answer the following questions: **How much do your employees need to save for retirement and how can we use The Rule of 72 to explain some important financial concepts to them?**

This is one of the most common questions we are asked at various employee education meetings. **The magic number is to save 10% of your income.** If they start saving a little late, they’ll need to save more. How do you determine how much income you'll need during your retirement years?

In the business, we call this “Calculating your income replacement ratio.” **You’ll generally need between 60% to 100% of your pre-retired income to maintain your standard of living.**

Let’s explain this a little more with an example. A 40-year-old earning $50,000 per year may be able to save less if they plan to have their house paid off and their children no longer on the payroll. With the two large expenses gone, you only need 60% to 80% of that income. However, inflation is something you’ll need to take into account. **As consumer goods and services rise over time, your income will have less purchasing power to buy those goods.**

Now, what’s the rule of 72? Basically, it’s a simple math formula that we can use to estimate the growth rate of money over time. Here’s the formula. Take the number 72 and divide it by an interest rate. That will give you the number of years that it will take for a dollar to double. For example, if you’re earning 8% on your money, it would take nine years for it to double. We can do this with inflation, too. Take 72 and divide it by a potential inflation rate of 3%, and we get 24. This tells us that the purchasing power of our dollar will be cut in half over a 24-year period.

Now, back to our 40-year-old earning $50,000 a year with 3% inflation. If he wants to retire on time in 25 years, he’ll need $100,000 to be able to replace his income in the future. **Most of the 401(k) record keepers we work with have the ability to put an income replacement ratio on a quarterly statement.**

Understanding and communicating these rules and calculations is critical so that your employees understand the concept of inflation, the income replacement ratio, and the importance of financial planning. We'd be happy to provide you with our “gap analysis statement,” a tool we use to help employees understand how much they need to retire and what they need to do.
