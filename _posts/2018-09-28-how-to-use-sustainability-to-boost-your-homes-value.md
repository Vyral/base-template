A new survey by the National Association of Realtors was just released, and it made some remarkable points. For example, 61% of Realtors said clients are interested in sustainability, and a whopping 71% of Realtors said energy efficiency is valuable in helping sell a home.

If you’re interested in sustainability and you want to sell your home for a higher price, here are some projects to consider:

* **Energy-efficient appliances.** ENERGY STAR-certified appliances such as fridges, washing machines, and dryers can be as much as 40% more water-efficient and 25% more energy-efficient than standard models. Those numbers are even higher if you compare new models with those that are more than a few years old. If you have an old thermostat or an inefficient water heater, then new alternatives such as the Nest thermostat or solar water heaters might be worth a look.

* **Solar panels.** Homes with solar panels sell 20% faster, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. What’s more is that they sell for a whopping 17% more than comparable homes without solar. With a range of federal and state incentives still in place, solar can be a great way to make your home more green and attractive at the same time.
* **Windows, doors, and siding.** These typically recoup about 80% of their costs in terms of higher home values. However, a full suite of energy-efficient windows, doors, and siding might be worth even more in the current sustainability-minded market. These projects increase your home’s curb appeal, making it more likely that your home will get more interest from potential buyers.
