Over last year or so, many of my videos, print advertisements, newsletters, and market reports have shown that the Phoenix area has gone up in value. So, this week I want to answer the question, **“How do you determine value on a house today when home values have been going up?”**

Give us a call. We can do a complete market analysis on your home. **Using online portals such as Zillow will only use an algorithm to calculate your home’s value; it does not consider upgrades that your home has.** The specific lot on the golf course or backed up to the water will not be considered, which means that it does not provide an accurate value for your property.

Have a Realtor to do a market analysis by going to your home. **Sit down with a Realtor and get suggestions.** Maybe the house should be staged entirely, or it could need a few extra items to finish it. This free information can help potential sellers make the decision to sell.

Whether you need to update, clean the carpets, add in new countertops, or redo the roof, we will give you an idea of how much it will cost to get your home in sellable condition. This will help to not only make it look more appealing to buyers, but also help it pass the inspection. This way **you won’t have any surprises.**

&nbsp;We like to look at these things when we do a market value analysis so it represents the home's value in its as-is condition. It gives you the options of upgrading and repairing, which in the end will give you peace of mind.

If you would like to have me do a condition market value analysis, please feel free to contact me by phone or email. I would be happy to speak with you.
