Contrary to popular belief, fall is a great market for both buyers and sellers. Here’s why.

Should you buy or sell this fall or wait until spring?

Most buyers and sellers feel that spring is the best time to buy and sell, but I couldn’t disagree more. **The fall market is a great market.**

{% include pullquote.html %}

Most people assume that the majority of home buying in our market takes place during July and August because buyers need to settle in time for the start of the school year, but statistics don’t support that assumption here in the capital region. July and August are generally slower months in terms of home sales, but September and October are great months for home sales.

**Over the past few years, statistics have shown that we’ve sold more homes in the fall than in the spring.** Inventory is still tight, and buyers are still very active during this time period. As we approach Thanksgiving, we will see a bit of a slowdown, but we should see inventory start to pick up, so fall should be a good time to buy as well.

If you list your home well before Thanksgiving and Black Friday, you should see success. Just last week, I listed a home that received five offers in 48 hours—most of them over list price. That’s the kind of activity we’re seeing with homes that are properly marketed.

If you have any questions about buying or selling in the fall or you’re thinking about buying or selling soon in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
