*Benjy Gilholm is a great listing partner on our team.
Hear from the man himself about how he came to join our team.*

We are excited to introduce another great member of our team. Benjy Gilholm is a listing partner with Team Lally and he is going to talk about what led him to us today.

**Benjy had actually heard about us first in 2008 when he was working for a different team.** His team referred all their short sales to us. The first thing that attracted him to us was the fact that we did a good job with those referrals and had a stellar reputation for doing so.

The thing that gave Benjy the fire to actually join our team was listening to our Sunday morning radio show. Benjy joined us as a listing partner because he loves getting on the phone, getting people into properties, and helping sellers list their homes successfully. His number one goal is always to take care of his clients.

**Benjy loves the team environment and the fact that the process of joining our team was so competitive.** He looks forward to closing 180 homes this year and continuing his success in the future.

If you have any questions for Benjy or if you’re looking to get your home on the market, give him a call at (808)-647-0002. If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out. Talk to you soon!
