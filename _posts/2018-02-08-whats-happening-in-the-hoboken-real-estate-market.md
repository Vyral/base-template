We’ve gotten a lot of questions about what’s going on with taxes and how they will affect the market. We’ve also gotten a lot of questions about interest rates. Rates have been increasing over the last few weeks, and we anticipate that the Fed will raise rates soon.

So, how has the Hoboken real estate market doing so far in 2018?

In January, we had 131 active condos on the market, with 65 going under contract in the last 30 days. That gives us an absorption rate of just over 2%, which means that if nothing new hit the market, we would be out of inventory in two months.

Over the course of last month, 48 homes closed. The average sales price is $856,281, and the median sales price is $767,500.

The average days on market is 32 days, and the median days on market is 26 days. Once homes are under contract, the list-to-sales price ratio is just over 100%, so we are continuing a strong trend here.

As of right now, there are nothing but positive results in our market.

I hope you found today’s market update helpful. Next time, I’ll go over what you need to know about bidding wars. In the meantime, if you have any other real estate questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
