So you’ve picked the price you’re comfortable with and your listing has gone live: if you find you aren’t receiving many showings or offers as you should be, your price may need some readjustment. **Here are three things you need to analyze in order to make that decision:**

**1. The feedback you receive.** This information is invaluable in illustrating how buyers in the real estate community perceive your home.

**2. The number of showings per week.** You should be getting two to three showings each week.

**3. Whether the showings have procured an offer.** You should receive an offer by no later than the 10th showing.&nbsp;

If you’re not seeing these results, **it’s time to have a conversation with your agent and see what you can change.** Is there a small issue you need to fix, such as a cluttered living area or peeling paint? If it’s something out of your control—your location or the amount of traffic, for example—a price reduction may be unavoidable.

By taking a look at the feedback and factors we discussed, you should be in a good position to come up with a new strategy in order to sell your home quickly and efficiently. If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
