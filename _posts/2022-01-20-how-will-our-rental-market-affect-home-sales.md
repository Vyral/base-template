That’s why I’m here to offer you an unbiased, accurate depiction of the state of the real estate rental market in 2022. We’ll talk about what I’m seeing in the rental market right now, some of my past predictions that have come to fruition already, and more.

**Feel free to watch the full interview, or use these timestamps to browse specific topics at your leisure:**
