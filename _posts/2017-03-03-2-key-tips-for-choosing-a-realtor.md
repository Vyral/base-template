Choosing a Realtor is not an easy task. Recently, I learned that there are 40,000 Realtors in the state of Missouri. That is a crazy number!
<br>
<br>I have two suggestions to help you pick the right Realtor:
<br>
<br>1. Just because they were recommended by a friend or family member **does not mean they are the right Realtor for you.** Meet up with the Realtor first and make sure that you like them. Buying or selling a home should be a fun experience, and it won’t be if you can’t stand your Realtor. Make sure you like the person you are working with.
<br>
<br>2. Make sure your Realtor **knows what they’re doing.** Hire an experienced Realtor who knows what they’re doing, not just a paper pusher.

Remember, this is the biggest investment of your life. Hiring the right Realtor is an incredibly important part of achieving your real estate goals.
