It’s hard to believe that Thanksgiving is already here. Today I wanted to express my thanks and also provide a little safety tip for you.

**Now that the weather is getting colder, we’re starting to turn our heaters on.** For most of us, they haven’t been turned on all year. Recently, a friend of mine in another state had their heater turned on and he was working a late night. When he got home, everyone was in bed, but the house was filled with gas that was burning his eyes. His wife and kids had no idea. He was able to get them out safely, but it could have turned out a lot worse.&nbsp;

**Before you turn your heater on this year or even if you’ve already turned it on, make sure you’re having the system checked out.**The same goes for your carbon monoxide detectors. If they’re out of batteries, make sure to replace them.

The other thing I wanted to do today is to thank all of you and let you know how grateful I am to you for making 2018 such a great year for my team. This has been an interesting year and we’re so grateful to be back in a good position after the devastation of Harvey last year. I hope the rest of your year is great and that you have a wonderful holiday season with friends and family.

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
