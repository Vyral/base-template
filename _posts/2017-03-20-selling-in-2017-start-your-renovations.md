There are a few good reasons to do some renovations in your home, especially if you plan to sell this year.

**For one, if you renovate now, you get to enjoy the new stuff!** There are plenty of things you may have put off, like new appliances or granite countertops, so why not enjoy them a bit before selling your house? Give yourself a chance to cook with those new appliances first.

The second reason to start renovations early is that **they always take longer than you expect.** If you get an estimated timeline of six weeks, plan on 12 weeks. It’s just the nature of the beast. If you plan for this, you won’t have to be stressed about getting your house finished and on the market in a certain amount of time.

Thirdly, you might run into issues that you’re not aware of. A big part of my job is going to potential listings early to get a look at things that might need to be done. We often uncover issues that you never notice because you live in the home every day.

Your renovations don’t have to be huge. I’m not talking about taking things down to the studs for a renovation. In fact, that’s not beneficial in many cases. **My goal is to get you $3 in return for every $1 you spend. **

The fifth reason is that in this competitive market, you simply might need renovations. With the popularity of HGTV in the last few years, we see that buyers simply want what they want. As an agent, I know these things that buyers want to see in a home and will get you more money for your home in the long run.

Finally, if you make the right renovations, you’ll see a good return on your investment. Again, we want to get $3 in return for every $1 you spend on these renovations. My main job is to identify the best ways to do this ahead of time.

If you’re thinking about selling your house this year and you’d like to know more about the smart renovations that will increase your net sales price, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help you!
