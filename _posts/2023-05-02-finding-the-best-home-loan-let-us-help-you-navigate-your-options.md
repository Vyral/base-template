If you’re going to buy a home, know that you have many different options for loans and assistance programs. That can be difficult to navigate, but we are here to help. First, we want to tell you about a new down payment assistance program that just came out called Dream for All. It’s a California program that is gaining a lot of momentum, and it can help people buy a home even if they don’t have quite enough saved up.&nbsp;

This program might be great for a lot of people, but the truth is that **you should look into more programs to find out what’s best for you and your situation.** For example, many people have a stigma against VA loans, but they’re fairly easy if you know the rules. There are a lot of options out there, so if you're on the fence about buying a house, let's talk about what your options and next steps are.

**We make sure to stay knowledgeable on all kinds of programs so we can help our clients.** We align ourselves with the best lenders who are experts on USDA, VA, and FHA loan programs. Plus, we know about many state, county, and city programs that often don’t get the attention they deserve.&nbsp;

Our job is to show you all of your options, and yours is to choose what’s best for you and your family. If you’re curious about buying a house but don’t have all of the necessary cash yet, don’t hesitate to reach out. You can call or email us anytime and we would be happy to help you.
