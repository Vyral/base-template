Today I’m going to talk about why I make these videos. Why am I putting myself out there? I do not have an ulterior motive; I am simply committed to increasing professionalism in our industry. I got my license in 2003, and my mom is a long-time real estate agent, so I grew up in the real estate community. Today I’m sharing some information and a couple of stories that illustrate why I wanted to teach others what I know about working real estate.
