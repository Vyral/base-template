Today, a good friend of mine and my preferred lender, Austin Ingersoll with Academy Mortgage, is joining me to have a chat about a new program that just became available for buyers in our market.

 It’s called the NHF Sapphire Program and it’s a true grant program, which means you don’t have to repay the funds that are given to you. You can use the program for a VA, USDA, or an FHA loan.

 Depending on your credit score, you can get all the way up to 4.5% of your loan amount given to you. To put that into perspective, on a $300,000 loan, that’s $13,500 which can be used for your down payment and closing costs.

 As far as requirements go for qualifying, they mirror the loan you are applying for whether it’s an FHA, VA, or a USDA loan. However, to get the most out of this program, you want to have a credit score of at least 680, but you can go as low as 620.

 All in all this program is great for buyers out there who are sitting on the sidelines because they may think they don’t have enough money for a down payment.

 To see if you qualify for this program or if you have any other real estate questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be more than happy to help.
