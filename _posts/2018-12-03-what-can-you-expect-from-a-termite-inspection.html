Today Iâ€™m joined by Vincent Young of [Warrior Termite](https://www.warriortermite.com/) to explain what happens when a termite inspection is ordered during a home sale. According to Vince, they look for both termites and dry rot during an inspection. The presence of termites qualifies as an active infestation, whereas the presence of dry rot qualifies as an active infection. They search all areas of the house in both the interior and the exterior, and their goal is to protect both the seller and the buyer.
