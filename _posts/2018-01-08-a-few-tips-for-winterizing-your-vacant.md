There are a few tips and tricks you need to remember if you want to keep your vacant property well-maintained this winter.

If you’re worried about your vacant property this winter, here are a few things you can do to put your mind at ease.

 First, **keep the heat on and make sure it’s at a minimum of 55 to 60 degrees.** If you use oil or propane, make sure you have enough to get through the wintertime. We had some issues with people late last year who discovered at the last minute that their property had no oil and were stuck trying to get some on New Year’s Eve. You can use kerosene or diesel fuel to work through and clean your system, and it will run off of those things as well.

If your property is going to be vacant for a while, you may want to turn the water off. There are many home inspectors who will do that for you, so if you need a good contact for that, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

If you’re worried about break-ins or having your copper pipes or HVAC system stolen and you want to periodically check on the property, you should **consider installing a wireless alarm system.** You could also ask a neighbor to check on the property once in a while and give them a spare key. Our office also offers a service for our clients where we check in on their properties once a week for them.

If you have any more questions about maintaining your vacant property during the winter or you have any other real estate needs, feel free to call or email us. We’d be glad to help you.
