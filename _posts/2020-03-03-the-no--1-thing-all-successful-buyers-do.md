Here’s what experienced lender Jake Bernhard had to say about the most important thing home buyers should do.

From a lender’s perspective, the No. 1&nbsp; thing a borrower needs to do is **communicate.** Making sure that you, your lender, and your agent are all on the same page is crucial to ensuring a smooth home buying process.&nbsp;

In fact, err on the side of over-communicating, and ask questions the moment they occur to you. Share as much information as you can; what you may not think is relevant could end up being critical info for your lender or agent.&nbsp;

As our preferred lender Jake Bernhard puts it, “Anytime that a \[problematic\] situation arises during a home purchase, it can all be tracked back to miscommunication.” In that sense, the home buying process is just like a marriage—healthy communication is key\!
