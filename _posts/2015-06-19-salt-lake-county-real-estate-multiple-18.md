Today I'd like to speak about how you can get multiple offers on your home and get top dollar when you sell in Salt Lake.

You first have to realize that selling your home begins online, because over 90% of buyers begin their home search on the Internet. Online marketing involves using photo and video, so you want to make sure that your home looks good. This means you'll want to plant as many flowers as possible, and make your home appear as good as it possibly can.

After working on the outside, you'll need to impress the buyers with the inside of your home. This means clearing every flat surface of every object except for decorative items. This includes bookshelves, end tables, and more. You should also make sure that your home is painted uniformly throughout, with no red or neon rooms that would stick out.

New paint can actually bring a big return on your investment, and it can go a long way towards attracting buyers to your home.

Once you have multiple offers on your home it's important to evaluate the different offers that you have on your home and decide which one would benefit you the most. Is there a pre-approval or a pre-qualification letter? Are they asking for closing costs? Do they have contingencies?

Overall, you have to pick the offer that best suits your needs, and sometimes the highest-priced offer is not the best.

Thanks for watching again, and if you need any help buying or selling real estate in Salt Lake City, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I would love to help you.
