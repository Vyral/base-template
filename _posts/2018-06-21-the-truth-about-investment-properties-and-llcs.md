Recently, Fannie Mae enacted a few changes in regards to transferring the ownership of investment properties into entities such as an LLC. You may remember the recent video I filmed on this topic, but, of course, things have changed again. This time, there are essentially three points you need to know.

**1. The loan must have been securitized by June 1, 2016.** This means you must have closed on or after this date in order to carry out this kind of transfer in ownership.

**2. The LLC must be in good standing with the state.**

**3. You must be the majority owner of the LLC.**

This recent change is actually very positive. A lot of my investor clients have taken advantage of it already.
