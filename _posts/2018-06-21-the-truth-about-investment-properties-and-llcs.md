Recently, Fannie Mae enacted a few changes in regards to transferring the ownership of investment properties into entities such as an LLC. You may remember the recent video I filmed on this topic, but, of course, things have changed again. This time, there are essentially three points you need to know.

The loan must have been securitized[1]&nbsp; by June 1, 2016. This means you must have closed on or after this date in order to carry out this kind of transfer in ownership.

The LLC must be in good standing with the state.

You must be the majority owner of the LLC.

This recent change is actually very positive. A lot of my investor clients have taken advantage of it already.

I would've assumed the correct word would be "secured" but apparently not. google says this is a real word in the lending industry. you learn something new every day.
