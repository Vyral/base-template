Today’s topic is multiple offers and how you can win against other buyers. **Here are the three steps that you need to take: **

**1. Find an experienced professional** who is willing to spend the time and resources to find “not-yet for sale” homes where you want to buy.

**2. Preview enough homes to really know what you want in the right home.**

**3. Be financially prepared** by knowing your budget, your costs, and the possession options for the sale of your current home.

In the Greater Memphis area, we’re seeing sales happen in just days, if not hours. If you need help buying or selling a home or have any general questions about the real estate market, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
