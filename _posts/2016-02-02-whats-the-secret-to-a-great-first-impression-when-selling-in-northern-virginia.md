{% include youtube.html %}The first thing a buyer is going to see when they drive up to your house is the outside. Are the shrubs crisp and trim? Do you have fresh mulch and colorful flowers? Make sure you have done these things and that the door is clean and in good condition.

Once you've made a good first impression on the exterior of your home, you need to focus on the inside. Have you decluttered and depersonalized your home? Make sure your home is clear and clean!

Another thing you need to do is neutralize paint and carpet colors. Loud colors will scare many buyers away, and neutral colors will appeal to the widest number of buyers. Also, be sure to open up your window shades to let in light and to make your home feel airy and fresh. Let the sun shine through your windows!

Finally, a high impact and inexpensive thing you can do is replace faucets, fixtures, and switches. Light switches get very dirty and worn over the years, so think about replacing them. Updating faucets is another way to make your home pop and really draw buyers in.
