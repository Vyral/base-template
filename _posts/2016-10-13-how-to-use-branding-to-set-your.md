Branding helps agents differentiate themselves from one another. Branding also allows people to structure their real estate businesses.

Today I’m here with Steve Kotsenburg, who recently returned to Keller Williams after working with a luxury brand. Steve and I will discuss his branding process and what Keller Williams allows him to do differently.

**More than anything else, Keller Williams allows Steve to be himself.** The branding and marketing talk about what he can offer personally as an agent, rather than focusing on the larger company. “It allows me to be more creative,” Steve says. “We all bring something different to this world.” Keller Williams really allows Steve to show what sets him apart from other real estate agents.

Steve’s tagline is “Gold Medal Service.” This tagline was inspired by his son, Sage Kotsenburg, who went to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and won the first gold medal in men’s snowboard slopestyle. “My son . . . he’s a very humble kid,” Steve says. “As a family, we don’t want to brag about being gold medal people, but over the last couple years we’ve come to realize what that [medal] represents to people in our country and our community.”

Many people told Steve that he needed to incorporate his son’s medal into his marketing. Ultimately, Steve landed on the tagline “Gold Medal Service” because that is what he aims to provide, even if his son wasn’t a gold medalist. “We want to provide that class of service, so we punched it in with our branding and it worked wonderfully,” Steve says. **As an agent, it’s important that your branding is relevant to the services you provide**, and Steve truly found the branding that works for him.

Since joining Keller Williams, Steve has gotten more responses from his SOI and fellow agents, and his ability to pull off that branding so quickly has been really good. “Working together here has been a great fit for me,” Steve says.
