The Affordable Care Act was designed to provide health care coverage for those who didn’t have insurance, so how is it affecting the nursing home industry?

Within the nursing home industry, most residents do have some form of coverage whether it’s Medicare, Medicaid, or an HMO, so the thought was that the impact the Affordable Care Act would have on the nursing industry would be small, if any.

The unforeseen consequence is that it really exacerbates the shortage and the demand for physicians. **It adds strain on the number of medical professionals available.** In fact, by the year 2025, there will be a shortage of 52,000 primary care physicians for a few reasons. The first is that very few study nursing home care while in medical school. Second, regulations are often very high, and third, the pay is often lower for that type of role.

There are, however, a few things that management of nursing home facilities can do to make sure they are aligned strongly with a physician for their community.

First, take an executive approach to make sure your administrator and the director of nursing build a good rapport with physicians in your marketplace. If the medical community hires a new physician, your administrator should **invite them out to get a feel for your community and introduce them to the care you provide.**

Again, physicians want to have a rapport built with key executives, like the administrator and director of nursing. **Ensuring that rapport is built will have you on your way to having a physician in your corner.**
