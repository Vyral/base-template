Today, I want to address an issue that may not have surfaced yet, but it's on the horizon for property owners across most counties in Montana this winter.

Here's what happened: Many counties opted not to levy the full mill rate authorized by the state for schools, which stands at 97 mills. They believed they didn't require the extra funds, but the state Supreme Court ruled that all counties are still constitutionally obligated to impose the entire 97 mill tax levy on real estate property taxes.

**This means that even if you paid your tax bill in full in November, you may still receive an additional tax bill to cover the difference.** If you only paid a portion, you can expect an extra tax bill to address the shortfall. This additional payment can typically be made alongside the regular tax bill due in May, which should amount to a similar total as the November payment.

I'm sharing this information preemptively to avoid potential confusion. You might wonder why you're receiving a tax bill in the middle of winter after already paying your taxes or assuming you were all set. This just goes to show how important it is to vote for lawmakers and officials who represent your interests.&nbsp;

If you have any questions or find this information confusing, please don't hesitate to call or email me. I look forward to hearing from you.
