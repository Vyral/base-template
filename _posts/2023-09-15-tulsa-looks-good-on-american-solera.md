Jennie connected with Katie Godoy, Operations Manager for American Solera.

Located at the corner of 6th and Utica , American Solera is a craft brewery focusing on creatively engaging beer drinkers both locally and across the world!

Just celebrating their 7 year anniversary, you are probably familiar with their &nbsp;bright, fun, and often quirky labels.

More recently, American Solera has expanded into wine making, sourcing grapes from both the Central Coast of California and right here in Oklahoma!

You can find their products around town in Tulsa and Oklahoma, but Katie recommends popping by the tap room to check out the latest and greatest creations. With 2-5 new beers every week, there is always something new to try!

With something for everyone, the space not only offers beer and wine, but also nonalcoholic drinks, a smash buger concept called Bubs offering food six days a week, and private event space.
