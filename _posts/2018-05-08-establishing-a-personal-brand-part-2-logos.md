Today I’m back with the second installment in my series on establishing your personal brand. As agents, developing a personal brand is incredibly important. **If you haven’t already seen the first part, you can [check it out here.](http://swvirginiarealestatecareers.com/welcome-to-my-series-on-building-your-brand.html){: target="_blank"}**

This time I’d like to talk about creating a logo. To truly build your business into a career, you’re going to need a logo. A logo will make your brand and business more identifiable. This logo will show up on signs, flyers, mail, etc.

I delayed getting my own logo until I was six or seven years into the business, so I missed out on a lot of branding opportunities during that time. Don’t make the same mistake. Have a logo created as soon as you can.

Fortunately, getting a logo made doesn’t have to be expensive. **If you want something quick and low-cost, check out a company called Fiverr.** Fiverr is a platform for freelancers to sell their products and services for, you guessed it, just $5. Of course, you can pay extra for rush jobs or “extras,” but the most I’ve paid for any logo using Fiverr was $15.

But don’t let the prices fool you. The artists working for Fiverr are truly skilled in what they do. For such a low cost, they definitely provide high-quality results.

As you’re developing your logo, though, remember this: **It will have to fit on a letterhead and on signs.** Don’t get anything too fancy or too tall. Advertising space is key, so make sure you get a logo that will fit where you need it.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
