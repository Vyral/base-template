Do you have to sell your current home before purchasing your next one? The short answer is no. **Lately, most sellers have been sitting on the market significantly longer than they did in 2022.** If you're thinking about getting a new home, call me first so we can discuss the plan with your current one and we can go from there.&nbsp;

As always, for any other real estate concerns, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’m always happy to hear from you.
