Today I’d like to illuminate the term “agency” and discuss what it means in a real estate capacity.&nbsp;

In a more general sense, “agency” simply means who works for who. While a number of states in the U.S. stipulate that the listing agent and the buyer’s agent have to be separate individuals, here in Arizona, state law authorizes what is known as **dual agency.&nbsp;**

**This means that, as a listing agent, I can also represent a buyer in the same transaction.** Whenever we write a purchase or listing contract, there are documents you’ll sign that, in no uncertain terms, spell out both buyer and seller representation. The state of Arizona wants you, as a consumer, to be fully aware of who is working for you.&nbsp;

**If I’m hired to represent both parties, how we interact is different from how we would if I were representing only one party’s interest.&nbsp;**
