  A number of states in the U.S. stipulate that the listing agent and buyer’s

  however, we’re authorized to practice what is known as “dual agency.”

Today I’d like to illuminate the term “agency” and discuss what it means in a real estate capacity.&nbsp;

In a more general sense, “agency” simply means who works for who. While a number of states in the U.S. stipulate that the listing agent and the buyer’s agent have to be separate individuals, here in Arizona, state law authorizes what is known as **dual agency.&nbsp;**

**This means that, as a listing agent, I can also represent a buyer in the same transaction.** Whenever we write a purchase or listing contract, there are documents you’ll sign that, in no uncertain terms, spell out both buyer and seller representation. The state of Arizona wants you, as a consumer, to be fully aware of who is working for you.&nbsp;

**If I’m hired to represent both parties, how we interact is different from how we would if I were representing only one party’s interest.&nbsp;**
