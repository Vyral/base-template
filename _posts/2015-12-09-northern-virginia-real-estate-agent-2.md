With the holidays upon us, there’s this misconception that it’s not a good time to sell your home. That’s not true!

This is a great time to be on the market. Buyers in the market now are serious and committed to finding the perfect home. Additionally, there’s less competition. Sellers often remove their homes from the market during this time of year.

Because of the holidays, many people decorate their homes. It makes their property look fabulous and spectacular. This adds to curb appeal and attracts buyers.

If you’re going to list in the winter, hire the right real estate agent. Make sure you hire someone credible, like me. I can be here for you even during the holiday season.

As always, price your home to sell. We’re in a price competitive market. We can provide you with the information to help you price your home accordingly!
