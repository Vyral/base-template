What income is considered when qualifying for a mortgage?

These days, everything has to be verified through W2s, paystubs, or tax returns. **Certain types of income are verified in different ways**.

For example, a self-employed person would need tax returns to verify their income. A self-employed person is someone who owns 25% or more of a company or is a contract employee whose employer doesn’t take out taxes so they have to file their own.

For a W2 employee who has a commission or a bonus, if that bonus or commission is greater than 25% of their annual income, they also need tax returns.
