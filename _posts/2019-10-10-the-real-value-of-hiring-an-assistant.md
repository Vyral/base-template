Being a real estate agent is hard work, especially for those who are just starting out. For this reason, I believe every agent in our industry should hire an assistant.

Even new agents can benefit from this kind of help, though I do recommend getting your feet wet and working for about six months before hiring someone. Even just having an assistant working for you a couple of hours a day (or a couple of hours a week) can help make the day-to-day tasks of your career much more manageable. Then, **as you start producing at a higher level, you can obviously increase the number of hours your assistant works accordingly.&nbsp;**

Ideally, you should keep the same assistant as you grow. This way, you aren’t scrambling to familiarize someone new with your tasks and systems after you’re already busy with a successful real estate career. &nbsp;

If you aren’t convinced yet, consider this: Wouldn’t you find it strange if your dentist, doctor, or accountant didn’t have an assistant? **You, like any other professional, should have administrative support.** Otherwise, you’ll undoubtedly find yourself spread too thin.&nbsp;

Beyond that, no one can be good at everything. It’s okay to be highly skilled in working with people, but not with handling back-end work. Finding an assistant who can “fill in the gaps” of your strengths and weaknesses is best. This is why I recommend hiring with your DiSC profile in mind. If you aren’t already familiar with DiSC profiles, allow me to explain.&nbsp;

The DiSC assessment is a simple test that evaluates one’s habits, strengths, and weaknesses as they relate to four categories: dominance, influence, steadiness, and conscientiousness. Your assistant’s DiSC profile should serve as a complement to yours. **You can take the assessment yourself for free** **[right here.](https://www.123test.com/disc-personality-test/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;**

As a final note, make sure to set clear expectations for your assistant from the beginning. A huge portion of workplace disputes stem from unclear expectations.&nbsp;

There is so much more I could say on this subject, so if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
