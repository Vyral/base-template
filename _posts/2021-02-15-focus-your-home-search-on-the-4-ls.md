Here’s the criteria you should focus on when starting your home search.

Today I want to talk to you about your criteria as a homebuyer and the importance of zoning in on what’s important to you. Especially in a low inventory market like this, buyers have to be clear on what’s most important to them in a home. **With limited inventory, you need to be able to prioritize and compromise. &nbsp;**

Each buyer’s answer is different, but what everyone should want in a home comes down the the things you can’t change: **The 4 L’s**

**1\. Location.** It’s the most important thing because you can’t pick up a house and move it.

**2\. Lot size.** You can’t add or move a yard.

**3\. Layout.** This is one thing you actually can change, but when you start getting into extensive layout or floor plan changes, you might as well look at what it would cost you in time and money to find a home with the layout that works for you as is.

**4\. Light.** Natural light, that is. If your home doesn’t face a certain way or has trees blocking the sun, it’s going to be darker no matter what. If natural light is important to you, it’s hard to make a darker home lighter.

I have clients all the time who talk about appliances or flooring as their must-haves. Those can be easily fixed by one of my contractors. The four L’s, however, can’t be, and they’re what you should be prioritizing in your home search.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
