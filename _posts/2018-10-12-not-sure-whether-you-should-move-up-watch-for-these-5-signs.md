Here are the top five signs that it’s time for you to move up:

**1. Remodeling wouldn’t be worth the cost.** Your home might need some remodeling work, but is all that work worth the cost? This is definitely something you should talk to a real estate professional about, but if it’s too much of a headache, you might be better off just selling your home and moving on.

**2. Your family is at each other’s throats.** Perhaps you have kids or extra pets in your home and there’s not enough space and it’s stressing everyone out.

**3. The neighborhood has changed.** There may be too many people moving into your area, or it’s changing somehow in a way that you don’t like.

**4. Everyone has moved on.** If you’ve lived in the same neighborhood for a long time, your kids have grown up and moved away, and all your neighbors have moved away too, a change of scenery (or possibly a downsizing) might be what you need.

**5. You have equity.** If you have a lot of equity built up in your home, it might be time to cash out.
