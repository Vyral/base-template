The fourth quarter is a great time to put your home on the market in Tampa Bay because you’ll face less competition and the buyers you encounter will be more serious about buying.

It’s been a fantastic year to buy and sell real estate, and we’re now heading into one of my favorite times to put a home on the market.

It’s the fourth quarter, and we’re entering the holiday season. A lot of sellers have been taught to believe that it’s a good idea to take their home off the market during the holidays because nothing sells then.

Well, I’m here to tell you that nothing could be further from the truth. **Tampa Bay is a year-round market with a strong fourth quarter.** Would it surprise you to know that last year, a full 25% of the homes that sold in Tampa did so in the fourth quarter? Out of 33,422 home sales across the entire year, 8,831 sales occurred during the fourth quarter.

If you’re thinking of taking your home off the market and listing it after the new year or once spring comes, have you considered taking advantage of the fact that inventory will be lower now because so many other sellers plan on doing the same thing? **You’ll face less competition, and you’ll deal with fewer but more serious showings** because buyers who look for homes during the fourth quarter tend to be more serious.

Who are these buyers? They include:

- Out-of-towners flying in over the holidays who want to tie in visits to friends and family with their home-shopping trip.
- People who are starting new jobs at the first of the year and need a new place to live.
- In-town residents who want to purchase a home and close on it before December 31st so they can put a put a homestead exemption on it.
- People who are busy with work and have some time off over the holidays to shop for their homes.

If you’ve been thinking about making a move but have been assuming it would be best to wait until after the holidays to do so, pick up the phone and give me a call so we can go over which options are best for you.

If you have any more questions about our Tampa Bay market, feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
