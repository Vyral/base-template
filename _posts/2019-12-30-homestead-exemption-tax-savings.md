I’ve covered this topic in the past, but I’ve been getting a lot of questions about it, and it’s important, so I’m discussing it again: the homestead exemption. The homestead exemption allows you to alleviate some of the tax burden on your primary residence. There are four options for a homestead exemption. Some people will qualify for more than one.&nbsp;

**1\. General exemption.** You can receive this for living in a home as your primary residence. This is about a 20% deduction from your taxes, a substantial amount since taxes here tend to go up every year.

**2\. Over 65 exemption.&nbsp;**

**3\. Disability exemption.&nbsp;**

**4\. Military disability exemption.** If you were in the military and are disabled to some degree.&nbsp;

To qualify, you must live in the home on January 1 of that year. Here in Houston, you can visit [www.hcad.org](http://www.hcad.org)to see if you qualify. If you haven’t filled out the paperwork for the homestead exemption yet, you need to, it saves you hard-earned money.

Call or email me if you have any questions about the homestead exemption or any other real estate topic. I would love to help you.
