I get asked all the time how the Portland market is doing, so I figured I should give you an update on what I’m seeing in our real estate market right now.

**We’re coming off two to three years of really solid appreciation.** Sellers have been able to sell their homes quickly and sell them for a high price. Earlier in 2016, we had as little as 1.3 months of inventory. That figure has risen slightly to 1.9 months, but that still keeps us in a strong seller’s market. For reference, a “balanced” market has an inventory of around six months.

We are seeing a little bit of an uptick in inventory due to a seasonal shift as well as the presidential election. Typically, the market slows down just a tad during this time of year. However, if you are out there thinking about selling your home but you’re nervous about the recent changes, don’t be.

**Our interest rates continue to remain low, which is keeping buyers in the market.** Also, 1.9 months of inventory is an extremely low number, and doesn’t leave a lot of options for those buyers with strong buying power. Low inventory and low interest rates are the perfect recipe for a seller to sell their home quickly and for top dollar and for a buyer to get a great deal on a long-term mortgage.

If you are thinking about buying or selling a home in Portland, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to help you in any way I can.
