Is Arizona real estate overpriced? I would say maybe, and that it depends. Know that the market always speaks loud and clear, so if people aren't willing to pay the price, then sellers lower their asking prices. That's what we've been seeing over the last few months.&nbsp;

However, now we've hit a landing area where **I believe prices are going to flatten out.** I've heard that we're going to see some relief with mortgage rates in the next few months, but we'll see. I will work to keep you updated, and in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. You can call or email me anytime, and I would be happy to hear from you.
