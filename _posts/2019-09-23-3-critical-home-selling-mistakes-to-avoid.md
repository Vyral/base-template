<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Are you nervous about your home’s price or condition before selling? Here’s how we can help.</em></p>

Today I want to speak to you about what sellers are thinking before they put their home on the market. It boils down to three things: They don’t want to overprice their home, underprice their home, or overimprove their home. Here’s why.

**We see a ton of sellers these days overimprove their homes because of what they see on HGTV.** That’s not a good idea. HGTV will tell you to remodel your whole house for six months, but you don’t need to do all that in this kind of deep seller’s market. Let us know when you’re thinking about selling and we’ll give you our advice on what improvements you should and should not make.

As far as overpricing goes, a lot of sellers think that it’s a no-risk solution to “see what happens” if they list their home for far more than it's worth. **I’ll tell you what’s going to happen. Your home is going to sit on the market for a long time and you aren’t going to get any full-priced offers.** You want to get as close to your sale price as possible because we have to sell your home to every agent, their clients, and the bank. You’ll probably take a 5% to 15% discount if you overprice from the start.

Finally, we don’t want to see you underprice either. **You’ll leave a lot of money on the table.** Don’t be that person who gets taken advantage of on the sale of their home by working with an inexperienced agent. You want the best of the best working with you so you don’t leave any money on the table.

Any seller in this market should be mindful of these three things. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
