  Many of today’s homebuyers have been struck by a common affliction: analysis
  paralysis. I’ve worked with many buyers who, after finding a great home,
  become nervous about proceeding with the transaction. So today I’d like to get
  to the bottom of an important question: Should you wait? Should you hesitate
  when making your home purchase? To find out, watch this short video.

**People always ask me, “Should I wait to buy real estate?”**

There are a number of variations of this question that I hear all the time, including: &nbsp;“Should I wait until the market improves?” and “Should I wait until interest rates get better?”

I most often get these questions when I’m out showing properties to buyers. And the same thing happens time and time again. Buyers are struck with analysis paralysis. They find a home they love only to become nervous about how market conditions may impact their purchase.

**Buyers who were ready to buy one moment are too afraid to do so the next.** But buyers in this situation are forgetting an important factor. At any given moment, there are a number of other buyers out there who are likely looking at the exact same listing—buyers who are willing, ready, and able to act. Hesitation could mean losing out on your dream home.

Today’s buyers must be mentally prepared to tackle our aggressive market. There’s simply no time to sleep on decisions. So when buyers ask me whether they can or should wait to make their move, the answer I give them is “No.” **In our current competitive market, waiting isn’t an option.**

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want to know how I can help you achieve your real estate goals, free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
