Why is today’s market so strong?

Before we answer this, let’s talk about what makes a strong market. From a seller’s perspective, a strong market is one where transactions are closing quickly and listings are receiving numerous offers.

For buyers, a strong market means that you’ve faced stiff competition to get the home you want.

With that all in mind, what causes these conditions? Why are we seeing such a strong market today?

**This market dynamic is actually caused by extremely low inventory.** In the video above, you’ll find some data from the Spokane Association of Realtors, including a chart displaying the number of active listings over the last three years.

In February of 2016, there was a five-month supply of inventory. As a reminder, a supply of five or fewer months constitutes a seller’s market.

A year later in February of 2017, there were 600 fewer homes listed on the market. This amounts to a three-month supply. This year, we had even fewer listings. **We had just two months’ worth of supply in February of 2018.**

This low inventory is the reason we’ve seen such a strong market. Aside from just impacting demand, low inventory is also affecting property values. By looking at the second graph shown in the video above, we can see how the average sales price has changed over the last three years. Since February of last year, property values have increased by more than 10% year over year.

The bottom line is this: **If you have been thinking of listing your home, right now is the ideal time to sell.**
