<p center="text-align: center;"><em>In the last six months, our market has done very well. Here are the numbers to prove it.</em></p>

We’re just about at the end of summer, and the latest numbers from our market look good.&nbsp;

Right now, **we have 371 pending sales, which is a great number for this time of a year and an indication that we’re in for a very good fall.** In the last six months, we’ve had 1,654 sales, and those numbers are good in all categories.&nbsp;

The price range with the most closed sales was $100,000 to $200,000 range, which had 839. Our biggest growth area has been in the $200,000 to $300,000 range, which had 441 closed sales. The price range that experienced the biggest increase percentage-wise was the $300,000 to $400,000 range, which had 164 closed sales. This means we’ve had a lot of move-up buyers closing on bigger, nicer homes these past few months.&nbsp;

If you haven’t made a move yet, there’s good news for you too. **Inventory has increased and created a nice balance between buyers and sellers.** Currently, there are 805 homes on the market.

Lastly, interest rates are also doing very well. 30-year fixed-rate loans are fluctuating between the 4.5% to 4.75% range, while 15-year fixed rate loans are shifting between the 4.25% to 4.5% range.&nbsp;

Now that we know things are going well overall, I want to end this week’s video on a more personal note. I recently attended the funeral of a good friend of mine who was also one of my wonderful customers and a great referral source over the years, and it reminded me to thank you for all the help you’ve given me over the years. **I appreciate all of your business, and I want to let you know that my team and I look forward to helping you with all your future needs.&nbsp;**

As always, if you have any questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.&nbsp;
