If I said that technology can boost your real estate business, your mind may fill up with thoughts of cutting-edge gadgets and gizmos. **However, I’m talking about a tech tool that most of us already have and perhaps take for granted: our email.&nbsp;**

We use Gmail on our team, and it’s an invaluable service to us because of its unmatched organizational capabilities. We use a business account, and you’ll need one to unlock the functions I’m discussing.&nbsp;

We give everyone on the team their own email, but we’ve also created generic accounts that help us avoid micromanaging the emails of people who join our team or leave. For example, we have a “listings” email, and anything that is sent there goes to our listing manager. However, those emails are still forwarded to me. This allows me to take my email off the correspondence and steer clients toward the people they actually need to speak with, but it also lets me see what’s going on if needed. I can filter out emails I don’t need, organize the important things, and keep everything else in a place that’s still easily accessible.

It’s the best organizational tool that we have and allows us all to stay on top of time-sensitive activities, transactions, showings, and everything else we need on a daily basis. It can all be a little complicated to explain in a video, but it’s fairly straightforward when you dive in. **If you’d like to learn more, I’d be happy to walk you through how we do it and help you streamline your processes through Gmail.&nbsp;**

Additionally, I’m hosting a webinar in a few weeks called “Never Buy a Lead Again,” and you’re more than welcome to join in. Whether you need help with Gmail, would like an invite to my webinar, or simply want to learn more about streamlining your business, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to helping you soon.
