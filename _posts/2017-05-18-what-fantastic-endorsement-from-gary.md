*Recently, we were fortunate enough to be endorsed by Gary LeVox of Rascal Flatts. Here’s what he had to say about our team.*

We were fortunate enough to recently land an endorsement from one of our favorite musicians, Gary LeVox of Rascal Flatts. You can check out the full endorsement in the video above, but **what really stood out to us was that the message of his music and the message of our business aren’t so different after all.**

*“When 'I’m Moving On' won the award for ACM song of the year, it struck a chord with folks who understand the challenges that come with life’s big changes. For many, that time comes when they sell their home. If you’re moving on, you want a team that will make selling your home easy and stress-free.” - Gary LeVox*

**He hit the nail on the head there.** It’s always our goal to make things as stress-free as possible for all of our buyers and sellers. We outsold every agent in Fairfield and New Haven County in 2016 and if we can’t sell your home at a price and deadline that we both agree to, we will buy it.

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
