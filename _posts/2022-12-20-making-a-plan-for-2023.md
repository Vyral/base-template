Happy New Year\! I'm very excited about 2023, and I hope you all are excited too.

This message is for all of the sellers: The spring market starts on January 1. The holidays are over, the guests are gone, and now is the time to get down to business with getting your home on the market. Also, this is still true if you are waiting until May or June to sell because **you need a plan in place right now.**

Reach out to our real estate team by calling us at (203) 980-6886 or visiting [carbuttirealestate.com](http://www.carbuttirealestate.com). Let's get started on your plan.
