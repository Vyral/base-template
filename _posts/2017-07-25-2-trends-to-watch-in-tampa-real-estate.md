How is the Tampa real estate market doing? May and June set new records in home sales, and prices are on the rise.

The June numbers just came in. You can check out all of the details here, but there are two important trends that I want to highlight.

**We just had two record-setting months** in sales volume and home prices.

In May, 3,573 homes sold, which is a record for the Tampa market. Then in June, 3,616 homes sold, breaking that record! Overall, there was a 13.2% increase in sales in June 2017 compared to June 2016.

Home prices have also seen a healthy increase of 9.3% year-over-year.

**If you are thinking of putting your home on the market, now may be a good time to do so.** If you have any questions about which improvements will get you the best return on investment, reach out to me and I can help you.

Homebuyers, if you are struggling to find the home you want, let us know.  We search daily, along with a dedicated staff, for off market properties for our buyers.  We always have a number of properties entering the market in the next three or four weeks, so we can certainly help you.
