It’s that time of year again. Property tax season! Most municipalities are adjusting values and therefore raising taxes. You probably have already received your notice this year, but **I wanted to make you aware of a few different things about them.**

{% include pullquote.html %}

The first thing you’ll get is a notice in early fall. Then a month or two later, you’ll receive a property tax bill that’s typically due sometime in November or late December. It’s important to note that this bill is something that’s typically included in your escrow account. Your mortgage company actually mails out that check. **Before you decide that you need to pay your property tax bill, check with your mortgage company to see if you already have.**

If you have any questions about this or about protesting your property taxes, I’d be glad to assist. Just give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
