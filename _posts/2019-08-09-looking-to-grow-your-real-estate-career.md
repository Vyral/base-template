I’ve got an exciting announcement to make. **This month, we are looking for two special people to join us on The Dave Friedman Team.** A real estate license is required, but the opportunity here is huge.

The first open position we have is for a buyer’s specialist. The total target income is a minimum of $100,000 and easily over $200,000 for those who want to get after it. It’s an exciting opportunity where you can generate new business every day, meet with buyers, and gain their trust to work with you. Our team structure will also help you get more free time in your schedule. **You’ll make more money by working less than you would as a solo agent.**

The second open position is for a market specialist. This person works with our buyer’s specialist and the buyer. They show the buyers all the homes they want to take a look at, which allows the specialist to spend more time generating business or just relaxing. **The target income here is between $75,000 and $85,000.** This position will also attend closings and inspections while showing homes to all of our buyers.&nbsp;

**If you’re interested in either of these positions or know someone who might be, reach out ASAP.** We’re making our selections over the next few weeks.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
