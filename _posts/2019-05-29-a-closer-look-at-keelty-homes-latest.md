Today marks the start of our “Builder Spotlight” series where we’re going to showcase some of the amazing new construction going on here in Howard County. **This time, I’m at the amazing new Keelty Homes community.**&nbsp;

33 homes have either been built or will soon be built. The model we’re in now has about 1,600 square feet on each level and about 4,500 square feet total.

**These homes start in the high $600,000 range up to the mid-$700,000 price point for some of the finishes that you see in the video above.**

There are two very impressive large bedrooms and no small rooms in the house. **Every square foot makes sense.** There is plenty of storage, plenty of room to move around, and the master bedroom suite and bathroom are incredibly impressive. There’s also the ability to make a fourth bedroom in the basement if that’s something you’re interested in.

**To get a better idea of what the entire home looks like, watch the entire video above.** If you have any other questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
