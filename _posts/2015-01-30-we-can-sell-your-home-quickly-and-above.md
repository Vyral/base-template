Today we have Paul with us, who was really apprehensive to sell his home. Agents had been telling him he needed to sell to a real estate investor because the home needed too much work. Paul expected to get $650,000 for his property, and other agents laughed at him and told him that it might be worth $500,000.

When he decided to work with us, we took the right steps to brighten his home and liven it up. We took down drapes, removed awnings, and opened up windows to make it feel fresh and new inside.

Paul ended up with 21 offers in seven days and had a selling price that was $130,000 over the appraised value.

If you want a fast, clean, and efficient sale, be sure to contact myself or my team. We would be very happy to serve you.
