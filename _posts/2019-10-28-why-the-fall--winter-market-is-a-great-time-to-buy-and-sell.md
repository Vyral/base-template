It’s no surprise that fewer people list their homes and fewer people look for homes to buy in the fall and winter months, but a big reason for this is because they assume there’s more opportunity in the spring.&nbsp;

Is that true? In some ways, yes. In other ways, no—**there is plenty of opportunity for both buyers and sellers in the fall and winter markets.**

For example, sellers who keep their homes on the market during the fall and winter are likely very motivated to sell, either because they need to upsize, downsize, relocate, etc. As a result, they’re more willing to drop their sale price or entertain offers that are lower than normal. This is in stark contrast to spring, where homes always sell for higher prices. Buyers should take full advantage of these conditions. **When you combine them with the fact that interest rates are near-historic lows, it’s a wise move to buy now.&nbsp;**

If you’re a seller and you need to buy your next home, the math doesn’t support the notion that spring automatically equals a more successful double-transaction. If you aim to move into a larger home, you may have to sell your current home at a lower price, but you’ll also be able to purchase your next home at a discount.
