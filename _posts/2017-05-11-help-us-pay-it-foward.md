Hello Friends!
<br>
<br>On Mother's Day, I will be walking with my team (@Home Property Group, LLC) &nbsp;to support Rose Haven, a local shelter for women and children. I would love it if you could come walk with us but life's busy- I get it. &nbsp;☺ &nbsp;So, if you would consider even a tiny donation to @HOME's fundraising page, I would be ever so grateful as every little bit helps! Below is a bit about Rose Haven and this Event and scroll all the way down to the bottom to donate or participate! Thank you and I hope to see you on the walk! XXOXO

**REIGNING ROSES WALK
<br>Benefiting Rose Haven
<br>Mother's Day - Sunday, May 14, 2017
<br>Castaway Portland - 1900 NW 18th Avenue Portland, OR
<br>• 10:00am - Packet Pick Up & Reception
<br>• 11:00am - 5k Walk**

Join hundreds of people this Mother's Day to honor a special woman in your life, and raise funds to empower women and children of Rose Haven experiencing homeless, abuse and other disruptive life events.
<br>Reigning Roses features everything needed to make this a special morning: mimosas, pastries, entertainment, prizes and a wonderful 5k walk. Together with Rose Haven guests, participants will stroll a 5k course through the streets of NW Portland, enjoying goodies and entertainment along the way. Participants are asked join or create a “team” made up of friends, family and co-workers. All genders and ages welcome!
<br>There is no minimum fee to participate, however, we ask attendees to make a personal donation and/or ask others to support their participation. This website makes it easy to ask your friends to join your team, or make a gift to support your involvement. Our goal is to have each participant give or raise a minimum of $189, the cost to serve a Rose Haven woman or child for an entire year!

<br>**ABOUT ROSE HAVEN:**
<br>Homelessness lasts 24 hours a day. Portland remains challenged by a homeless crisis. For those fortunate enough to get a temporary bed overnight, they must leave by 7am each morning. Rose Haven fills a unique niche as one a very few shelters available for women and children during the daytime, when they have nowhere else to go for safety and support. We start by providing basic services that meet their immediate need for safety, food, clothing, hygiene products, etc. Then, we offer support to help them address longer-term challenges related to employment, housing, medical and legal issues. Our goal is to empower women and their children to build sustainable lives for themselves. In 2016 we served a record 3, 191 women and children who collectively visited 18,817 times during the year for services and support. Services cost just $189 per woman or child for an entire year of support from Rose Haven. Please set a goal to see how many women your team would like to help this year!
