Today, I’m joined by one of the greatest St. George legends in living memory: My dad\! Dale Larkin is 80 years young, so I thought it would be interesting to walk around the city with him and find out how it’s changed in the last 80 years. While St. George has changed a lot since my dad was a kid, there are some things that haven’t changed at all.

**You can watch our full journey in the video above or skip to each location using the timestamps provided below:**

1:15 — Robert Gardner Jr. statue and the center of town

I would like to thank my dad for joining me today, it was a real pleasure\! As always, if you are looking to buy or sell, please give me a call. I’m always willing to help.
