I am joined once again today by Shani Weiss, our top stager and designer. She tells us what a stager does to change a home from a place with specific, personal decor to something a potential buyer could see themself living in from the moment they walk in.

**Shani begins her process by removing everything from a listing’s rooms**. She then replaces it with other furniture and decor that won’t overpower the space. She works with the current homeowners to decide what they can do to help the home sell easier.

You can see a bright and open flow from the kitchen into the family room for the home featured in today’s video, in particular. In this case, she makes the home more modern and contemporary with fresh white paint on the fireplace and encourages natural lighting by removing the window coverings. This creates a focal point for the potential buyers to see as opposed to looking at the furniture. **Shani says that when you are staging a home the family room should be a place where people imagine not only relaxing and being comfortable**, but can also see themselves entertaining and being themselves.

Shani tells us that almost all of the furniture she has brought in is owned by the staging company. However, they do make strategic business partners so that they have access to certain pieces without purchasing them. Home Dynamix, for example, owns all the rugs that they use for staging purposes. She says that she prefers to use Wayfair because they have great customer service.

In our next series of videos, Jamie Corsair, our lead buyer’s agent will join us. In the meantime, if you have any further questions about staging or are thinking about buying or selling, please feel free to contact us. My team and I would be happy to assist you in any way that we can.
