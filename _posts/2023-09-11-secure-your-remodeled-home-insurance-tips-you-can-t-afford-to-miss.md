Are you planning a substantial home remodel? Or perhaps you've already completed such a project? If so, you might be wondering how to ensure that your home is properly insured to protect your investment. We recently encountered this question from a client who was working on architectural drawings for a remodel in the range of $200,000 to $300,000. Here's what we discovered:

Contrary to some misconceptions, most insurance companies do not require a new appraisal after a home remodel. Instead, you can simply reach out to your insurance company and let them know the extent of the work you've done.

Therefore, if you're planning to construct an ADU or have already done so, it's essential to consult your insurance company. Find out if they can insure the ADU and what specific coverage it might require. If your current provider does not offer coverage, explore alternative insurance options to protect your investment.

Protecting your investment starts with the right insurance coverage, so contact your insurance provider for guidance and peace of mind. If you have any questions about this topic, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out by phone or email.
