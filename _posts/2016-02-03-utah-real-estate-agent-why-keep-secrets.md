Today I have another home selling tip for you, and it has to do with keeping your motivation for selling under wraps. If a buyer knows why you’re selling, they can use that against you.

**Your reason for selling will have a major impact on negotiations.** For example, if you need to relocate to an area quickly, this will impact the sale. If the buyer knew you were on a deadline, they could use that against you in a negotiation. We don’t want to give the buyer any reason to think that they have an advantage against us.

**You’re better off keeping your reason for selling confidential.** Only speak about this with your listing agent. This will put you in the best possible position when you negotiate for price.

If you need any other assistance when buying or selling, please don’t hesitate to contact me!
