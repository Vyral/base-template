Whether you are buying or selling, you need to have an agent by your side in our market for a few reasons.

**1. Ethical standards.** Everything we do is out of professionalism and protection for the public, so our clients can rest assured that everything we do is for their benefit.

**2. Expert guidance.** When you buy or sell a home, there are many different forms that are required from zoning to disclosures, and it’s our job to help you understand what those forms are so you know exactly what you’re signing.

**3. Objective information and opinions.** We have information relating to zoning, school systems, utilities, and everything else that comes into play when buying or selling a property. Our objective opinion comes into play when helping you analyze a property in terms of if it’s the right fit for you or what the market value might be.

**4. Expanded search power.** Most consumers will start their search online, however, you might not find what you’re looking for on the Internet. This is when a Realtor comes in handy. We actually have what we call a secret list that contains properties that haven't even been listed yet. There’s a good chance we can help you purchase a home before anyone else even sees it.

**5. Negotiation knowledge.** There are many factors up for discussion in a purchase agreement. As a Realtor, we look at everything from your angle. Having someone advocating for you during the negotiation process is essential.

**6. Up-to-date experience.** We sell hundreds of homes every year, which means we are very knowledgeable about what the current laws and regulations are. Our experience will help guide you through the process as smoothly as possible.

**7. We are your emotional rock.** A home is more than four walls and a roof. For most people, it’s the biggest financial transaction they will ever make. Having a concerned yet objective third party fighting for you and consoling you through the emotional ups and downs of the transaction is our most important job. We do this every single day, which means we set clear expectations and guide you through the process.

If you’re looking to buy or sell a home or if you have any other real estate questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’m always happy to help.
