Today I’m joined by Melanie Taliaferro from SWBC mortgage to answer the question, “What is the difference between being pre-approved and pre-qualified?”

**People use the terms pre-approved and pre-qualified interchangeably when it comes to mortgages, but there is definitely a difference.**

A pre-qualification can be as little as a verbal conversation with a borrower in which the lender asks about income and credit then tells the borrower based on their answers that they are pre-qualified for a home loan. That confirmation can be verbal or in writing, and the strength of a pre-qualification can range.

**A true pre-approval means that a lender has not only gotten a written loan application, but has also pulled your credit report and evaluated your income and assets** to get an overview of your whole financial picture before issuing a pre-approval letter. Having a pre-approval letter, then, will make your offer much stronger and put you in a position to beat out someone who might have only been pre-qualified.
