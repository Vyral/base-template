When I first started in real estate, I felt like I was working 24/7. It was a brutal thing to be “on” all the time, but I’ve since learned how to manage my time and how to help my agents do the same.

On our team, all agents must take at least one day off a week. They can take two off if they wish, but the point is that family matters. Devoting time to one’s personal life is crucial. In fact, that’s why we all do what we do. **Our work allows us to provide for ourselves and our loved ones, and offers us a safety net against unexpected expenses. **

Make no mistake: We want our agents to be productive, but I would so much rather have an agent spend an evening with his children than see that same agent chase down a buyer who isn’t qualified to purchase a home to begin with. 

With all of this in mind, time management is a skill like anything else. To be successful in managing one’s time, you’ve got to keep your calendar well organized. **Our team has a shared calendar that tells us what each agent is doing and at what time.**

Besides this, we also have a definitive structure to how each day runs. We begin every morning at 8:43 a.m. with a huddle call. This conversation allows us to check in on what’s working, what’s not, and how each agent is doing with handling their individual tasks. This is also the point at which our agents can ask each other for help. 

Following this call, we typically do prospecting and lead follow-up from between 9 a.m. until 11 a.m., after which agents will typically go on a listing appointments before taking lunch. 

Blocking out time this way is the best way to make sure immediate issues are taken care of and that the business continues to run smoothly. **Making good use of our time is how we stay successful, while simultaneously allowing our agents to enjoy their lives outside of the office. **

Another way we promote the significance of our agents’ personal lives is by asking that they work only two evenings each week. Our agents’ families deserve to have them home, and allowing for this time benefits us all on both a personal and a professional level. When you’re in control of your time, then time is no longer in control of you. 

So if you have any other questions,  would like more information, or are interested in joining a team that values your time, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
