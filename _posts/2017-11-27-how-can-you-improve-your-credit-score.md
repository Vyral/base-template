What can you do to improve your credit before applying for a mortgage?

First of all, **you need to have a basic understanding of what your current accounts look like**. To do this, my team and I can perform a soft pull that wonâ€™t affect your credit score.

{% include pullquote.html %}

The most important thing on your credit score is your revolving balances, specifically in relation to your limits. **If we can get these below 50%, this will help to improve your score**. Your score will be even better still if we can get them below 10%.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
