</i><div style="text-align: left;">Today I wanted to talk to you a little bit about pocket listings. A pocket listing is one that the seller intends to sell but hasnt yet officially listed or put into the MLS. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">Therefore, these listings wont be found anywhere online. When it comes to a listing like this, the seller has often met with an agent who theyve asked to find them a buyer. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">Pocket listings have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. **One of the biggest advantages is that you can maintain your privacy throughout the sale.**<div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">Since pocket listings arent readily available to just anyone in the public, you have a lot more control over who sees your property and who sees your home. <div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">Pocket listings can work very well depending on your circumstances. <div style="text-align: left;">This also means you have fewer buyers and fewer showings to deal with. Days on market is much less of an issue for this kind of listing since they arent on the MLS. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">When my team and I work with these kinds of properties, we put them on something called the off-market property list. As soon as a person tells us theyre interested, we do our best to match the listing with homebuyers who were working with. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">This has been very successful for us and many of our sellers. However, there are clear disadvantages to pocket listings. **While fewer buyers do mean less stress, it also means that certain benefits associated with higher exposure are greatly reduced.** <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">With pocket listings, our full, aggressive marketing package doesnt work. These kind of listings naturally see less activity and foot traffic. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;">Ultimately, pocket listings can work very well depending on your circumstances. The decision whether or not to list in this way is really up to the selleras only they can truly know and understand their individual situation. <div style="text-align: left;"> 
<div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: left;">If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<div style="text-align: left;"> ld like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.
