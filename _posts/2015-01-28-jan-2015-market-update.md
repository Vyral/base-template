There's some exciting news for the Los Angeles real estate this January. For starters, interest rates have fallen to right around 3.7%.

This will result in buyers coming out sooner than usual. With affordability on the rise, you can expect to see a busy Los Angeles marketplace.

Sellers are also making their way onto the market and listing homes in response to the increase in buying power. There usually is not a lot of demand from buyers in January, but 2015 is different, and the market is off to an extremely hot start.

Whether you're a buyer or a seller, it's a good time to get in the market. Interest rates are as low as they've been in 20 months,  causing a flurry of activity in Los Angeles and in the rest of the nation.

If you need any assistance, whether you're buying or selling in LA, please be sure to call or email me. My team of professionals are waiting to hear from you!
