<br>When you’re renovating your home in preparation to put it on the market, there are a few projects that you need to focus on if you want the best possible return on your investment. Yes, updating the kitchen and bathroom will absolutely increase your home’s appeal, but not every seller has the budget or time to perform these upgrades before they list. Today I’ll focus on the top three renovations I recommend to sellers to increase their bottom line.

**Follow along in the video above or use the timestamps below to navigate the discussion at your leisure:**

0:50 — No. 1: Patching and painting

1:43 — Important painting items to address

2:40 — No. 2: Refinishing your hardwood floors and replacing your carpet

I’ve been doing this for over 12 years now, and I can confidently say that the sellers who took my advice on this had no problems selling their homes at all.
