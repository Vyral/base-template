Why should you interview and hire an experienced agent? If you’re buying or selling, you’ll need an experienced real estate agent to represent you for the following reasons:

**1\. The market has shifted.** There are 1.5 million agents in the National Association of Realtors (NAR). According to statistics, the average agent only has eight years of experience. Unfortunately, we've been in a hot seller's market for more than eight years in Portland, meaning your average agent hasn't seen any market except for the one we've just left. You want someone who's seen different markets and understands the nuances of helping people buy and sell.&nbsp;

**2\.&nbsp;**​​​​**An experienced agent has analytical skills.** The agents that have been in the business for the last two or three years or during the pandemic are probably the ones who lost their jobs and then got their licenses.. I don't want to overgeneralize, but many of them don’t have the analytical skills to price a property.&nbsp;

**3\. Relationships matter**. For someone like me who sells about 100 to 150 homes a year, I have the chance to work with 100 to 150 agents. They know my name, my work ethic, and have had good experiences with me. Similarly, our vendors, stager, photographer, painter, etc. will help you, regardless of whether you're a buyer or a seller client. For example, if you're an investor looking for a rental property, I'll bring in my property manager. Before you're even through your inspection period and due diligence, you'll have a good sense of what the rent will be for the property. I have advisors that will give us valuable insights to help you make the right decision.&nbsp;

If you have more questions about having an experienced agent in this shifting market, call or email me. I’m always happy to help\!
