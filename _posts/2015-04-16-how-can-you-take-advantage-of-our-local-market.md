{% include youtube.html %}Real Estate Business Intelligence, which studies our local real estate market with the George Mason University Center for Regional Analysis, has just released some numbers for our market.

* **New pending contracts increased by 13%**

* **The number of closed sales increased by 41.2%**

* **There are 8,000 active listings, which is a 26.6% increase over this time last year**

* **Our median sales price of $415,500 is a 4% increase over last year**

* **Our average days on market is sitting at 67 days, which is a two week decrease from last March**

* Buyer demand continues to improve, and seller activity is also beginning to pick up

On top of all of this, mortgage rates continue to be very low, so it is a phenomenal time to purchase a home. If you're looking to buy or sell this spring, now is the time to get prepared. \*\*You don't want to miss out on this market! \*\*
