Unfortunately, winter is upon us here in Alaska. We’re already seeing snow on the mountains, and the mornings are getting quite chilly. If you're a homeowner, it’s time to winterize your&nbsp; property before it gets too late. Here’s a handy list of things we should all be doing to prepare our homes for the long winter ahead:

**1\. Clean out your gutters.** Make sure any leaves are removed, so your gutters don’t get clogged in the spring when the snow starts to melt.

**2\. Make sure your downspouts are taking water away from the house.** If you don’t, your foundation and basement will be at risk of flooding come spring.

**3\. Get your heating system cleaned.** This will almost double the life of your furnace if you do it annually.

**4\. Check your CO and smoke detectors.** Replace batteries if you need to.

**5\. Clean your chimney and fireplace.**

**6\. Remove your hoses from the side of your house.** Cover any hose knobs.

**7\. Check your sump pump.** If you have one in your crawlspace, make sure it’s working properly or you’ll end up with water everywhere in a few months.

**8\. Caulk your windows and doors.**

**9\. Insulate your external plug-ins.** You can get some foam insulation to put in there.

**10\. Cover exposed pipes.** If it gets really cold, these pipes on exterior walls tend to freeze

**11\. Consider a programmable thermostat.**

**12\. Dig out your snow shovels.** You’ll need them soon.

If you have any questions about our checklist or anything else related to real estate, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
