{% include youtube.html %}Are you using professional photography to market your home for sale? If not, it could cost you thousands of dollars on the sale of your home.

I recently received an email from a good friend of ours with the subject line, “worst home photos ever.” Boy, they weren’t kidding. The photos were from a home in Ashburn that was for sale. I couldn’t resist clicking on the link. These photos were so bad they would have made an amateur blush.
<br>
<br>I’m talking dirty dishes in the sink and on the counter, laundry on the floor, and unmade beds. In one photo it looked like there was a body in the bed! It looked like a set for a horror movie, NOT a home for sale. In my humble opinion, marketing a property like that is malpractice. Clients deserve better.

**Unfortunately, it’s shocking to see what some Realtors consider to be good marketing.**

<br>Professional photography sells homes. It’s imperative in this day and age if you want to sell your home for top dollar in the shortest amount of time. **Every day buyers make decisions on which homes they want to see in person based on what they see online.** Impressive, high quality professional photography is critical for getting them off the couch and into their car to come see your home in person.

<br>If you have any questions for me about professional photography or anything else relating to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help.
