Property owners ask us all the time whether getting a home warranty is a good idea. Generally, the answer is yes, but there’s one issue. **The home warranty company usually only has one or two vendors on the island to service your house.**

{% include pullquote.html %}

For example, a couple of home warranty companies needed to replace the washer and dryer in our properties, but there are currently no washer and dryer companies on the island. That means some of our tenants had to wait six to eight weeks to get washers and dryers shipped in through the home warranty company. If you didn’t use the home warranty company, you could just go to Lowe’s, Home Depot, or Ross’ Appliance and buy your own washer and dryer. Right now, appliances are in short supply on the island, so home warranty companies are also having a difficult time getting in air conditioning units, plumbing items, and electrical necessities because they only have one vendor that serves all the houses on the island.&nbsp;

**As a property owner, you have to decide whether a home warranty is in your best interest.** Price-wise it probably is because everything inside the property is rented to your tenant but is your responsibility.

If you have any questions or want to talk more about home warranties, call or email us. We’d love to speak with you soon.
