There’s one common denominator for all kinds of business: learning never stops. This week on Level Up With Rosie Hayer, we delve into the inspirational business story of **Michael Shwartz, Vice President of Priority Title**, and explore the quintessential road to success. What does it look like and how do you know that you’re still on track?

#### Self-discovery and a thirst for knowledge

You always start with something, whether it’s a small idea to address a minor setback or a big leap onto a gripping venture. This spark will drive you to innovate, create, and develop irreplaceable solutions, which can easily adapt to the ever-changing needs of your clients. This part of the process is definitely exciting, and it pumps you with adrenaline to take on the next steps with grace and enthusiasm.&nbsp;

#### Humble beginnings

As soon as you decide to be fully on board with your undertaking, the process takes you to a whirlwind of experiences. Hence, Michael reminds us to take the time to step back. Make it your number one priority to know what you know and what you don’t know. This self-awareness and willingness to learn will position you in the right place to listen to other people’s experiences, understand what needs to be done and how it should be done, and realize the value of learning and building connections early on.

#### Opportunity over impossibility

Building something from the bottom is not an easy feat. It’s not unusual to experience pitfalls and doubt yourself, so Michael prompts us to grow your grit and know your drive. “Hitting a goal proves you’ve mastered a skill. But why stop?” He challenges us to surpass our limits and sustain the purpose that keeps us going. *I can keep on being better. I value the respect I gain from being great in what I do.* Focusing on the opportunity rather than the impossibility of your venture will help you rise to the occasion, whatever challenges you might face along the way.

#### “Others first”

While treading your way to success can be self-serving in nature, make it your number one priority to be mindful of other people. After all, you cannot sustain your business by yourself; you have your team to work with, the people that trust your leadership, and your clients whom you serve with your product or service. By putting these people on top of your list, you give yourself the chance to engage with your surroundings, get to the bottom of the problem you’re trying to resolve, and increase the potential of your organization.

Michael concludes with a powerful statement as he recounts his way to the top. Be gracious. Be patient. Be tolerant. The world is continuously changing, especially now that we are facing a crisis, but standing by our values will always be the right choice. Merge compassion with opportunity, and you will attract the right people and circumstances that will build your success.
