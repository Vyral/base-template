During the Federal Reserve’s last meeting back on September 20th, Fed Chair Janet Yellen announced they would start reducing their balance sheet.

This sounds like a boring announcement compared to their normal news of rate hikes, but it will impact the economy in a significant way. After the financial crisis 10 years ago, the Fed felt they needed to take some emergency measures to prop up the economy by injecting roughly $3.5 trillion into it. They did this by buying up financial assets such as mortgage-backed securities.

Ultimately, these measures did help the economy and lead us into the recovery we’re currently experiencing. Now, they feel like the economy is doing well enough that they can start reducing the balance sheet and pulling some of that money back out of the economy.

**Experts agree that this will put upward pressure on borrowing costs such as mortgage rates.** Obviously, if you’re a seller and interest rates go up and the demand for mortgages goes down, that can make it harder for you to sell. If you’re a buyer, this means you’ll be able to afford less house, which will make it harder to buy.

The good news is they won’t reduce the balance sheet in one fell swoop. Instead, they’ll do it to the tune of $10 billion per month, which is just a drop in the bucket compared to the $3.5 trillion they have invested. Make no mistake, though—this will have a big impact in the near future.

That’s why it’s crucial that **if you’re thinking about buying or selling that you reach out to a professional and make a plan.** In either case, we’d be happy to assist you.
