<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Today I’m sharing a discussion I had with John Nayduch, our buying and listings specialist, where we talk about goals and growth.</em></p>

John Nayduch has been on the Dave Hooke Team for four years, and in the office, we call him “The Machine.” Prior to joining us, John was with a different brokerage, averaging 15 to 20 real estate transactions per year. After joining the team, John began as a buyer’s agent and eventually became one of our lead listings agents.&nbsp;

Today, John still works with buyers, though listings have become a larger part of his focus. He’s on pace to record somewhere between 80 and 100 transactions this year.&nbsp;

Though his workload can be challenging, John described the team like this: **“It’s like family. You can lean on each other. I actually enjoy coming into the office.”&nbsp;**

I’ve always admired John’s relentless day-to-day hustle, and his positive support is representative of our core values.&nbsp;

If you know anybody who might be thinking about a real estate career and is seeking a work environment that feels like family, reach out to us by phone or email. We’d love to get connected.
