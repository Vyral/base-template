The secret to getting to outbound prospecting and securing the best ROI possible is **acquiring great data.** So where does it come from? Well, there’s no single data gold mine, and finding the best data heavily depends on the industry you’re in.

To better define what data is, think of it as a list; in essence, it’s a list comprised of people that are the ideal client you’ve set your sights on.

**In order to obtain the best data, we recommend you purchase propensity-based data with predictive analytics.** The company you purchase from will likely be a cut above more industry-specific options, and your list should be fairly large, containing approximately 25,000 contacts. If you’re in the real estate industry, a list of this size should keep the caller busy for anywhere from four to six months.

Those in real estate may have to look to data sources beyond the propensity-based variety, though, due to the disparate types of lists you may need. Real estate-specific data often comes from places like Cole Realty, Vulcan 7, RedX, etc., so **it’s important to look into what source will help you pinpoint your ideal client and market to them.**
