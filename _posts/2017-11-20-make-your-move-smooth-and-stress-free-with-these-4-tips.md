Everyone knows how stressful moving can be, but I have a few quick tidbits to share with you that will help your move go off without a hitch. I just moved myself, so I speak from experience.

First, **separate all of your stuff into three piles: things you will keep and move with you, things you will give away or sell, and things you’ll throw away.&nbsp;**I know it’s hard to put any stuff into that last pile, but if you’ve moved multiple times, it might be a good idea to consider what really has to come with you.&nbsp;

Second, **declutter your home before you put your house on the market.** Whenever we show a house, it looks amazing if it’s decluttered. Clear anything that can be packed up into boxes and store it in the garage, in a closet, or somewhere else.&nbsp;

Third, **use clear storage bins.** This will save you the time of having to look through each box for what’s inside after the move is over.&nbsp;

Fourth, **label everything with blue painter’s tape.** This is a tip my wife and I used. We labeled everything with blue painter’s tape and wrote down where it was supposed to go in the new house. This will keep you from having to double-move all your boxes after your movers or helpers have already left.&nbsp;

If you’d like a free estimate of what your move will cost, reply to this email and I’ll put you in touch with Move Buddies, a local moving company that we partner with. They can also provide boxes and a moving truck and take care of everything in just one day if you decide to use them.&nbsp;

If you need any more moving tips or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in the Charleston market, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be glad to help you.
