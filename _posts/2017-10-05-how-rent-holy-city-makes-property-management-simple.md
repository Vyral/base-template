Are you considering renting your home out? If so, I want you to think about the benefits of working with a property manager.&nbsp;

To help me cover the subject, I’m joined today by special guest Jessica Lewis. Jessica is from our sister company, RentHolyCity.com, which has a team of specialists to market your home. These specialists will bring in a high volume of potential tenants to your property.&nbsp;

Once they’ve done so, they then aggressively screen potential tenants to make sure they are fit to rent. Not only do **they perform a credit check, they also verify employment and income, criminal history, and residential history.&nbsp;**

Additionally, Rent Holy City’s specialists will get in touch with any potential tenants’ previous landlords, to make sure that they were responsible with rent and were generally good tenants.

So, how does the accounting side of things work? If you choose to work with Rent Holy City, you will have access to their experienced accounting team and easy-to-use online portals. The **online portals allow tenants to pay their rent digitally, and also allows Rent Holy City to pay you,** the property’s owner, each month.&nbsp;

Truly, Rent Holy City makes property management hassle-free for the owner. They have many great systems in place which can be tailored to meet your needs. Rent Holy City can even help owners who are operating from afar. If you have relocated, they will be happy to perform property checkups for you.&nbsp;

**Not only are Rent Holy City’s services extremely helpful, they are also very affordable.** Investing in their services typically costs homeowners just 8.5% of collected rent. Many other companies out there will charge 10% or more for similar services.&nbsp;

Rent Holy City also deals with rent-to-own homes. Whether you’re a homeowner renting out or a tenant searching for somewhere to live, Rent Holy City is a great resource.&nbsp;
