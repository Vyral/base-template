Although 2022 was a wild and chaotic year for many of us, it has also been an amazing year for our team, thanks to your continued support. The things we’ve accomplished this year and in years past wouldn’t be possible without you. Thank you so much for also coming to our client events. We always have so much fun at them. We highly appreciate your business, referrals, and friendship, and we’re excited to see what lies ahead.&nbsp;

Part of that includes hiring a new agent. **If you're currently licensed or you're thinking about getting your real estate license, I'd like to share everything I know with you.** I've been in the business for 22 years with a lot of clients you can work with, so you don't have to cold-call. Real estate is a great career choice that's flexible and work-from-home, but you likely need a mentor to make a consistent living at it. I will be that person for you.&nbsp;

If you know anyone who’d be interested in this opening, or if you’d like to hear more about this position, don’t hesitate to reach out to us by phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
