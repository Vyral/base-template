<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Accessory dwelling units can be a great addition to your property, but there are a few things you need to keep in mind before you start building.</em></p>

If you’re thinking of building an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) on your property, there are a few requirements you need to keep in mind and points to consider before moving forward.&nbsp;

First, **you don’t need a detached structure on your property to build an ADU.** You can add to your existing house or use your garage, although it should be at least a two-car garage if the latter is your preferred option. The maximum amount of space you can add is 1,200 square feet, and you can’t build more than 50% of your house’s square footage. For example, if your house is 1,000 square feet, you can’t add more than 1,000 square feet for your ADU.

Second, **you might be in for a bit of a wait to obtain your building permit.** Before you start building, you have to submit your plans to the Department of Building and Safety. In the past, you’d only have to wait a couple hours for your plans to be approved. Now that building ADUs is becoming so popular among investors, this waiting period has stretched to two to three weeks.&nbsp;

Don’t assume you’ll be able to just convert your garage for $20,000, either. Depending on what you’re trying to build, **ADUs can also be cost prohibitive** due to the construction regulations you must follow.&nbsp;

We’ve also found that many homes with ADUs end up being bought out by investors because they’re an ideal option for any investor looking for a duplex or a triplex. Those investors are getting a vacant property that they can start renting out immediately.&nbsp;

Lastly, by adding an ADU onto your property, you’ll be subject to the rules of rent control, especially if the property was built before 1978.&nbsp;
