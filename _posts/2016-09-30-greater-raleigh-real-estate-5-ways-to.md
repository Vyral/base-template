A lot can go wrong when purchasing a home. We are giving you these five tips to help you avoid making simple mistakes.

There are so many different things to keep in mind when buying a home that buyers often forget a few of them. We want to help you avoid these if you’re thinking about purchasing, so **here are five of the most common oversights we see buyers make:**

{% include pullquote.html %}

**1. Not considering the home’s resale value.** This is not your dad’s real estate market. Our market is transient, and people move in and out very quickly. You want to make sure the home you pick is appealing to a broad range of buyers down the line. Stay away from a home with a sauna or a barn. It may not appeal to the next buyer.

**2. Not factoring in expenses you’ll pay after the home closes.// Everybody is so focused on their monthly payments and closing costs, they forget about the additional costs that will inevitably occur when you move in. You may end up shelling out $10,000 or $15,000 in cash when you could have originally gotten a home that cost $10,000 or $15,000 more and not had to deal with any problems.

**3. Not rooting out all restrictions.** You want to make sure that you call the local municipalities and see what restrictions there are, if any, on the house.

**4. Not checking if past work was up to code.** Even if a homeowner has had a basement or attic finished by a professional contractor, they still need to have the proper permits. You don't want to run into any issues here either.

**5. Not getting the scoop on the HOA.** Homeowners Associations are there to be supportive, but some are harder to deal with than others. Your agent can help you deal with certain restrictions and investigations.

 We have a great team of buyer’s agents that would be happy to help you check off these boxes on your next home purchase. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.
