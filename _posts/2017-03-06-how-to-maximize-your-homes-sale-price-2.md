While the rest of the country is still dealing with the tail end of
winter, right now in Arizona we’re in our prime home selling season.
Here in Tucson in particular, February through June are our strongest
months. If you’re a seller, how can you maximize your sale price while
minimizing your costs? 

Let’s start with maximizing your sale price. **Your home must give a
strong first impression,** and that first impression starts outside on
the street where people pull up in their cars. The front yard
landscaping, the front entry, and your home’s exterior painting all
contribute significantly to your home’s curb appeal. 

Once you get inside the house, the carpeting, flooring, and windows all
need to be clean. Layer on a fresh coat of paint if possible. Making
these areas look spotless might seem like a nuisance, but doing it will
help your house sell quicker. The earlier a house sells in its listing
period, the higher the price it generally sells for. 

What about minimizing your costs? Not many sellers do this, but **we
recommend getting your home inspected.** Have a home inspector go
through your home with a fine-toothed comb so you can repair any items
with a vendor of your choice. You lose a lot of cost control if you let
the buyer do their own inspection after you’re under contract and select
which vendors to use.

Whether you’re a buyer or a seller looking to make a move in our market,
please give us a call so we can help you out. We look forward to hearing
from you!
