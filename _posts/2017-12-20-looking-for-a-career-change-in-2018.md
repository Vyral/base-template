I just wanted to let everyone know that we are hiring for 2018.

We are looking to grow our team, and there are a lot of great opportunities.

Whether you had thought about a career in real estate and not had time to transition or are looking for a part-time opportunity, I’d love to talk to you. If you have a license and are looking for full-time opportunities, I’d love to talk to you.

Even if you are an established agent who needs more support for administrative work and marketing, I’d love to talk with you.

**We have a good track record of getting new agents into the business** through different career paths, and we’re really proud of that. We are looking to grow our team, and we have a great value proposition that I’d love to talk to everyone about.

There are 26,000 real estate agents in Maryland and the D.C. area, and about 100,000 homes sell each year in Maryland. Some might say that the industry is over-serviced, but I disagree.

I can tell you that only about 10% of agents renew their licenses after two years in the business. That means that 90% of agents get out of the business.

There is a huge amount to learn, from technology to contract changes and beyond. As great as some brokerages are, it can be hard to provide everything an agent needs.

That’s why teams are so prevalent now. **Teams are able to provide training, accountability, and leadership.&nbsp;**Keller Williams has world-class training that we are really proud of.

So, if you or anyone you know would be interested in a career in real estate, I would love to talk to them. In the meantime, I hope you have fun this holiday season.

I look forward to hearing from you!
