<p style="text-align: center;"><em>There are certain things that homebuyers hate to see when touring a home. Here are six of them.</em></p>

Today we’re going to be discussing six homebuyer turnoffs that home sellers should be aware of in today’s market:

**1. Damp or wet patches.** Studies show that 70% of homebuyers are put off by this. If you have any dampness anywhere in the home, make sure you get it fixed right away.

**2. Odor.** 56% of homebuyers said they are turned off by any indication of odors from pets, dampness, smoke, or anything in between.

**3. Dull light or darkness.** 54% of buyers say that this is unattractive when viewing a home. Open up those blinds, let the sunlight shine through, and make your home look more attractive.

**4. Clutter.** 15% of buyers are disappointed by any sort of clutter in a room. Do a deep cleaning and decluttering of your property before you list it.

**5. Outdated bathrooms.** Kitchens and bathrooms are some of the most important rooms to homebuyers, and 25% of them find an outdated bathroom to be unappealing.

**6. Over-the-top decor.** 15% of homebuyers aren’t flattered by this. While home staging is important, it’s not necessary to overdo it.&nbsp;
