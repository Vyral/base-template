<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Interest rates are expected to rise, but how much?</em></p>

Today I want to take a minute to talk about interest rate predictions.

Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, predicts that the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond will go up 5% in the next 24 to 36 months. Typically the spread between the 10-year Treasury bond and a 30-year mortgage is about a 1.75% yield. **The yield as of August 7 for a 30-year mortgage is 4.75% with a spread of 1.77%.** If the yield goes to 5% then the 30-year mortgage rates rise to 6.75%

This means is that if you purchase a home for $290,000 with a 5% down payment, your payment would be $1,437 per month. If the interest rate jumps to 6.75% for that same loan, though, the payment would be $1,786 per month. This $349 more interest per month becomes nearly $4,200 per year more and $125,000 over the life of the loan.
