Why did renowned real estate coach and trainer Ginni Field recently join the Keller Williams team?

She says that, previously in her career, it wasn’t the right time to join. She stepped down from brokerage management in 2009, though, and she’s always been a student of the industry, which led her to KW.  

“I spend at least two to three hours a week, on average, just studying trends, watching what’s happening, and seeing where things are going,” she says, “and I think Keller has evolved into a strong player in a changing market.”

This evolution fits her wheelhouse perfectly in this stage of her career. Ginni also says **she still has a passion for making a difference in people’s lives and likes the idea of bringing what she’s learned over the course of her career to KW.** The excitement of helping agents achieve their goals is especially fulfilling.

“That fills me up, and that’s why I’m here—because I know I can make a difference in this place, and it’s exciting for me. I’m not done yet.”

We want to thank Ginni for sitting down with us today. If you have any questions for us about the newest addition to KW or there’s anything else we can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.
