As a buyer, there are only certain things you can ask for in a home inspection and only certain issues a home inspection is supposed to investigate.

When people ask us about home inspections, they usually want to know two things:

1. What does an inspector look for in a home inspection?
2. What can I ask for in a home inspection?

As to what you can ask for in a home inspection, in our contract, **a home inspection limits you to asking for material defects.** A material defect is defined as “something that would’ve caused a normal buyer not to purchase the home had they known it was there.”.

**What an inspector looks for during a home inspection is major issues within the house.** They’re not looking for any cosmetic issues such as the paint or the wall coverings. If you’re worried about those types of issues, they should be taken care of in the contract. During a home inspection, the key is to look for issues like a leaky roof, any type of plumbing system or electrical setup that’s not safe and functional, and any overarching structural issues.

**If you have any more questions about home inspections, feel free to reach out to us by phone or email. We look forward to helping you!**
