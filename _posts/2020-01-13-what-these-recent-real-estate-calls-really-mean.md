<br>Are you getting a lot of random calls from people representing real estate agents lately? Allow us to explain what’s happening.

It’s January, and a lot of agents who are new, haven’t performed well, or don’t have a big marketing budget, are hiring assistants to call people in their database to try to get them to list their homes. Granted, this is the time of year people start thinking about listing their home. The holidays are over, taxes are finished, and you get a clearer picture of where you want your next step to be.

However, **don’t get caught up in these sales calls**. Again, the person calling you is an assistant who has no real estate experience, so if you want to entertain the notion of selling, at least ask the important questions, such as:

* Who is the agent?
* What company do they work for?
* How many homes have they sold?
* What do their reviews look like?

Don’t let them get away with just “selling” you on an idea or product. If you want to schedule an appointment with an agent, make sure you conduct multiple interviews so you know which agent you connect with the best.

The goal of these assistants is to call at least 100 people a day; it’s a numbers game for them. Most of the agents behind these assistants took the holidays off, and now they’re coming back aggressively to start the year. This is borne more out of desperation than the need to help someone. We refer to this as “commission breath,” and you don’t want to work with an agent who has it. **Work with someone who understands your circumstances and wants to do their best job to help you**.

We’ve found that if we can do anything to protect you and help achieve your real estate goals—not the agent’s—it’s better for you.

If you have any more questions about this topic or need a second opinion about any calls you’ve received lately, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.
