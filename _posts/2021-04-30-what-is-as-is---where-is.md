In a competitive market like the one we’re in right now, many buyers end up having to buy homes “as is where is.” This means that they’re buying the home and agreeing to not ask the seller to make any repairs. A lot of times in purchase contracts, you have an opportunity to get an inspection done and request a remedy for certain repairs. **When you’re competing against a ton of buyers in a hot seller's market, however, you may have to waive the right to request a remedy.**

You still have the right to do the home inspection and if you find something that’s a deal-breaker, you can still walk away. However, when things are this competitive, sellers have all the power, and they want to sell their homes “as is where is.”&nbsp;

**You won’t be able to dictate repair requests in this market, but you can still get a great home if you’re working with the right agent.** If you have any questions for me about buying a home, selling a home, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
