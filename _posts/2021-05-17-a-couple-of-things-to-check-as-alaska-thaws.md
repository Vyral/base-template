If you look outside, the sun is shining and the Alaskan winter is disappearing. With that comes a few things you need to watch out for as a homeowner as the ice and snow melt.

We’ve had a lot of snow this year, and **we’re starting to have clients call in with problems in their crawl spaces.** Make sure to check yours. Even if you haven't had any trouble in the past, it’s worth double-checking to make sure the melting snow isn’t draining into your crawl space and basement.

**If you have a sump pump, you’ll want to check that out too.** I suggest checking it once a week until all the snow has melted. We’ve seen properties this year that have never had water issues, but water is showing up in the crawl space.

Check your gutters as well to make sure they aren’t blocked. Make sure the downspouts are attached and extended out from your foundation as well.

Those are just a few tips for you this time of year. Enjoy the spring\! If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
