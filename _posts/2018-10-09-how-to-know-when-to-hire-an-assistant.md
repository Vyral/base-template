If you can no longer do your job within nine hours each day, it’s time for you to hire an assistant.

After you’ve hired an assistant, the first thing you need to do is teach them to take and funnel all of your phone calls for you. However, keep in mind that there are laws in place that regulate what information an assistant can handle and what they can and cannot do. If your assistant isn’t licensed, then they can’t answer any questions about a property—even for other agents. Everyone on my team is licensed, and if you’d like more information about what assistants can and cannot do, whether they’re licensed or not, you can visit [**okrealtors.com**](http://okrealtors.com/){: target="_blank"}.

The time to hire your first buyer’s agent is **when you have so many listings that you don’t have time to work with the buyers who’re interested in those listings.** Turn over any buyers who come from open houses and advertisements to that buyer’s agent and take care of the referrals you get from past clients and/or family members yourself at first. Then once you no longer have time to do that, tell those people that you have a specialist who will help them.&nbsp;

**You should be doing roughly 35 to 40 transactions a year before you hire your assistant, and you should be doing roughly twice that number before you hire your buyer’s agent.** Some people hire assistants earlier than this, but you can’t pay someone to do all of your jobs and still make a net profit at the end of the day. You’ll still have to work and do more than just tell people what to do.&nbsp;

On the flip side, don’t wait as long as I did to hire your first assistant—I waited until I was doing between 55 and 75 transactions. You should start looking once you’re handling 30 transactions. And remember, you can’t expect your assistant to know everything. Teach them to do one thing at a time, and after they know how to do that thing, teach them how to do something else.&nbsp;
