We’ve found a home that we really want, but it’s entangled in a multiple-offer situation. What do we do? I’ll shed some light on what to think about in this type of scenario this Tuesday.&nbsp;

Even before writing your offer on the home, **have an inspection done first.**&nbsp;

**See which contingencies you really need and which ones you can live without.** Do you need to have a finance or appraisal contingency? If not, you can elevate your offer by taking them out.&nbsp;

If you have your heart set on a home, **put your best foot forward when making your offer.** Knowing that another buyer that might be willing to pay more is right behind you, ask yourself: **What is my real number?** It’s important to cement a threshold in your mind, so you know how high you’ll be willing to go in a bidding war.&nbsp;

Let me share an experience I had with one of my buyer clients recently:&nbsp;

The buyer found a home they loved, but they were a little concerned about overpaying for it. As it turns out, they probably would have been willing to pay a few thousand dollars more if it meant winning the home, but their overconcern about price kept them from going any higher; they lost the house to another buyer as a result.&nbsp;

It’s important to understand that, **once a home goes under contract, that’s a new comparable**—the next one won’t be less, it’ll, unfortunately, be similarly priced or higher.&nbsp;

If you’re a buyer who has found yourself in this situation and you’re unsure of what to do, please give me a call at 240-731-8079. I’d love to have a conversation with you! Join me again next week for another edition of “What’s Working Now Tuesday at 2”!
