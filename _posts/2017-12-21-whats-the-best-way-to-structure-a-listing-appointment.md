What’s the best way to structure a listing appointment?

A lot of people in the office have been asking about it, and I’ve been meaning to put together a training video together for listing appointments.

Now, I can’t say I have the best way to structure a listing appointment, but over the last 15 years, I’ve been on over 1,000 of them. I’ve also learned things from other agents both inside and outside of the market. As a result, I’ve been able to put together a good, professional listing appointment.

**During the intake call, we fill out a seller information sheet.** This is a proven process that helps us learn the needs of the seller as well as their interests. The sheet also helps us learn a bit about their property, what improvements they’ve made to the property, and which features they are most proud of.

From there, we set the listing appointment. Sometimes we do a one-step appointment, where we walk away from the initial listing appointment with the listing contract signed. Sometimes we have two separate appointments. It really depends on what the seller’s motivation is and what they are looking for from us.

The second thing we do is prepare for the appointment. We will pull all of the information from the public record that we can. If possible, we’ll pull a deed. We’ll also look at previous listing information and put together a **listing preparation packet.** We also add a listing presentation manual; we have 100 of those pre-printed at a time.

Next, show up at the appointment and ask if they have a kitchen table you can set your things down on. From there, walk through the house with them. This gives you the opportunity to take notes, ask questions, learn more about the seller, and make a connection with them. Remember, it’s important to be super complimentary when you are walking through the home. This is also a good time to ask them what they love most about the property.

After the walk-through, we’ll go back to the kitchen table and review their needs one more time. That’s where the seller information sheet comes in handy; simply review the information you got on the intake call. At that point, you will go through the listing presentation.

**I like to make the listing presentation about the seller.**I tell them what they can expect when they list their home, what showings will look like, and how often we will provide feedback. I also go over exactly what we’ll do to market their property so they know where their home will be advertised. &nbsp;

From there, we’ll decide if we want to talk about the value of the property. If it makes sense, you can go ahead and list the property. In some cases, the property may be a bit more difficult to price.

If that’s the case, we’ll set a second appointment at our office. We’ll take a couple of days to run the CMA. At the second appointment, we’ll go over their home’s value. If it makes sense to list their home, we’ll go ahead and do that. If they want to wait for a while or decide to go a different direction, that’s fine too.

If you have any questions about how we structure our listing appointments, or if you have any helpful steps to add, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.
