Today, I’d like to tell you a story from my past.

Before I was a Realtor, I had an experience as a client that I want to share with you. At that time, I remember my agent paying a lot of attention to my husband.

Admittedly, I was jealous. I felt that no one was paying attention to me. We were moving to a new area for my husband’s job, but I had a lot of important life changes going on, myself.

Not only was I adjusting to having a new baby, I was also adjusting to life in a new area. **I had no idea where to find the best pediatrician, hair stylist, or even chinese restaurant.** It was really hard not knowing my area.

Fast forward to now, 17 years later, I feel very at home and connected here in Portland. We’ve lived in four homes over that time, which is one of the reasons I became an agent in the first place.

I’ve got a lot of great connections. **In fact, my clients think of me as their own personal “Angie’s List.” I like to call it “Sarita’s List.”**

My clients know that they can ask me any time they need a referral for anything here in Portland. I’m happy to help you buy and sell homes, but I also want to be the first person you think of when you need a recommendation for a service, big or small.

**If I don’t already have a connection to a resource, I will seek one out for you.** Even after I help you close a transaction, I am always here for you.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
