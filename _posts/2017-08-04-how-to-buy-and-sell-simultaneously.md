{% include youtube.html %}Selling your home and buying another at the same time can be tricky, but you do have some different options. A lot of people can’t afford to have two mortgages at once, so they need to sell prior to buying.

**The first and least effective method is to go out, find a new home, and make an offer on the home that is contingent on your home sale.**In a hot seller’s market like this, it probably won’t work. The seller won’t want to give up control of the selling process and they don’t want to rely on your home sale in order for theirs to go through. Offers without contingencies are much more attractive to sellers.

The second option you have is listing your home first, finding a buyer, and making the sale contingent upon you finding your next house. You’ll still have to make a contingent offer on the home you buy, but if you’ve already put it under contract you can show that to the seller. **It makes your offer a lot stronger.**

<br>You can also decide to list your house, find a buyer, complete the sale, and negotiate a rent-back while you find your new home. You’ll agree to pay them rent for a few months, and it will give you enough time to get approved and find your next house.

Finally, you can decide to sell your home and temporarily rent one for six to twelve months while you figure out what your next step is going to be.

**It’s a lot to juggle, so don’t try and go through it alone.**If you have any questions about the process or need any help through it, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
