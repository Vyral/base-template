Today I’m here with our real estate market update for the fall season.<br>If you are looking for a home priced under $500,000, you have probably noticed that you are in a disappearing price range. As prices continue to rise, there are fewer homes priced under $500,000 available. In fact, there are 19% fewer homes on the market in this price range than there were at the same time last year.

<br>**The $500,000 to $750,000 price range is the hottest segment of the market,** just as it was last season. Homes are spending an average of 51 days on market. This price range represents 45% of active home inventory and 68% of buyer demand. This segment is in a hot seller’s market.

Meanwhile, the $750,000 to $1 million market segment is in a really good, stable market. The average days on market is 88, which is very stable. This price range makes up 19% of active home inventory and 17% of demand. As you can see, supply and demand are very close percentage-wise, which is a good indication of a steady market.

<br>Now, what about the luxury market? The $1 million to $1.5 million price range is starting to slow down a bit, turning into more of a buyer’s market. If your price point is above $2 million, you are in a strong buyer’s market. You will definitely see more and more price reductions, as well as more days on market.

<br>**As a whole, the average list-to-sales-price ratio is at 97%,** so if your home is listed at $1 million, you can expect to sell for $970,000, which is great news for sellers.

If you have any questions about our current market conditions or about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. My team and I would be happy to help you!
