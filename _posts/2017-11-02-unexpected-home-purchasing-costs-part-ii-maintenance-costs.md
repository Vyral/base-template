In addition to the costs I mentioned last time, another unexpected cost you need to watch out for is the maintenance for your home.

When you rent a house, you don’t have the same external and internal maintenance duties you have when you buy a house. Of course, you don’t have the tax advantages either.

When buying a home, you really need to budget accordingly, because nothing in a home lasts forever. One reason we always encourage home warranties among our buyers is that it acts as a maintenance plan for the house.

**When buying a house, look at items like the roof, the HVAC unit, and the water heater, because all of these things have expected lifespans.** Make sure you plan for the replacement, upkeep, and repair for these items.

If you have any questions about the maintenance costs of purchasing a home, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be glad to help you.
