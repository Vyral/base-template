Sellers often ask me how they can generate multiple offers on their home sale.** Here are a few ways of doing that:**

**1. Preparation.** Homes with a fresh, inviting feel will attract more attention. A few ways to provide that feeling are by decluttering or adding fresh paint or carpet. Buyers are looking for a turnkey home. Consider sprucing up the yard by doing some landscaping and powerwashing the driveway.

**2. Pricing.** Position your home for maximum value against the competition. What are the prices of the homes you are competing against? You want your home to be the best looking and the best priced of the bunch.

**3. Consider an offer deadline.** If possible, you want your home to have at least five days of marketing and one full weekend of exposure. Let buyers know they can submit their offers, but you won’t respond to them until the deadline date.

**4. Understand your market.** Know the inventory in the different price ranges in your market. Take time to study the trends in home pricing, interest rates, and seasonality.

**Implementing these strategies and understanding the market will help you generate multiple offers on your home.** If you have any questions in the meantime or would like to learn more about the market, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to help.
