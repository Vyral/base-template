Fall is upon us, and with it the end of the high season for real estate.

However, if you're thinking you've missed your chance to sell your home, let me reassure you: **This autumn actually presents a fantastic moment to sell.**Here's why.

First off, housing inventory is still incredibly low. In fact, according to data from the Census Bureau and the National Association of Realtors, inventory remains well below historic averages, and is 50% less than its peak in 2006. In addition, the recent slump in new construction means demand for existing homes will stay high in the near future.

Second, while mortgage rates also remain very low, recent announcements by the Federal Reserve might cause them to finally start rising. This would make mortgages less affordable and might turn away a significant number of potential buyers. This is even more of a concern when you consider the continuing growth of home prices—6.9% in the last year alone.

Third, buyers in the fall are likely to be more serious because they have probably been searching for months without success. Also, because fewer homes are listed in the fall, this means there's even less competition than we’ve seen due to the general low inventory.

So what do you get when you put all those things together?

Well, if you were to list your home right now, chances are good that **you would be able to sell it very easily and for a top price.**

On the other hand, if you decide to wait, the situation might not be as favorable because mortgage rates might rise or because new construction might pick up.
