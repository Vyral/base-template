What is happening in and around our local market?&nbsp;

As it stands, our current market is still leaning toward sellers, but we’re seeing a slight leveling off in favor of buyers.

**The average sale price for homes in our market is hovering in the mid-$200,000 range, but we’ve actually seen a 4.5% uptick in price year over year.**

While inventory has yet to come down for homes priced above $250,000, **the amount of inventory we have below that $250,000 price range is pretty scarce** and multiple-offer situations are increasingly the norm.&nbsp;

Additionally, **with interest rates being so low, good deals are just waiting to be made.** The bottom line is if you’re looking to buy, be careful not to assume that we’re in an all-around seller’s market. Depending on your price point and what your goals are, the time to make a move might be now.&nbsp;
