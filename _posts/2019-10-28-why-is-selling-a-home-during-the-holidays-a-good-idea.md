This time, we’re answering a great question from Michelle, who wants to know, “Should I sell my house over the holidays?”

We get that question a lot this time of year, so I’ve asked our lead listing specialist, Diane, to answer that question.

**According to Diane, there are three great reasons to sell a home over the holidays:**

**1\. There’s less competition.** A lot of sellers take their homes off the market during the holidays, which means you can get a higher price for your home because inventory is limited.

**2\. Holiday buyers are serious buyers.** These buyers are motivated and on a mission to find a house.

**3\. Interest rates are unlikely to rise.** This means that buyers can lock in lower monthly payments and actually afford to pay more for a home.

As you can see, the holidays are a fantastic time to sell your home. If you have any questions for us or want our help, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
