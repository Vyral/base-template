We have a hot market here in Clarksville, and today I have the stats to prove it. To give you an update on where we stand, I’ve compared the latest market figures to the same figures from March of last year.

In March 2016, we had about 1,400 houses on the market for sale. Right now, we have about 1,100 houses on the market for sale. At this time last year, our number of year-to-date home sales was 827. This year, we’ve closed 834 houses so far. That’s not much difference, but it shows that we had a great market last year as well.

Our average list price increased 6.4% from $164,000 in March 2016 to $174,600 in March 2017. Our average sales price increased 6.81% from $161,500 in March 2016 to $172,500 in March 2017. In that same time frame, our average days on market dropped from 101 to 91. As you can see, **prices are going up in Clarksville, so it’s a great time to put your home on the market.**

Something else we’ve started tracking lately is the most active price ranges, and right now the most active price range is between $140,000 and $180,000. There are 207 houses on the market within this price range, and about 25% of those houses have been sold already.

The next hottest range is $180,000 to $240,000, which represents about 24% of the market. The third hottest range is the $100,000 to $140,000 area. You might not think it, but you can get a nice house for $100,000 in Clarksville.

If you have any questions about our market or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would be happy to help you.
