Is joining a big-box brokerage actually the secret to getting ahead in real estate? Actually, no. This route isn’t for everyone, and it certainly wasn’t the right move for today’s special guest: Benjamin Barfoot—one of our team’s great agents.

After joining a major brokerage, Benjamin felt lost. He didn’t know where to get leads,and so he invested a bunch of money into trying to find business that he didn’t know how to convert in the first place.

But that all changed when Benjamin came to work for us. In just his first year, he closed 30 deals. Now, **in his second year of business, Benjamin has upped the ante and is on pace to close 45 transactions by the end of 2018.**

And his business isn’t the only area of Benjamin’s life that has improved since joining us. His free time is now truly free. In fact, because of his newfound success in real estate, Benjamin has been able to spend a lot more time on things like travel. All in all, Benjamin is enjoying life both personally and professionally, and is now working to help other agents do the same.

Ultimately, **a lot has changed for Benjamin in the relatively short time he’s been with us.** He’s got a bright future on the horizon, and our entire team is so excited to help him (and other agents like him) succeed.
