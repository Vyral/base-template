If you’ve never been to Westminster Strength & Conditioning, you might be surprised it what it has to offer besides lifting weights. **We’ve been coming to Westminster Strength & Conditioning for about five years now, and it’s very near and dear to our hearts.&nbsp;**

Aside from owner Beau Bryant, this facility has three other strength coaches on staff who train people ages 14 and up. Originally from Pennsylvania, Beau moved to Westminster in 2006 and opened his first gym in 2010. In 2012, they moved to their current location where we’re at today.&nbsp;

Initially, Beau chose strength and conditioning as a career to train and build better athletes. Once they settled into the community, the goal became more about helping people. “I can’t think of a job where you can help more people immediately in their life than just making them stronger,” Beau says. “Almost immediately, when you make someone stronger, it changes their life.”

Beau chose Westminster after exiting the military because it reminded him of home—it’s a close-knit community in a beautiful area. This gym isn’t just for athletes, either. **There are many real-life applications to strength and conditioning training,** and all kinds of different people in our community gather there to train, support each other, and better themselves.&nbsp;

Beau opens the gym every morning around 5 a.m. and stays motivated through the members that join him each and every day, no matter how busy their schedule is. “This is the first job in my life where I jump up every day and enjoy coming into work,” he explains. In his opinion, to run a successful business, you need to have a passion for it.&nbsp;

There’s always some gym activity that everyone hates, though, and Beau is no different. His gym is known for it’s ability to teach people how to squat, but Beau himself doesn’t particularly enjoy that lift.&nbsp;

If you’d like to live a healthier lifestyle, both mentally and physically, and you think you could benefit from being a part of Westminster Strength & Conditioning, give Beau a call at (540) 454-6697 or visit their website at *[**www.westminsterstrength.com**](http://www.westminsterstrength.com/)* and leave a message.
