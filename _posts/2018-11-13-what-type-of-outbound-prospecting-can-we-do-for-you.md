Here at 1000 Calls a Day, we can pretty much run any type of outbound prospecting campaign that you’d like us to. A campaign is simply a fancy name for a script and a list. **If you have a script and a list that go together, that’s a campaign.**

Most of the clients that hire us have anywhere from three to five outbound prospecting campaigns going on at once. We can track the numbers and analytics of each one of these campaigns so that you know **where you’re getting your leads, which campaigns are working, and advise you on where you should be spending your time.**

In the real estate world, there are a lot of different options when it comes to campaigns. We can run campaigns for FSBO, expired/withdrawn, just listed/just sold, open houses, database reengagement, and more. If you're an investor, we can go after different types of distressed properties, foreclosures, tax liens, and anything else you can get a list and a script for.

The beauty of it is that you really don’t need to put a script together most of the time. **We have hundreds of scripts that our clients are using around the country and we can borrow the best-performing ones and use them for you.**

We can also call your database. This includes old customers clients, and prospects who you haven’t talked to in a while. We can re-engage with them, get updated contact information, and announce something to them that you want them to know or an offer.

**As you can see, the possibilities are pretty much endless when it comes to running campaigns and scaling your outbound prospecting.** If you have any questions for us in the meantime or you’re interested in working with us, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email today. We’d love to hear from you soon.
