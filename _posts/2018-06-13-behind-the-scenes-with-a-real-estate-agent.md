The real estate market continues to be very, very active.

Inventory is very tight in the under-$300,000 range, placing us firmly in a seller’s market. Above that range, we’ve noticed that there’s been a shift toward a buyers market. Rates are going up, and whether you’re a buyer or a seller, I think you’ll regret not locking in a low mortgage rate this year. For sellers, you’ll have a larger pool of buyers to access when rates are low, since homes are more affordable with lower rates.

However, instead of focusing on market trends, today **I want to talk about what goes on behind the scenes in real estate.**

Real estate is a very unique business. We have competitors in the field, but we also have to collaborate to sell homes with those very same competitors. This week, I had a competitor say some very rude things to me; he hung up on me twice. In my 25 years in the business, this is very unusual.

One of my listings was under contract; we were waiting for the revised contract to come in from this gentleman. In the meantime, I was able to produce a better, stronger offer for my client. This competing agent, who had said that the offer that was taking too long to get to us, unfortunately got bumped. I have a fiduciary responsibility to produce the highest and best offer I can for my clients, so we went with the second offer.

The agent of the first offer disagreed, and **he had many not-so-nice things to say, dropping the F-bomb repeatedly before hanging up on me—twice.**

There were a couple takeaways from this experience:

* **The agent utterly lacked professionalism.** In the real estate business, the barrier to entry is very low, and I’ll admit that the encounter got my ego up. I was upset; I had done the right thing for my client, but this agent didn’t seem to think so. Rather than judging him and getting angry at him, I should have stepped into a mode of curiosity—I have no idea what’s going on in his life.
* **Anger is not the best response to a situation.** Anger didn’t produce the results that he wanted, even if the transaction I have going now were to fall apart. Going back into business with him won’t likely be in the best interests of my client.

I always have the duty to my sellers to produce the highest and best offer that I can, and our team will always honor that, regardless of the agent on the other side.
