<center><em>There are three important factors to consider before you put your home on the market.</em></center>

Before you put your home on the market, there are three things you need to be aware of if you want to sell quickly and for top dollar.&nbsp;

The first is **your competition.** In other words, be aware of other properties on the market in your area. If you have a 3-bedroom/2-bathroom home that’s 1,800 square feet and you want to list it at $600,000, how it compares to other homes with similar features in the same price range will make a difference in your success. Location and whether a property is waterfront (as well as what kind of waterfront) also has a huge influence on price and desirability.&nbsp;

Second, pay attention to the **amount of inventory on the market.** Right now, homes under $600,000 average about three months on the market before they sell. When you get above $1 million, the average is closer to six months.&nbsp;

Finally, remember to **price your home according to your circumstances.** If you need to move quickly, for example, you need to be more aggressive in your pricing. If you are willing to wait longer and drop the price as needed to get action, you can price on the higher end of the comparables. As long as you price your home correctly in our market, you’ll have good results.&nbsp;
