In the wake of their latest announcements, Zillow has been making headlines again. For one thing, co-founder Rich Barton has once again taken the reins of the company as its CEO. On top of that, representatives from the company have also reported plans for Zillow to become a more integral part of the real estate process for its users. 

Though Zillow is most well known among buyers, sellers, and homeowners for its Zestimate feature (which, actually, can be fairly inaccurate), the company is best known among real estate professionals as a means of purchasing leads. 

But now, **Zillow is getting involved in the real estate game in new ways,** with the most prominent example being their “iBuyer” program. This development, in my opinion, does more harm than good. 

Zillow’s iBuyer program purports to be a way for people to sell their properties quickly and without the hassle of listing on the open market, but sellers should be wary of this arrangement. When Zillow buys homes through this program, they do so at a vastly reduced price. Worse than that, their underlying goal is to turn around and sell the property for a profit. **They are essentially taking sellers’ hard-earned equity and hocking it off. **

Given that more than half of all online real estate searches are done through Zillow, this development has raised a great deal of concern among professionals in our industry. Zillow’s iBuyer program, and others like it, has created a new type of competition for listing agents in our market. 

**Thankfully, there are a few things we as real estate professionals can do.** On a broad scale, my first suggestion would be that brokerages start offering 100% commission rates. This would allow agents to invest back into their own businesses and provide better service to buyers and sellers as a result.

The next step is for us, as agents, to leverage technology to our advantage. Given the size and scale of Zillow, it only makes sense that we, too, would create a massive digital network. At Expert Home Advisors, we’ve already got a plan in place to make this happen. How?

Well, this leads me to an exciting announcement of our own: **Expert Home Advisors will soon be part of JPAR, one of the nation’s top-ranked brokerages.** This move means that our agents will now be able to enjoy 100% commission, will have the chance to draw on the expertise of a nationwide network, and will have the opportunity to build teams of their own if they so choose. 

On top of all of this, JPAR also offers its agents unparalleled access to the latest technology in the real estate game. There’s no other brokerage like JPAR in our Jacksonville area, and we’re proud to fill that niche. 

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are curious how being part of a brokerage like this could improve your life and career, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
