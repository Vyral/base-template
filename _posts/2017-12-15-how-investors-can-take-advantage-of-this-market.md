Today I want to talk about all the current and potential real estate investors out there. If you’ve been thinking about buying a multi-family or other income-producing property, now is the time to get a great deal in the marketplace.

**Recently, we had a client pick up a two-family home in Wallingford right down by the YMCA for under $150,000**. It needed a bit of work, but it will be well worth the effort in the end.

You can get a lot of value for your money right now. Not only because of what you’re purchasing, but for what you can rent the property out for. The rental rates here in Wallingford and the surrounding areas are through the roof and renters are paying a premium.

**If you or someone you know is interested in buying a multi-family home to use as an investment or to fix and flip, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.** I would love to sit down with you and explain how other people are using this opportunity to make great money. Just give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
