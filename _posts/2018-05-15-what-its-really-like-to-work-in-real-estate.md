Having been in the real estate business since 1999, I’m frequently approached by people who are fascinated by the idea of joining this industry but have no idea where to begin.

{% include pullquote.html %}

Because of this demand, I’ve decided to launch a monthly meet and greet where people thinking of entering real estate can learn about the business. During these meet and greets, **I’ll discuss my experience, my team’s unique approach to home selling, and what to expect from a real estate career.**

The meet and greet also provides people with the opportunity to learn about how our team functions on the operational side. Getting into real estate doesn’t have to mean taking on a sales position.

If any of this sounds interesting, I’d love to talk to you about what makes the Misty SOLDwisch Team here at Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Innovations such an amazing place to work.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
