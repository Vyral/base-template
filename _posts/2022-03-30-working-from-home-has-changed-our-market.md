Today we'll talk about three ways in which working from home has changed the market in Colorado Springs. First, **people are refinancing and using that money to update their living spaces**. When you’re home a lot more, you might end up wanting a nicer kitchen or a dedicated office space, for example.We’re also starting to see more buyers moving up. As people are coming together and creating more multi-generational living, we see an influx of higher-priced homes.

Lastly, people who couldn’t move here due to work are now able to move to the area. With many businesses now allowing employees to work from home, they get to choose where to live. **We're seeing an influx of demand from all over the country** because they want to live in this beautiful state.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us by phone or email. We look forward to helping you navigate through the buying and/or selling process.
