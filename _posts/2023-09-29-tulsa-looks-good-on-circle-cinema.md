Jennie recently caught up with Executive Director, Brent Ortolani, to hear about Tulsa’s oldest theater.



Circle Cinema’s mission is to use film to foster an understanding and appreciation of the diversity of the human experience and to create a community among the viewers. The theater celebrates filmmakers both locally and from around the world, 365 days a year!



As a 501 (c)(3), proceeds from every ticket and snack bar purchase are invested back into Circle Cinema’s mission to expand community consciousness through film.



Moviegoers can enjoy a variety of entertainment including independent, foreign, familiar classics, and live theater just to name a few! And you haven’t fully experience The Circle Cinema without enjoying a silent film with musical accompaniment from the restored 1928 pipe organ!



And if you can’t get enough of the big screen, then you are in luck! Become a member of Circle Cinema and enjoy free popcorn, early access, and free passes!
