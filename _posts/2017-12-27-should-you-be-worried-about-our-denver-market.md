Is the Denver metro market in a bubble?

Thankfully, no we’re not. If you’re a homebuyer and you’re anxious about buying a home, try thinking of the Denver market as a teenager—**we’re in a growth spurt right now, and we might level off and find our true footing in the next five to 10 years.**

There are two factors that have a significant impact on the home buying process that we want to address: interest rates and the local economy.

First, interest rates. Right now, the median sale price of a home is about $450,000. We understand how that price tag can be a little intimidating, but look at it this way—if you were to purchase a $400,000 home with a standard 30-year fixed mortgage loan and a 1% increase in interest rates occurred, it could affect the life of your loan by $50,000.

Secondly, **Denver has one of the most diverse economies in the country,** with a number of leading industries, including aviation, aerospace, bioscience, healthcare, energy, finance, IT and software, etc. In the last year alone, the IT and software industry grew by 10%.

On a final note, Denver is ranked No. 2 on the list of the most highly educated workforces in the nation.

Taking all these information into consideration, we don’t see our market falling behind in any facet.
