As a continuation into our series on things not to do when buying a home, today we’ll be talking about why making lowball offers is a major mistake.

Some buyers believe the reason agents offer this advice is because we want to make a higher commission. This isn’t the case. Your agent is there for you and your best interest.

**The reason we caution against submitting lowball offers is simply that they aren’t effective.** These offers run the risk of making the seller feel alienated or insulted, and can also decrease your overall chance of securing the home.

If you really want to strike a deal on your dream home, the best strategy is to follow your agent’s guidance and make an offer that reflects current market conditions.
