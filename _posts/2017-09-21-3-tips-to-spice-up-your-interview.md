There are three little things that tend to separate good candidates from the rest in the interviewing process
{: .present-before-paste}

First, **make sure that you’re standing up during the phone interview.** Sitting down compresses the diaphragm and naturally makes you sound as though you aren’t engaged or excited about the conversation. Phone interviews are difficult—you need to make sure you’re &nbsp;concerned with engaging the other person on the phone. You should be truly invested in the conversation, as opposed to focusing on taking notes and being afraid that you’ll miss something important. That energy level is the No. 1 knockout factor in telephone interviews today.

Second, **f****ollow up with any type of correspondence within 24 hours.** This includes email, voicemail, or text. Response time is absolutely indicative of someone’s excitement level—companies want to hire someone who is excited about the opportunity and the organization itself.

Third, **respond with “thank you” emails quickly, and proof them first.** In today’s world, emails have become a widespread tool used in almost every capacity, but the issue is that many are being sent over the phone. There are spelling and grammatical mistakes all around. Instead, write these emails from a computer, where you’ll be able to review the email more closely and make any edits you need before you send it. Additionally, since these emails will probably be read from a phone, any email that takes longer than two swipes to read will probably be ignored or unfinished. Keep them short and concise, but customize them to the person you met with.
