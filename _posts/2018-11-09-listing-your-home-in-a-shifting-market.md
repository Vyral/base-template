By now, most of us have seen and felt a lot of changes in the marketplace. Right now, we're looking at a 3.73-month supply of inventory, which is an increase from the period between 2014 and 2017, where there were only 1.5 months of supply.

This is a big rise in inventory and a big change from the strong seller’s market we knew in that period. **The current market is still good for sellers, but the shift has changed how we should strategically place your property.** We’ve also noticed an increase of expired condo listings in the market. In 2017, there were 44 expired listings. Currently, there are 59 expired listings.

What does this mean for you?

It means that **as you’re preparing to list your home in the first quarter of 2019, who you work with really matters.** You need to speak with a professional who has their finger on the pulse of the market and who understands how to best present your home to get it sold for the most money possible in the shortest amount of time.

Hopefully this information is helpful to you. If you have any questions, feedback, or are in need of an agent who understand the market, please reach out to the Riolo Residential Group. &nbsp;Until then, enjoy the Thanksgiving holiday season. Cheers!
