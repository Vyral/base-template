Today I want to talk about the two jobs you have as a real estate agent. When people get into real estate at first, they think their job is going to be selling houses, smiling with buyers in front of the sign, and driving people around. While those are all part of your real estate career, here are the two true jobs you have as a real estate agent: lead generation, which includes lead generation and follow-up, and then comes being a real estate agent.

I think what happens is the first job isn't all that glamorous. Unlike a salary and a set paycheck, you don't know where your business is coming from, so **you'll need to go out there and look for business.** Make phone calls, talk to neighbors, go to networking functions or parties, door knock, or do whatever works for your personality to find business.

We all make the crucial mistake of getting caught up in the second job that we neglect the first. However, once you close, you’ll be twiddling your thumbs because you don't have a pipeline and you don't know who you're going to help next. The best way to minimize the roller coaster of real estate is to ensure you make a habit of doing the first job for at least three hours a day.
