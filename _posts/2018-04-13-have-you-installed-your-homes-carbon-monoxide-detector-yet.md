As of April 1, **it is now required of all Austin homes that have gas- or fuel-burning appliances to have a carbon monoxide detector installed in a proper location.**

This includes any homes that have an attached garage, so if your home is powered solely by electricity, this ordinance is still required. Specifically, the ordinance states that “A CO detector must be installed near a bedroom if there’s anything in your home that uses fuel or gas, as well as inside the bedroom, if the room has or connects to a room that has fuel or gas.”

The National Association of Fire Protection takes it a step further by recommending that you install your CO detector in a central location outside each sleeping area and on each level of the home.

If you’re getting your home ready for sale and you don’t have a CO detector installed, that will come up on an inspection report once you get an offer. More importantly, this is about you and your family’s safety.

**If you’d like more information about this ordinance, [this link](https://www.abor.com/new-carbon-monoxide-ordinance-effective-april-1/) will provide you with all the details.** These detectors aren’t expensive, and you can pick one up at Home Depot or just search for one on Amazon.

If you have any other questions for me about this ordinance or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
