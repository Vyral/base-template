<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Your credit report will contain three different credit scores. Here’s the reason why.</em></p>

You’ve probably heard of the three major credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Transunion, and Experian. They each report credit scores on your credit report, but you may have a different score with each company.

**Why does this happen?** Each company has a different matrix that they use to determine a score. With respect to these companies, the creditor that is reporting often doesn’t report to all three, so they might not all have the same information.

A particular mortgage or auto loan company may only report to Experian or Equifax. Consequently, that will have an effect on your score when you pull it yourself.

**We like to look at the middle number to get the score that’s used for your credit application.** If you have any questions or concerns about this topic or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today.
