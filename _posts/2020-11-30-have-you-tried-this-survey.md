<center><em>We&rsquo;ve been using this survey to gather information from our database.</em></center>

<br>Do you have a system for checking in with your database of clients and friends to get a feel of when they’re thinking of making a move? If not, now you do.

**Last year, we started an annual survey that we send out to our network asking a few simple questions about their knowledge of the current market and getting a feel of where they are in the process**.

We incentivize them to respond to the survey, which is a simple Google Form, with a giveaway. We let them know that filling out the survey gives them a chance to win a $100 Amazon gift card.

**In the form, we shared that interest rates are still at historical lows, inventory is lower than we’ve seen in a long time, and prices for homes are actually way up**. These are three great reasons to make a move if you need to be moving, which is why we shared them with our entire database.

We not only wanted to educate our database with this information, but we also wanted to ask some questions. Here are the very simple questions we included on our form:

* Are you thinking about selling in the next 12 months?
* If you’re not going to sell, why?
* Would you like to receive a free market report?

After you ask these questions, make sure that you put a space in there to contact their most recent contact information, including their name, phone number, email address, and home address.

We have already received 74 responses to the form already, and we’re keeping the contest up for a couple of weeks so we can get this form out to more people via our social media channels. **The entire goal is to find people who are thinking about moving now as well as keeping up with past clients who may need to buy or sell in the near future**.

If you have any questions for me about this survey or would like a copy of ours to see for yourself, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
