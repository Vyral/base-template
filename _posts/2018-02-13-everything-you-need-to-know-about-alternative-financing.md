Listen: There are loan programs for just about every person and every kind of deal these days.&nbsp;

We’re all familiar with the cookie-cutter loans such as FHA and Conventional, but today I’d like to talk about the other financing opportunities that are out there.

First of all, **despite what some may have thought, No-Doc and Low-Doc loans are still available.** These loans are great options for people who are self-employed or those who don’t want to go through all the hoops of obtaining a traditional mortgage.

There’s also the option of fix-and-flip or fix-and-hold loans. These are typically short-term interest-only rehab loans. If you get your property up to FHA standards, you will likely be able to convert it to a more traditional mortgage with a better financing rate.

**As always, there are still options for first-time homebuyers, including down payment assistance.** Also, the new home equity for purchase plan for buyers aged 62 and older is a great option with a loan down payment.

Even if you have low credit, I am in contact with a lender who provides loans to those with scores as low as 550. Really, there’s no reason you shouldn’t make your move and buy a home.

Don’t let financing issues dissuade you from pursuing a home purchase. Speak to a Realtor about your options and don’t take no for an answer. **I’ve got a list of lenders who offer alternative financing and would be happy to help with you.** If you would like access to that list, simply send me an email at [michael@makethemovetoflorida.com](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(109,105,99,104,97,101,108,64,109,97,107,101,116,104,101,109,111,118,101,116,111,102,108,111,114,105,100,97,46,99,111,109))) and I’ll send you out the PDF.&nbsp;
