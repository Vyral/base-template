What is a home inspection? Why is it important? Why is it so important to hire a good inspector? I’ll answer these questions for you today.

First, **what is a home inspection?**

A home inspection is when you hire an inspector to come to your property to inspect everything from the roof all the way down to appliances. The inspector then creates a report for you that summarizes their findings.

**Why is a home inspection important?**

{% include pullquote.html %}

There are actually two reasons. First, it gives you a clear understanding of the condition of the property that you’re about to purchase. No property is perfect, and there will be a list of deferred maintenance with any home, but you want to be able to plan financially to take care of anything found on the report. Second, there may be some big-ticket issues, such as roof, plumbing, or foundation issues that would be pretty costly to fix. Finding out about these issues allows you to negotiate a solution with the seller. You can either ask for a credit or a price reduction.

**Why is it so important to hire a good inspector?**

A good home inspector is going to be thorough and give you the report in a timely manner so you can use that to negotiate with the seller. They will also review the findings with you. You want to make sure they are going to be available to answer any questions that you might have as well.
