If you want to get your house sold quickly and for top dollar, you need to invest in it by focusing on the landscaping.

**Want to Sell Your Home?** <a href="http://www.damongettier.com/list/" target="_blank">Get the Value of Your Central or Southwest Virginia Home</a>

Does landscaping increase your home’s value? **Absolutely.**

Let’s say someone wants to sell their $6,000 used car. The first thing they’re going to do is get it detailed, right? It’s perfectly conceivable that they’ll spend as much as $300 for that detail. That’s 5% of the car’s overall value.

Unfortunately, people who are trying to sell their house don’t carry this same mindset when it comes to landscaping, even though their house might be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. You need to invest in your home to get it sold for top dollar. How do you do that? You do that by giving it instant curb appeal.

**Houses generate more offers and sell faster when the curb appeal is there.** When looking at a property, not many people get excited about the prospect of needing to spend $4,000 or $5,000 over the course of two or three years just to get the front yard looking right.

If you want to sell your house for its maximum value, you need to position it properly. Spend some money on the landscaping to upgrade the curb appeal so it makes the right impression on potential buyers. That way, they’ll be more eager to move forward. You may even get multiple offers.

If you have any questions about increasing your home's value or about the Roanoke market, give me a call or send me an email. I'd be happy to help!
