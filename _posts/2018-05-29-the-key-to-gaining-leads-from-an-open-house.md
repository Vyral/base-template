Open houses can go really well or really badly. In any case, there will be a lot of people walking through the house to check things out. 

So, how do you sit an open house to get leads? 

The first thing you need to focus on is having the right mindset. **You’ve got to believe that the connections you make at the open house will either translate to a sale or to a new lead.** After all, when you sit an open house you’re there for two reasons: To sell the house and to gain leads. 

Beyond simply having the correct mindset, it’s also important to have adequate signage. The more signage you have, the more traffic you’re going to see through the open house. Putting out a lot of signs can be time-consuming, but it will be well worth it in the end. 

**Door knocking is another great way to generate interest in the open house.** Even though the people you meet this way may not be looking for a home, it’s still good to make connections. They could make a great addition to your database. 

Now that we’ve discussed a few ways to prepare for the open house, let’s move on to what you should be doing the day of. First, make sure you arrive about 15 minutes early. There’s nothing worse than walking up to an open house to find people already waiting in the driveway.

**It’s also important to have a sign-in sheet prepared and readily available to everyone who passes through.** You can use anything from an iPad to pen and paper. All that matters is that you’re capturing the contact information of the people who attend. This includes their names, phone numbers, and email addresses. They should also provide the name of their agent. 

The goal of the open house is to connect with people on a personal level. Do not be overbearing as people tour the home. You want people to feel at ease. However, people who aren’t willing to fill out the sign in sheet shouldn’t be allowed to view the home. 

Once the open house is over, it’s good to take notes about the connections you made. And don’t forget to enter these people into your database. Of course, you should always keep in mind that you’re also there with the goal of helping to sell the home. If anyone visiting the home comes along with their agent, be sure to let the listing agent know. This creates a great opportunity to get some feedback about the house. 

So, in short, the goal of an open house is to make connections and then follow up with them. Open houses are a great way to get clients. Remember to keep your energy up and be yourself.
