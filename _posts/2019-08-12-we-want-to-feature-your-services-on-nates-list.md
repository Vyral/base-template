<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I keep a list of local companies that I know and trust after years of doing business in the area. Here are the kinds of businesses on my list.</em></p>

What is **Nate’s List**?&nbsp;

Basically, it’s **a referral network I’ve created that comprises every service provider I can refer to my past client database, current buyers, and anyone else who’s thinking about placing their home on the market.**&nbsp;

What kinds of services will you find on Nate’s List?&nbsp;

If you can think of a service that might benefit buyers and sellers, it’s probably on Nate’s List. We’re constantly welcoming new residents to the Valley, and many of them, for example, don’t have the slightest idea of where the best, most reputable dentists, pediatricians, and doctors are. In addition to those providers, Nate’s List features landscapers, pool builders, block layers, masons, and more.&nbsp;

**If you feel like you can bring value to buyers and/or sellers in the Valley, we want to know about you.** Here’s what I’d like you to do: Fill out this form and let us know what services you specialize in and what area of the Valley you work in. We have clients Valley-wide, and we’d be happy to point them in your direction.&nbsp;

After serving our local market for more than 33 years and owning RE/MAX Professionals for 19 of those years, **we have so many happy clients calling us everyday to inquire about specific services they need.** &nbsp;

So whether you work in one of the areas I’ve mentioned or you’re an electrician, roofer, painter, carpet cleaner, tile setter, or something else entirely, we invite you to reach out if you’re interested in lending your services to our team’s clients and expanding your business. This is an opportunity for those of us who all live and work in the Valley community to help one another.&nbsp;

I hope this message finds you well. If you have any questions or would like more information about this opportunity, please don’t hesitate to contact me. Otherwise, fill out the form here and together we can build one of the best referral networks in the Valley. I look forward to hearing from you\!
