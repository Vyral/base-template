The housing market has been facing a significant challenge for some time now—there simply aren’t enough homes for sale to meet buyer demand. However, with the recent increase in homes for sale and the drop in mortgage rates, the spring market could be the perfect time for you to sell your house.

According to the latest housing market trends report from Realtor.com, there were 65% more homes for sale in January 2023 compared to January 2022, totaling 248,000 more homes available to buy. Although this number is still 43% lower than it was before the pandemic from 2017 to 2019, **the increasing number of homes for sale is providing more options for homebuyers.**

With fewer homes available for purchase, some buyers are becoming frustrated and giving up on the home-buying process altogether. However, with the current low mortgage rates, more buyers are willing to jump back into the market. This presents a great opportunity for homeowners looking to sell, as the demand for homes is growing once again.

As spring approaches, home buyers are edging back into the market, eager to find their dream homes. **If you've been considering selling your house, now is the time to act.** With more homes for sale to meet the demand, the spring market could provide you with the perfect opportunity to sell your home quickly and at a good price.

The current state of the housing market provides a unique opportunity for homeowners looking to sell their homes. With more homes for sale and an increasing number of buyers, spring could be the ideal time to make your move.
