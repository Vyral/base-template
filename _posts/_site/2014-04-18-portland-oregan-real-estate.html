Trulia, a well-respected resource for this subject, recently wrote an article about the housing recovery and broke it down into<b> five very important factors:</b></span><br /><br />&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Home prices have gone up substantially</b></span>&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Delinquency and foreclosure rates</b></span>&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Existing home sales</b></span>&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>New construction starts</b></span>&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Employment rates for people between the ages 25-34</b></span>&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;<br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In addition, Trulia, Zillow and Forbes are all predicting rising interest rates as soon as the year ends. So, what does this mean for you as a buyer? <b>You should get it in gear!</b> Home prices will continue to rise and so are interest rates – the real estate experts are predicting that this won’t last much long.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As a seller, if you don’t like your values now, good things may happen if you wait. However do keep in mind that as interest rates rise, <b>you could potentially lose buyers and as values go up, more and more people will sell their homes.</b> This will increase your competition!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For more a more detailed look at these numbers, visit the main article <a href="http://www.trulia.com/trends/category/housing-barometers/" target="_blank">here</a>.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If you have any questions regarding our market or the surrounding area, please feel free to call or email us.
