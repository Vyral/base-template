<p><br /><br />Today I wanted to talk about why it’s critically important to be pre-qualified before looking at homes as a buyer. While I know getting a pre-approval on a mortgage is not as fun as shopping around for houses, it’s very important to find out what your financial situation is before we find the home for you. Otherwise, you could end up scrambling at the last minute and with our market’s low inventory, that lapse in preparation could cost you the house.<br /><br />Sellers also want to specifically see pre-approval letters from buyers up front; they may not even let you view their home without one, especially during the holiday season when time is precious. If you’re thinking about buying a house, be sure to check out our state of the art home search. Thanks and have a great day!</p>
