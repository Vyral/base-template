You have all been big supporters of my business over the years. You have either bought or sold a home with me or referred me to your friends, family, and other people that you know. For that, I am eternally grateful. You are my saviors, especially for my special-needs dogs who have expensive medical bills.

Because of that, I want to do something for you and let you know how much you’re appreciated by me. Our first client appreciation event will be on September 22 at noon at the Xscape Theater. We will have fun and games, snacks, drinks, and a great movie: Dog Days.

In addition, we’ll be giving away gifts and raffling off some great items for you all. I really want to see you all and let you know about some exciting developments that I have in store as well.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon!
