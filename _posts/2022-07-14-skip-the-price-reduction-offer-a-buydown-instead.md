We once worked with a seller who wanted to get top dollar for their listing, and they weren’t quite ready to reduce their price to attract buyers. Interest rates have been on the rise, which has many buyers worried about being able to afford their monthly payments. That led to some hesitating with their purchases or leaving the market entirely. In turn, there has been a slight slowdown in buyer demand, which affected our sellers. Instead of lowering their asking price, we helped our sellers lay out an option for their concerned buyers: **a buydown**.&nbsp;

Though many consumers aren’t even aware of it, a buydown can help you preserve your purchasing power. Buydowns entail letting the seller buy down the homebuyer’s interest rate instead of lowering the asking price. **Over the course of five years, the buyer would save around $46,000** just by taking half a point off of their interest rate.

It’s key to stay ahead of the market these days. If you’d like to learn more about the buydown strategy or other resources to help you adapt to our shifting market, give us a call or send us an email.
