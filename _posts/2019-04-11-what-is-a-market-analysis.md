Most sellers have probably heard the term “market analysis” thrown around quite a bit, but do you know what this phrase actually means?

In short, **a market analysis is a study of homes similar to yours which have sold in your area.** The data collected from such an analysis can be used to help you price your own property more effectively.

In order to gain the most comprehensive understanding of your home’s value, we review data not only from homes that have sold, but also those that are pending. That said, closed homes are our primary focus. 

Of course, a market analysis alone isn’t enough. **There are three main aspects of a home that will dictate its success on the market: condition, location, and price.** You obviously can’t control your home’s location, but you can adjust its condition and price. 

Our team would love the opportunity to help you achieve your real estate goals by following the steps and principles we’ve outlined today. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
