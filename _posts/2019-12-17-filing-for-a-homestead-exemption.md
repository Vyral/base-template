If you bought a home as a primary residence in 2019, you can file for a homestead exemption for the 2020 tax year.

This is something I recommend to all homeowners. **The exemption allows you to receive a discount on your property tax.** This way, your tax bill is regulated and it’s not climbing as rapidly. On that note, if you feel like your home’s property tax is too high, we can help you dispute it. Just reach out to us and we’d be happy to assist you.&nbsp;

Each county has different rules regarding homestead exemptions, but **Cherokee and Cobb counties also offer a senior exemption,** which you can file for if you’re over the age of 62. If you’re married, just one person has to be over the age limit to qualify. This exemption discounts about 75% from the school portion of your tax. Since the majority of your tax bill goes toward your school district, this is a massive discount.&nbsp;
