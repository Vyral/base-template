There are some amazing new home developments in Long Beach, LA, and Orange County in general. **If you’re planning to purchase a new home at any point in the near future, here are some tips to unlock some fantastic incentives that can save you thousands of dollars:**

**1\. Check for lender incentives.** Builders oftentimes have lenders that have financed other homes for sale in their development, and they’ve typically done all the due diligence as well—not to mention that their underwriters have already underwritten loans for them. A lot of the upfront work is taken care of and, as such, these lenders would love to help buyers purchase homes in the development. These special incentives encourage buyers to use them for financing and could add up to tens of thousands of dollars.

**2\. Look for close-out specials.** When a developer has just one or two remaining homes left, they are oftentimes anxious to get those properties sold quickly and are willing to offer closeout specials on these homes. These properties are usually gone within a matter of days, so make sure your agent is keeping up with the market.

**3\. Ask your Realtor to help negotiate the purchase price.** We recently helped a client purchase a new home where they are receiving over $23,000 in new-home incentives. It was a close-out special and we knew it wouldn’t last long.

**4\. Let your Realtor know you’re interested in a brand-new home.** If they know in advance, they can help you identify your best options. Then, they can be there to help you negotiate. If you go to a developer without a Realtor on your first visit, they won’t let you use one later in the process.

If you have any questions for me or would like a list of new home developments in the area, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
