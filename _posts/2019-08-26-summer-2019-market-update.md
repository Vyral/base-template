<p style="text-align:cener;"><em>Summer is winding down, but our market isn’t. Let’s discuss what’s happening now.</em></p>

We’re in the dog days of summer, but don’t think because the weather is set to cool down soon that our market is, as well. Homes are still selling, and many are getting multiple offers. We’re still in desperate need of inventory, so if you’re thinking of listing, don’t delay. Whether you’ve got plans to buy or sell, it’s a great time to make a move. And our team here at Carbutti Real Estate would be happy to help you make the most of your goals. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
