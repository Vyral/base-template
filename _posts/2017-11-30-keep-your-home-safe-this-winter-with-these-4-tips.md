Now that we’ve seen the temperatures dip closer to zero degrees and we’ve seen our first snowfall, here are a few items to take into consideration to protect your home from the effects of winter weather if you haven’t already.&nbsp;

First, **call your local HVAC company to inspect and service your furnace** to make sure it’s running at optimal efficiency. If you have electric baseboards, you can also turn them on and make sure all registers are producing heat. If they aren’t, call a local electrician to visit your home and make sure all wires are connected properly.&nbsp;

Second, examine all your gutters and make sure they’re clear of all debris or leaves. This will prevent any water blockage once spring arrives.

Third, remove the screens from all of your windows. This will allow 30% to 40% more natural light to enter your home, which will give it more solar heat and make it more energy-efficient.

Finally, **shut off all water valves connected to your outdoor spigots and store away any water hoses.** This will prevent any water breaks or leaks your home might incur if anything freezes. This will also spare your hoses from any cracking.&nbsp;

If you have any more questions about protecting your home this winter, you’re curious about what’s happening in our West Fargo market, or you’d like a list of &nbsp;vendors I use on a day-to-day basis, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be glad to help you.
