Today I’m joined by special guest and certified home inspector Barry Malesh to talk about things homeowners can do to prepare their property for the market.

**Little things like having the fireplace lit and ready to go before a buyer enters the home will make a great first impression.**

Another area to pay close attention to is the bathroom. Determine whether the showers and bathtubs are properly caulked. This prevents maintenance issues and makes your home look more appealing.

When buyers sense that a home is well-maintained, they will feel more inclined to put forward a strong offer. As a homeowner, it can be difficult to see which areas in your home might need improvements. It never hurts to have a friend over to look at your property with fresh eyes.

**Minor issues that might go unnoticed by a homeowner could be more obvious to a buyer**. And, even if you aren’t getting ready to sell, periodically fixing small problems with your home is a great way to keep your property in good shape.

As for the exterior of the home, one of the issues Barry notices regularly is raised downspouts. This, along with grading issues, can cause cracks in the foundation as water freezes and expands. **Your downspout should always be running away from your foundation, not toward it**.

If you’d like to get in touch with Barry, you can do so by calling (587) 582-5855 or by visiting **[www.northwestcalgary.abuyerschoice.com](http://www.northwestcalgary.abuyerschoice.com/)**.
