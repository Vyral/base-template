If you’re thinking of selling your home, there are a couple scenarios where it’s feasible to sell it as-is.&nbsp;

First though, the definition of “as-is” can vary from person to person, so make sure you and your listing agent have a mutual understanding of what your home’s as-is condition is and you don’t encounter any unwanted surprises.&nbsp;

Now, **if you inherit a property with a lot of problems that you have neither the time nor money to fix, this is a good opportunity to have an as-is sale.** Because of the work involved in fixing up the home, you’ll typically get an offer below market value, but you’ll also likely get a cash offer and be able to close quickly.&nbsp;

**If everything in your home is in good condition and you don’t want to make any major upgrades to it, this is another good opportunity to sell as-is.** However, you don’t want to use the term “as-is” when marketing the home to the open public, because buyers will assume something’s wrong with it. This option will allow you to still sell at a good price.&nbsp;
