Did you know that June is national homeownership month? There are plenty of benefits to owning a home, and I want to share a few of my favorites with you today:

**1\. Homeownership offers a sense of pride and satisfaction.** Since you own a place that’s uniquely yours, homeownership comes with plenty of opportunities to create joy. For example, you can personalize your space in any way you wish. Your home is your personal corner of the world that only you own. This knowledge creates a powerful emotional connection that will grow with you as you update your property.&nbsp;

**2\. You can get more involved in your community.** When you own a home, you’re putting your roots down in an area for at least a little while. It makes sense that you would want to do what you can to improve it. Eventually, you’ll meet like-minded people and get a true sense of your community.&nbsp;

**3\. Homeownership provides long-term financial stability.** Not only will you have a predictable monthly payment, but you’ll build equity with each one. As your home appreciates, you’ll grow even more equity. The average net worth of a renter is about $8,000, while homeowners have an average net worth of $300,000. That means homeowners have an average net worth 40 times higher than that of the average renter.&nbsp;

Homeownership is a great way to find increased happiness, satisfaction, and financial stability. If you’d like to purchase a home or have any questions, please call or email me. I am always willing to help\!
