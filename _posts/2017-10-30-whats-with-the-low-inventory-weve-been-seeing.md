According to a recent study, 47% of sellers are worried about selling their homes for fear of not being able to find a new one that meets their needs. The trick is to find creative ways to find sellers the homes they need.

Today’s topic of discussion will be the question, “Why are there so few homes for sale here in the Conejo Valley?”

First American did a study to find out why we have such a low amount of inventory. They found that the No. 1 reason had to do with the sellers. **47% of sellers are very uncomfortable about the inventory level,** and they don’t want to put their home on the market until they find the home of their choice. They’re ready to move, they’re just holding back. This has an effect on the inventory level all across the US.

**We’re seeing now that we have to become creative in how we get sellers to put their homes on the market.** We did just that with two clients of ours, David and Tessa. They, too, wanted to move, but had not found a home that had met their needs.

We knew where they wanted to live, so we worked with the title company, and we had them put together a report that showed homes that were on the view-side of the street, had a pool, and had a certain number of bedrooms and bathrooms. **We sent out a targeted letter to the specific homes that met this criteria,** and lo and behold, we heard back from one family who agreed to meet with us. We took our buyers there, and we’re proud to say they’re now in escrow and will be closing in three weeks.

If you know of anyone who has that same concern and are struggling to find the home that they’re looking for, give us a call. We can sit down and put together a game plan of how we can go find that house for them, even if it’s not on the market.
