As I’ve worked to grow my team, I've also had to let go of team members. This is never, ever any fun at all. 

However, by utilizing the 30-60-90 system when bringing on new team members, **we’re able to make sure agents have what it takes to be successful on our team by the time their 91st day rolls around**—for their first 90 days,they have to crush their 20% tasks. I can attest to the beauty of this system.

This system has allowed my behavioral style, which would have traditionally kept team members on because I care about them and don’t want to let them down, to be able to let them go. In the past, I would have allowed team members to stay because of my own personal feelings.

**I had to let go of a great person today who was all-in on our team and culture.** For the current role we need, though, they just weren’t a fit, which the 30-60-90 system showed me. 

It was about what the team needs. I feel that it’s my duty as a team owner to protect our bottom line. When we have the wrong person in a role, it really hurts the whole team. I had to remove my ego from the process in order to be the protector of the profit. **If our team isn’t profitable, there’s really no point in doing this.**

By following systems that are already created for us at Keller Williams, like the 30-60-90, we can move on faster when things aren’t working and continue forward, looking for the next great fit.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime or want to learn more about how our team works, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
