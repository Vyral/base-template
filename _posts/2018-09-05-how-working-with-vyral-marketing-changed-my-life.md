I just got back from an awesome mastermind in beautiful San Diego, California where got to spend time with Frank Klesitz, the CEO of Vyral Marketing, and a handful of other top agents across the country. Each of us has different things going on with our businesses, but there was a lot of commonality among us, and we’re all focused on being the best we can be when it comes to marketing our business.&nbsp;

That being said, I’ve been a Vyral Marketing client for a long time now, and **today I want to talk about the value of doing business with them and what that business entails.** Before I was their client, I knew that I wanted to implement video in my business, but I’m no “techie,” and I was spending so much time spinning my wheels trying to edit videos. Once I found Vyral, it changed my life.&nbsp;

People ask me all the time, “How do you measure your return on investment with Vyral Marketing?” **Their service costs about $500 per month, and in return I shoot two videos per month that get sent out to my database.** The numbers and statistics of these videos are tracked, so I get a report afterward of who clicked on what. This gives me a rundown of who to call and what to say when I call them. They also provide coaching and accountability. I know I have to get those videos done on time or they’ll be asking me where they are.&nbsp;

There are a couple other things included in the subscription that I didn’t even realize until recently.

{% include pullquote.html %}

First, we know our business is all about our database, and you’ll already have a database of your “mets.” These are your past clients, friends, family, or any buyer or seller leads you’ve had past conversations with. Categorize your “mets” and make a list of your centers of influence. Once you’ve categorized your “mets,” you’ll send them two videos a month.&nbsp;

For our database videos, I like to mix them up. For example, first I’ll send a market report. Then, because I’ve noticed that my database really likes videos about their community, I’ll send a video where I spotlight a local business or nonprofit. I want to provide my audience with content I know they’ll care about, and I can tell how many people click and share these videos.&nbsp;

**They also send monthly postcard to your database which is a snapshot of you and a video you’ve made.** You pay for the postage and the printing, but they’ll help create the postcard.&nbsp;

If you’re like I once was and you’re perhaps struggling to figure out a way to increase the touches to your database, this is the answer. After you make a video, you can send them a postcard that shows the picture of the video and offers them a way to subscribe to your videos and your website.&nbsp;

Lastly, **you have to call your mets, and having a fun way to call them is especially important.** Adding events to your business is the easiest way to do this. Make your phone calls ways of being a connector and adding value to them. They’re the ones who help our business grow, and referred business is the best kind of business.&nbsp;

If you have any more questions about working with Vyral Marketing or you’d like to connect with them, give me a call. I’d be happy to help.
