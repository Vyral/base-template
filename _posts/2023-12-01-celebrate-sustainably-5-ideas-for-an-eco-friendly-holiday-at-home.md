According to one survey, for example, 60% of respondents admitted to throwing away more than usual during the holiday months as they filled up their trash bins with uneaten food, wrapping paper, gift bags, and commercial packaging.1

The reality is, Americans routinely toss about 25% more trash between Thanksgiving and New Year’s than at any other time of year, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.2 In fact, we throw away so much ribbon during the holidays—around 38,000 miles’ worth—that the discarded material could easily run more than one and a half times around the Earth.3

As our holiday schedules grow busier, many of us also forget to take simple steps at home to shrink our carbon footprints or prepare for a more energy-efficient winter.&nbsp;

Luckily, it’s not that hard to shift our habits and plan for a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly celebration. Here are five ideas for ringing in the holidays this year without overstressing Mother Nature.



**1\. PREP YOUR HOME FOR WINTER**

Depending on the amount of time and resources you have available, you could cut your carbon emissions significantly this season just by winterizing your home.

Investing in a more sustainable way to warm up your surroundings—such as a geothermal heat pump or solar heating—could be especially impactful if your current HVAC is underperforming and you can afford a more expensive system.4 Replacing old appliances or things like chronically leaking windows with newer, more energy-efficient solutions can also save you money over the long term.5 Plus, you may be able to claim a federal energy-efficient tax credit for up to 30% of your investment.6

You don't necessarily have to spend a lot upfront, though, to prep your home for winter. Even simple tweaks—such as sealing windows and doors or upgrading to more energy-efficient window coverings—can lower your energy consumption and reduce your carbon footprint.7

Incorporating environmentally healthier habits into your routine can also make a meaningful difference. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, for example, dialing back your thermostat by as little as seven to 10 degrees for eight hours a day can trim up to 10% from your bills.8&nbsp;

Consider a home energy assessment to help you pinpoint what needs fixing. Depending on your comfort level, you can audit your home's energy efficiency yourself with the help of the Department of Energy's DIY Guide.9 Or you can hire a professional, such as a home energy auditor or weatherization contractor.10 Call us for a recommendation or personal referral.



**2\. DECORATE SUSTAINABLY**

Decking your home's halls is one of the most jolly seasonal activities of all. There's something special about gathering 'round with friends and family and relaxing in the comforting glow of a festively decorated space.&nbsp;

But since so much of the holiday-themed decor that's sold in stores is notoriously disposable, it can be a challenge to spruce up your home sustainably. Cheaply produced and rarely recyclable, store-bought decorations are often made with plastic, styrofoam, and other environmentally unfriendly materials that can crowd landfills for generations.2&nbsp;

Luckily, you don't have to trade style for sustainability when making your holiday decor. Thrifting is still in vogue, so consider crafting new and on-trend decorations out of secondhand finds or upcycling items already in your closet.&nbsp;

For example, you could transform an ill-fitting sweater into a holiday-themed pillow, turn teacups into candles, or turn leftover shipping boxes into creative decorations. Alternatively, natural decor foraged from your yard—such as dried leaves, flowers, pine cones, and branches—can make for especially beautiful wreaths and centerpieces.&nbsp;

If you do purchase store-bought decor, proactively look for the most environmentally friendly options. LED lights are now ubiquitous in stores and use far less energy than incandescent versions.11 Similarly, if you celebrate with a Christmas tree, think twice about choosing an artificial option. Plastic trees may be reusable, but natural trees are generally thought to have a smaller carbon footprint.1



**3\. CUT BACK ON HOLIDAY SHOPPING**

Shopping online or at the mall may be convenient, but it can be costly for the environment. The greenhouse emissions from shipping and transportation alone add up fast, as do the emissions that are produced when an item is first made. According to the online consignment and thrift store, thredUp, 4.5 billion pounds of carbon emissions could be saved if every American bought just one used item instead of new this year.12&nbsp;

Splurging on brand-new products also makes it more likely that the gently used but still functional items that you've got at home will wind up in the trash.&nbsp;

Rather than buy new, check vintage stores and consignment shops for unique gifts that you and your recipient can both feel good about. According to research by thredUp, most people are open to receiving gently-used presents, especially if they're socially-conscious members of Gen Z.12 Alternatively, consider regifting items that you haven't used, upcycling something you own, or try crafting gifts by hand.&nbsp;

Giving away special experiences, such as concert tickets or community memberships, may also be a more eco-friendly option. So is donating to a favorite charity in a gift recipient's name or offering gifts of time, such as promising to help a loved one clean out their garage or fill their freezer with home-cooked meals.&nbsp;

Research shows that gift recipients often value thoughtful gifts with sentimental value, especially if they're homemade or nostalgic or will provide them with a unique experience.13&nbsp;

And if you prefer to buy something tangible, look to local businesses that source or manufacture their goods nearby. Craft fairs and community markets are a great place to start. Or, give us a call and we’d be happy to share a list of our favorite local stores, depending on the type of gift and your budget. We make an effort to patronize the independently-owned shops and restaurants around town and would love to share our recommendations.



**4\. GREEN YOUR HOLIDAY DINNER**

Do you hail from a family of passionate carnivores? If so, trading your meat for a vegetarian option may seem like a step too far—especially for a holiday dinner.&nbsp;

But swapping your meat for beans isn't the only way to “'green” your holiday meal. For example, you can consciously source your meat from ethical sellers, prioritize local producers for seasonal sides, and serve enough filling vegetables to satisfy a large portion of your appetite.14&nbsp;

You can also minimize food waste by planning ahead so that you don't cook more than necessary. Check out the Natural Resources Defense Council's dinner party “Guest-Imator” to help you narrow down how much food you and your guests will actually need.15 In addition, consider using the USDA's FoodKeeper App to help track safety recalls and set up calendar reminders for expired food.16&nbsp;

Once you're finished eating, clear the table immediately and either freeze the leftovers you'd like to keep or send guests home with reusable containers. Or, if you have untouched food that's still whole or in unopened packaging, take it to a local food bank or homeless shelter. We’d be happy to share a list of options in our area.



**5\. DONATE OR RECYCLE WHAT YOU CAN**

Once the festivities are over, the real work on behalf of Mother Nature begins. This is the time when taking a few minutes at the end of your holiday celebration to swiftly collect wrapping paper and ribbons, unwanted packaging, and other discarded items can make a real environmental difference by reducing what you send to landfills. Your goal should be to reuse what you can and compost or recycle what's left over.&nbsp;

For example, if you upgrade any electronic gadgets over the holidays, you can conserve resources and limit pollution by donating or properly recycling your old versions. The U.S. Geological Survey estimated that recycling a million laptop computers could help save the energy equivalent of 3,500 homes' annual usage of electricity.16 Similarly, the EPA says that recycling one million phones can help salvage 35,000 pounds of copper, 772 pounds of silver, 75 pounds of gold, and 33 pounds of palladium.17

It can also help to reimagine new ways to make old traditions more eco-friendly. For instance, if lighting candles is part of your holiday celebration, consider choosing beeswax candles this year instead of the typical paraffin wax, which is a petroleum derivative. Not only are they cleaner burning and less toxic, but the leftover wax is biodegradable and can be composted, unlike traditional candle wax.18

There are also plenty of earth-friendly ways to dispose of a natural Christmas tree without kicking it to the curb. Trees that are sent to landfills release a potent greenhouse gas called methane.19 So, it’s important to properly dispose of a live tree, if you have one, so it can be recycled or composted. If you’re not sure how, reach out for a list of local options.
