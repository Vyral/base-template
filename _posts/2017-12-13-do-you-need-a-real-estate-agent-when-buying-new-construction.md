Why should you have a buyer’s advocate with you when you look at new construction homes? Why not just work with the builder’s agent?&nbsp;

It’s important to remember that the agent at the new construction site is there to protect the builder’s best interests, not yours. **Your buyer’s agent will have your best interests at heart.&nbsp;**

A buyer’s agent will help you with any hiccups in the process. We will also negotiate the best deal possible for you.&nbsp;

**The best part is that we do all of this for free.** You can work with a buyer’s agent at no cost to you.&nbsp;
