Today, I’m excited to sit down and talk with Phil Long, a great member of the Dave Hooke Team. We’ll discuss why he joined the team, what he does, and what’s in store for the future. Let’s get started\!

**So, Phil, how did you first become interested in joining the Dave Hooke Team?**

I joined the team in 2019, but I’ve known Dave for a long time. I knew from personal experience that he was a stand-up guy, and I knew his business focused on giving back to the community. Those values lined up with mine, so it seemed like a natural fit.&nbsp;

**You have a different role here than a real estate agent. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do?**

Dave and I formed a company together called Offer PA, and its goal is to give sellers more options than listing their homes on the open market. My job is to offer to buy sellers’ homes in as-is condition for cash. For a seller who has a highly damaged property or needs to sell quickly, Offer PA could be exactly what they need.

**As you’ve settled into the team, what’s your favorite part?**

I love our morning positive focus meetings. We do them every morning, and people can talk about something as simple as what they had for dinner last night or something as fantastic as the birth of a new child. Either way, it’s a great way to keep up positive energy and get everyone ready for the day.&nbsp;

**What would you say your biggest challenge is on a day-to-day basis?**

There’s always something new to learn, and there are always ways to make what we’re doing more efficient. However, it comes down to the little things we have to do every day because they are the foundation for everything else.&nbsp;

**Finally, what are you looking forward to in the next few years?**

I’m focused right now on building Offer PA and helping more homeowners. There’s a lot going on in this market, so I want to give my best to people every day.&nbsp;

I would like to thank Phil once again for joining me today. If you have any questions for Phil or about real estate in general, please call us at 717-216-0860 or email me at [dave@davehooketeam.com](mailto:dave@davehooketeam.com).&nbsp;
