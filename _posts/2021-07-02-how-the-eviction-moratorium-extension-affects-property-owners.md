You may have heard that the eviction moratorium has been extended, and today I’ll be talking about what that means for real estate investors in the Honolulu area.&nbsp;

**The moratorium that relates to property management and real estate sales is 127-A-30.** It means the property management moratorium section has been updated or extended 30 times. However, other parts of the moratorium have been extended more than this.

The eviction moratorium has been extended until August 6, and this will be the last extension given. Many Realtors and property owners have been wondering what this means for tenants if they decide to sell, and **the extension states that month-to-month tenants can be given a 45-day notice upon closing the sale.**

If you have any questions about the moratorium extension or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
