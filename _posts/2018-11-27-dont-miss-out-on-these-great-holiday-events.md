What are your favorite holiday traditions? My family and I love to go and see The Young Americans perform at La Mirada Theatre; it really helps to put us in the Christmas spirit each year. If you’re looking for some great festivities to enjoy this winter season, check out our list or follow us on our social media pages for upcoming events that are guaranteed to put you in the holiday spirit throughout December. Maybe you’ll find a new tradition you can look forward to every year like we do.
