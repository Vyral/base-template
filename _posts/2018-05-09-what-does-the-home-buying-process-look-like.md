A friend of mine recently told me that he was confused about certain aspects of the home buying process. That inspired today’s topic: an overview of the buying process laid out in a 12-step blueprint.

1. **Consultation with an agent.** In this meeting, we’ll discuss your needs and wants and create a blueprint of your home buying plan.
2. **Pre-approval**. Getting a pre-approval with a lender is the best way to know what exactly you qualify for and, more importantly, what payments you’re comfortable with. Sometimes, what you qualify for is more than what you’d like to pay each month.
3. **Select and review properties**. This is done either automatically through my website, or we can go right to the MLS. You can enter in your own criteria and see what comes up. If anything new comes on the market, or if prices change so that they match your criteria, I’ll send you an update.
4. **Write the offer**. Once you find a property that’s right for you, we’ll first do a quick market analysis so we know how to gauge your offer; you don’t want to overpay.
5. **Negotiate the offer**. Oftentimes, offers aren’t accepted as written, and the seller will present a counter offer. I will try to get as much information up front so that we know about their situation. This way, we can reduce the number of counter offers.
6. **Go under contract**. We’re officially in the position where no one else can come in and sneak the house from underneath us.
7. **Earnest money**. When we write the offer, the earnest money is typically attached to the offer. There are a couple different strategies that we use for the earnest money, depending on the situation.
8. **Seller disclosure deadline**. This is the date by which the sellers have to give us all the information to help with our due diligence. They’ll give us a six-page seller’s property condition disclosure which will relay the condition of the house, including the HVAC system, electrical, plumbing, the foundation, and more. They’ll give us all the information we’ll need to let us make an informed decision on whether we want to go through with this property.
9. **Due diligence deadline**. This is one of the most important steps. Section 8 in the real estate purchase contract goes into detail about some of the things you may want to perform due diligence on. It’s your right to analyze the property and make sure it’s a good fit for you. I strongly recommend getting a home inspection done; I can refer you to a couple companies that I trust.
10. **Financing and appraisal deadline**. This is the deadline by which we need to have the appraisal back. You’ll also verify that the loan terms are acceptable to you by this time.
11. **Settlement and closing**. Settlement is when we go to the title company and sign all the paperwork. Closing is what it funds and records with the county.
12. **Possession**. This is negotiated between the time the offer is written and accepted, so we’ll know exactly when you’ll actually get the keys. Sometimes, it’s as soon as it records, and other times, it’s a day or two later.
