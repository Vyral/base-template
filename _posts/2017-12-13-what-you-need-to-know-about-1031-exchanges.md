One of the most common practices among many of our investors is a 1031 exchange. What is a 1031 exchange, though?

When you buy one or more investment properties and you’re looking to sell that property so you can buy another one, **the 1031 exchange allows you to avoid paying taxes on your gains.&nbsp;**If you have a cost basis of $1 million in a commercial building and you sell it for $1.5 million, for example, instead of paying the capital gains on it like you would with stocks or other asset classes, you can defer them by using a 1031 exchange. &nbsp;

The biggest problem with 1031 exchanges is what’s called their “identification phase.” Many investors who work with us like to find the asset they want to buy next before selling their original asset. Once we help them locate that asset, we write an offer that’s contingent upon the sale of their original asset.

In residential real estate, it’s common to have to sell your house in order to buy a new one. In commercial real estate, your offer can be contingent on the sale of 15 properties that are going to auction and are set to close on or before then. Once you have that accepted offer on the new contract, you’d list the property that you have.

**Whichever step you take first often depends on the desirability of your original property’s location**. If you have a scattered site portfolio, which includes duplexes and four-unit properties all across Columbus, that may take a long time to sell. In this case, I’d encourage you to have a purchase contract already accepted. If you have a super desirable property you know you can sell right away, however, the situation is different.

What happens during a 1031 exchange?

First, as I already mentioned, you have the identification phase, which typically lasts 45 days. During this phase, you identify the properties you’re interested in. After you’ve identified them, you have up to 180 days to close on them.

Once you sell your property, you have to place the funds from that sale with a 1031 intermediary, which is someone who looks after those funds. Typically in Columbus, we work with title companies who handle both closings and have their own 1031 intermediary. This process usually costs just under $1,000, which may sound like a lot, but **it’s much cheaper than the thousands upon thousands you’d pay in capital gains.**

We’ve helped many people handle 1031 exchanges, whether they’ve needed to buy or sell first, so if you have any more questions about them, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help.
