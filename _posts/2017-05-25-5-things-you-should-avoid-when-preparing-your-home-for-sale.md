Here are a few things you should avoid if you’re preparing your home for sale this summer:
<br>
<br>**1. Wallpaper:**If you have a 15- or 20-year-old home, it was probably originally a model by the builder and has a lot of wallpaper. This is unfortunate because wallpaper is out of fashion right now. Don’t replace any wallpaper you have. If you have to make any repairs, I recommend you remove it instead.
<br>
<br>**2. Lavish light fixtures:** Big, ornate light fixtures act as detractors for your home. You’re better off replacing them with a light fixture that’s more simply designed.

<br>**3. Replacing carpet with more carpet in the active living spaces:** This means the hallways, the bathrooms, the laundry rooms, and the family/dining rooms. Hard surfaces are trending much better for these areas, and many builders install hardwood floors during new construction because it’s the least costly flooring material they can put down.
<br>
<br>**4. Having big, ornate trees and bushes in your landscaping:** People here in Arizona favor a simpler, lower density landscape with a minimal amount of vegetation because they’re more cognizant of how much water it takes to maintain that type of landscape.
<br>
<br>**5. Pools:** Be mindful of what kind of return on investment a pool will bring. Now that we’re heading into June, pools are obviously more in-demand here in Tucson, but they can also be a double-edged sword. Installing a custom pool with a spa will likely cost you anywhere from $25,000 to $40,000, but your return on that will be at the most 25% or 30%. Our society is growing more and more mobile, so newer buyers are more likely to settle for having a community pool in their area than take on the responsibility of maintaining their own.
