Today I want to talk about the pros and cons of being a solo agent versus being on team.

If you’re a solo agent, **you’re completely on your own**. You don’t have any predetermined structure or confines to adhere to unless you create them. You also get to pick and choose all of your branding and strategies, and there’s a lot of freedom and flexibility on how you choose to run your business.

A lot of these things are also cons if you’re a solo agent. You’re completely on your own, and sometimes this business can be a lonely business. You gotta have some type of structure in place in order to be productive. Picking and choosing all of your branding and marketing strategies can be distracting and **you could waste a colossal amount of money in that process**.

The pros of being on a team are that there’s structure and accountability, proven systems and models, and the ability to take vacation time uninterrupted. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been on vacation in the past, negotiating a contract and interrupted family time in the process.

Some of the cons of being on a team are some teams are all about the team leader and not the individual. Some teams out there are all about big numbers and seeing what they can get out of your, whereas the right team is more focused on the individual. They’re more focused on what they can do to help the individual accomplish their goals within the organization.

On our team, **we specifically focus on helping our team members set a goal and put together a step-by-step game plan** that we hold them accountable to so they can ultimately hit that net income goal that they have. At the end of the day, it’s all about the net income and the quality of life that you have in terms of why you get into real estate.

So, if you’re looking for a change in your career, more free time, a better income, or something along those lines and want to explore that option more, I’d love to have a conversation with you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out and talk further about it. I’d be happy to help!
