Are you thinking about buying an investment property in Charleston? If so, know there are three things you absolutely need to consider first:&nbsp;

**1\. History.** Has the property increased in value over the last 10 years? If it has appreciated historically, chances are it will continue to do so.&nbsp;

**2\. Location.** This is crucial in all facets of real estate. If you buy a property in a great location, you are increasing your opportunity to rent it at the highest rate possible and keep it occupied consistently.&nbsp;

**3\. Patience.** This is the most important thing to ask yourself: “Do I have the patience to keep this property for at least 10 years?” Historically, if you hold a property at any point in a 10-year period in the real estate cycle, you can sell it for a gain. Make sure you’re capable of this and ready for it.&nbsp;
