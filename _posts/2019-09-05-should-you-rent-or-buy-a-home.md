How do the benefits of owning a home compare to those of renting a home in our market? Find out here.

Today I’m joined by Justin Allender from Success Mortgage Partners to discuss the benefits of homeownership compared to renting a home.&nbsp;

According to Justin, one of the biggest benefits of owning your own home is that **you’re locking in your rent payment for the next 30 years.** Often, landlords continue to raise rents each year, sometimes making rent payments hard to budget. Having a fixed payment means that you can plan your finances around your monthly mortgage payment.

Additionally, **homeownership allows you to write the property off your taxes.** Of course, it’s wise to speak with your accountant or CPA to learn about this in more detail, but many have taken advantage of the tax benefits of owning a home.

Someone who pays $1,500 a month in rent will, in five year’s time, have paid $90,000 to their landlord. If you buy a $200,000 home instead, you could begin building equity over those five years—about $30,000, assuming even a low appreciation rate (**over the last few years, we’ve seen upwards of 6% to 9% appreciation rates\!**).

So overall, homeownership is a great way to start saving and putting money into an appreciating asset. Plus, having a safe place to come home to at night is no small thing for you and your family.

If you have any questions about whether it’s a better choice to rent or buy a home given your unique situation, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We hope to hear from you soon\!<br>&nbsp;
