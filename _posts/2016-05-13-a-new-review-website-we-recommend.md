{% include youtube.html %}As part of our commitment to customer service, we wanted to share with you a website we found that we think could be a great resource for any consumer.

The website is [www.reviews.com](http://www.reviews.com)

What they do on this site is review various products and industries, and they state that it’s unbiased research. We like that!

We found reviews.com when looking at homeowner’s insurance. They did a review of 99 homeowners insurance companies and used the industry’s own rating standards to rank these companies. We think it’s a value to you as anyone buying or renting a home who is looking for homeowner’s insurance, HO6 insurance, or renter’s insurance.

To learn more about homeowner's insurance specifically, check out this article.
