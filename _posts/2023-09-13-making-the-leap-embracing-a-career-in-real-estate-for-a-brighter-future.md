Are you at a crossroads in your career, wondering if there's something more fulfilling out there for you? I can relate because I've been there too. I'm Drew Richmond, the team leader of the Dave Hook Real Estate Team at Keller Williams of Central P.A. Today, I want to share with you how a single question changed my life forever and led me to a rewarding career in real estate.

It all began during a period of transition in my professional life when I was grappling with a sense of purposelessness in my work. That's when someone asked me a question that would ultimately reshape my future: "Have you ever considered a career in real estate?"

At first, I was hesitant and skeptical. I was accustomed to the security of a steady salary and traditional benefits, such as a 401(k) and employer-paid health insurance. Moreover, I had recently relocated to a new area, where I had yet to establish connections or gain the trust of potential clients for their real estate needs. The doubt and fear surrounding this major life decision seemed overwhelming.

However, I realized that **the only way to overcome my apprehensions was to seek guidance** and gather the information I needed to make an informed choice. That's when I made a pivotal decision—I booked a strategy session with Dave Hook, an experienced real estate professional.

During our session, Dave provided me with invaluable insights and a clear roadmap for success as a real estate agent. It was a turning point that enabled me to take the necessary steps to achieve my goals.
