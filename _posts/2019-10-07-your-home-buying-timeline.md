How long does it take to buy a home? That’s the question I’ll answer in today’s message. The length of your home purchase depends on how you purchase it. If you pay in cash, you can buy a home in as little as seven days. If you use a mortgage, it can take anywhere from three to eight weeks to get that mortgage processed. You also have to consider how long it will take you to find the right home, which might add a couple weeks to your timeline. If you don’t include the length of your home search, however, a good rule of thumb is to expect your purchase to take about 30 days. If you have any other real estate questions I can answer, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak to you.&nbsp;
