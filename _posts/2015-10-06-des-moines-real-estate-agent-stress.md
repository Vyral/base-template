**Today, we're going to talk about our top tips for a stress-free moving day.**

**First of all, start early.** Don't leave everything for the last minute and get overwhelmed. Being overwhelmed just makes the entire process more stressful than it needs to be. Start early and **do one room at a time.** It will be more manageable, and you won't feel overwhelmed by the amount of stuff you have to pack.

**While you're packing one room at a time, keep all the rooms together.** Don't have a bunch of miscellaneous boxes that aren't labeled. Put your kitchen things in boxes labeled "kitchen," your living room things in boxes labeled "living room," and so on.

**While you're packing, however, make sure you leave important documents out.** You don't want to have to unpack everything to find your checkbook so you can pay the mover. **Leave out things like credit cards, bills, or anything you may need to give your lender at the last minute, such as tax forms.**

**If you're moving with kids, it's a good idea to take the kids over to the new house while it's still vacant.** Have them "pick" their rooms (even though you probably already know where they're going to go), and pick the room color. Doing this helps your kids get excited about the move. When you are moving, pack some snacks and have activities to keep them focused so you can do what you need to do. **If you can, have grandma come out for the day and keep the kids busy.**

**Finally, if you're moving with pets, you need to plan ahead.** You may need someone to watch your pets. Leave their food and toys out so they have something to do while you are moving.

**Those are our top tips for a stress-free move!** If you have any questions, please give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
