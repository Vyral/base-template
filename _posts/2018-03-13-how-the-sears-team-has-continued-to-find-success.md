I had a great Q&A recently with Liz and Amanda of the Sears Team. We talked to them a little bit about why they chose Keller Williams and where that decision has brought them to today.

**Why did you choose Keller Williams?**<br><br>“When I ran across Keller Williams, I wasn't even looking for another brokerage. I was very successful at Re/MAX and brought my dad on as a buyer agent. He told me that there had to be a better brokerage out there that offers more support and training to get you to the next level. I sat down with the team leader at KW and the more he talked, the more I was impressed with the way the company was structured. The coaching is phenomenal and the interaction between the management, the training staff, and the agent was something I had never seen before. What I love most about Keller Williams is the support that it has provided me which has allowed me to get to the next level.”

The one thing they value the very most is excellent communication. What we've done ist tailored our business and our process so that our clients always understand each step. We like to keep them updated throughout the entire process so that they feel comfortable and never lost. We also invest our time in attending seminars, training, and coaching so that we can continue to provide the very best service along with our communication.
