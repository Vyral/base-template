If you have parents who are thinking of downsizing and you want to help them through the process, what kind of repairs should be made to their home before they list it?

As our parents get older, it’s important to think of this kind of thing ahead of time rather than wait until the last minute.

Most of your parents’ financial well-being is likely tied into that house, meaning they don’t have a lot of cash reserves to throw around. That’s why, when my team and I work with clients in this type of situation, **we usually focus on small remodeling projects that will make the home look more appealing (repainting, recarpeting, etc.).** You can also choose to sell the home as-is at a discount.

In either case, it’s important that your loved ones don’t get taken advantage of in this situation, which is why we also offer a few different selling options to our clients, from guaranteed sale programs to instant-offer buyouts to a more traditional listing.

If you have any questions about this topic or you need help preparing your parents’ house for sale, don’t hesitate to reach out to us so we can sit down and discuss your family’s options. We look forward to speaking with you.
