*Mortgages rates reached all-time lows, then immediately started to climb. Here’s why that happened. *

Rates have been dropping over the last month, and many people have been refinancing their mortgages to lock in lows of 3.25% and 3.5%. They’ve been dropping in response to the volatility in the stock market and the fear of the economy slowing down in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;

Last week, however, rates started to climb back up. Why did that happen? **Usually, when the yield on the Treasury goes up, mortgage rates go up too, and when yields go down, mortgage rates follow suit.&nbsp;**

Currently, the yield on the Treasury is as low as it's been in recent memory—well under 1%. Counterintuitively, rates have risen though, and that’s due to several factors. One of the largest factors is that **lenders are overloaded.** A flood of applications has come their way, and they simply don’t have enough operational capacity to process all of these in a timely manner. This problem will be only exacerbated by the need for more people to work from home.

**An artificial rate hike allows lenders to curb the volume of refinances** (if a sizable chunk of existing mortgages get paid off through refinance, lenders would be seeing less in profits).&nbsp;

**There’s a lot of uncertainty, but we’re likely looking at low or negative growth in our economy over the next six months,** whichsupports the theory that, without any underlying inflation, mortgage rates should remain stable and low.&nbsp;

If you missed the wave of low rates, you’re more than likely to have a second chance. When everything settles down, and once the banks have a chance to process their loans, we’ll probably see another dip in the rates.&nbsp;

The best thing you can do is get pre-approved now so you’re prepared to take advantage when rates drop again. As always, reach out if you have any questions on this or other real estate topics. I hope you stay safe, and I look forward to hearing from you.&nbsp;
