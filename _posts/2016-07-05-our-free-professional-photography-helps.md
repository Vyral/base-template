I wanted to take a minute today to talk about something I'm really passionate about - real estate photography.

Putting it plain and simple, most real estate photography just sucks. It looks like it was taken with an iPhone and doesn't even utilize the full 25 pictures allowed by the MLS. The most important thing with bad photos is the location and arrangement not making sense to a buyer. You've probably seen it in a listing and found yourself wondering where this or that bedroom is, why you only see pictures of one bathroom, and so on.

We hire a professional photographer here in Roseville for our listings, and he generally gives me about 35 to 40 pictures to choose from. We do a walkthrough video tour as well so potential buyers can see exactly how the house flows and how each room relates to each other. For unique properties requiring aerial views, we actually use a drone. We recently had a unique property with a canyon behind the house and very dramatic views that we wouldn't have been able to capture without the drone. We had another that was just off the ocean, and we were able to show how close the home was to the ocean with a drone fly-in.

The more unique your property is, the more special the photography needs to be, and that's a free service we offer. If you'd like to see some examples of our professional photography, or you have any questions about how we utilize photography, don't hesitate to reach out to us.
