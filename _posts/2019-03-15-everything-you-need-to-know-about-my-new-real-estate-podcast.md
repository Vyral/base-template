I’ve got exciting news to share: I have partnered with WHO Radio hosts Van Harden and Bonnie Lucas to create a new real estate podcast!

There aren’t many people out there who know more about what’s on the mind of Central Iowans than these two, so I am so excited to have the chance to cover our local market conditions with their help.

**But breaking real estate news isn’t all we cover in this great new podcast**. We also share tips for buyers and sellers on how best to navigate today’s market, as well as information regarding today’s most innovative real estate programs.

We’ll be posting episodes from this podcast soon, so be sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel. **You won’t want to miss these insightful updates**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
