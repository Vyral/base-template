As some of you prepare to list your home in January, I wanted to reach out today and talk about the importance of pricing your home correctly. Many people think they can get a better price than the home that sold across the street.

If you price your home accurately, it will sell faster and for more money. According to the Tucson MLS, homes that sell without a price adjustment sell within 33 days on the market at 98% of list price. Homes with just one price adjustment are on the market for 110 days and sell for 96% of list price.

Clearly, the Tucson MLS data reveals overpricing your house in our market will cause you to be on the market for three times as long and get you 2% less money. Pricing your home correctly the first time is the best way to be successful when selling your home.

Before you list your property, consult with a professional. Hire someone who understands the market, your neighborhood, and will price your house properly. This is extremely important!

If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
