Today I’m joined by our team’s top designer and stager, Shani Weiss, to continue our discussion on styling a home. For this segment of our conversation, we’ll be specifically focusing on the importance of coffee tables.

At this point, you may be wondering: **What makes a coffee table so important to selling a home?**

What most people don’t realize is that coffee tables serve as the focal point for socialization in a room. This is why people spend so much time and energy determining what to put on top of this central surface. Or, in many cases, what not to put on it.

Some will advise you to remove every single personal item and knick-knack from on top of your coffee table. However, a completely empty coffee table will look adequate at most. And at the Stacy Esser Group, we don’t settle for things being “just fine.” We believe that homes should look phenomenal, not mediocre.

The best way to style a coffee table is actually to, first of all, **make it reflect your personality, and second, to pick four points that lead to all other visual aspects of the room**. You can see how this works in a real-life application by referencing the video above.

From a design perspective, everything you place on a coffee table should be done with purpose. This is certainly the case for how Shani approaches staging projects. She keeps in mind not only how the space will appear in person, but how decor pieces will impact the way a space will look in photographs.

<br>It’s also important that staging not interfere with the seller’s lifestyle while they’re still occupying the home. This is why Shani finds it so important to get to know clients. Forming this kind of organic connection will **foster a more successful and pleasant experience for everyone involved.** Then when it does come time to go live on the market, a successfully staged home will tend to sell quickly and for top dollar.
