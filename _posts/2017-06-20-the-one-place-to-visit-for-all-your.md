Lighting is one of those things you don’t think about until you’re in need of it. Here’s who we recommend you get your next lamp or light fixture from.

We are excited to be joined today by our friend Derek Nielson with Lighting Specialists to talk a little bit about what they do and how they help new and existing homeowners alike with their lighting needs.

You might be tempted to go to a big box store like Home Depot or Lowe’s, but there are certain advantages that come with working with someone like Derek that you won’t get there.

The first is the selection. Everything is high quality, and the selection is unmatched. Their pricing is another advantage because **most of the time, they can get you a better deal on a lamp or lighting fixture than you would get at a big box store.**

Finally, their customer service is second to none. Derek, or one of his coworkers, will ask questions and listen to your answers to determine exactly what your needs are. They are very patient, and definitely in it for the long haul. **I just got a new fixture for my dining room here, and Derek was very patient with me.**

If you have any questions for Derek or anyone else at Lighting Specialists, give them a call at <a href="tel:801-566-1324">801-566-1324</a> or visit their website <a href="http://lightingspecialists.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

If you have any real estate questions or needs, you can always give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
