<br>There has been a lot of bad news intruding on our daily lives lately. Today you have a chance to do something completely different, as I have some great news to share.

**What would you do with $5,000?** I want to invite you to enter the Maxwell 2020 Dream Vacation Sweepstakes. The previous year's winner came from our office, so maybe this year it could be you.

**All you need to do is <u><a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2I6dcQx">follow this link</a></u> and fill out the information**. There is no purchase necessary and no obligation required. If you win, you’ll get $5,000 to plan the vacation of your dreams.

I’ll be holding weekly draws for just my clients and MaxWell is also holding smaller monthly drawings, so enter today to increase your odds of winning.

If you have any questions about real estate in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
