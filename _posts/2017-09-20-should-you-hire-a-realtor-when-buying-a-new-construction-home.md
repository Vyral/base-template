I’m here today to answer the question, “Should I use a Realtor when purchasing a new home?” This is a common question we get in the Buda and Kyle markets where half of our inventory is made up of new construction homes.

A lot of builders are out there building homes as fast as they can, and there are a lot of opportunities out there for homebuyers. However, **you should always use an agent when buying a home, even if it’s brand-new.** Here’s why.

The agent in the sales office or model home is working for the builder, not you. You need someone on your side who is looking out for your best interests, which is what you get with a buyer’s agent. If you don’t hire one, you could fall victim to a number of hiccups. You might be advised against doing an inspection, which may cause you to be unaware of a major defect in the new home. They are rare, but they occur.

Another reason to hire a buyer’s agent when purchasing a new home is because of the wealth of information they have. We can give you a full financial picture of your home, including what payments will look like two or three years down the line when the property tax rates are adjusted.

You see, a lot of times the taxes that builders quote you on are usually for the unimproved land. In year two or three, your taxes will go through the roof. **I’ve had to sell a lot of homes recently that were bought two years ago, but now the owner can’t afford the additional payments.** We don’t want that to happen to you.

If you have any questions for us or you need our assistance in buying or selling a home, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to be of assistance.
