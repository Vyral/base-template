<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We need your help. Not only are we looking for homes for our buyers, we’re also getting ready for another year with the Basket Brigade.</em></p>

Can we help each other?

Usually, we try not to ask. We want to deliver incredible information on home values, the reality of buying and selling a home, the ups and downs of our real estate market, and what’s going on in Downtown St. George. And we’ll KEEP doing that!

But today we’re asking very directly for your help.

First of all, the past 3 years we’ve coordinated the <a href="http://stgeorgebasketbrigade.org/" target="_blank">“Basket Brigade”</a> event which delivers a full Thanksgiving meal to hundreds of families every year. **Our goal is to feed 250 families this year.** In 2017, we helped 265 families.

<strong>TWO THINGS:</strong>

<ol>
<li style="margin-left: 40px;">We're open for family nominations. If you know a family, (or families) in need this Thanksgiving, please nominate them at the Basket Brigade <a href="http://stgeorgebasketbrigade.org/" target="_blank">website.</a> If you &quot;suspect&quot; there's a need, trust your gut&#151;there's a need!</li>

<li style="margin-left: 40px;">In order to pull this event off we've got to be selling plenty of real estate!</li>
</ol>

We are selling properties in days and sometimes hours. It's like going to the grocery store and finding empty shelves; there simply are not enough homes on the market for our buyers.

We have buyers looking in every price range from $100,000 to $700,000 who cannot find a home.

**There has never been a better time to sell a home than right now.** We need to find those clients. Please reach out to us if you know anyone who is thinking of selling a home.

If you can think of anyone who is selling a home, please let us know by email, phone, text, whatever makes your heart sing!&#9786;

Again, if you know of a family in need this Thanksgiving, **visit the St. George Basket Brigade [website](http://stgeorgebasketbrigade.org/){: target="_blank"} to nominate them.**

As always, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me with any real estate questions you may have. I would be happy to help you!
