Today, I have a question to ask you: Can we help each other?

Usually, we try not to ask. We want to deliver incredible information on home values, the reality of buying and selling a home, the ups and downs of our real estate market, and what’s going on downtown.

But today is different. I want to know if we can help each other.

First of all, for many years, we have participated in the Basket Brigade. The Basket Brigade delivers a full Thanksgiving meal to hundreds of families every year. **Our goal is to feed 250 families this year.** In 2017, we helped 265 families.

This is just one of our ways of giving back and serving the community. Check out the St. George Basket Brigade [website](http://stgeorgebasketbrigade.org/){: target="_blank"} if you would like to nominate a family in need this Thanksgiving.

In addition to helping the community, we’re also asking for your help with the real estate market.

Our real estate market has gone berserk! We are selling properties in days and sometimes hours. It’s like going to the grocery store and finding empty shelves; there simply are not enough homes on the market for our buyers.

We have buyers looking in every price range from $100,000 to $700,000 who cannot find a home. If you can think of anyone who is thinking of selling a home, please let us know. Consider your church group, your school group, your friends, and your neighbors. Do you know anyone with an investment property they may want to sell? (These people are really winning in our market!) We need your help!

**There has never been a better time to sell a home than right now.** We need to find those clients. Please reach out to us if you know anyone who is thinking of selling a home.

Again, if you know of a family in need this Thanksgiving, **visit the St. George Basket Brigade [website](http://stgeorgebasketbrigade.org/){: target="_blank"} to nominate them.**

As always, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me with any real estate questions you may have. I would be happy to help you!
