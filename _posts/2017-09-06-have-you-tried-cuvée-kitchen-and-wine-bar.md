Today I’m excited to feature a great local restaurant that is sure to impress: Cuvée Kitchen and Wine Bar.

The owners, Chris Ruyan and Tyler Jarvis, are both experienced restaurateurs here on the Emerald Coast. On top of Cuvée Kitchen, they also own Jackacudas and Brotula’s Seafood House and Steamer.

Since I had the opportunity to sit down with Chris and Tyler, I decided to ask them a few questions.

First, I wanted to know how the inspiration for Cuvée Kitchen came to light. According to Chris, it was an evolution of their shared vision for restaurants they enjoyed. Chris and Tyler wanted to create a great menu as well as an amazing atmosphere. From the beginning, they wanted Cuvée Kitchen to be a place where people could gather to enjoy food, drink, and company.

Staying true to this vision is something that has always been important to them—even now following their recent relaunch of the restaurant. The space has been opened up and the format of the dining experience has been changed, as well.

**Social interaction through intimate spacing, small plates, and craft-style cocktails are all key features** that Chris and Tyler have tried to bring with this relaunch. They wanted to create a fun and interactive experience instead of the more quiet atmosphere that is usually associated with upscale dining.

**Also, because they use fresh ingredients, the cuisine at Cuvée Kitchen is always unique.** The chefs have a lot of freedom to create different items on a daily basis. Recently, Chris and Tyler have begun to think about implementing a rotation-style menu that would change four times a year depending on the season.

But the food isn’t all that makes Cuvée Kitchen unique. The restaurant also offers a wide variety of cocktails. Cuvée Kitchen carries a lot of different craft cocktails that aren’t typically found in the area, as well as some imported spirits.

The “Corrupt Bargain” cocktail is Tyler’s personal favorite. A spin on a traditional Manhattan, the Corrupt Bargain is a blend of single barrel and rye whiskey complemented with Carpano Antica and vermouth. Finally, the drink also has a flamed orange peel, which provides a unique and delicious smokiness.

Food and drink aren’t the only things Cuvée Kitchen has to offer. **Each week from Monday through Saturday between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., the restaurant hosts a social hour.** From 9 p.m. to close on those same days, you can experience the reverse social hour.

Each of these hours will feature small bites, sushi, local fish beignets, cocktails, and more.

To learn more about Cuvée Kitchen, you can visit their website: [www.CuveeKitchen.com](http://www.cuveekitchen.com/). Also, if you’re interested in dropping by to experience it for yourself, **you can find the restaurant in downtown Destin at 26120 Emerald Coast Parkway.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
