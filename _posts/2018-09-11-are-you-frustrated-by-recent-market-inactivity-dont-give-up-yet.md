We’re more than halfway through 2018, and it’s been an amazing year for The Wolek Group.&nbsp;

We’ve been able to help more than 104 families buy and sell real estate so far, and we look forward to helping many more through the end of 2018 and beyond. Of course, another way we love to help all of you is by providing key insight into what’s happening in our market.&nbsp;

**At this point in the year, real estate tends to slow down a little bit.** With school starting up, buyers with families are mostly done shopping for homes by this point. This lull in our market is nothing out of the ordinary, but those looking to sell should be aware that it might take a little longer now than in recent months to find a buyer. Not to worry, though.

After school is back in full swing and labor day is over, market activity will likely pick back up. Seasonal market changes are normal, and there is still plenty of time and opportunity to sell your home before 2019.&nbsp;

**If your home is already on the market and you’re feeling discouraged by current conditions, though, a price adjustment may be just the thing to jumpstart buyer interest.** Buyer activity may be down, but it is not stagnant.&nbsp;

There are still people out there looking for homes, and, with the right strategy, your property could be the one they choose. It’s not the time to throw in the towel, but it is time to be realistic about how you’re presenting your listing to the market.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are curious how we can help you achieve your real estate goals, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
