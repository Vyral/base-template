When it comes to real estate investing, it’s not uncommon for beginners to miscalculate their cash flow. Many mistakenly believe that because they’re renting their property out for $1,000 a month, yet only paying $700 to $800 in monthly mortgage costs, it must mean they have a positive cash flow. In reality, they’re simply failing to account for other expenses. Instead, consider this approach: the 50% rule. This rule asserts that 50% of the rent you collect should go to your monthly expenses and as long as your principal interest is below that 50% threshold, you’ll have a property with positive cash flow on your hands.
