We recently implemented a new program called Peer Pay on our team, and I want to tell you all about how it works. 

The concept behind Peer Pay is that **each team member gets a sum of money that they can reward other team members with throughout the year.** In our case, each member of the Wolek Group received $500 of what I call “TWG Peer Pay Bucks” to give to their peers. By the end of the year, they must distribute all of their money to other team members.

Here’s the kicker: Each reward must be done in private. This is because we don’t want to hinder other team members from rewarding the same person. If they’re awesome enough, they should get all the money they deserve. 

**I think this program fits great with our team culture, and I’m excited to share the results with you later on.** If you have other ideas about how to build a sense of community within your team or business, I invite you to share them with me. 

In the meantime, if you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to call or email me anytime. I’d love to help you.
