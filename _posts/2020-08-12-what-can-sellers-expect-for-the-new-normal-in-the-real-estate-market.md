<center><em>For home sellers, there&rsquo;s a new normal in the market. Here&rsquo;s what it looks like.</em></center>

<br>As a home seller, it’s wise to minimize the physical contact that potential buyers have with the stuff in your home as they walk through to view it. Leave the doors and drawers open so that buyers can visually access your home without having to touch anything.

Another thing you can do is leave hand sanitizer along with instructions at your home’s entrance. **Visitors should be instructed to use the hand sanitizer before coming in and after walking through your home**.

We also encourage you to discuss your comfort levels with your Colemere Realty associate regarding how many showings you want to have, how many people you want to enter your house, and so on. If you’d rather keep your home’s exposure to others to a minimum, you can always pursue virtual showings and open houses instead.

Once showings are over, be sure to turn all the lights off and **take disinfectant wipes to all the surfaces in your house that people are likely to touch**, like light switches and doorknobs.

Finally, we’ll let buyers know that they need to stay home if they’re not feeling well to reduce the risk of spread. And if you, the seller, feel like you’re coming down with something, **don’t be afraid to put showings on hold**. There are plenty of virtual options out there for you.

If you have any questions about what safety precautions are being implemented to keep buyers and sellers safe during the pandemic, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to provide you with more information.
