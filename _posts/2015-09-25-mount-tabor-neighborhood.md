Today, I'm going to give you a tour of one of my favorite neighborhoods in Portland - the Mount Tabor Neighborhood! This great location is nestled in Southeast Portland, an ideal location close to downtown, freeways, parks and other venues.

Our first stop is Mount Tabor Park. This park is actually on top of an inactive volcano. The park offers miles of hiking trails that cover 196 acres. These trails are great for biking or hiking. There are tennis courts, picnic areas, and a playground. There is something for everyone at Mount Tabor. Stop by for a beautiful view of the downtown skyline, and the best sunset you've ever seen.

Tilikum Crossing Bridge is the only bridge in Portland reserved for cyclists, pedestrians, and the MAX light rail. This is my favorite way to get to Mount Tabor from downtown Portland! It only takes 10 to 15 minutes to go from downtown Portland to the Mount Tabor neighborhood, and there are many great public transportation options for you, such as the bus line.

Mount Tabor also offers a variety of locally owned businesses. There are great bars, restaurants, bookstores, and pubs! Hawthorne Boulevard is one of the most well-known streets in this neighborhood. Cup and Saucer  is one of my favorite breakfast places. You must try their homemade scones!

Albina Press Coffee Shop is just west of Mount Tabor Park. Portlanders are very serious about their coffee, and Albina does it right. They also serve Stumptown coffee, a local coffee that is very popular. Albina provides a cozy atmosphere.

On the Portland food scene, food carts are our claim to fame. There are pods of food carts all over town, such as this one, Good Food Here, located at the base of Mount Tabor. This pod definitely lives up to its name. There is a huge variety of food: Korean, tacos, seafood, vegan, vegetarian, and more! Good Food Here offers a heated, outdoor eating tent. It's a great place to check out if you want to try a few different things, or if you don't have time to prepare a meal at home.

Tabor Tavern is located right in the heart of the neighborhood. The food is amazing, and there are rotating taps of beer, cider, and local wines available as well. I recommend their Caesar salad. Happy hour is from 3:00 to 5:30, so be sure to stop by!

Overall, the Mount Tabor neighborhood is a great place to live. In addition to the parks and restaurants, Mount Tabor offers a wide diversity of homes. If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
