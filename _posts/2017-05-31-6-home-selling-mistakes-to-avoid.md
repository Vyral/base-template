Home selling is a complicated process. Here are six things you need to avoid doing.

Selling your home can be a stressful process, but avoiding these six common mistakes will make that process a lot easier and smoother:

**1. Picking the wrong agent.** It’s really easy to pick the wrong agent if you don’t do your research on them. The right agent is going to answer the phone when you call, get back to you in a timely manner, and be a market expert. They will be honest and straightforward with you rather than agreeing with everything you say and telling you what you want to hear.

**2. Overpricing your home.** Price is everything when marketing your home. Even a well-priced home with a bad marketing plan will sell. It will just take a little longer.

**3. Failing to make simple repairs.** If the dog chewed something up or there are minor dents or scratches in the paint, buyers will notice that. It's better to get these things fixed before listing the home.

**4. Neglecting the decluttering.** Buyers start their home searches online these days and if the pictures of your home show off your stuff instead of the home itself, there’s a good chance buyers won’t even come out to look at the home in person. Store your excess “stuff” in the garage or a storage pod so it doesn’t get in the way.

**5. Not allowing adequate access to your home.** Your home should be show-ready at all times and you should be able to accommodate agents and their buyers when they want to see it. If a seller tells a buyer or their agent they can’t see a home at a certain time or they have to reschedule, most won’t come back.

**6. Getting too emotional about your house.** Sellers can be very attached to their homes, which is understandable. However, when you are selling your home you have to look at it as an investment, not as your home. If you get a lowball offer or someone wants to remodel a part of the home, don’t take it personally as long as they pay the price you want them to.

Avoiding these mistakes will make sure your home sells for the most amount of money possible in the least amount of time. If you have any questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
