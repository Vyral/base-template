Now that we’re in the fall months and colder weather is setting in, a lot of sellers have been asking me if they’ve missed their opportunity to list.

Today, I want to let you know that now is still an outstanding time to put your home on the market. There are still a ton of buyers out looking for their next property.

Interest rates are still low, but there’s no telling what they’re going to do when next summer rolls around. **Buyers aren’t waiting, so you don’t have to either.**

Also, many out-of-state buyers are moving into our Boise area. Boise is definitely one of the best places to raise a family in our country, and out-of-state buyers have caught onto this.

All of these factors combined with our current low inventory mean that sellers right now can afford to ask for and obtain top dollar.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
