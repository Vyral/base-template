**Tulsa Looks Good on The Lemon-Aid Project**

Jennie caught up with nonprofit founder, Katie Eller Murray to learn more.

Started in 1994, The Lemon-Aid Project is a city-wide charity event where kids are provided with all the materials to set up lemonade stands to raise money for those in need. It is a free and fun Tulsa tradition that empowers kids of all ages to be impactful entrepreneurs and philanthropists within their community.

Founded on the belief that small actions can lead to monumental impact, this grassroots organization is committed to tackling issues right here in Tulsa. Most recently the Lemon-Aid Projects efforts have benefited local nonprofit, The Lindsay House, raising over $31,000 between 2022 and 2023.

Want in on the fun? Volunteering for the Lemon-Aid Project is easy with a variety of ways to help give back. Whether you are hosting a stand in your neighborhood or choose to sponsor elements of the event, all efforts are impactful in helping to better the Tulsa community.
