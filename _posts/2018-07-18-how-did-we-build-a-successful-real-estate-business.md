If you’re curious about how we went from 100 to 200 to 500 to 1,000 home sales per year in just a few short years, I’m here today to tell you how.

**Over the past 15 years, we’ve used a precise, very simple system to grow our business to over 100 agents and an average of 97 transactions per month, allowing us to serve over 1,000 families per year.**

Because so many people have been asking how we’ve done it, **we are inviting you to be part of “Inside JCRE”** to see what being on this team actually looks like.

This event will allow you to learn the ins and outs of my company. You’ll hear from team members, vendors, and myself about how we became one of the top real estate teams in the entire country.

We’ll also have a number of breakout sessions, ranging in topic from lead generation to lead conversion, ISA management, recruiting agents, marketing tactics, investing, expansion, and so much more.

**We aim to give everyone the opportunity to learn what we’ve learned in the real estate business to empower real estate agents all over the country to be able to take their vision for their company and make it a reality.**

The “Inside JCRE” event may just be the change that you’re looking for. For more information, visit **[insidejcre.com](https://insidejcre.com/){: target="_blank"}**. If you have any other questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
