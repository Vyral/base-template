Today I’m going to go over how to handle a multiple offer situation as a competitive buyer.<br><br>When dealing with a multiple offer situation, it’s important to always make your highest offer with the best possible terms. As you know, we have far more buyers than houses available in the under-$300,000 price range.

Imagine we’re out looking at houses and you find your dream home only to realize four other people have put in offers on it. To ensure we have a fighting chance, **we first have to understand that we're not going to be able to see the other offers. They are sealed and confidential.**

Once you've submitted your offer for the property through your buyer's agent, the listing agent will contact the agents representing each potential buyer to ask for their final offer.

Hopefully you did your due diligence as a buyer and picked an agent who knows how to win in this situation on your behalf. It ultimately comes down to knowing what you're willing to lose the property for. In other words, your offer should be the highest number you're comfortable with.

There are a few different ways we can structure an offer to make it more appealing to the seller. **Being pre-approved with a loan is important in this market,** as is choosing the right financing option. And working with a mortgage broker is also critical, because they're going to pick the best program for your circumstances.

If you enter a multiple offer situation and aren’t pre-approved, you're likely going to lose. Sellers typically view pre-approved buyers the same as cash buyers

**Make your offer appealing to the seller’s timeline.** Structuring the timeline of the offer to fit the seller's needs is crucial in making your offer competitive.  

Another way to prove your commitment as a buyer is to offer a high down payment and waive the typical seller credits. You may also want to consider covering the closing costs. All of these things will speak volumes in your favor. <br>It can also be helpful to appeal to the seller’s emotional side. Consider sending a handwritten letter explaining your personal situation, the names of your kids, and your plans for the property. 

On a more practical level, you could have a mortgage broker contact the listing agent to give them peace of mind about your financial situation.

If you have any further questions about multiple offer situations, don’t hesitate to contact me by phone or email. I would be happy to speak with you about how to win your dream home.
