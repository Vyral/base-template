It’s been pretty quiet lately in Arizona regarding new construction. A lot of developers are starting to develop subdivisions and large tracts of properties in Tucson. I‘d like to take the opportunity to reach out to buyers and let you know that it doesn’t cost you anything to be represented in a new construction site. If you bring an agent along with you, that agent can represent you and your interests throughout the transaction at no cost to you.

It may not be obvious to everybody, but the person behind the counter you meet when you walk into the sales office is working for the builder and the developer. They’re not working for you. If you want somebody to look after your interests, you should recruit your real estate agent to go in with you and get you registered on your first visit so they can represent you through the whole ordeal. The new construction contract is also quite a bit different than the standard residential resale contract, so you’d be well-advised to have your agent review it and talk you through the nuances. 

If you have any more questions, send me an email or give me a call. Make it a great day.
