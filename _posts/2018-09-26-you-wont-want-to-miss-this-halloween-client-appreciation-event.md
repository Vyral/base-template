Today I’m excited to invite you to our Client Appreciation Pumpkin Patch Event coming up on **Wednesday, October 10, 4:30-7:30pm.** We’ll be transforming the parking lot outside our office into an amazing pumpkin patch featuring a hay maze, face painting, balloon animals, family photos, and free pumpkins for all! We plan on having a lot of fun and making this a great place for you to make some memories with your family. I’ll be dressed up, and if you can find me there, you’ll have the chance to guess which superhero I am. To see my full invite with all the details, watch this short video.
