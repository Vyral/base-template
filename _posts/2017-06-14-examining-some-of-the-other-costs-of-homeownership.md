What is the true cost of homeownership?

<br>Oftentimes when people purchase their homes, they think solely about what their mortgage and interest payments will be. If you’re thinking about purchasing a home, there are a few other things you’ll want to consider.

<br>The first is if there will be property taxes and Mello-Roos for your particular home. You might find Mello-Roos in newer communities that have just been built, such as some sections of Irvine where the developer is passing along the infrastructure cost in the form of a tax. Mello-Roos can raise your property tax by 1% to 2%, which can be a big hit to your cash flow on a monthly basis.

<br>Additionally, some financial experts recommend that you keep a slush fund of 1% to 2% for maintenance issues that could arise on your new home. It’s also a good idea to ask the current owners if they wouldn’t mind sharing their utility bills over the course of a year. You may be surprised how much these fluctuate, especially if you’re in Orange County’s inland region during the summer months when the air conditioning bills can jump considerably.

<br>If you’re a first-time homebuyer moving from an apartment into a larger house, it’s also a good idea to factor in the cost of window coverings and furnishings and set aside a little cash for that.

<br>If you have any questions about the costs of homeownership, feel free to give me a call. I’d be happy to speak with you.
