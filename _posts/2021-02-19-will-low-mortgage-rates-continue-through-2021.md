### Will Low Mortgage Rates Continue through 2021?

With mortgage interest rates hitting&nbsp;[record lows](https://www.simplifyingthemarket.com/2020/11/19/will-mortgage-rates-remain-low-next-year/?a=94310-69c287c0a402c16fd60512cd144a2e2d){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}&nbsp;so many times recently, some are wondering if we’ll see low rates continue throughout 2021, or if they’ll start to rise. Recently,&nbsp;*Freddie Mac*&nbsp;released their quarterly&nbsp;[forecast](http://www.freddiemac.com/blog/research_and_analysis/20210125_what_will_2021_bring_for_housing.page?){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, noting:

> *“The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hit a record low over a dozen times in 2020 and&nbsp;**the low interest rate environment is projected to continue through this year.&nbsp;**We expect interest rates to average below 3% through the end of 2021. While this is a modest rise from 2020 averages, the recent vote by the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates anchored near zero should keep rates low.”*

As shown in the graph below,&nbsp;*Freddie Mac*&nbsp;is projecting low rates going forward with a modest rise that’s expected to continue through 2022.

*Freddie Mac*&nbsp;isn’t the only authority forecasting low rates with a slight rise.&nbsp;[*Fannie Mae*](https://www.fanniemae.com/media/37951/display){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}*, The Mortgage Bankers Association*&nbsp;([MBA](https://www.mba.org/news-research-and-resources/research-and-economics/forecasts-and-commentary){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}), and the&nbsp;*National Association of Realtors*&nbsp;([NAR](https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/forecast-Q1-2021-us-economic-outlook-01-30-2021.pdf){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}) also anticipate low rates with a small increase as 2021 continues on. Here’s the quarterly breakdown of their projections and how they’re expected to play out over the next year:

It’s important to note that, while a small change in interest rates can have a substantial impact on monthly mortgage payments, these rates are still incredibly low compared to where they were just a couple of years ago.

#### **What does this mean for buyers?**

Low mortgage rates are creating an outstanding opportunity for current&nbsp;[homebuyers](https://www.simplifyingthemarket.com/2021/02/11/47-of-new-buyers-surprised-by-how-affordable-homes-are-today/?a=94310-69c287c0a402c16fd60512cd144a2e2d){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}&nbsp;to get more for their money while staying within their budget. As the economy gets stronger and we recover from the challenges of 2020, it’s natural for rates to potentially rise in response to a healthier economy. Mark Fleming,&nbsp;*Chief Economist*&nbsp;at&nbsp;*First American*,&nbsp;[reminds](https://blog.firstam.com/economics/why-the-housing-market-can-thrive-if-a-new-rising-rate-era-begins){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}&nbsp;us:

> *“**Rising interest rates reduce house-buying power and affordability**, but are often a sign of a strong economy, which increases home buyer demand.&nbsp;**By any historic standard, today’s mortgage rates remain historically low**&nbsp;and will continue to boost house-buying power and keep purchase demand robust.”*

With low rates fueling activity among hopeful buyers, there are a lot of people who are highly motivated and looking for homes to purchase right now. In this environment, it can be&nbsp;[challenging](https://www.simplifyingthemarket.com/2021/01/28/what-record-low-housing-inventory-means-for-you/?a=94310-69c287c0a402c16fd60512cd144a2e2d){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}&nbsp;to find a home to buy, so a local real estate agent will be key to your success if you’re thinking of buying too. Working with a trusted real estate professional to navigate the process while rates are in your favor might be the best move you can make.
