Welcome back to another edition of “What’s Working Now.” Today I am going to conclude the story I began on the last episode about a couple of buyers who I was able to help find the perfect property for.

**If you remember, I was originally showing my buyers a different property, but we wandered into another that we heard was coming on the market for sale.** I knew the agent and she was fine with us seeing it and showing it, but did absolutely not want us to write an offer because it was not on the market yet.

**I talked about the big, bad offer we made, but I left out the best part of that story.** The offer that we made was actually contingent on my client selling their property first. How did we get that offer accepted? **There are three main reasons why:**

**1. My relationship with the listing agent.** We knew and respected each other a great deal, so she had a feeling what was coming.

**2. My track record of selling fast.** When we presented the contingent offer, I included my track record of all my recent listings, showing that they all had sold within seven days. When I wrote the offer, &nbsp;I gave us 13 days to sell the home. After the seller saw my track record, it was a no-brainer that we were going to get that home sold within 13 days.

**3. The ability to get our buyer’s house on the market quickly.** It was contingent on the sale of a house that was not actually ready to sell, so we got the stager, painter, cleaner, and movers together to prepare the home. Within three days, the house went on the market with an open house.

If you have any questions for me about this success story or about how I can help you buy or sell a home if you are in a time crunch, please feel free to give me a call at [240-731-8079](tel:240-731-8079){: target="_blank"} or send me an email at [Marjorie@MarjorieDickStuart.com](mailto:Marjorie@MarjorieDickStuart.com). I look forward to hearing from you soon.
