  Have you been thinking of finding a new home this year? If so, you may want to
  start looking. Interest rates are on the rise and even small increases are
  having a big impact on buying power. Today, I’m going to show you a key
  example of how this works. Did you know that a rate increase of just 0.5%
  constitutes a 10% drop in buying power? To learn more, watch this short video.

Interest rates can have a direct impact on buying power. Today, I’d like to explain how this works.

In January, interest rates were at 3.98%. Today, they are at 4.5%. **Even having only risen slightly more than 0.5%, this constitutes a big change in buying power.**

Let’s take the example of a home priced at the current market average of $260,000. In January of this year, a buyer would be left with a $208,000 mortgage after paying 20% for a down payment. This amounts to a principal and interest payment of $987 per month.

To have the same monthly payment today, you’d have to have a mortgage of $195,000 on a house worth $234,000. Overall, this is a 10% decrease in buying power.

We already know that interest rates are going to continue to rise. So, what happens when they do? We’re expecting three or four jumps in interest rates this year and each jump will cause a decrease in buying power.

So, if you’re thinking of buying or selling, come have a conversation with my team and me as soon as possible. We want to place you in the best financial situation possible and lock in your rate before they rise again.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
