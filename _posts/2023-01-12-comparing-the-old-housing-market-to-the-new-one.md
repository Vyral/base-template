There has been a big shift in the market, and many buyers and sellers have been confused about how quickly it did so. People are still buying and selling real estate—there were over 500 listings on our MLS recently. However, things have changed, so it’s important that we all keep up and make the necessary adjustments.&nbsp;

The old market had an interest rate of 2.9%, homes sold in less than 30 days, there were crazy bidding wars, prices were increasing rapidly, and buyers had to pay an arm and a leg to get a house. In this seller’s market, buyers were paying exponentially over asking price while also offering other things so they could beat the fast-moving competition. It was crazy\!

However, **things are different now, and that affects everyone in the market.** In our current market, interest rates are around 5.5% to 6%, which is historically good even though many people were concerned by the sudden jump. Also, homes are taking longer than 30 days to sell now, and some listings are even expiring if they aren’t serious about their pricing and marketing.&nbsp;

There are negotiations now, prices are decreasing, and buyers have many more options. This price decrease of about 10% isn’t concerning because, in the last 10 years, prices increased by 130%, so values are still in a good place.&nbsp;

With all these changes, know that we’re still in a great market. **If you go into your plans with this updated perspective, you’ll have a much better experience.** If you have any questions about your home’s value, what’s on the MLS, or anything else in the real estate world, visit [our website here](https://www.gostgeorge.com/) to find out more.
