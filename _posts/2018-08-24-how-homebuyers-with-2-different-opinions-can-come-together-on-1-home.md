Sometimes, two people who’re looking to buy a home together just can’t agree on which one to buy because they have different opinions about what features their future home should have.

When one of our clients is facing this situation, we resolve it by having them use a tool we call ”the triangle.” The triangle is simply a list of the top three essential features you can both agree that your new home should have.

The reality is, no home is perfect. Whether it’s a new construction home or one that’s recently been rehabbed, certain features won’t look exactly how you want them to. After you’ve found a home that has the three most important things you both agree on, put on your investor’s hat and fix up any problem areas in that house. If there’s a bathroom in the house that needs to be updated, fix it up yourself so you can build equity in that home. That way, when the time comes to sell it, you’re reaping the benefits of that equity instead of buying someone else’s premium.

So, focus on the three most important things you want in your new house. Not five, not six—just three. Everything else is an opportunity to increase the value of that house.
