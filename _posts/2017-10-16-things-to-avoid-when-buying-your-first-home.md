When I asked the buyer’s agents on my team what they found most gratifying about their jobs, they told me how much they love working with first-time homebuyers.

Most of all, my agents enjoy helping these buyers understand and navigate the home buying process for the first time, and then watching them succeed in doing so.

Part of the reason this is so gratifying is because these agents realize just how much goes into the process of searching for and purchasing a home. There are a lot of steps, which means a lot of room for error. For that reason, today I wanted to go over some of the most common mistakes first-time homebuyers make, so that you don’t repeat these mistakes yourself.

1. **Not considering the cost of the home, beyond just the mortgage payment.**There’s a lot more to the cost than principal and interest. You also need to consider insurance and taxes. Also, the maintenance of owning the house over the years is going to add up. It’s important to consider these kinds of costs that will come down the line, including any upgrades you may do. These upgrades may add value to the house, but remember that you might not see that money back when you sell.<br>{% include pullquote.html %}
2. **Shopping for a home without being pre-approved.** Imagine finding your dream home only to watch someone else buy it out from under you while you’re at the lender trying to get pre-approved. Make sure you understand your price range and that you are pre-approved ahead of time. This will prevent any unpleasant surprises.
3. **Changing your debt-to-income ratio, causing your lender to deny you the loan.**Watching your new house go down the drain is a terrible feeling. You may not realize it, but going out and making expensive purchases on credit can have a huge impact on your ability to receive your loan. Wait until after closing before you do anything that could change your credit.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are interested in having a buyer consultation with us, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
