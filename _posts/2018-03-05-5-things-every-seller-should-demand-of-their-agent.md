Today I want to give you some insider tips on what you should demand of your real estate agent. These tips can save you tens of thousands when buying or selling a home, so it’s something you’re going to want to pay attention to.

**1. Make sure your agent is truthful about the price of your home.** Having an agent come in and give you a price just because they want to get the listing or just because it’s what you want to hear will not be beneficial in the long run. Many studies have shown over many years that when you overprice a property, it can quickly become stale. The longer it sits on the market, the less likely you are to get a good price. Being truthful about your home’s value is an invaluable quality for an agent to have.

**2. Make sure you know what their list-to-sale price ratio is.** The higher the number, the more likely you are to get a good price. Our market’s average is around 94% right now, but our team is hovering at 98%. That’s extra money for our sellers and a quicker home sale, too.

**3. Know what their home searching strategies are.&nbsp;**Other than an automated search in the MLS, you wanna make sure your agent is active and out in the market looking for homes for you. You don’t want an agent who will haul you around and hope you buy a home. You want an agent who is looking for the exact type of home you want via circle prospecting, door knocking, and even cold calling. We’ll be able to tell you about homes before they hit the market.

**4. Alleviate as many roadblocks as possible.&nbsp;**We refer to this in our business as the “88 types of turbulence.” We have found 88 different roadblocks that most commonly derail transactions. We make our buyers aware of these to make the process less stressful.

**5. You need a full-time agent.** Another big question you should be asking right off the bat is, “Are you a full-time or part-time agent?” Anybody can be a part-time agent. You want a full-time agent working for you. An agent that sells a lot more than the four or five home average.

These are just a few demands you should be making of your real estate agent. If you want to learn more or if you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
