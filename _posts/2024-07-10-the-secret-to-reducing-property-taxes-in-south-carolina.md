Did you know that primary residents in South Carolina can save thousands on property taxes? Homeowners typically worry about the long-term costs of homeownership, thatâ€™s why today, I will tell you the secret to reducing your tax costs: just fill up a form at closing.

Your attorney can provide this form to you at closing. Filling out this form with the county can save you thousands of dollars as **it allows you to file for a 4% tax rate, compared to the standard 6% rate.** The 4% rate is designated for primary residences, while the 6% rate applies to second homes or investment properties.

I recently had a client who forgot to complete this form. When I reminded him, he was able to receive a refund for 18 months of property taxes that he had paid at the higher 6% rate instead of the 4% rate!

If you want to ensure you're paying the correct property tax rate, please reach out to me at 843-701-9186. I'd love to help you understand this process and potentially save you a substantial amount on your property taxes.
