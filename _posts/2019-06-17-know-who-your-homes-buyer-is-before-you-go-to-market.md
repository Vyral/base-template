Who is your buyer?

When asking this question, I like to use the term “avatar” in reference to the buyer. As a listing agent, you need to figure out who your avatar is before you go to market so you can market your home to a larger pool of buyers.&nbsp;

**Your avatar can take many different forms, but you need to know who they are before the property launch.** There’s a reason why one of the modules in our Luxury Listing Specialist Certification is all about the property launch, and this is because that’s when the heavy lifting happens—from the time you sign the listing agreement to the time the home goes live on the MLS. Here, you’re doing all the necessary prep work to position the home so that the maximum pool of buyers can visualize living in it.&nbsp;

So figure out your avatar and concentrate your marketing efforts toward the agents and buyers who you think fit the description. You might be wrong in some cases—you can’t be all things to all people—but you should position your home to appeal to the majority of people who represent your avatar.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any questions about this or any other topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. And remember—it’s not the market, it’s the marketing.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
