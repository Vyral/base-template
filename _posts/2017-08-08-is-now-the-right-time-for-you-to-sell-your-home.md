Is now the right time for you to sell your home?

A lot of our clients are asking if they should sell now or wait until next year. So, how do you know when it’s a good time to put your home on the market?

Harvard just completed their 2017 State of the Nation Housing Study and concluded that, for the fourth year in a row, national sales inventory has dropped. A normal, steady absorption rate is 6%. Nationally, sales inventory is at 3.6%. Locally, we’re at about 2% to 2.5%, which is an increase from the end of 2016, when we only had a 1.5% absorption rate.

**The absorption rate determines whether we are in a buyer’s, seller’s, or neutral market.** Theoretically, with a 2% absorption rate, if no new homes came on the market, we would run out of inventory in just two months.

Not only that, fewer homes have been built over the past 10 years. In fact, there are fewer new construction homes than at any 10-year period in recent history, since the 1970s.

Homeownership has also declined for the last 12 years. The homeownership rate finally flatlined last year and now, it’s starting to increase.

The National Association of Realtors has also found a steady rise in buyer demand. The main challenge for homebuyers is there are not enough homes on the market. Many of them have a difficult time finding one they want to purchase.

Inventory is starting to creep up a little bit and, with more increases looming on the horizon, **the numbers certainly indicate that now is the best time to sell your home.**

Of course, every situation is different. If you have any questions about selling your home in the current market, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you.
