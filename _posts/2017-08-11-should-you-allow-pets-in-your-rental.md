You can choose whether you want to allow pets in your rental property. Here’s what we recommend.

One of the most common questions we get from homeowners is if they have to allow pets in their rental home. The answer is no. It’s totally up to you what kind of pets, if any, you will allow in your home.

However, keep in mind that **eight out of 10 people in today’s market have pets.** Especially when rent is up a little higher and families are out there looking. Most families have one or two children and one or two pets. It just comes with the territory.

If you do choose to allow pets in your home, our addendum helps protect you. We’ll go inspect the property every four months and look for pet damage, as well as any other damage. **We’ll send you pictures of any damage, as well as a picture of the pet in the home.**

We don’t take our pet policy lightly. We’re here to protect your home and put money in your account. If you don't want to allow pets, that’s fine, but just know that you'll be missing out on a huge part of the market and it might take us longer to find a tenant than normal.

If you have any other questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out. We would love to hear from you soon.
