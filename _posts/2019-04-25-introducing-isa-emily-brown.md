Today I’m sitting down with Emily Brown for a quick chat about what her role is with the Caul Real Estate Group.

As an ISA (inside sales associate), Emily describes her role on our team as being similar to that of a nurse in a hospital. It’s her job to gather information, assess what you need, and then refer you to one of our agents (or the doctor), so we can continue working to get you the best deal possible.

“I’m the question asker and think of them as kind of the solution provider,” she says. “And you’re going to love working with our agents.”

**\*\*When calls come in, ISAs like Emily direct traffic so that our outside sales associates can go out there and find our clients their dream homes. \*\***

There are a lot of fun facts about Emily, but the one she chose to share with us today is that she’s a native of the Raleigh area. Specifically, she’s an eighth-generation Apex native.

If have any questions for Emily, you can message her on our website. If you’d like to know more about our real estate market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’d love to speak with you.
