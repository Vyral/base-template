Is today the right time to sell your house?

The market is absolutely on fire, so I say yes. My research shows that we should see a 4% appreciation rate in 2018. **This is a little down from last year and it might slow down the market a bit, but it’s still a healthy rate of appreciation.**

Like I said, the Phoenix market is on fire right now. We’ve been seeing offers everywhere. A recent home we listed had two full-price offers before it was even listed. **Another home we listed around Christmas had five offers by the new year.**

If you’re thinking about selling anytime in the near future, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you get the best price possible for your home. If you have any other questions for us, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
