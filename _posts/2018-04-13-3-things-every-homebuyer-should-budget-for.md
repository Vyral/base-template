Today we’re going to talk about some of the common costs that people tend to forget about when buying a new home.

**1. Home inspection.** If you’re buying a home, you’ll need a home inspection, and you’ll need to pay for it. Many people forget to budget for the cost of a home inspector.

**2. The earnest money and option money.**

**3. The actual cost of moving.** This includes movers, moving trucks, new furniture, and everything else you’ll need to transport to your new place.

If you’re in the market to buy a home, don’t forget those things. If you have any questions for me or want to get more details on the process, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
