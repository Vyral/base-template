Today I want to talk about what to do when you have found the right home. Finding the right home is a very exciting time and, usually, you want to share it with everyone. However, you may not want to tell all those loved ones just yet and continue doing more research about your neighborhood.

A lot of times the decision you make about a home is very personal. Even though you are sure of your decision, your family and friends are still going to try and protect you. When you show friends and family your new home, keep in mind that they weren't there to see all the other properties you rejected during your search. This is exactly why **it may be a good idea to keep the exciting news of your new home purchase to yourself until you've closed.**

If you tell your friends and family before you close, there could be some tough conversations about you buying a certain home. You can, of course, counsel with them, but keep in mind that you have already made your decision.

If you have picked out your home and are drafting an offer, I recommend driving **by the home throughout the day.** Visit it in the morning, at dinner time, and around bedtime so you can see the neighborhood in different ways and be able to check the traffic, find the school bus stops, etc. It is so enlightening to see actual activity rather than just your showing.

The final thing I would recommend is to **take it slow and enjoy it.** I know that you have people telling you one thing or another and this is a stressful process, but it's one you will never forget. A lot of people are going to try and figure out how they can fix everything in a home inspection and how the financing is, but you should just enjoy it. It may be quite a fire, but you will end up with a home to enjoy for either the rest of your life or until the next chapter of your life.

By using tools such as driving by the home and using Google to understand the area, you can learn a lot and know that you are making the right decision. Just remember that, although you can ask for help, you are making the decision for yourself.
