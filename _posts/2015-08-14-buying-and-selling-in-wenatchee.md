A lot of people don't have the money to buy a home and then sell their other property afterwards. Paying two mortgages is simply not feasible for a lot of people, but that's okay because we have ways around this.

We recommend that you get in touch with one of our buyer specialists to find a home, and when you put in an offer, **you can make the purchase contingent upon the sale of your home.** This means that you can only agree to buy the home when your property is finally ready to sell.

{% include pullquote.html %}

Typically you will have 45 days to sell your home. This means that after you have your offer accepted, you have 5 days to put your home on the market, so **you really have to be serious about selling your home.** Not a lot of people do this, but the market is so hot right now that we think a lot of sellers will be willing to accept an offer like this.

We have the resources necessary to help you put your home on the market in 5 days, and **we have the skills necessary to sell your home** for top dollar and in the shortest amount of time possible.

If you need to buy and sell at the same time, please don't hesitate to contact us. We would be very happy to organize a transaction such as this one.

We look forward to speaking with you!
