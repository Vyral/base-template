How much are you going to need for a down payment? The answer varies depending on your financing. With an FHA loan, you’ll need to put at least 3.5% down. With a conventional loan, you may need 20% to 25%. There are also programs out there that don’t require a down payment at all. You can hear my full thoughts on this subject in today's video. Otherwise, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
