I’m so excited to be here today with my friend Chris Padley with Gateway Mortgage. I wanted to feature Chris and share all the great things he does to help our clients get to the closing table with less stress and a happier experience. Chris has been in the Tulsa mortgage business for almost 20 years, so I wanted to chat about what’s going on in the mortgage world.
