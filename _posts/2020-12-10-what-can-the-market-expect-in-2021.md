<center><em>These are my predictions for what we can expect in our 2021 market.</em></center>

<br>Today I’m sharing my 2021 Phoenix real estate market predictions. 2020 has been a heck of a year, and most of us are ready for 2021.

I believe the first quarter of the new year will be similar to what we’re seeing now. With the progressing pandemic and a vaccine hopefully coming soon, there’s potential for change, but likely not in the first quarter. More of the same means **we’ll continue to have low interest rates**. Interest rates in the 2s make it extremely affordable for buyers to purchase a home, even with the current higher prices.

Arizona is seeing high inward migration and low inventory, which means demand and prices will remain elevated. I see this continuing to happen, even with the coronavirus market we’re in right now. If and when the broader economy recovers in 2021, I believe the real estate market will stay as it is, if not get stronger, though it’s difficult to imagine it stronger than it is these days.

If you’re considering buying a house, interest rates in the twos are very positive. It’s a competitive market, but know that&nbsp;**we have strategies and techniques to get you into the home you love**. If you’re thinking about selling, we have extremely low inventory, so buyers will frequently fight over your house, which means multiple offers for you. So it’s currently a great time for both buyers and sellers in our market.

If you have questions about buying or selling, please give me a call or send an email. I’d be glad to schedule a free consultation with you.
