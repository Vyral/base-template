When we go to show a home, we’re often greeted by a cluttered and messy sight. Perhaps the sellers were a little too busy figuring out the logistics of a sale, but regardless, an unkempt home isn’t going to win over any buyers.

Renovated kitchens and freshly painted walls do help entice potential buyers, but the best, easiest, and cheapest way to get your home sold is to simply keep it clean. **Here’s how to tidy up your home:**

1. **Improve your curb appeal.** Rake leaves, trim trees, and do upkeep on your landscaping. If you need help with these services, reach out to us—we know several great companies that can make your lawn look great.
2. **Remove clutter.** Get rid of items on countertops, on the floor, etc. You’re trying to create an open space, and if it feels cluttered, it won’t seem nearly as spacious as it actually is.
3. **Invest in a good deep cleaning.** Buyers notice things like dusty floorboards and dirty ceiling fans—things the homeowner may overlook. This can cause buyers to think, “Has this home really been maintained?” If you need a cleaning service, let us know and we’ll put you in contact with one.
4. **Rearrange furniture.** You want an open space so people can easily walk through the home and its rooms. You should remove any furniture that is blocking doorways or closets. Oversized furniture can also create a problem with the perception of space.
5. **Create a positive emotional response.** Buyers can see half a dozen homes in a day, but what they’re going to remember most are the ones that struck a positive emotional chord. Try to capitalize on this by invoking good feelings and making them see how great their life may be if they choose your home.
