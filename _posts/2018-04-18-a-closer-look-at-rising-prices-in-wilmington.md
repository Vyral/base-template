Why are home prices in the Wilmington area still rising?&nbsp;

Well, price is a function of supply and demand. **As long as there are more buyers than homes to buy, prices will continue to rise.**&nbsp;

In Wilmington today, there is less than 3 months of supply for homes priced under $300,000. Low inventory creates a strong seller’s market, and means those listing their properties can ask for slightly higher prices than normal.

If you aren’t already familiar, the term “inventory” refers to how long it would take for the market to run out of listings if no other properties were listed during that time

Below $100,000 there is about 1.3 months of inventory and between $100,000 and $200,000, there’s about 1.7 months of inventory. Between $200,000 to $300,000, there’s around 2.5 months of inventory.

However, **there is a little more inventory above in the price range above $300,000****.** So, if you’re thinking of upgrading to a more expensive home, now may be the perfect time to do so.
