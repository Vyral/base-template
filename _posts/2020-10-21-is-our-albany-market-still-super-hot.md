Today I’ll talk about our market, buying peace of mind, and raising money for a good cause.

In addition to my regular market update, I have a couple issues that are near and dear to my heart that I want to share with you today&nbsp;

First, **the Albany real estate market is still super hot.** We’ve seen a bit of a seasonal slowdown this fall, but a lot of multiple-offer situations are still happening, and many homes are still selling far over list price. If you’re thinking of selling, now’s a great time to do so. If you’re a buyer, don’t get discouraged. You may have to pay more for a house, but with mortgage rates as low as they are, your monthly payments are still very reasonable, which levels out the increase in prices.&nbsp;

Second, it’s getting cold outside, which means it’s time to turn the heat on in your house. Every year I read about homeowners suffering from carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, but **for just $29.95, you can buy a CO detector and keep your family safe.** If you have a gas fireplace, water heater, stove, or any appliance that produces CO, $29.95 is a small price to pay for peace of mind.

My daughter is a senior at Marist College who lives off-campus in a 2-bedroom, privately owned apartment that’s probably six or seven years old. She called me a week ago because all the CO detectors were going off. When the fire department got there and tested the air, they found that the CO levels were 4x what’s considered safe. After some investigation, they found that the cause was the furnace filter. In all the years the landlord owned the property, they never once changed the furnace filter. It was completely clogged and created a backdraft that led to a surge in CO.

So, always maintain your gas appliances and have a CO detector present in your house. CO is colorless and odorless gas, so a lethal dose can essentially knock you out after you fall asleep. Additionally, state law requires you to have a CO detector in your house if you want to sell it. I want to do my part to help keep your family safe, so if you can’t afford a CO detector, reach out to me and I’ll buy one for you. I’ll also ship it directly to your door for free.&nbsp;

Lastly, **I’m hosting a virtual fashion walk to raise money for the National Kidney Foundation this November.** Studies show that one out of every three people will be affected by kidney disease, and there are hundreds of thousands of people out there waiting for a kidney transplant. I have two friends who underwent kidney transplants, and I saw up close what they had to go through. Kidney disease is a life-altering condition that impacts many people. One day, you see your doctor because you don’t feel well; the next thing you know, you’re on a transplant list and have to completely change your lifestyle.&nbsp;

I believe it’s important in life to get outside of your comfort zone. Successful people get comfortable being uncomfortable, and this fashion walk is completely out of my comfort zone. If you want to help me raise money for this cause, [click on this link](https://secure.frontstream.com/catwalk-for-kidneys2020virtual/participant/KevinClancy) to make a donation. Otherwise, stay tuned for more details on this event. We’ll have a great time and raise some money doing it.

If you have questions about any of these topics, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I look forward to hearing from you. Here’s to you and your continued success.
