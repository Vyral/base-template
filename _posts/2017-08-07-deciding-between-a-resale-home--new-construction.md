One question I get asked all the time by buyers is, “Should I buy a new construction home or a resale home?”

The answer, of course, depends on a few things. Each type of house has its pros and cons.

**With new construction homes, you get a brand-new shiny penny****, so to speak.** Not only is this option low maintenance because everything is new (new roof, new furnace, etc), but your house’s design features will follow the latest trends in real estate. One of the disadvantages of new construction, though, is you’ll typically have to buy a much smaller lot than what a resale home offers.

**With resale homes, your home will have older features, mechanicals, and systems.** This doesn’t mean these things can’t be updated, though, so you have to be prepared to budget for updating them. You also have to be prepared to budget for the features that make up your home’s overall fashion aesthetic, such as the floors, cabinets, counters, etc.

Again, what’s best for you depends on what your wants and needs are. The good thing about our Portland market is you typically can’t buy new construction with giant lots. If you could, the resale market would probably suffer.

If you have any questions about which option is best for you, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help.
