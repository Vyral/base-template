{% include youtube.html %}Many communities across the Midwest are currently facing severe damage from this year’s earlier flooding, including our own Tulsa area, and we at the Wolek Team would like to help. Through our charity group, Keys to the City, we are going to be giving $500 to six different families in need of flood relief. If you know someone here in Tulsa or the surrounding area whose home was lost or severely damaged by the recent flooding, please nominate them to receive our donation using <u><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0lN2fLBC4asAbqHSl20yWFo8fQEFgcEbMMrQqWJBd8_o9Ww/viewform">this form</a></strong></u>. We’ll be selecting the six lucky families by July 1, so send your nominations in as soon as possible. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.
