A lot of agents set goals but never reach them. That’s not how we do things on our team.

Our team hit all our goals for 2016, and we are ready to crush it even more in the new year. We are looking to close on more than 300 homes this year, but we need some help.

**We are looking to hire two buyer agents to help us reach our goals.** The ideal candidate is fearless, bold, energetic, and enthusiastic. Accountability is huge, too—it’s at the top of our list. We do a ton of coaching and goal achievement to help keep our agents on track.

A lot of agents who set goals of selling 40 or 50 homes end up closing six and calling it good. That’s not what we do here. We really thrive on goal achievement and setting ourselves up for success by making sure our priorities are taken care of.

**We don’t charge desk fees, we provide a ton of quality leads,** and we teach you the best practices in converting those leads. We want you to know what to do with a lead so you can gameplan for yourself and make sure you have a good year.

If this is something that sounds interesting to you, feel free to email me directly or just give me a call. I would love to meet with you, get your resume, and chat. Even if you’re a new agent, we’d love to hear from you too. In fact, one of our new agents is on track to sell 50 homes this year.

If you possess the mindset to succeed in this role, we look forward to hearing from you soon.
