{% include youtube.html %}How do you know what your potential is? If you’re asking yourself this question, we can help you find the answer. **As instructors for Quantum Leap for Young Adults (ages 18-30), we want to invite you to an upcoming life and leadership workshop on October 12.** We’ll help you decide what you want your life to look like and create goals around that vision. Additionally, we’ll be offering two scholarships worth $500 that will go toward education and training. The scholarships are courtesy of our non-profit—Keys To The City.

To RSVP and save your seat, <u><a target="_blank" href="https://app.kwkc.org/event/jennie-wolek-10-12-2019">click h</a>ere</u>. If you have any questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
