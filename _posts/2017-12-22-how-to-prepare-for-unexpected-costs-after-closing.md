Buying a new real estate property is exciting, but they often come along with some unexpected expenses right after closing.

People commonly forget about these expenses and they can certainly add up. **Here are just a few examples:**

1. Moving expenses.
2. New furniture.
3. Window treatments.
4. Dishes and cutlery.
5. Shower curtains.

There are many more beyond what I’ve listed. I was amazed when I bought my first home to see just how lengthy and expensive a process it was to fully furnish and decorate the home. **Between shelving, appliances, paper goods, and more, fine details can really add up.**

For that reason, it’s important to do some budgeting beforehand. Compile a list of the things you’ll need when you move in so that you aren’t surprised at the additional costs associated with your new home. However, **don’t buy these items prior to closing.** This can have a negative impact on your loan.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
