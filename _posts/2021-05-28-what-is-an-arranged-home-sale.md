The central Ohio market is hotter than ever, and it’s been a challenge for both buyers and sellers. Buyers are having to compete with multiple offers in order to win a home, and sellers are trying to wind up homeless as they sell their properties and look for new ones to buy themselves.

**One solution that we at Vision Realty offer is an arranged home sale.** We’ve created a list of buyers and sellers, and we reach out to people directly to match our buyers with sellers and vice versa. That means we can find a replacement property for you, let you preview it, and if after that, you’d like to put your current home on the market, we’ll already have an arranged sale for you.

If you would like more information about arranged home sales or would like to be added to our list, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.
