One question clients frequently ask me is, “Should I get a home inspection?”

The answer is definitely yes. Home inspections are incredibly important for a few reasons.

First, let’s talk about what a home inspection is. When you purchase property in the state of Idaho, **agents typically write up a contingency in the real estate contract that allows buyers to have the home inspected before they go through with the transaction.**

Typically, the inspection must be performed within five to 10 business days after going under contract. When you hire a professional home inspector, their job is to go over the property and check every detail.

They should go up onto the roof, up into the attic, and even into crawlspaces to make sure that everything is safe and in good condition. Home inspectors will also make sure the home’s systems and appliances are in working order. **A home inspection ensures that the property you’re buying is safe and sound.**

Of course, there is almost always something that could be improved upon in a used property. But, what about when you buy a new construction home? Do you still need a home inspection during for that kind of purchase? Actually, yes. I always recommend that you get an inspection.

I was once working on a transaction for a new construction home where the inspector discovered the attic had no insulation. **It just goes to show that new homes can still come with problems.**

Another question people ask me pertaining to home inspections is, “If I have a one-year warranty, should I still have my inspection done prior to closing or should I wait until I’ve entered that warranty period?”

Either one of these options works, but there is something I’d like you to think about: **If you find a deal-breaker issue prior to buying the home, you can still back out.** This isn’t the case if you wait until you’re under that one-year home warranty.
