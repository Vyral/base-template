I’m excited today to introduce Sparks mayoral candidate Jeff Bonano. As our special guest, he has a few things to say about our community.

“The Sparks community has seen a lot of growth since it was founded in 1904,” says Jeff. “Now with almost 100,000 people, **it’s easy to see why Sparks is a great place to live and build your own life.”&nbsp;**

Jeff has been a resident here for most of his life, and he says the “old-community feel” is one of the things he loves most about Sparks. Jeff also appreciates how safe and family-oriented our community is, as well as all the things there are to do here.

For car enthusiasts, there is Hot August Nights; for food-lovers, there’s the West Nugget Rib Cook-off; and for families, there’s the Pumpkin Palooza.&nbsp;

It’s no wonder why our community is so well-loved by Jeff and all its residents. **If you aren’t from Sparks, you should definitely come on down and check us out for yourself.** For those who are from Sparks and would like to know more about Jeff, you can visit his website at [www.JeffBonano.com](http://www.jeffbonano.com/index.html), find him on Facebook at @JMBonano, or call his community hotline at (755) 354-4442.&nbsp;
