We're halfway through 2015 right now, so I thought I'd let you know a little about the kind of market that we're seeing right now.

**We're currently seeing a seller's market, but it's beginning to even out quite a bit.** We have just under 3,600 homes on the market right now, and this is actually a little low for the amount of inventory we usually see.

**Sellers are seeing multiple offer situations, and we're seeing a lot of properties beginning to sell very quickly.** This means that buyers need to move quickly in this market and make strong offers on homes that they like. Don't be afraid to be a little aggressive, otherwise you may not get the home that you really want.

With the shortage of inventory we had this spring, we have seen home values rise. However, **we expect prices to stabilize** because we have been getting a lot more homes on the market lately.

If you're looking to buy, please get into contact with us. We can show you homes that aren't even on the market yet.

We can also help you sell for top dollar. Reach out to us at any time!
