In addition to making sure you come to our client appreciation party on November 20, I also wanted to talk to you a little bit about my recent trip to D.C. and what I learned while I was there.

I’ve got a few different things to talk to you about today. **First, I want to talk about our client appreciation party and annual apple pie giveaway.** It’s going to be on November 20, so keep an eye on your mail for an official invite. If you’re not on our mailing list already, give me a call at (518) 461-9937 and I’d be happy to add you. We would love to see you there and give you a pie as a way of saying thanks for your support.

**Next, I want to talk about my recent trip to Washington D.C.** I got in early before my meetings and had an opportunity to take an awesome run through the national mall. The Vietnam Memorial, in particular, made me realize what a great country we live in and how those who have paid the ultimate price have allowed us to live with freedom. **One of the biggest freedoms we have is owning real estate in the greatest country in the world.** Not everyone has the ability or freedom to do that. Even if you don’t think you can afford it or you don’t think you can qualify for a mortgage, reach out to us. Oftentimes you can own a home for less than what you’re paying in rent right now and we’d love to help you get the process started.

While in D.C., I also had the opportunity to meet some of the top executives in the country and see the billions of dollars that have been pouring into the real estate industry from venture capital firms to fix inefficiencies that we’ve had for decades. I think in the next five years, we’ll see a ton of big changes. For example, there are companies where you can put your address in your computer and get an instant offer on your home based on an algorithm. You literally put your address in, someone comes out to your home, and you can have an offer within a day or two. **I’m working on a program like that with some investors that we hope to be able to offer you soon.**

If you have any questions for me about anything I mentioned above or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
