Trade wars, tariffs, and recessions… oh my\! These buzzwords have been floating around a lot lately, but what’s actually happening in our local real estate market today? Today, we’ll cut through the clutter and get straight to the point about what’s going on.

For one thing, **there is some truth to the talk that change is coming**. Calling it a recession might raise some alarm, but there’s no denying that the economy isn’t quite where it should be. If it were, the Fed wouldn’t have lowered rates as far as they are now.

So **what does this volatility mean for you and your real estate goals?&nbsp;**Simply put, while you do need to be strategic, it’s still possible for buyers and sellers alike to get a great deal. And for those who aren’t interested in leaving their current home, there are still opportunities to be had. Namely, it’s a great time to refinance.

Of course, you shouldn’t do any of these things without connecting with a professional first. After all, everyone’s circumstances are different and not everyone will benefit from the same strategies.
