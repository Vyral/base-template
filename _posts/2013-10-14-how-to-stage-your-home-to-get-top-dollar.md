{% include youtube.html %}Welcome back! If you’re getting your home ready to sell, it’s important to know how to appeal to buyers. What is it that they want to see when they view your home? Here are four important elements of preparing your home.

1. Curb Appeal. The front of your home is the first impression buyers have. Make sure you have a well-kept lawn, plant some new flowers and if needed, put on a fresh coat of paint.
2. Lighting. Buyers want a bright home. Put the maximum wattage light bulbs in and open all the shades and curtains.
3. Remove all personal items. When a buyer looks at your home it’s important they imagine themselves living in the home; that can be hard when pictures of your family vacation are everywhere.
4. Staging. We have a professional stager on our team that can help make your home appear more spacious and appealing to buyers.

If you have any questions about how to prepare your home, please give me a call!
