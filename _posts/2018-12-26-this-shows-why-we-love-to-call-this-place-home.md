I hope you enjoy this gorgeous aerial tour of everything our area has to offer, from Crystal Beach in Destin all the way to Rosemary Beach on East 30 A. Itâ€™s easy to see why people love Northwest Florida's Gulf Coast. The clarity of our water, the white sandy beaches, and the southern charm make this place incredibly special. I was born and raised here and there is truly no place like home.
