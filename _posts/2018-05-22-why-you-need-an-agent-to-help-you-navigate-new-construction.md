Do you actually need an agent to represent you when you do new construction?

If you’re thinking about new construction, the builder is always going to have an agent who will be more than happy to help you through the process. However, make no mistake, you’ll need your own real estate agent from the beginning. **Even if it’s plug-and-play with the builder’s agent on site, you want someone who will represent only you and your best interests during the process**.

The job of the builder’s agent is to get that builder the most money in their pocket as they can. Your agent’s job is to get you the best value for your money with the least amount of hassle and frustration during the entire transaction.

**Your agent should already have relationships with various builders and price ranges** so that they can steer you in the right direction with a reputable builder. Believe it or not, there’s a big difference between builders as far as quality of work, even in the same price ranges. Getting things done according to a timeline and keeping the customer happy is not a universal skill.

**It will also help if your agent has knowledge of the building process** so they can help you through the pre-construction period, drawing on their prior experience to have things in order from the start. This way, you can avoid delays with the architect, the builder, the engineer, and the city.

An experienced agent can help you with choosing the best lot that fits your needs, the best floor plan, and a number of other factors you might not have considered if you haven’t done this before. These could be things like where to put extra plugs, where you’ll put your furniture. Optimizing the utility of the home will depend on how it’s built, and agents can help you plan it out.

Finally, **they can often recognize any red flags that may come up as the transaction moves along**. They should be getting at least weekly updates from the builder’s agent and relaying them back to you.

Overall, there are a lot of moving parts to a new construction transaction, and having someone on your side looking out for you will make the process smooth and hassle-free. If you have any questions about this or real estate in general, feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
