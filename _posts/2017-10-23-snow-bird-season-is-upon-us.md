It’s snowbird season! That means it’s selling season here in Florida. Every year, starting around November, the snowbirds start rolling in.** By the time the new year rolls around, the season is in full force.**

Snowbirds are, of course, visitors of Florida during the winter who come from cold and snowy climates. Some stay a week or two, some stay a month, and some own homes here and stay all season. They have a big seasonal effect on our real estate market.

**If you’re currently a homeowner in Florida and thinking of selling, I want to give you a word of caution about pricing.** There are currently 3,032 homes with pools priced under $500,000. That’s a lot of competition for you if you have a similar home. The bottom line: Listen to your Realtor’s suggestions when it comes to pricing. If you think the home is worth more than they do, get an appraisal to settle the score. The appraisal will also be a great selling tool for your Realtor down the line.

If you’re thinking about buying a home down here because you’re a snowbird yourself, there is a lot of great inventory out there now. **The seasonal peak hasn’t hit yet, so you can purchase in a much less competitive market.**There’s no guarantee that owning a home in Florida is going to be more affordable. Even after the recent hurricanes, our market still keeps chugging along.

If you have any questions for me about buying a home, selling a home, or about the real estate market in general, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
