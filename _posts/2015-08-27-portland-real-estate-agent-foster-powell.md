Today, I'm here to talk about the Foster Powell neighborhood, affectionately known to Portland residents as FoPo. One reason FoPo is so popular is the diversity of businesses, home styles, and street layouts.It truly is a unique blend of neighborhoods.

No Portland neighborhood is complete without food carts, and FoPo is no different. Be sure to check out Carts on Foster. There are so many different options: pizza, barbecue, vegan, and more! Roadrunner BBQ was voted the #3 barbecue establishment in Portland by the Oregonian. Visit their Yelp page to see the reviews.

Carts on Foster even has a beer pod. Steve Woolard owns the Pod Bar. It's open from 12:00 pm to 9:00 pm every day. It's family friendly, dog friendly, and you can fill a growler for just nine dollars! Check out their Yelp page for more information.

Also, make sure to check out the Portland Mercado. This is a Latino-themed market and food court plaza. It's a great platform for local businesses to grow and succeed. There's a produce market, a coffee shop, a juice bar, and much more! Tierra Del Sol is great food at the Portland Mercado. Check them out at portlandmercado.com/tierradelsol. Make sure to stop by in person and try one of their amazing tacos!

All in all, this is a fantastic neighborhood. If you're interested in living in the Foster Powell neighborhood, give me a call or send me an email. I'd be happy to help you!
