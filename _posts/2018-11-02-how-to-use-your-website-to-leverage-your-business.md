Welcome back to our webinar series on real estate fundamentals. For part nine of our series, I wanted to touch on **one of the pieces of technology that is underutilized in many of our agents’ businesses: websites.**

In no way do I think it’s critical that our agents become web developers, but at the very least, they should know what the tools that are available to them can do to increase their business. Keller Williams invests $1 million per week in technology and that technology is available for us to use to leverage our businesses.
