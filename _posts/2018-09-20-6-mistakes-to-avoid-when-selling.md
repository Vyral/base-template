In my 14-year career, I have seen many sellers make detrimental mistakes. Today I want to give you six of the biggest ones so you can avoid making them as well:

**1. Picking the wrong agent.** The right agent will answer your calls or at the very least return them in a timely manner. They will be professionals who know the market from experience and be honest and straightforward with you. You want someone who will tell you the truth, not just what you want to hear. 

**2. Overpricing your home.** When selling, pricing is everything to potential buyers. Even a home with poor marketing will sell if it is priced right.

**3. Failing to make repairs to your home.**  You need to fix those minor repairs such as the dog-chewed baseboards because buyers can see it when they walk through your home.

**4. Neglecting to declutter.** Most buyers start their home searches online, so you want your pictures to show off your home, not your stuff. If you leave your home cluttered, there’s a good chance buyers won’t want to look at your home. To help declutter, get boxes to pack up personal items and store them in the garage or a storage pod. 

**5. Not allowing adequate access to your home.** Make sure your home is show-ready for potential buyers, because I found out that eight out of 10 won’t try to see your home a second time. 

**6. Getting too emotional about your house.** Sellers are sometimes very attached to their homes because they have a lot of memories there, but when you sell your home, you need to look at it as a property, not your home. If someone gives you a lowball offer or they talk about remodeling the home once they move in, don’t take it personally, especially if you got the money you wanted. 

If you have any additional questions about this, or if you’re interested in speaking with me about buying or selling, please feel free to call or email. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
