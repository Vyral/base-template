As real estate agents, we get internet inquiries and call-ins all the time. We know that our first initiative is to serve the client the best we can and serve the customer on the other end of the line.

But we also know that these are opportunities to get an appointment with a new potential buyer, and we want to capitalize on those opportunities while serving our listing client, if that’s applicable. If an internet inquiry or a call comes in, we usually call back within five minutes, and **here’s a statement we use for that call that works better for us than just about any others:**

“Hi (client name), this is (agent name) with (name of real estate company). I see you inquired about (property address) through Zillow. What questions can I answer for you about that property and do you have a time that would work for you to preview that home?”

Asking those two questions does two things. First, it addresses the reason they inquired. Second, it opens the door for them to preview the property with you. When someone calls about a property, they typically have a question in mind, but they may not have been thinking about previewing the property.

Typically, they’ll follow up with the question they called about. Assuming you have factual information, you can answer their question or say you’ll bring the property up and follow up with “As I’m bringing the property up, is there a good time that would work for you to preview this property?”

Restating that opens up their mind even more. More often than not, they’ll opt into that appointment. Keep in mind that after they elect to have the appointment, if they’re going to be asking opinion-based questions, you still have to do the oral consumer notice and make sure you’re explaining agency relationships. We’re always going to need to qualify that prospect.

Here’s the thing—we’re often afraid to set the appointment because we’re putting the cart before the horse. **Oftentimes, though, the person wants the appointment, so go ahead and give it to them.** After that, make sure you qualify them well, because you don’t want to waste your time, the seller’s time, or the prospect’s time.

Go through all the typical questions, such as:

* “Are you already working with another agent?” If they say yes, make sure they get back to their agent so that agent can show them the property.
* “Have you looked out for or obtained financing yet?” If they haven’t obtained financing, you can simply postpone the home preview and put them in touch with a lender.

**So, again, start the conversation with why they called and ask if they have time to preview the home.** Asking those two questions in your first breath will go a long way in helping you get an appointment with every customer who calls in.

If you have any more questions about securing appointments, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to chat with you.
