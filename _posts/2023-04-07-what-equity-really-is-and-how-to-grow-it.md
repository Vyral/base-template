One of the benefits of being a homeowner is that you build equity over time by selling your house. That equity can be used towards purchasing your next home. But before you can put it to use, you should understand exactly what equity is and how it grows.&nbsp;

**Home equity is the portion of your home you've paid off**. In other words, your stake in the property, as opposed to the lenderâ€™s. In practical terms, home equity is the appraised value of your home minus any outstanding mortgages and loan balances. If you've owned your home for a while, you've likely built up some equity. You may not even realize how much. Such a large amount of equity benefits homeowners in more ways than one.

Record levels of home equity provide security for millions of families, minimizing the chance of another housing market crash like the one we saw in 2008. Over time, your home equity grows. In addition to providing financial stability while you're in your house when you're ready to sell, that money can go a long way toward paying for your next home. **By selling your house and leveraging your equity, it could be easier to pay for your next home.**
