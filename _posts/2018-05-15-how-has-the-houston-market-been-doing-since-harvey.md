Today I’d like to discuss the state of the real estate market in the North Houston area.

Everyone has heard that the market is really hot—it’s a seller’s market, homes are coming on the market which people can’t buy because they immediately receive multiple offers, and so on. **We are not seeing the same thing in the Houston market.**

Our market is impacted by oil prices. For the past two or three years, oil prices have been down, which has been reflected in our market; we never crashed like the rest of the country did.

Now that the country has been doing well for the past few years, we haven’t been. I don’t mean that we’ve crashed and burned—in 2015, prices adjusted and came down a little bit from where they were in 2014.

{% include pullquote.html %}<br><br>We are now seeing an uptrend in oil prices, though, and we know that as oil prices go up, so do home prices. **But we’ve also had Hurricane Harvey to contend with.** Thousands of homes were flooded and people were moved into apartments or short-term rentals for six months. Now that those six months are over, people have gotten their insurance money and they’re coming back to the market. Still, those homes are still flooded or haven’t been fully updated, so that means that we have a shortage of inventory.

It’s summertime, and now that those leases are up, people are coming back to the market to look for new homes. That means we’re headed for a seller’s market. **However, people are now uncertain in the aftermath of the hurricane:** Should they buy a home or rent? Should they return to the area that was flooded, where their support system and schools were, or should they just move to a new area altogether?

A sizeable portion of people who were displaced by the storm are deciding to stay in the area rather than uproot their lives and leave their support systems behind. But some people’s homes have been flooded even up until Tax Day; those people are scared. If they’re not being purchased by buyers, they’re selling it to the investors. Usually, investors will rent those homes out to build the equity back up for the purpose of reselling it in the future. That means that we can likely expect a number of these homes to appear on the market soon.

Looking at these different factors, it’s very difficult to decide where the market is going end up exactly. When people ask me when is a good time to buy a home**, I simply say that you have to look at the market individually.** Different parts of Houston may be impacted differently; it’s hard to make a general prescription.<br><br>This is why you need a professional Realtor to look at the area you’re interested in and figure out whether or not it’s a viable path for you. I’ll continue to discuss what changes we see over time, so if you have any questions in the meantime, please feel free to reach out to me.
