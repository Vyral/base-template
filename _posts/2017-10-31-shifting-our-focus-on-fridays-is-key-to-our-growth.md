Our team takes one day out of the week to spend some time thinking about and working toward the bigger picture. You see, **on Fridays, our team spends time focusing on ways to make million dollar plus real estate deals.**

Now, there are only 222 homes sold each year, on average, for over $750,000 here in Columbus. With over 6,000 agents in the city, that’s a very small pie to slice up. Instead of spending all of our time focusing on luxury homes and trying to get a 10% to 20% market share, **we instead choose to focus more on the opportunities in the commercial real estate world.**

Right now, there are over 680 properties listed for sale above the $1 million mark across 20 different asset classes in Columbus. These asset classes include hotels, motels, gas stations, restaurants, and more.

In order to increase our chances of getting these kinds of listings, we put our networking skills into overdrive. **Fridays are for connecting with buyers, sellers, agents, and lots of business executives.** Right now, we’re focusing our efforts on hotels. There are 27 hotel owners in Columbus right now that we are trying to get in touch with on a weekly basis. As we slowly build that network, we’ll build that pipeline of people who focus on these deals.

If this isn’t something that’s part of your business plan, it should be. If you don’t have goals that include increasing your production and doing bigger and better deals, maybe you need to join a team that can show you the path to success. If you have any questions for me about our team, our Friday schedule, or anything else about the real estate business, give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you.
