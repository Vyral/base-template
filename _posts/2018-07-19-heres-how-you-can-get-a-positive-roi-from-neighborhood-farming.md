The rules say that you have to hit people at least three times before you get a positive return from neighborhood farming, but every single time I hit my neighborhood, I end up with at least one listing. 

How? 

You have to be consistent with your touches and remember that **the meaningful touches are what make the difference.** It’s not how many postcards or emails you can send someone—it’s what value you can provide them whenever you touch that particular farm. If you send someone a postcard that talks only about yourself, how good you are, and how much you need their listing, nobody will care. What they care about is the value proposition you offer them.

If, for example, the average days on market for homes is 78 days but your homes’ average days on market is 38 days, that’s what kind of value you can offer them. If the average home in your market sells for 97% of the list price but your listings sell for 99.1% of the list price, that’s another value you can offer them. 

**How meaningful and valuable your touches are matter more than how many times a person hears from you. **
