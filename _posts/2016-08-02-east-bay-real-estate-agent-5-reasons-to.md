When you are out looking at properties, you typically only visit homes during the day. Most open houses on the weekends end before 5 p.m. However, it’s important to visit a home at night before you purchase it. Why? Here are five reasons:

1. **Find out what the commute is like.** Driving in the evening allows you to see what that commute home from work will be like. Here in the East Bay, a lot of people find that the commute is longer than what they want. It is important to know how much time you will spend driving to and from work before you buy a home.

2. **You will see how many kids are in the neighborhood.** During home showings, kids are usually in school. If you go to an open house on the weekend, you might see a few kids, but driving through a neighborhood in the late afternoon or evening gives you a better idea of how many kids are in the neighborhood and if the area is a good fit for your own children.

3. **Is the neighborhood safe?** By driving through the area in the evening or at night, you can spot any potential issues that may threaten your family’s safety.

4. **Are there any loud neighbors?** Will there be people having band practice or loud parties on school nights or during the workweek? Can you live with that?

5. **How is traffic in the area?** If you are buying a place closer to downtown, that area may see some busy traffic around 7 or 8 p.m. The noise may be a problem, but you should also keep in mind that traffic is a safety issue.

If you have any other questions about buying a home or about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
