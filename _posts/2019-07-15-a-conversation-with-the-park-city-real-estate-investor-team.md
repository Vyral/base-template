**I’m joined today by Annett Blankenship and Drew Via of the Park City Real Estate Investor Team to talk a little bit about how they’ve structured their team to provide maximum service and efficiency to their considerable client base.**

They’re one of our top teams and their business model is commendable. They have one of the most highly trafficked websites in Park City and have managed to achieve a very high conversion rate, which is very difficult to do. Their client reviews are outstanding as well. How do they do it?

**Annett and Drew feel that anybody who is reaching out from their website is already a step ahead of other buyers and sellers in the market.** They’re educated, they know where the market is going, and they know the different neighborhoods, which makes it much easier to get out and start looking at properties.

Annett focuses on marketing, mainly—web-based, print, and more. She also takes some business on the side from families and friends. Drew is the lead salesman, following up with leads, creating relationships, and bringing in new business.

**When going through a typical day, they always look through their calendars a night before to prioritize tasks and what needs to be done and when.** Transactional stuff usually happens in the morning, and they roll into phone calls and showings after that. Each day is different, but organization is key.

The key to their communication is being in the same office every day. They’ve tried to work separately, but it just doesn’t lead to the same results. Five feet away from each other is the best place to be, as far as Annett and Drew are concerned.

If you want to learn more about Annett and Drew’s business, [visit their website here](https://www.parkcityinvestor.com/){: target="_blank"} or give them a call at [(435) 649-6659](tel:435-649-6659){: target="_blank"}.

If you have any other questions for me in the meantime about the real estate business in general, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
