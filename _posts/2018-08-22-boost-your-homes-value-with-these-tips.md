On every listing appointment my team and I go on, sellers ask us how they can get the most money from their home sale.

We typically don’t advocate spending a lot of money on your home before listing it, but if you want to increase its value so that it sells quickly and for top dollar, we recommend making a few specific improvements.

**The first thing you should improve is the home’s curb appeal.** If your house doesn’t look good from the street, people who made appointments to come see it won’t even bother looking inside. This means your front yard landscaping should be fresh and the entire front entryway should be clear and clean. It also doesn’t hurt to add some color around your front door.

**On the inside of the home, you need to declutter and depersonalize.** Decluttering means adding space to your house. Whenever we prepare a house for the market, about a third of its items go into storage. This way, it resembles a new construction model home. Depersonalizing means removing any personal photos so buyers are free to focus on just the home itself.

If you have any questions about this topic or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
