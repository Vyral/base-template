In today’s market, plenty of people find themselves needing to buy a new home and sell their current home simultaneously. The stakes are high, and a couple of false moves can cause both transactions to crash and burn. **Here are a few simple steps to avoid these mistakes:**

**1\. Don’t wait too long to prep your home for sale.** You may need to repair it, fix decking, or add grout to bathrooms. Don’t wait until the last minute to kickstart this process. Otherwise, you could end up in a bind.

**2\. Get pre-approved for your new home.** The pre-approval is essential because it puts a stop to unrealistic expectations by telling you exactly what price you can afford.&nbsp;

**3\. Give yourself a cushion with pricing.** If the market decides to cool down, you’ll want to give yourself a cushion on what you really need to sell your existing home for. As you go through the process, the rule of thumb is to move forward with the assumption that your home will sell for less than expected.
