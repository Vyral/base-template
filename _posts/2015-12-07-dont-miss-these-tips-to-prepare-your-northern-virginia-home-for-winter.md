{% include youtube.html %}Last time we covered how to prepare for winter on the inside of your home, and **in this episode we're going to discuss how you can winterize the outside of your property.**

You can start by performing some preventative yard maintenance. This will include raking your leaves, clearing your gutters, fertilizing your lawn, and perhaps even mowing the lawn one last time. **Clearing your gutters is important for keeping snowmelt away from your foundation in the spring.**

**It's also crucial that you drain your sprinkler pipes so that they don't burst during a hard freeze.** You might need to hire someone to blow out your pipes if you cannot do so yourself. Right now is also a good time to touch up on the paint covering your siding, decks, and patio.

**Something else that is often overlooked is replacing or adding caulk and weather stripping to your doors and windows.** This will help insulate your home and will even save you money on your energy bill.

If you have a real chimney or fireplace, have it checked by a professional to ensure that you won't encounter a problem during the middle of a blizzard.

If you have any questions about these issues, please don't hesitate to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you!
