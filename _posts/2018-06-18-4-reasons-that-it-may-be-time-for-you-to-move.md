How do you know when it is time to move? Maybe you feel like your family is constantly elbowing for more room. Or, maybe your life recently changed. You could even be looking for a fresh start. Whatever the reason may be, I am here today to provide you with the four main reasons why people decide that it is the best time to move.<br> <br>**1. Space.** If your kids have moved out and you are tired of cleaning a big house, now may be the time for you to downsize. Size may be an issue for new families or families with kids who require more space. In this case, it may be time to upgrade. We have a specialized trade program that gives our upsizing and downsizing clients the ability to transition out of their existing home and move into a new one.<br> <br>**2. Commuting.** Maybe you are spending too much time in your car commuting across town and would rather spend that time enjoying the back porch of your new home.

School district.** You may want your kids in a different school district and you now have the ability to put them into a better school district to get a better education.<br> <br>**4. Financial situation.** Your financial situation may change because of winning the lottery. Or, you may have the opposite issue. Either way, we have an immediate buyout program where we have the ability to purchase your existing home from you no matter what your circumstance.<br> <br>Knowing if and when you should move is confusing. We have the ability to sit down with you and do a free consultation to determine if now is the perfect time for you to move. We can tell you exactly what you could get for your existing home, how much you will have left over, and what available options there are for you to transition seamlessly.<br> <br>If you would like to speak with us more about this, please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
