Buying a new home is a very exciting time, but it can also be confusing trying to figure out where to begin. So before you purchase your new home, there are a few things you’ll want to do to ensure the process goes smoothly. **Here are five steps to keep in mind:**

**1. Speak with your lender about a budget.** You need to understand your budget and know what price point you can actually afford. You don’t want to end up living paycheck to paycheck because you overextended your purchasing power.

**2. Determine what features are essential.** What must you have and what would you simply like to have? **If you can find 80% of what you’re looking for in a home, you’ve most likely found the right one.** Draw that line between a necessity and a nice bonus.

**3. Research your neighborhood.** Take a drive down the street, walk its sidewalks, peruse local shops, enjoy dining experiences, check out schools and churches—**get a feel of where you’d be living.**

**4. Pick the right style for you.** Are you looking for a charming rowhouse? Do you want an elevator in your building? What about full amenities? These are things to think about when looking for a home that will facilitate your needs.

**5. Document your visits.** Keeping track of homes and neighborhoods you’ve seen is a great way to weigh out your options. After seeing three or four properties, everything can begin to sort of blend together. **Pictures, videos, and notes can help you remember what your experience was.**
