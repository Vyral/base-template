You may have noticed a different logo behind me in today's video.

I'm excited to say that I've teamed up with Atlas Premier Realty and today, I wanted to take a moment to talk about the last few months and why I made the change.

Over the last 15 years I've served homebuyers and sellers on a very transactional basis. This move came down to a commitment to what I want the next 15 years to look like. After a lot of soul-searching, it came down to community. **I wanted to serve the people that I know, like, and love with more purpose. My move to Atlas Premier Realty is all about how I can make a bigger footprint and make our community better.**

This move allows me to work more purposefully for you in a way that's also simpler and easier for you. Ultimately, our goal is to become the real estate company of choice here in Carroll County that's built around uncompromising experience and an environment which focuses on building long-standing relationships with purpose in our community.

Here at Atlas, we value family, integrity, communication, accountability, and humility whether we're working on a real estate transaction or working to make the community a better place.

I really appreciate your love and support not just in the last few weeks during this transition, but really through the last 15 years. I'm really looking forward to making the next 15 years even better with you and our community.

If there's anything I can ever do to help you, please don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I'd be honored to help you!
