Staying on top of home repair tasks is critical, so today I’d like to share some insight into how small fixes, if delayed, can turn into major headaches.&nbsp;

Today I’d like to go over a few easy fixes and expensive mistakes that homeowners should be aware of. **There are many small things you can do right now that will help you save a huge amount of money down the line.&nbsp;**

For instance, I highly recommend changing out all the lightbulbs in your home to energy-efficient ones. You can do this one room at a time if you’re concerned about the initial expense, but know that in the long run the cost will be well worth it.&nbsp;

Another recommendation I’d like to share is to never ignore a leaky faucet. More than just being wasteful, leaks like this can also cause thousands of dollars worth of damage. So **whenever you notice a minor issue in your home, it’s best to address it before it becomes a major expense.&nbsp;**

And speaking of home maintenance, make sure that you’re taking good care of your furnace. This means regularly replacing air filters and using the correct size of filter when you do so. This, as well as making sure your hot water heater isn’t set too high, will help you save on energy expenses.&nbsp;

**Another great way to make your home more energy efficient is to install a programmable thermostat.** This will help you regulate the temperature of your home on a schedule, or even remotely.&nbsp;

Finally, homeowners who want to avoid expensive repairs should keep a close eye on their roof. And if you find anything wrong with it, don’t delay repairs. What might be a $500 fix now could be a $5,000 set back if you put the problem off.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
