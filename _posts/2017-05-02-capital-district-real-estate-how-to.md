How should you sort your database? We use five distinct tags.

The question of how to qualify or sort your database comes up a lot. I always say that your success or failure in real estate is in direct proportion to the number of people that think of you when they think of real estate. It's important to reach out to them consistently.

For our database, we use Top Producer. Regardless of what you use, you need to create tags. **We use five different tags** for every client or prospect that goes into our database.

{% include pullquote.html %}

**The first category is my raving fans VIP list**; people who trust me, know who I am, and whom I've sold multiple homes to or have given me multiple referrals. The second category is 'A clients,' or those who have referred business to me or would in the future. The goal is to get every level of client to the next level.

The next group, 'B clients,' are people who would do business with you in the future when they have a need or would refer you business. Then, a 'C client' is someone who hasn't done any business with you or referred you any leads. They might be an Internet lead or someone you met at an open house.

Finally, the last category is the 'D prospects,' or people you just don't want to work with. You might have had a bad experience with them or they just don't return your calls. We have this category for tracking purposes only.

If you have any questions about sorting your database or you'd like a copy of how we break down our categories, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I'd be glad to help.
