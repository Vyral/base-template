After much anticipation the [Desert Flower](https://www.mysunwoodhomes.com/southern-utah-communities/desert-flower/) subdivision is here\!&nbsp;

We’ve worked with over 1300 families buying and selling homes here in the St. George area and we can tell you without hesitation, this is the most attractive, highest quality, most well-located “affordable” (everyone defines that differently) housing product in the County\!

Our friends at Sunwood Homes spent a few YEARS developing something the community would really love, AND really needs\!&nbsp;

Desert Flower is made up of 40 single family homes, ranging from the high $270’s to mid $350’s with 2-car garages, block privacy walls and fantastic curb appeal.&nbsp;
