<center><em>If you are thinking about buying a brand-new home, here&rsquo;s a cautionary tale as to why you need representation during this process.</em></center>

&nbsp;

We recently had a house listed for a client who was buying out of the area and wanted to buy a new construction property. **We were able to list and get her home under contract quickly**.

Then she went in to write a contract for a new construction home and let the builder convince her to write the offer without a home sale, knowing that we needed her house sale to close before we could close on her new home purchase.

We were a little delayed on our close and the builder made it really difficult by threatening our client with fees, constantly calling and texting her, and turned a situation that should have been peaceful into a horrible and borderline-abusive situation.

**The best way to avoid a situation like this is to have someone represent you as a buyer**. If we could have referred her to a representative that was looking out for her best interests, all the threats and bad vibes could have been avoided. Representing yourself on a home purchase is a bad idea. It’s like going to court without a lawyer and going up against an all-star team of defense attorneys.

This client didn’t save any money by going straight to a builder. **Hiring a buyer’s agent not only would have cost her nothing, but it would have saved her so much time, hassle, and money**.

If you or someone you know is thinking about buying or selling a home anytime in the near future, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
