Today we are excited to be giving you a market update and talk about some fun things going on in Des Moines right now.

Not only are presidential candidates flooding the city, people who want to live here are flocking to the area as well. **We have had some amazing referrals over the last month,** from all over the country. People have come to us not only through our large referral network, but through our friends and family that live all over. Those referrals mean a lot to us, and we thank you for trusting us and thinking of us when it comes to Des Moines real estate.

If you're not in Des Moines and reading this, we just want you to know **we can help you move no matter where your destination is.** We have fantastic agent relationships all over the country with Keller Williams, and we can get you in touch with a great agent no matter where you are.

In Des Moines, we had a huge surge in business in 2016. January is the busiest month I've ever had in real estate. We have a ton of buyers coming in, a lot of businesses coming in, and we are still short on listings. If you are ready to sell, **now is the time to make your move.** Even if you're just thinking about selling in the future, but don't want to formally list your home, we might just have the perfect buyer for your home. It can never hurt to have the option on the table.

If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you!
