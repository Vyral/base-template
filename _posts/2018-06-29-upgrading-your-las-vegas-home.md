Lately I have been meeting a lot of homeowners that would like to sell their home and upgrade to a larger home or even downsize to a smaller home. However, there has been a big challenge with finding homes for sale.

As we discussed before, the resale market inventory is very low. Therefore, those **homeowners who would like to sell their homes are having trouble finding another home to buy**. Personally, I would not want to sell my home before I can buy another to move into.

An option for homeowners in this situation is to purchase a brand new home. Around town there are many new homes from different builders that are available. They offer different prices, different floor plans, and different areas to live.

If you have any questions about selling your home and how you can make the transition to a new home construction, give me a call. Builders are offering me special incentives as a real estate broker, and I can pass on those savings to you as a buyer. You can even use those incentives toward upgrades or closing costs.

I hope that you all have a happy Fourth of July and, for the Canadians, have a great Canada Day. Talk to you soon!
