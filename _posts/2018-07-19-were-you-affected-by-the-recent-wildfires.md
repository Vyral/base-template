Today I want to pass on some information for those of you whose properties were damaged by the recent wildfires. If your property wasnâ€™t damaged, you may have friends or family that could benefit from this information.

The county assessor recently sent an email to most of us Realtors with information about what you can do if your property was damaged. In the email, it says that **any taxpayer whose property has been severely damaged or destroyed by the recent wildfires may be eligible for disaster relief on annual property tax bills. In some cases, this includes refunds on taxes already paid.**

The link is [here](https://assessor.lacounty.gov/disaster-relief/) for those who may be eligible and need to file a claim for misfortune and calamity relief. This must be done within one year and you must have sustained a minimum of $10,000 in property damage. You may qualify for a refund for taxes already paid as well as lower annual tax bills until the property is repaired or rebuilt.

I know that there is somebody out there who you know who has been affected by the wildfires, so please feel free to pass this information on to them. Hopefully it will help them recover some of their losses.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I would be happy to help in any way that I can.
