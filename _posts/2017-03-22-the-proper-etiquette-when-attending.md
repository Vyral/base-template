Today I’m answering four common questions I get about proper open house etiquette.

More open houses are popping up as we get into the spring market, so today I want to go over proper open house etiquette for homebuyers.

**1. Can I use the bathroom?** If you gotta go, you gotta go. However, if there are a lot of people at a showing, you want to make sure you’re not hindering their ability to see the property. If you do use the restroom during a showing, make sure you leave it how you found it!

**2. Can I bring my coffee?** Most everyone in the current buyer pool loves their coffee. If you need that morning or mid-afternoon pick-me-up, make sure it’s in a container with a lid. You don’t want to be walking around someone’s home with a mug full of coffee.

**3. Can I bring in my food?** No. Never bring in food during a showing.

**4. Can I peek in the closet?** Of course! You’re looking at the home with the possibility of purchasing it, which means you need to know what sort of space the home offers. Just remember to be mindful when peering into personal spaces. For example, don’t open the drawers of dressers or go through anything that won’t be staying with the property. Also, on the subject of respecting privacy and personal space, never take a selfie with the property.

**5. Can I sit on the furniture?** If you want to sit for a second to get the feel of a room or if you have a health condition that hinders your physical capabilities, it’s fine to take a seat. However, lounging on the furniture can come across as disrespectful. You’re there to look at the home and gauge if it’s right for you, so make sure you’re respectful during that process.

If you are looking to buy or sell a home, or if you have any other questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
