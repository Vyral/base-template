Have you heard about the growing trend of multi-generational housing in today’s real estate market? It's something we are currently considering for our aging parents.&nbsp;

This option is great for people who are not yet ready for assisted living but can’t live alone and wish to be near family. **We’ve noticed that more and more buyers are looking for homes that have a full bathroom and bedroom on the first floor to accommodate those who can’t do stairs.**&nbsp;

Also, this multi-generation trend is not limited to seniors. **We are also seeing the return of "boomerang children" due to rising housing costs,** particularly in California. These adult children often need a place to stay to save money to buy a home or due to the unaffordable rental market, so they’re moving back in with their parents.&nbsp;

Our experience in this area allows us to share potential pitfalls to avoid and identify opportunities to save money or find the perfect home for your family. This unexpected trend is only becoming more significant, and we are here to help you navigate it. Just call or email us with any questions. We look forward to hearing from you!
