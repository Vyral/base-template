As real estate agents, open houses are part of the business. On our team, open houses are meticulously planned so that we can have success beyond just the sale of one home. **I recently took a deep dive into our team’s open house strategy and I’m excited for you to hear it.**

Here’s an outline of the video, with timestamps so that you can skip around to the section(s) that interest you the most:

0:30- The criteria we use to choose homes for open houses<br>1:30- Why we prefer holding open houses at vacant homes<br>2:35- Where to put valuables and medications during an open house<br>5:00- How to protect yourself as an agent when hosting an open house<br>7:20- Tips for how to prepare for and market open houses<br>8:15- How to handle lead-in arrows in the neighborhood

I hope this discussion is helpful to you the next time you’re holding an open house. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
