Today we're looking at the major differences between working with a mortgage broker and working with a direct lender or bank. When I say “bank,” I’m referring to banks like Wells Fargo, Chase, etc.

**The main advantage of working with a broker is that their hands aren’t tied like the bigger banks’ are.** If you walk to your local bank branch and try to refinance with them, the answer is black and white. They can either help you or they can’t.

When working with a broker, it’s not like that. If we can’t qualify you now, we can help give you guidance and **show you the concrete steps to take to get your financial health to where it needs to be to qualify in the future.&nbsp;**&nbsp;Another benefit of working with a broker is that we make the banks compete for your business. They give us better rates and better terms, and we pass those savings along to you.

If you have any questions for me about working with a broker or anything else related to refinancing, interest rates, or mortgage in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
