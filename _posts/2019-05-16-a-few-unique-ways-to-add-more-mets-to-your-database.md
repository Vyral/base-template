I recently had a friend who reached out to me and said this: “I’m noticing a great return on my met database. Now I need to know how to get more of them.”

As we know, the more mets we have in our database, the more business we’re going to get. When we’re properly applying a 36-touch program, that should produce a 12:2 return on our database. **Here are the three things I told this friend to consider:**

**1\. Housewarming parties.** Many other teams and businesses have implemented this in order to build their database with mets. Once you help a buyer find a home and once they’re all moved in, tell them you'd love to throw a housewarming party for them. All you need is their invite list: names, email addresses, and home addresses of all of them. You'll send invitations, reminders, and calls to all their friends at the party, and afterward, you have all their contact information. It’s an awesome way to build your database and have fun at the same time.

**2\. Promote local business owners.** A lot of us have these kinds of people in our database already. Promoting them not only adds value, but it also gets their name out there. You can also reach out to the non-business owners in your database and ask them who they know that has a great local business. Then, you can add them to your service provider list.&nbsp;

**3\. Ask your attendees to invite a friend.** That’s just another way you can broaden your circle and meet more people with a warm relationship that can also go in your database.

These are just a few ways that show you how building your met database, and having a referral- and relationship-type business is the way to go. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
