Today we’ll be going over the 2017 market recap and our 2018 housing market predictions.

Unfortunately, we don’t have a crystal ball to see exactly what 2018 holds for the housing market. For now, we have a forecast from top economists and housing experts.

In 2017, home values increased in San Diego by an average of 6.9%. However, experts projected that **growth will slow down in 2018** with a project value increase of 4.1%

As far as rents are concerned, in 2017, rental appreciation increased by 2.9%. This is going to **more than double in 2018** to 6%. With such a huge jump in rental prices and weak income, renters are going to start looking at the option of buying a home, causing more demand in inventory with very little supply.

**There is, however, exciting news for new homebuyers in 2018**. Not only are loan limits increasing, but there are several different programs available, such as down payment assistance programs, self-employed programs, and programs with as little as 10% down with no mortgage insurance.

If you are currently thinking of buying and are tired of renting and throwing your money away, please contact me. I can definitely refer you to our preferred lender. I’m happy to help.
