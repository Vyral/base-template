I'm frequently asked, “What should the process of hiring an agent look like?”

Hiring a real estate agent to help you buy or sell your home is an important decision and you should take it seriously. Hiring a family member or friend may be a good idea, but it also may not be. Take the time to find out whether they are a great agent or not, and do not just take them at their word because you feel obligated. You should be hiring the most qualified person for the job.

As with interviewing anybody for a position, being armed with helpful questions is very important. There was a recent study done that determined the most important assets that smart consumers are looking for in a real estate agent. **Here are the seven most important things you should be looking for, in the forms of questions you should be asking your agent:**

**1. How experienced are you?** You need an agent who is consistently productive. 55% of all agents in the Denver market do not sell a single home in a year. The average is only eight or nine sales per year. You really want to hire an agent who sells 30, 40, or even 50 properties per year and has the experience to deal with every problem that comes up.

**2. What are your numbers?** Ask the agent about their average sale price, their average days on market, etc. If an agent doesn’t know their numbers off the top of their head, that is really not someone you want to get into business with.

**3. If I do not like your service, is there a satisfaction guarantee?** Any good agent will have this kind of guarantee written into the contract. It is important to be able to get out of the agreement if the agent you hire is not doing what they said they would.

**4. Do you work with a team or as an individual agent?** If the agent lacks a support staff, it means they are doing everything themselves. This does not give them the time to commit to their clients like they should.

**5. Do you have a written plan of communication?** For instance, if you have a listing agent, you want to talk to them every week. Many agents just put a sign in the front yard and then never talk to their client again. We discuss the numbers, the market, and the sale with our clients every week.

**6. Do you work with buyers or sellers?** These are two different jobs, essentially. I think finding an agent that specializes in selling homes is a really big deal.

**7. Do you have a list of recent clients?** I recommend getting a list of the last 10 people that they worked with to get a better idea of the service you will receive.

If you have any questions about these questions or you’d like a more thorough list, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
