The 2021 Best of Hawaii Viewers’ Choice Awards is here, and today we want to ask for your vote to make Hawaii Pacific Property Management the top property management company in the state. Voting lasts until January 31, and participants who submit 60% or more votes will be entered for a chance to win a trip for two to Las Vegas\!&nbsp;

**To cast your vote, start by following**[**this link.**](https://www.kitv.com/bestof#//) From there, click on the ‘Companies’ category, select ‘Property Management,’ and fill out the form. We thank you for your support, and we hope you have a great holiday season. If you have questions or there’s anything we can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help.
