I love Charleston, South Carolina, and as a Realtor, it’s my job to convince people to move here. However, there are three things that I absolutely could do without in Charleston, and they could be reasons why you wouldn’t want to move here:

**1\. Alligators.** They live in the ponds and are particularly active during their mating season. You don’t want to stand too close to the bank of a pond. However, they won't bother you if you don't bother them.

**2\. Bugs.** Mosquitoes and no-see-'ums can drive you crazy. They're not out all the time, and if you go to the beach where there's a nice breeze, you can avoid them.

**3\. Traffic.** During peak rush hour, getting from one side of the city to the other can take a lot longer than you think.

With all that said, I hope you move to Charleston because there are also a lot of great things about this city. If you have any questions, reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
