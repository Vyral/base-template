title: Are Real Estate Lenders Headed for Another Crash?

excerpt: >-
  Back in the mid-2000s, zero money down and zero closing cost loan products
  were all the rage. In fact, they were a contributing cause of the market crash
  we experienced around then. Now those products are back, and they’re targeted
  at those with bad borrowing history instead of the high-income, good credit
  borrowers. Could we be headed for another crash? To learn why you should be
  keeping an eye on this, watch my latest video.

The reason I pose this question is that Flagstar Mortgage **recently came out with a zero money down product and a zero closing cost loan product.&nbsp;**With these products, the borrower won’t have any skin in the game.

You might be thinking, “**Isn’t that what got us into trouble in the first place?** Didn’t we offer these loans in 2005, 2006, and 2007, which eventually crashed the marketplace?”

Yes, thank you very much! That’s what I was thinking, too.

You might also be thinking that they surely have safeguards in place, that they’re only offering these products to high-net-worth, high-income, good-credit borrowers who can really handle the risk.

Actually, it’s quite the opposite. **They’re advertising this loan to the poster-children of bad-credit borrowers.**

The only silver lining is that it is just limited to the Detroit metro area, where they’re using these loans to try to revitalize some neighborhoods there. That isn’t bad per se, but the bad news is that Fifth Third Bank in Cincinnati is also coming out with a similar product, which will roll out in several states.

We are a long way off from a crisis, and a lot can happen between now and then. However, if you start seeing a slowdown a few years from now, just **wait and see if these loan products expand and are used more and more heavily** to try to extend the earning cycle of these banks.
