What convinced me to keep striving towards success? It was a 'sink or swim' mindset. When you give yourself no other options, the only path forward is success. I didn’t let myself look for an excuse or a way out, because I knew as soon as I gave up, I would regret it. The secret is that there is no secret to success other than hard work, perseverance, and a positive mindset.&nbsp;
