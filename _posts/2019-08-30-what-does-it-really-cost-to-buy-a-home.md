The cost of buying a home isn’t limited to the price of the property, itself. Beyond that expense, you’ll also need to pay a number of fees to your lender, like appraisal fees, title fees, and mortgage insurance. These additional expenses, which are known as closing costs, typically range between $3,000 and $5,000 depending on your circumstances. To learn more about this topic, watch this short video. As always, if you have any other questions or would like additional information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
