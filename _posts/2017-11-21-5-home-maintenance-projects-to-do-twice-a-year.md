Today I’d like to talk about home maintenance projects that should be done biannually, or every six months.

I use the changing seasons as a gauge for when these items should be done—before winter and before summer.

**1. Have your HVAC system serviced.** Go ahead and have that coil cleaned, and do whatever else you need in order to get it in prime working order before the winter months, when you’ll need to be using it. It’ll save you money in the long run by extending the life of the system.

**2. Replace your air filters.** Some air filters need to be replaced every month, but some need to be changed every four to six months. Be sure to have those checked before the winter season has moved in.

**3. Check the perimeter of your home for any openings.** Sometimes caulk can shrink, in which case you’ll need to re-caulk it in order to keep critters and pests out.

**4. Change out the batteries in your smoke detectors.** While you’re doing that, I also recommend that you check the batteries in your flashlights and your emergency preparedness kits. You don’t want to be caught in a storm with dead batteries.

**5. Make sure your hose bibs are insulated and protected.** We don’t get too many hard freezes in our area, but one good freeze where a water pipe bursts and you’ll be crying. Make sure those are all wrapped up well for the winter.
