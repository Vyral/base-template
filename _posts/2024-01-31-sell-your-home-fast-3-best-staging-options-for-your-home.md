One of the things that you can do to make your home look its best to prospective buyers is staging. In this article, we’ll talk about staging and how it can improve your home when a buyer visits it.

When assessing a home for a showing, real estate agents, like me, consider the arrangement of the furniture in your home. There are times when we suggest bringing some furniture to your home to help it look according to what’s trendy and new at the moment. We also do this to ensure that the furniture is optimized to fit in your space.

A great example of this is using smaller pieces of furniture like a loveseat instead of a sofa or a sectional to make the room look bigger. Utilize the available space with furnishings to make it look like a model home.

For people who are wondering whether they should stage their homes. My fast answer to that is yes. Depending on your preference, you can choose from these three types of staging.

**1\. Professional.** Hire a stager to bring furniture and arrange it in your home.&nbsp;

**2\. DIY.** Make use of the things you currently have and arrange them in a way that maximizes the space.

**3\. Virtual.** Use software rendering to digitally put things in the home so people can visualize what your space may look like with furniture even though the house is vacant.

Why is staging important?&nbsp;**The purpose of staging is to create a great first impression of your home.** Buyers often decide to see your home in-person after looking at three to four pictures. Those pictures are critical to ensuring that your home has a fighting chance to sell.

Staging your home is not long-term. It usually stays staged for about 30 days or less. It gives you the best of both worlds, where the buyer can both see the staged pictures of your home and, at the same time, imagine their own things in your space when they visit your home and see it vacant.&nbsp;

While staging your home can be expensive, it will always make your home sell for more and faster. So, if you are selling your home, staging is definitely something that you should consider doing. This can make your home look its best. It doesn’t matter if you hire a professional stager or me as your advisor; either way, we will make it a point to keep your house appealing to prospective buyers.
