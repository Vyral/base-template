Today I am joined by Tim Weber, one of our preferred lenders, to talk about how he does business and what makes him different from other lenders in the industry.

As one of the hardest-working lenders I know, I find myself working with Tim a lot because he’s unique, ambitious, and thinks outside of the box. Recently he has stepped up and taken a lot of loans that couldn't get closed by other lenders and finished them.

Buyers who bring their own lenders to our listings tend to have deals that fall apart a lot. Tim then picks it up and closes those deals.

How does he do this? **Tim says that part of it is because of his 18 years of experience.** However, he also says that it’s a passion of his. He admits to staying up all night if needed to help finish a loan because he feels that he should treat his clients the way he would like to be treated.

Finally, he adds that he has flexible underwriting with a team that looks at things intuitively and puts things together as a whole package without getting too hung up on bureaucracy or federal guidelines. Of course he pays attention to the guidelines, but he also says that there are ways to misinterpret those.

A lot of buyers have moved over to Tim from other deals over the past 10 to 12 years and continue to come back. In fact, we randomly see him suggested as a lender online. **Tim has an incredible reputation in the community.**

To maintain this reputation, Tim says that it takes a lot of marketing and follow-up. He says that he wants each customer as a lifelong customer, so he treats transactions differently. They are not a single transaction, but instead someone he takes care of over time.

If you have any questions about mortgage loans, give us a call and we can connect you to Tim. Of course, if you have any other real estate needs, please feel free to contact us as well. We look forward to speaking with you soon.
