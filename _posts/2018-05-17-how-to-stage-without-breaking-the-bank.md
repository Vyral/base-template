Welcome to another episode of **“What’s Working Now!”**

This week I want to talk to you about staging…

Specifically, I want to talk about how to stage your home…

Without breaking the bank…

**So you can make more money when you sell…**

Last week I met with the owners of a new listing…

Who were concerned with the expenses of staging…

We discussed how staging their space…

**Could put an extra $40,000 to $50,000 in their pocket…**

I wanted to change the look of the place…

Make it less colorful & dated to more neutral & current…

**It’s the difference between having potential buyers…**

Being confronted with the impression of the need for…

Overwhelming remodeling and redecoration versus…

**Feeling comfortable that they can move right in…**

With simply paint, cleaning, new carpeting…

Some furnishings & dressing up the kitchen cabinets…

{% include pullquote.html %}

The quote from the contractor and stager was $8,700…

The owners did not feel the need to make the changes…

**Guess why?**

I found out…

It was more than their budget allowed…

Not, just something that they just didn’t want to do…

Once I knew the budget…

**We adjusted…**

Only painted one room and changed some materials…

And still achieved the look we needed…&nbsp;

To get an extra $40,000 to $50,000…

So, when you are talking with your agent…

**It is vital to be upfront & let them know your budget…**

Any questions?
