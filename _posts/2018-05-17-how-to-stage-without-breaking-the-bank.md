Welcome to another episode of “What’s Working Now!”

This week I want to talk to you about staging. Specifically, I want to talk about how to stage your home without breaking the bank, so you can make more money when you sell.

Last week I met with the owners of a new listing for a condo who were concerned with the expenses of staging. **We discussed how staging the space to look like a hotel room could result in $40,000 to $50,000 more.**

The quote from the contractor and stager came back as $8,700 to complete my changes. I wanted to change the look of the place to make it less colorful and old to more current. The difference between having potential buyers walking in to see work versus being able to live there right away was simply paint, cleaning, dressing up the kitchen cabinets, furniture and different carpeting.

After presenting the quote, the owners did not feel the need to do the changes. I found out that **the owners felt this way because it was out of their budget** instead of being something that they just didn’t want to do. So, when you are talking with an agent, it is important to be upfront and let them know that you have a budget.

To compromise and make it cheaper we painted one room and changed the materials. Once I knew what the budget was, I was able to make the place look almost like I had wanted to get the reaction I wanted. Now I am confident that we will get an extra $40,000 to $50,000.

If you have any questions about this or anything else real estate related, or if you would like to be invited to my next decluttering seminar please contact me. I would be happy to speak with you.
