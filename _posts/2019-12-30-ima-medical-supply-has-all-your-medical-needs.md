<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I was able to sit down with Richard Gobin and Robin Mueller and let them explain why IMA Medical Supply is a special local business.</em></p>

Today I’m delivering another local small business insight as part of the brand ambassador program here in Cumberland County.&nbsp;

**We’re highlighting IMA Medical Supply, which is a medical needs retail store in Carlisle, right next to the Carlisle Regional Medical Center.&nbsp;**

Richard Gobin—’Uncle Rick’ to me—is the founder of IMA Medical Supply. When explaining what’s at the core of IMA Medical, Richard said: “We serve people.That’s our main purpose. And to help them where they cannot find service elsewhere. It’s to make life better as we move on in age.”&nbsp;

IMA Medical fulfills this purpose by selling durable medical equipment like walkers and scooters to the Carlisle community.&nbsp;

**According to Robin Mueller, IMA Medical’s co-manager, walkers, wheelchairs, canes and even lift chairs rank among the items highest in consumer demand.** IMA Medical also has plenty of supplies for bathroom needs.&nbsp;

Looking forward to the future, Richard said that IMA Medical is excited about getting enrolled with all the insurances that are possible. He’s also eager to continue filling the community’s need for a brick-and-mortar medical supply store where they can find helpful products and outstanding service.&nbsp;

Tim Miller, IMA Medical’s other co-manager, has been in the business for a decade and a half. He specializes in repairs and assemblies for customers. “If it can be done, Tim will do it,” Richard said.&nbsp;

“We want to be a business where people can come in here and feel comfortable and know that they’re going to be treated with respect,” Robin said.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about how IMA Medical Supply can improve your quality of life, or if you have any real estate questions for me, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to connect you with Richard or Robin or help you with your real estate needs\!&nbsp;
