Today we’re going to be talking about what you can take with you when you sell your home. This is a big question; many people ask about it when we go on listing appointments. Thankfully, the answer is pretty simple:

**You can take any personal possession that is not fixed to the house.** If you have cabinets on each side of your fireplace, you can’t unbolt those and take them with you. However, you can take that freestanding, old-school dresser. Lawn ornaments, pictures, and any interior possessions are yours to bring along, but if something is fixed, leave it.

If you have any questions about this or other real estate topics, feel free to call or email us. We’d love to hear from you.
