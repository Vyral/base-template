If you’ve been watching the news, then you know inflation is on everyone’s minds. So how does inflation affect real estate? Let’s talk about it.&nbsp;

First things first—what is inflation anyway? **Inflation is when the cost of goods increases. Put simply, it costs more money to buy things, including gasoline, groceries, and even houses.** In the United States, we typically see 2% inflation year over year; however, over the last 12 months, we’ve seen inflation of over 6%. The Federal Reserve is concerned about this, but if you own real estate, inflation could actually work in your favor.&nbsp;

When you own a home you live in, and the value of your home increases, you build equity. **The same thing occurs if you own rental property.** During an inflationary period, you build equity at a faster rate since the price of homes increases. While none of us want inflation to happen, owning real estate is considered a strong hedge against it.&nbsp;

If you are looking to diversify your portfolio with real estate, give me a call or shoot me an email. I would love to talk about your options with you.
