<center><em>Here&rsquo;s a look at how we handle termite infestations in our properties.</em></center>

Termites are the most formidable adversary we have here in Hawaii. There are two types: ground termites and air termites. **When a house is tented for air termites, it’s usually a 24-to-30 hour process and you will typically get a five-year warranty.** Ground termite treatments are almost as expensive and involve setting bait around the house.

If you find evidence of termites in your house, we’ll need to get a termite inspection right away. If it’s determined you have active termites, we’re going to have to tent the house.&nbsp;

**There are so many things that can happen once we’re running termite treatments on your property.** We have to tent the house and get the tenants out first and foremost.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
