Termites are the most formidable adversary property owners have here in Hawaii. If you find evidence of termites in your house, get a termite inspection right away. You have active termites, we’re going to have to tent the house, which will involve you having to leave the property, unfortunately.&nbsp;

There are two types of termites to be aware of: ground termites and air termites.&nbsp;**When a house is tented for air termites, it’s usually a 24-to-30 hour process and you will typically get a five-year warranty.**&nbsp;Ground termite treatments are almost as expensive and treating the property involves setting bait around the house.

If you have any questions about termite inspections, how to spot an infestation in its early stages, or how you can protect your home from these pests in the first place, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
