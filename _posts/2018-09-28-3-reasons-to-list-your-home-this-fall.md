Today I want to give you three reasons you should list your home this fall instead of waiting until next spring.

**1. Less competition.** Since all of your neighbors are thinking that they will wait until the spring to list, doing so now will give you more leverage. You will also have a larger pool of buyers to choose from at this time of year.

**2. More motivated buyers.** Some buyers may have already sold their homes in the summer months and are now in need of a new home before the holidays begin. There are also many people in our area who are relocating and want their children to be acclimated to a new school system as early in the school year as possible. Motivated buyers like these can give you more leverage when negotiating the value of your home.

**3. Neighbors have decorated.** Your neighborhood will be warm and inviting, with decorations and the red leaves falling off of the trees helping the ambiance. Your neighborhood will make it feel like a home to potential buyers.

If you have any questions about this, or if you're looking to buy or sell, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
