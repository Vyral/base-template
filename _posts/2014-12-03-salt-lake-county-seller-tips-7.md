Today, we're going to address a problem we're seeing here on the Wasatch Front. Many empty nesters - couples whose kids have moved from the house and are looking to make a move - have been hesitant to sell their homes in the last 6 months. The reasoning behind this is they are waiting for the market to rebound so they can get top dollar for their home. However, many of these empty nesters don't realize that the market has changed and their property values have likely gone up.

If you're an empty nester who's ready to sell, now is a great time to start searching for a new home. There is a wide selection of inventory and homes are continuing to come onto the market. There are many homes to choose from to meet your downsizing needs.

Recently, many sellers we've worked with have made the mistake of spending the last year renovating their home. While improving your home is almost always a good idea, there are some projects that simply won't add any value to your home. If you want to know which improvements you can make to raise the final sales prices, give us a call. We'll assist you in determining which renovations will get your home sold.

Now is a great time to downgrade if you are an empty nester. If you would like some top-rate assistance with the process, give us a call or shoot us an email. We'd love to make your life a bit easier!
