<div style="text-align: center;">*<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Using a piggyback loan when buying a house can result in giving you a lower interest rate over the life of the loan.*<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">What makes piggyback loans beneficial to home buyers? Why would a recast be more advantageous for you? 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">**A piggyback loan is when you take out a single loan for 80% of the homes value and either 10% or 15% of the remainder to purchase the home.** Its usually either an 80/10 or 80/15/5 split. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Structuring the loan this way usually makes sense when youre very close to the $417,000 conforming loan limit. There are definitely better ways to structure this if possible, though. I say this because when you structure it with the first and second lien, the interest rate on that first lien is quite a bit higher than it would be otherwise. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">If the loan amounts cooperate, most of our clients actually structure this with a single loan, pay the private mortgage insurance, and then pay the loan down in either a lump sum payment as a result of the sale of another property, or with accelerated principal payments throughout the loan so that the mortgage insurance drops off. 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> 
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">At that point, they can then contact us to recast the loan so it acts as a retroactive down payment. What happens, then, is **you end up at the same place as if you structured the loan with the first and the second lien. **The difference is by structuring it with a single loan with mortgage insurance and throwing in a recast there, you end up with a lower interest rate over the life of the loan, which ends up saving you quite a bit of money. 

<div class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">Structuring your loan this way will give you a lower interest rate.
