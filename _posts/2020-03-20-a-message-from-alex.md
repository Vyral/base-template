My heart goes out to our families with children with schools shut down, our seniors in assisted living, our neighbors at the hospitals, our local businesses struggling and anyone impacted by this pandemic.

I’ve lived in Orange County my entire life.&nbsp; I’m fortunate to know people who may be able to help you out for a trip to the grocery store, watching children, or even getting bills paid.

You’ll be surprised how many good people are here in Orange County happy to help you.

Of course, I’ve been asked “How do I sell my home at this time?” I’ll continue to share what’s going on in the market and give you the information you need to make smart decisions.&nbsp;

Homes are still selling. Our Federal Reserve [just dropped their interest rate to near zero](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/business/economy/federal-reserve-coronavirus.html) to keep the money moving for people buying homes. It’s quite unprecedented. 90% of our buyers are staying in the transactions.&nbsp;

We are taking caution with our buyers, still, by bringing Purell to sanitize before and after showings, driving the neighborhood beforehand, and giving them access to floorplans to make sure it really is the right home for them. On our current listings, we want to make sure only the right people come into the home. We make sure all the descriptions that are available are provided to the buyers and pre-qualifying them.&nbsp;

I’m here to guide you and make fact-based, researched decisions if you need to sell your home (or buy one) since life must go on for those in situations who need to move.

That may be you or someone you know. I have your back. If there’s anything I can do to help you, call me at (949) 682-8880.

I’m here to help if you need *anything*. Let me know.
