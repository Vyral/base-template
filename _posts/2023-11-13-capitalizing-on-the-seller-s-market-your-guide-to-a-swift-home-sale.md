Are you contemplating whether or not to sell your house? It's crucial to grasp a key aspect of the current real estate landscape–there are more buyers in the market than there are available homes. While this may sound surprising, it's a reality driven by a remarkably low supply of homes for sale.

Let's delve into the numbers. The graph below illustrates the active listing counts of homes available for sale each September. The three blue bars represent the typical inventory in a normal market year. However, the solitary red bar for this September indicates that the current market is significantly below the usual supply levels.

In a market with such limited inventory, your house becomes a focal point. Buyers are eager for options, and your property might be exactly what they're searching for. With such scarcity, your house could attract attention, sell quickly, and even fetch multiple offers. **The market is practically pleading for homes like yours, making it an opportune time to sell.**
