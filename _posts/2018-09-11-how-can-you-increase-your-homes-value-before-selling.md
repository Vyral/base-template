Here at The Kohler Group, we are always striving to uphold your home’s value for when it comes time to sell. **There are four things that will help keep your home’s value up in today’s market:**

**1. Make sure the exterior presentation of your home is excellent.** Make sure that your garden beds are edged and are full of seasonal flowers. Trim your bushes as well. Make sure your front door and doorbell look good and are working properly. Buyers and buyer’s agents first impression of a home starts with the front door, so you want to get started on the right foot.

**2. Make sure the home has neutral colors.** This is especially important in the critical rooms such as the foyer, living room, dining room, kitchen, master bedroom, and master bathroom. Make sure windows are open throughout the home so buyers can see the natural light pouring through the windows.

**3. &nbsp;Remove any clutter.** I’m sure you’ve heard this many times before. Removing clutter is essential for buyers being able to see the money features of your home more easily. We want them looking at the flooring, cabinetry, countertops, appliances, and the other emotional grabs of the property. This is really what drives offers.

**4. Make sure the home is clean.** We’re all busy and it’s very challenging to keep a home clean. However, making that extra effort to make the home spotless will give the buyer a great impression of how the home has been cared for over the years. A home cannot be clean enough when it’s on the market.

One thing I’ve learned over the years is that it pays to hire professionals when getting your home ready. **We have vendors at our office that we’d be more than happy to get you in touch with.** These vendors include cleaning ladies, landscapers, painters, and more who know exactly how to make a home look its best. We’d love to share them with you so that you can enjoy your time spent with friends and family.

If you have any questions for us about getting your home ready for sale or about the real estate market in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
