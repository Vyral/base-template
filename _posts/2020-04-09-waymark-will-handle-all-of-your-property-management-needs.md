<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Waymark Property Management will take care of all of your property management needs.</em></p>

In our Brand Ambassador spotlight, we’re coming to you from our Carlisle office to meet with Cal Yoder, my good friend who oversees Waymark Property Management.&nbsp;

As you can see at the beginning of this video, he’s not just a friend—I’m now a client of his. I’ve turned over my entire portfolio of investment properties to him, and I couldn’t be more excited about it. **As a full-service property management company, they take the hassles and headaches out of owning real estate as an investment.** In Cal’s words, all you have to do is sit back and enjoy the money rolling into your bank account.&nbsp;

Cal bought his first rental property about 20 years ago and managed it himself. Since then, he was able to learn from his mistakes, and it allowed him to offer his services to others.&nbsp;

“I basically got into the business to help others take their headaches of owning real estate away,” he says.&nbsp;

As we know, there’s a vulnerable side to owning and operating a business, and property management is no different. If Cal had to pick one cause for concern that could potentially keep him awake at night, it’s ensuring his clients get their rate of return. Specifically, the biggest challenges in his business are delinquencies and filling vacancies quickly. These same challenges kept me awake at night, but I’m glad he’s taking care of them for me now.

Over the next three years, Cal is most excited about building his business, mainly through the relationships. He’s looking forward to meeting new people and providing them a great service.&nbsp;

**If you’re interested in buying an investment property, Waymark offers free consultations for investment analysis.** They can also give you a rundown of all the services they provide. For some investors, it only makes sense to shift the management of their property over to them. They can shorten vacancies, net-zero their fee if rents are low, etc.&nbsp;

So whether you’re just getting into the investment game or you need someone to take over all of your property management needs, you can trust Cal Yoder and Waymark Property Management to help you. Just give them a call at (717) 412-0744.

As always, if you have questions for me or have a local business in mind you’d like to see on a future Brand Ambassador video, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.
