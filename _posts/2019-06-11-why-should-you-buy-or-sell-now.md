We want to thank the sellers of the home at 39W165 Longmeadow Lane in St. Charles for allowing us to do this video at their home and we welcome you to schedule a showing as the property is on the market.

What makes right now such a great time to buy or sell? There are actually a few reasons, and we’ll share just a handful of the most significant factors today.&nbsp;

For one thing, there are 2% fewer homes on the market in our area right now than there were at this time last year. Also, home values have risen by 3% on average. This means those who list now can enjoy lower competition and higher prices.

As for buyers, one of the greatest advantages in today’s market is our incredibly low interest rates. It’s also good to know that, because home values are rising, buying a home now means you’ll be able to build equity faster after you close.&nbsp;

As a final note, **we’d like to invite anyone looking to buy a home out to join us for a private showing and some lemonade by the pool at (ADDRESS).** And, of course, we’d like to thank the sellers of this great property for allowing us to film on location at their listing.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
