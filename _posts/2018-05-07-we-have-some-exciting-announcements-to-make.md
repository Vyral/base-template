We have a couple exciting announcements from our team to make as our spring market moves along.&nbsp;

First, we want to thank you if you joined us at the Malibu Cafe for our Earth Day event last April. We had such a blast meeting all of the clients who joined us, and with that in mind, we want to remind you to mark your calendars for our next upcoming event—**our Summer BBQ Bash on July 28 from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m..** We plan on having lots of fun, and you’re officially invited.

We'll release more information about the event in coming weeks, so be on the lookout for updates.

In addition to this announcement, we’d like to introduce you to the newest member of our team, Ruth Cavanah. **Ruth will be our showing agent while Heather is away on maternity leave,** and her addition is great news for both us and our clients. Ruth will be out every day previewing and showing properties for us, which will enable us to see homes the minute they hit the market and meet with you so you can get the first look at them.&nbsp;

We’re excited to have Ruth on board. You can reach her by calling 805-990-8900 or emailing ruth@radkeagency.com.

As always, if you have any questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you.<br>&nbsp;
