With more homes on the market and buyers who are pickier than ever, preparing your home for sale has become incredibly important.&nbsp;

**One way to prepare your home is to make it feel larger**, which you can easily do by removing the rugs from your hardwood floors. However, you may find that the floors have been bleached by the sun—how do you fix this?

**Here are three simple steps to clean and refresh your floors and remove the sun-bleached color:**

**1. Get a mop with exchangeable covers and cleaning solution**. We purchased the $13 mop and the $6 covers at Home Depot. The Bona Professional hardwood floor cleaner was $18 for a 32-ounce spray bottle and the Bona Professional hardwood floor refresher was also $18 for a 32-ounce bottle—these were bought online from Amazon.

<br>**2. Sweep the area and treat it.** You want to remove the floor of any dirt or particles that would affect the refresher when it dries. Using the cleaner product, spray a small amount on the floor and use the mop to spread it evenly, following the grain of the wood. Follow the instructions, work backward toward the exit, and allow the product to dry completely.&nbsp;

<br>**3. Exchange the mop cover and use the refresher.** After the floor has dried, place the new cover on the mop and lightly dampen it with water. Then, apply the refresher to the mop or directly on the floor in a small area. Use the mop and its new cover to spread the refresher evenly across the floor, again working with the grain and backward toward the exit. Remember to follow the bottle’s instructions. Wait one hour before you walk on it and two hours before applying a second coat, if required.

The cost was only $50, it took less than two hours to complete two coats, and the remaining products are enough to tackle more rooms in the future. By forgoing a professional service, we saved $350.&nbsp;
