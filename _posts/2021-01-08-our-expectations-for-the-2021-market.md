<br>What can we expect from our 2021 market? Like most real estate professionals in the market, we wish we had a solid answer to that question. However, we can say with some certainty that interest rates won’t be going up in the first quarter of the year. Ultimately, we don’t expect a ton of change at the beginning of the year.

We’re still consistently bringing in buyers for our area, specifically the South Bay, East Bay, and San Francisco areas. However, **we also still have a shortage of inventory**, which means that if you're a homeowner on the fence about selling, you should reach out to us so we can discuss your situation and why it would be beneficial for you to enter the market. We can customize a program just for you so that you know all the options that are available to you.

Don’t hesitate to reach out to us\! We’d love to help you move on to the next stage of your life.
