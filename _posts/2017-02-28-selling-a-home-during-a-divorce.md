Going through a divorce and selling a home are probably two of the most trying and stressful events anyone can go through. **When you have to do them both at the same time, it can be overwhelming.** We’re here to help make the process easier by taking you through the different options you have.

<br>Your home is one of your largest assets, so how you handle it will be vitally important as you move forward in your divorce. **The first thing you need to decide is what you want to do with the house.**We usually see people take one of three routes.

<br>The first is to have one spouse buy out the other’s stake in the house. A lot of times, that’s not an option. Another option is to have one spouse live in the home with the children until the youngest child is 18 and then sell the house after and divide the proceeds.

<br>The third option is to simply sell the house. **Unless you don’t have any equity in the home, this is probably the best option because of the tax benefits you receive.** It’s important that you know with this option, you are going to want to sell your house before the divorce is finalized. Here’s why.

<br>In California, married couples are entitled to a $500,000 capital gains exclusion. **That means you can receive up to $500,000 of tax-free profit on your home sale.** If you are single and selling, that exclusion only amounts to $250,000. That’s a huge swing.

<br>Once you have decided to sell, here are five tips that will help make things easier throughout the process:

<br>**1. Proper preparation.**We want to make sure that when you do sell, you don’t broadcast it to all of your coworkers or neighbors. The reason we say this is because when buyers find out that a home is being sold during a divorce, they start to view it as more of a distressed sale than anything else. This will lead to them sending lowball offers and trying to get the home as cheap as possible.<br>**2. Carefully select your agent.** A family member or friend isn’t always the best idea. You want a neutral third party.<br>**3. Formulate a great communication plan.** When emotions and tensions are high, communication becomes extra important. Work with your Realtor on a communication plan up front so each spouse feels included and respected throughout the entire process.<br>**4. How are you going to handle showings?** We recommend putting a calendar together with your agent so you can maximize the number of showings.<br>**5. Make sure you have a written agreement on who gets what inside the home.**<br>If you have any questions for us or if you or someone you know is currently going through a situation like this, give us a call or send us an email.
