How's the market doing? We're in early 2016 right now, and I've got three things for you to think about if you've been on the fence about buying or selling a home.

For starters, inventory is incredibly low. If you've got a house to sell, now is the time to giddy up! There are buyers out there who don't have a lot of choices. If you're thinking of selling, now is your chance to be a big fish in a little pond.

Next, interest rates are still low. The Fed did raise short term interest rates by .25% at the end of 2015, but so far that has not affected long term mortgage rates. If you're looking to sell your property and buy another, you have a golden opportunity to lock in a low interest rate.

Finally, buyers are still buying right now! They are taking advantage of those low interest rates, and they don't have a lot of choices. Our spring market has gotten into gear much earlier than we imagined it would this year.

So if you're thinking of buying or selling a home, get rolling. The market doesn't get any better than this!

If you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
