I’ve been getting a lot of questions lately from all of you, many of which are about how to get organized when it’s time to move. Here are my top five tips for getting organized before and during your move:

**1. Sort piles of belongings into groups.** These groups should include: things you want to keep, things you may want to keep, things you want to give away, and things you want to throw away. If you don’t have any use for the items in your “maybe” pile after a year, get rid of them.

**2. Give yourself plenty of time.** Getting organized is a process. It takes time. When it comes to sorting through personal items and memorabilia, give yourself a little extra time for the inevitable reminiscing that will occur.&nbsp;

**3. Store items in clear, plastic bins.** This will allow you to have a quick, clear view of what’s inside. If you use cardboard or colored bins, be sure to clearly label what’s inside.

**4. Get rid of the paper.** A big problem I’ve found when moving is the paper trail that’s left behind. Whether it’s old receipts, newspapers, magazines, or flyers, it can create a lot of clutter. Go through your stuff and shred or recycle any documents you don’t need.

**5. Do it now.** This is the most valuable tip. As soon as you’re finished reading this, I advise you to put some time in your calendar over the next week or month to get organized. It will give you a nice head start when the time comes to sell.

If you have any questions for me about how you can have an easier, less-stressful move, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
