As a real estate agent, how important is the car that you drive? **More important than you’d think.** Let me share with you a couple of stories.

Before I was a real estate **agent**, I was a real estate **client**. One time, I called two different agents to come and visit with me about purchasing a new home. The first agent arrived, and I peered through the curtains to see an old, two-tone, beat up car. I immediately made a snap decision that I did not want to do business with him. Was it fair? **Probably not, but most clients will judge you by the condition of your vehicle.**

Around 2008, most of the country had a real estate meltdown. A close friend went to visit with one of his clients about selling his home. This client had purchased while values were high, but values had now declined, meaning a big loss when selling his home. They signed the agreement and the client followed my friend outside. The client saw the late-model, luxury vehicle my friend had arrived in and promptly ripped the agreement into pieces. He said, “**I am not going to be going through so much pain and financial loss so you can drive a car like that.**”

Every aspect of a real estate professional’s career needs to be viewed through the lens of the client. How will they perceive what you drive? It’s important to look for the sweet spot—**drive a professional and clean car, but don’t choose the most expensive car you can afford.** You can still drive your fancy cars, but save it for when you aren’t working with buyers and sellers. When with your clients, you don’t want to offend on the low end **or** the high end.

Your car matters, as do so many other details in a Realtor’s life. I help agents identify and fix those details, and I’d be more than happy to help you do the same. If you’d like a one-on-one business consultation to see what you can do, reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.
