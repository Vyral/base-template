  How does the home buying process actually work? It depends on your unique
  situation, but for first-time buyers it’s pretty standard. The first thing you
  need to do is talk to an agent who can help you get pre-approved by a trusted
  lender. If you need to buy and sell a home at the same time, the process is a
  bit more of a puzzle. To learn more about the home buying process, watch this
  short video.

Today we want to take a quick look at the home buying process.

If you’re a first-time homebuyer, the first thing you need to do is have a conversation with us. **We’ll talk about your wants and needs, the areas you’re looking at, and how we can get you into contact with a loan officer so that you can get pre-approved right off the bat.** This will answer a lot of initial questions.

**If you’re a homeowner who is going to be buying and selling a home at the same time, we have a bit of a different puzzle.** First, we’ve got to evaluate the equity in your current home. You may be able to qualify for a pre-approval before selling your current home. You might have to sell first in order to make an offer, however. That’s the puzzle we have to piece together.

There are a lot of moving pieces, but we can help you work them out. If you have any questions for us or if we can help you buy or sell a home in any way, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
