I broke one of my cardinal rules over the weekend. Here’s where I messed up.

Here’s a rule that I broke last week: Never do a listing presentation without all decision-makers in attendance.

Last week, I was called in by one of my agents to help assist her with a listing appointment. The husband and wife were interviewing nine different agents. **As they were showing us the house, the wife had to take a call. We got into the listing presentation, but I asked the husband if he wanted to wait for his wife.**

He said to go ahead and start without her. Right at that point, I wanted to reschedule, but he said that they really wanted to make a decision that weekend. We went ahead and did it and at the end of the presentation, he said they would talk about it over the weekend and get back to me.

**We got a call back over the weekend saying they decided to go with someone else.** When we asked what the determining factor was, he said it was the commission. He went with an agent who had a lower commission so they could get every penny they could out of their home.

You never want to present to just one decision maker. Whoever is going to assist in the final decision needs to be present. Every time I break this rule, there’s a much higher chance I don’t get a listing.

If you have any questions for me about your career or the real estate business in general, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.
