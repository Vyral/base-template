What’s the latest in our San Diego market? The most recent numbers tell us that we’re shifting from a seller’s market to a buyer’s market. **However, there’s a rising concern about home affordability.**

The median price for homes is around $568,000, a 6% increase from 2017. The market is still moving, but certain price points are looking better than others.

Homes between $380,000 to $800,000 are still selling normally, but homes over $1 million are taking a bit longer to sell. **Since interest rates did not increase as much as we anticipated, home prices haven’t dropped.** We most likely won’t see homes appreciate at the same rate we saw last year, but it’s still a strong, balanced market.
