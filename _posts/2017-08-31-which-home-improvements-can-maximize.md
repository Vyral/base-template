Here are a few repairs you can make to your home that will maximize your dollar return when it comes time to sell.

What improvements can you make to your home to increase its value when the time comes to sell it?

**Countertops and bathroom fixtures are at the top of the list.** If yours are dated or old, replace them. They’ll really pop if they’re brand new, and you can still enjoy them for a year or two if you don’t plan on selling right now.

Another aspect you should focus on is **flooring.** Hold off on replacing any carpet until right before you list your house. You can install vinyl or wood flooring any time and it will increase your home’s value. It will not age quickly, so doing it ahead of time makes you ready once your house hits the market.

These improvements will both increase your dollar return and help market your home online. If you have any other questions about making home improvements or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home right now, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
