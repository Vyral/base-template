A lot of people have been asking me lately if the market is shifting, and today I’ll be answering that question.

**Last week, a buyer wanted to purchase a one-bedroom condo**. She, too, was concerned about a market shift, and she ended up missing the opportunity to buy because she convinced herself that everything was crashing.

A few days later, a slightly better condo came onto the market. Again, she said she wanted to wait, and this condo sold almost immediately.

**If you’re worried about a shift, I’m definitely not seeing one in our market right now.** If you want to buy, though, you have to be ready and willing to pay top dollar. If you’re not, the market will pass you by and you’ll be stuck waiting for the shift. Really, the choice is up to you.

If you’d like help navigating our current market or figuring out what to do, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
