When fall rolls around, a lot of people decide it's time to take their home off the market if it hasn't sold, and wait until spring. Although this is the conventional way of thinking in the real estate business, it doesn't mean that it's absolute or definitive.

We are here today to tell you that the real estate business just doesn't stop. In fact, there are a lot of advantages to keeping your home on the market during the latter part of the year. Here are 3 of them:

1. Less competition
 There will be a lot of homes that come off the market in the next few weeks as it gets colder. In the fall selling season, there is a reduced amount of inventory, resulting in less competition

2. More effective showings
 In the fall and winter, showings are extremely efficient. People won't just be walking through a house during the cold winter season with snow on the ground if they aren't serious buyers.

3. You get a better price
 Every year, without fail, we get offers in November and December, typically from people who sold their home and are needing to buy now. As a result of low inventory, they will pay good money for a good home that they like, most often near asking price.
