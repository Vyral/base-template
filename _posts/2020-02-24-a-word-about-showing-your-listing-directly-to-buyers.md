Here’s a situation that we all run into from time to time. You have a listing, it’s the weekend, and your schedule is all booked up. A buyer calls and wants to see it. You ask them if they have an agent, and they say yes. What do you do?

I get frustrated when this happens. **It’s not that I don’t want to show listings, but it’s the fact that we’re sort of expected to jump when a buyer calls to see a house.** I think as a community we need to work better to set some parameters around that.

For buyers that have an agent who's out of town, for example, I’ll continue to say that I can show them the listing, but then I’ll also inform them that I want to make sure their agent is aware that, if I show the listing, then I’ll get the commission on it. This usually stops them in their tracks. Then I explain the procurement of cause and how they can still be represented by their agent, but that agent won't get the commission from the sale.

**If the buyer has an agent, I will reach out every time.** I reached out to one recently who had no idea what his client was doing, but he ended up confirming it. Of course, they ended up not being real buyers. They weren't able to buy until October.&nbsp;

The other way I protect myself is when someone says they have no agent, I push them pretty hard about it. I ask them why they’re looking without an agent and whether they’ve looked at a home with an agent in the past. I make sure they understand that if I show them the house I will get the commission.

**Even though it can be frustrating to deal with, it’s important that you confirm and procure cause every time that a buyer wants to see your listing.** A lot of these agents that buyers work with are friends or family members who are in this business part-time.

If you have any questions about what you should do in a situation like this, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
