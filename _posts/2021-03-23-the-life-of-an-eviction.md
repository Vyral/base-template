<center><em>Here are the basics about how eviction works in property management.</em></center>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

An eviction has a very long life. **Most evictions occur when something unforeseen happens to the tenant**\: someone may lose a job, change their mind, a relationship breaks up, etc. Usually, the property manager will know about it because we do inspections, talk to tenants a lot, and collect rent. The minute rent doesn’t come in on time, we contact the tenant and ask what’s going on, how they’re doing, and why the rent is late.&nbsp;

The life of eviction begins when a tenant stops paying rent. We tell them what their choices are, and sometimes we let them out of the lease, sometimes we don’t. **Issues arise when the tenant stops communicating with you.** Remember that you have to give a five-day notice of the writ of eviction so they know you plan on carrying out eviction proceedings.&nbsp;

Then we have to try to get them into court. I’ve had to go to court a few times for evictions. Once they show up in court, frequently the first question the judge will ask them is whether they owe the money, and usually, they’ll say yes but have an explanation. Next, the judge will ask what we want to do and when we want them out of the property.&nbsp;

Up until now, all that has been the easy part. However, **once the court rules that the tenant has to be out of the property by a certain time, we have to enforce it.** All this is why property owners need to hire a property manager.&nbsp;

Here at HI Pacific, we have an eviction guarantee, and we’re the only ones who do it. If you want to know details about our guarantee or have any questions about the eviction process, give us a call or send an email. Aloha\!
