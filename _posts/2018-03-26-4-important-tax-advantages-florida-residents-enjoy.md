The new tax laws have changed the way you’ll handle your local and state deductions, so it’s more important than ever to pay attention to what your state taxes are.

**Florida has the second-lowest taxes per capita of any state in the nation, and there are four other particular tax advantages you should know about:**

* There is no state income tax. There are five other states where residents aren’t required to pay income taxes: Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming.
* There is no social security tax.
* There is no inheritance or estate tax.
* Our state’s Save Your Home law protects homeowners by capping property tax rate increases.

If you live in the Northeast, you probably already know that Connecticut tops everyone’s list as the state with the worst taxes. Vermont, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island are five other states that are always in the mix for that top spot as well.

If you live in another state, always take a hard look at your tax situation during tax season. Remember, we have great weather, a great quality of life, and low taxes in Florida, so that’s something to consider if you’re thinking of making your move down here.
