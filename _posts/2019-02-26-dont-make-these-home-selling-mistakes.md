In today’s short video, I’m going to share three common mistakes that I continue to see home sellers make. If you or someone you know is thinking about selling their home soon, paying attention here will help you have a more successful sale:

**1. Over-improvement.** Oftentimes, I’ll meet with a home seller who has made a lot of nice repairs, but they’re in an area where those improvements aren’t quite as important. This makes it very difficult for you to get the money you put into your home out of it when you sell it. If you’re a move-up buyer, tread lightly because over-improvement could really leave you strapped for cash.

**2. Solar power.** However, if you're thinking of adding solar power to your home in order to boost its value, don’t do that. The reason why boils down to economics. If you invest money into a solar system for your home, you’re not going to get any money out of it unless you live there long-term, especially if you end up leasing your system.

**3. Too much stuff.** Start getting rid of things now if you’re planning on selling. Don’t go out and start accumulating more, either. It makes it difficult to see the floor plan. It’s a very common mistake and will just cause more worry for you. When the time comes to put your home on the market, it’s going to sell quicker and for more money.

These are just three things you can to do have a successful sale. **If I had to add a fourth, it would probably be hiring an experienced real estate professional like myself.** If you have any other questions for me about selling a home or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
