People always ask me, “How’s the market doing?”

Today, I want to bring some insight to this question by going over a few year over year market statistics.

The median sale price for single-family homes has increased by 4.1% in 2017. &nbsp;The median sale price for condos over that same period increased by 6.5%.

In terms of inventory, the supply of single-family homes has decreased by .5% since 2017. Inventory for condos went down by over 20%.&nbsp;

However, location does matter. The numbers I just gave you reflect the Horry County and Georgetown County markets combined. **You can expect an email from me in the near future breaking down the market statistics for all local areas.&nbsp;**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
