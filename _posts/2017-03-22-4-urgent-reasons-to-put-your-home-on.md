There are four reasons why now is the perfect time to jump off the fence and put your home on the market.

If youâ€™ve been thinking about selling your home, now is the time to get off of the fence. There are four reasons why:

**1. Mortgage interest rates are rising.** Interest rates have been historically low, so we all knew that this was coming. The Fed raised their rates by a quarter of a point, which will affect the mortgage rates. In fact, the Fed is expected to raise rates several more times this year, which will affect the number of buyers who can afford to purchase your home.

**2. Inventory is extremely low.** Inventory is shrinking, which means you will have less competition and your home will be more valuable.

**3. Home prices are rising.** Buyer demand is incredibly high right now. That combined with low inventory and rising interest rates means that home prices are going up.

**4. Consumer confidence is on the rise.** Thanks to an improving job market and economy, buyers are more confident about purchasing homes.

So, if you are ready to jump off the fence, now is the time. If you have any other questions about our current market or the home selling process, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
