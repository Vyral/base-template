Something magical happens the first day you list your home for sale. Like the new kid at the high school dance, all eyes are on your listing.

At that moment, buyers and agents will make some rapid judgments. Is the home overpriced? Is it in good condition based on its photos? Is it in a good and desirable location?

**The first impression of your home will shape how many showings it gets the first few weeks it’s listed.** If you have little or no showings the first few weeks after the home has hit the market, you have a problem. This means the market as a whole is rejecting your value proposition, and there’s only one solution. You must drop the price—the faster, the better.

Why not give it more than just a few short weeks?

Think of the real estate market as an audience in a movie theater. As soon as your home hits the big screen, the group decides collectively whether they like the picture or not. More often than not, more time won’t change their minds. If your home is seeing little or no activity, it’s been decided that your home has received a “thumbs down.” The only thing you can hope for is that some new audience members trickle into the theater and—against all odds—nominate your home for an Oscar.

**A better bet would be to reprice your home and re-submit it to the Academy.**
