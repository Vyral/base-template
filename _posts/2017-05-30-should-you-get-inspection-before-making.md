Getting a home inspection offers many benefits if you’re thinking of buying an as-is property and making renovations to it.

If you’re thinking about buying an as-is property and making some renovations, do you need an inspection?

Absolutely. We always suggest getting a home inspection, especially if you plan on doing a renovation. **It gives you a starting point of things you need to fix.** Otherwise you might ask your contractor to make certain fixes without even knowing about other fixes that could be huge issues if left unresolved.

Getting a home inspection also means you can give it to your contractor and include both your ‘have-to’ fixes and your ‘want-to’ fixes’ so when you get a bid, you get a complete bid.

If you have any more questions about renovations, home improvements, contractors, or anything else of that nature, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help.
