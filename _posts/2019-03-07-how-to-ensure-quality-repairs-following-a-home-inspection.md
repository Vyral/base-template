Imagine this: You’ve found the perfect home, submitted an offer, and gone under contract. You think everything is going smoothly, but then you get the results of the inspection report. It’s normal for this report to turn up issues, but the severity of these issues can vary vastly. However, it’s the way these problems are addressed that truly matters.

In general, **a buyer will be more likely to ensure quality repairs are done than a seller, who will usually have their focus elsewhere.** Even the most well-intentioned sellers may be tempted to fall back on a quick fix rather than a long-lasting solution. Most sellers simply don’t have the time to focus on repairs given everything else they’ve got to handle during their home sale.

If the seller does choose to take care of repairs, though, they should always hire a third-party contractor. This person has no stake in the transaction. Their sole focus is taking care of the issue at hand. Alternatively, **a buyer may opt to ask for a credit from the seller.** This allows buyers to get repairs finished in their own time and on their own terms.

All in all, problems listed on an inspection report should not cause too much alarm unless they’re truly extreme. There are a number of ways to resolve these issues and keep the deal moving forward.
