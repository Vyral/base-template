<p style="text-align: center;"><em>One of the Dave Hooke Team’s great members, Drue Richmond, recently sat down to share a few thoughts on her experience with us. Now, we’d like to share her insight with all of you.</em></p>

Recently, I sat down with our team’s sales director Drue Richmond for a great interview on what she does here and why she loves being a part of our team.&nbsp;

Before we got to that, though, I asked her to share just a little bit of information on what her life was like before joining the Dave Hooke Team.&nbsp;

In a word, Drue called her former career path “unfulfilling.” And, since she was selling home theater parts for a meager $28,000 a year, I can’t say I blame her. Thankfully, she wasn’t stuck in that rut for long before she came on as the very first member of the Dave Hooke Team (other than myself, of course). Drue first started out with us as a buyer’s agent, and it wasn’t long before she began to thrive in this new role. **It quickly became clear that real estate was a perfect fit for her.&nbsp;**

Fast forward to just a few years later and Drue moved on to working as a lead listing agent—another major leap in her career. She helped approximately 70 families with their home sales within her first year as a listing agent and, last year alone, more than doubled that number. That’s right—Drue helped 150 families sell their home in 2018.

Having demonstrated such a strong work ethic and such incredible talent, it’s no wonder that, recently, Drue transitioned into a new role yet again and is now serving in a leadership position as our team’s sales director.&nbsp;

Drue has found this position to be incredibly rewarding, so far. She even got to see one of our top-performing employees double his income thanks in part to her guidance. This potential for growth is just one of the many things that makes the Dave Hooke Team such an incredible place to work.&nbsp;

**“Whenever \[I’m\] going through a hard transaction \[or\] a hard day, I really love that a whole team is around \[me\], supporting \[me\], through that process,” says Drue.&nbsp;**

And now, thanks to our continued expansion, you can enjoy that same support. We’re currently looking to hire new team members for a variety of positions, including a few leadership positions, and **we would love to speak with you if you’re interested in coming aboard.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me or my team a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
