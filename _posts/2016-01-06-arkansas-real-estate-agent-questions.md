Choosing to buy a home is an important decision, and one you shouldn’t make without doing proper research. Today, we’ve got some tips for you on the types of questions you should be asking the homeowner or your Realtor about a potential home purchase. Proper preparation is the key to getting what you want in a home. Here’s where you should narrow your focus:


The Neighborhood

The location of your home is very important. How close are you to different stores, gas stations, or other amenities? Would you rather be in a bustling area or a quieter part of town? Is there any new construction going on in your neighborhood? If so, how will this affect your home’s value? These are all different questions you should be asking when determining where you want to live.

Schools

Another equally important topic to learn about is your potential home’s proximity to different schools. Find out what district your home is in. Even if you don’t have any kids, being in a good school district increases your home’s value when it comes time to sell.


The Little things

There are a ton of different, little things you need to check up on when researching potential homes. Ask about the little things like electric and utility bills, the age of the roof, hot water heater, and other appliances. If you have a lot of maintenance to do on a home, that will impact the kind of offer you make on it.

These are just a few of the questions you should be asking when researching homes. If you have any questions for us, or want to learn some more of the questions you should be asking when looking for a home, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to help!
