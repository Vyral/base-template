Now that fall is upon us, I’d like to take a look back at how our Central Vancouver real estate market fared over the month of September.

To start off, the detached housing market had a 14% sales-to-active ratio. This is about 1% less than last month.

The reason this market hasn’t seen any increase in prices or activity is because total listing inventory has increased 36% since August. **These factors are a strong indicator that we’re in a buyer’s market.**

Let’s turn our attention to the condominium market. In that market, there was a 59% sales-to-active ratio. This is about 11% less than last month.

The condo market is still red hot. Inventory is low, about 29% less than last year, and there are a lot of multiple offer situations taking place.

With all of this being said, I’m starting to notice my clients looking to sell their condos and buy detached homes instead.

**Condo prices can only rise so much and the detached housing market is experiencing a temporary slowdown,** so this is a great strategy.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
